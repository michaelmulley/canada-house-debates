<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed from April 15 consideration of the motion that Bill C-43, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on February 23, 2005, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p><A NAME="Int-1247232"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247265"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Joy Smith (Kildonan—St. Paul, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is important this morning to put some comments on the record regarding this very important bill. This is a bill that has some very big difficulties. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an important bill that should have been passed in the House of Commons this session. Unfortunately, there are things within the context of the bill itself that are very worrisome and which impact in a very negative way on Canadians, particularly Canadians on the east coast with the Atlantic accord and the Kyoto accord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a manoeuvre that appears to disclose a hidden Liberal agenda, Bill C-43 arrogantly disregards the best interests of Canadians. What should have been a straightforward implementation of the budget is in fact an attempt to pass legislation that deserves open discussion in Parliament and specific individual attention, namely Kyoto and the Atlantic accord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals knew that the majority of the House would not approve their Kyoto measures if they were presented in stand-alone legislation, so they attached it to Bill C-43. This move has, at the very least, delayed legitimate budget measures from implementation and may even put their implementation at risk. Canadians deserve better than this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it that some of the measures in this bill are not reflective of how they were presented in the budget document? For example, the Department of Finance website assures Canadians that the Liberal government will “deliver on commitments made in the 2005 budget”. The budget stated that the amount of the share of the gas tax would rise to $2 billion annually or 5¢ per litre by 2009-10. While part 11 of Bill C-43 allows the transfer of 1.5¢ per litre of the gas tax to the provinces, territories and first nations for sustainable infrastructure projects, the Liberals have reneged on the remainder of their commitment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent survey conducted by the Manitoba chapter of the Canadian Automobile Association, respondents nearly unanimously agreed that Canada's roads and highways are a part of health and safety. They are a health and safety issue. The same group unanimously agreed that the federal government must reinvest more of the gasoline excise taxes collected in roadway development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days of neglect must be reversed. Further delay is not an option. Prior to the last election there were grandiose announcements about how this issue would be addressed, yet this issue has not been addressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the glaring need for immediate action, how is it that the Liberal government only authorized gas tax transfers until 2005-06? Instead of fulfilling its 2004 election campaign promise and providing critical infrastructure assistance, the gas tax transfer has simply become another example of an election promise gone unfulfilled again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing what we say we will do means planning how to fulfill a promise. That is again planning how to fulfill a promise, not planning on how to make excuses. Canadians deserve better. The Liberal government once again violated the trust and confidence of the Canadian people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior adults in nursing homes deserve our respect and care. In my riding of Kildonan--St. Paul, as in the rest of Canada, low income seniors do not have time to wait for years to see increases to the guaranteed income supplement. Senior adults have invested in our communities for most of their lives, making them better places in which to live. They deserve to have their basic needs met with dignity and compassion.</p><A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1000"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Bill C-43 stands, our senior adults in subsidized nursing homes may never see the guaranteed income supplement at all. Ironically, the nursing home operator or the province could become the recipient. Why are safeguards not put in place, ensuring provincial programs will not claw back part of the GIS increases? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low income seniors in my riding frequently tell me they are struggling to put enough food on their tables. The GIS increases do not go far enough or occur fast enough to provide a substantial benefit to the low income senior adults of Canada. Senior Canadians deserve better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative Party will continue to hold the Liberals to account for wasteful spending. Over a decade of Liberal waste, mismanagement and scandal has clearly revealed that billions of dollars sent to Ottawa would have been better managed if they had been left in the pockets of Canadians. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our low income seniors could have had the means to live their sunset years with dignity and respect. With more gas tax revenue, our towns and cities could have had the resources to maintain roads and highways. The way Bill C-43 was put together was a very crafty way of doing it, so Kyoto would be passed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must speak to the Atlantic accord briefly because it is a very important aspect that needs to be pushed through to help the people on the east coast. The Liberals are holding the people of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia hostage by linking the Atlantic accord provisions, which most members in the House of Commons support, with Kyoto measures, with which many in the House of Commons have voiced concerns. The Atlantic accord provisions in Bill C-43 could be passed in one day if the Liberals would table stand-alone legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is critical that this game playing with the futures of Canadians be stopped. The fact that the Kyoto measures have been put in are a great concern. The Liberals knew the majority of the House would not approve their Kyoto measures if they were presented in stand-alone legislation. That is why they attached them to Bill C-43. This move has, at the very least, delayed legitimate budget measures from implementation and may have even put their implementation at risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are things in traditional budget bill measures that are very important and there are things that need to be put through, but when other aspects of a bill are linked together that cause grave concern, then obviously a responsible government would ensure that these are taken out and put in a stand-alone position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative Party does not play games with the well-being of Canadians. It is high time the Liberals stopped playing politics and followed the lead of the Conservative Party by acting in the best interests of Canadians. All Canadians deserve better. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having seen the events that have happened in the House since the beginning of the session, it is high time that serious consideration be given to taking a closer look at legislation that would be better for Canadians and not manoeuvring legislation, so that pet projects get to be put through, regardless of what Canadians think.</p><A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1247265"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247269"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247232"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Merv Tweed (Brandon—Souris, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talked about the Atlantic accord in her opening comments. In my constituency, we sent out a survey asking people for their thoughts in regard to the Atlantic accord and whether the people of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia were being used as pawns in the game. At that time the survey response was overwhelming. I was not only surprised but very impressed at the grasp and understanding that people in western Canada had of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the member to comment on some of the comments she has heard in her constituency and also the relevance of the game playing that appears to be going on by including the Atlantic accord in the budget as opposed to a stand-alone bill.</p><A NAME="Int-1247269"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247281"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247265"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Joy Smith: </b>Mr. Speaker, my riding is in the centre of Canada and my party is concerned about our whole nation. When things happen on the west coast, on the east coast, in Quebec or anyplace in Canada, we as a party are very concerned about the well-being of the people of Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to that question, let me say that the Atlantic accord is extremely important. As I said in my speech earlier, that accord could be passed in one day. The reason it is so important is that it increases the quality of life for people on the east coast. It is what they deserve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is unanimous agreement within the House that the Atlantic accord should be passed. Everyone is anxious to have that happen. Unfortunately, through typical Liberal manoeuvring it was hooked into Bill C-43. It became a part of that bill. In order to have everything passed we have to make sure that every element of Bill C-43 is best for Canadians. Kyoto was linked in as well. It is well known that people in the House have strong feelings that there are definite problems with some of the Kyoto aspects of the bill. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are saying today is that the Atlantic accord should be lifted out of this legislation and made into stand-alone legislation. Let us get this passed in one day, because we are concerned about the people of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador and those all along the east coast. They are Canadians who have contributed to our country in a major way. At this time they have an opportunity to be the recipients of resources that have been owed to them for a long time. This is our concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative Party of Canada is appealing to the government to take a closer look at Bill C-43 and make sure that the stand-alone elements are lifted out so that we can make sure the people of Atlantic Canada are taken care of.</p><A NAME="Int-1247281"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247287"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247269"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's South—Mount Pearl, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her speech and also for her knowledge of the situation as it pertains to the Atlantic accord agreement and the benefits that should be accruing right now to the province of Newfoundland and Labrador and to Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She mentioned taking the single piece of legislation pertaining to the accord out of this omnibus bill. The Liberals have countered with “pass the bill and everything passes”. I will ask her if this is reasonable. When we compare one two-page piece of legislation, which has been agreed to by the provinces and by the Prime Minister, with an omnibus bill, is it fair to ask people to make that comparison?</p><A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1247287"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247297"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247281"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Joy Smith: </b>Mr. Speaker, absolutely and very clearly in my opinion, it is not fair.

The sad part of this is that people's lives are being used; men and women and families at their breakfast tables in the morning are being put at risk because it does not allow them to get on with planning their futures and their financial well-being. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know why governments are in place: for the well-being of the people of Canada. That is what we should be concerned about. The political game playing and that kind of thing is of no interest to anybody outside these walls. Clearly that is important.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1247297"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247321"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247287"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Yves Lessard (Chambly—Borduas, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak this morning to Bill C-43, the budget implementation bill. I am especially pleased to be able to speak the day after the Prime Minister's address to the nation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This budget is consistent with the Prime Minister's address to the nation. In other words, this budget ignores the public interest, and it  is based on the purely political interest of saving his own party. In fact, this budget  is strategically designed as a campaign tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, this budget totally ignores the priorities of Quebec. Implementing this budget would clearly contradict our own purpose, which is, first and foremost, to defend the interests of Quebeckers, who have given us the mandate to come here as a strong majority, in terms of members from Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-43 should have been an opportunity to make significant improvements to the budget. However, it includes initiatives we find unacceptable. It supports the agreements with Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia and, with regard to Kyoto, it sets out measures based on the polluter-paid principle, instead of the polluter-pay principle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minority Liberal government should have seized the opportunity presented by Bill C-43 to make real compromises and reflect on  the political situation and the message it is getting from all across Canada about the changes that need to be made to government policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, my remarks are intended, naturally, for the Liberal members. In particular, I want to warn them that they will take the fall, and even if the majority of the country does not want an election, one will be necessary given the position in which the government is putting the Canadian public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying earlier that Bill C-43, to implement the budget, is consistent with the Prime Minister's speech yesterday. Last night, the Prime Minister appealed to the nation. It was quite pathetic, because usually a national appeal is in the interests of the entire nation. This means that the head of state, in his official capacity, must speak from on high in the best interests of all Canadians and particularly, in this case, Quebeckers, given the serious damage inflicted on them by the Liberal Party as a result of the sponsorship scandal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, we would have expected the Prime Minister, rather than addressing the nation to ask it to save his party, to apologize for not doing something about the current situation in Canada. We would have also expected him to acknowledge that he was responsible in large part for that situation because, when the Prime Minister was the Minister of Finance and, thus, the custodian of public funds, cheating occurred on the other side of this House for many years. He should have acknowledged that he made a mistake not only by failing to watch more closely over those who were dipping into the fund, but also by withdrawing support from municipal infrastructure.</p><A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also referring to the Guaranteed Income Supplement and how the government simply decided to deny seniors information about their rights. Today, as a result, seniors are still owed $3.3 billion and the government is preventing that money from getting to them. Yet, these people are among those who need it the most. He should have apologized and said that the situation would be corrected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of infrastructure, he should have arranged to have measures in place to prevent municipalities from fighting over who wins the jackpot. He should have also acknowledged what we owe to seniors and  give them back the money they are entitled to and put money back into the fund for social housing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government made these promises in the mid-1990s, and did not start financing these sectors again until 2001. He should have told the public last night that he was sorry, that he made a mistake and that he mismanaged things. He should have added that, effective immediately, since the money is available, he will make amends. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families are owed a major apology, all of the families of Quebec and Canada, because of the Unemployment Insurance cheat, the $46 billion  taken from it.  The Prime Minister pulled off a David Copperfield style magic trick to make $46 billion disappear, and now he says this was virtual money and no longer exists.  Yet that $46 billion had been accumulated by reducing benefits to the unemployed, even though they and their former employers had contributed to it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, a mere 38% of them can hope to receive EI benefits if they end up unemployed.  There ought to have been an apology and a commitment to put that money to its proper use. Instead we are being told today that the money does not exist and that it is all virtual. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are these employee contributions to the EI fund, and the contributions by employers, who pay  $1.40  for every $1 the employees contribute, virtual?  Do they exist or do they not?  That deduction on people's pay stubs, are we to understand that the government did not keep it?  That it was returned?  If that was the case, then it has gone somewhere.  Into the party's fund?  I hope not.  So it must be somewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This talk of virtual and non-existent money is tantamount to deceiving the public.  The Prime Minister ought to have told us that last night, ought to have admitted that he had deceived us.  Only then would he have gained any credibility.  He ought to have made a commitment to put the money back into the fund.  Then he would have been credible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So where is that money?  It is being used as a   hidden  tax in order to decrease the debt, although that  burden must be assumed by the entire community and not just one part of it.  It is even worse when the money diverted has a specific purpose at a time when people are losing jobs and in difficult situations.  If they are impoverishing families in this way, is it surprising that there are so many poor people, so many children living in poverty in this country? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are children living in poverty, it is because there are parents living in poverty. If there are parents living in poverty, it is because certain people are passing measures to prevent them from receiving benefits after losing their jobs, despite having contributed their entire lives. It is an outrage and the Prime Minister should be ashamed. Why did he not mention this yesterday evening?  He would have had credibility, had he done so. He would have been speaking in the interest of the country and of Quebeckers, too, who have taken the fall for him for the underhanded dealings and fishy business connected to the sponsorship scandal. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tying the election to the Gomery commission means making Justice Gomery shoulder a burden that is not his to carry. It is the same as saying that, when he renders his decision and tables his report on all the testimony he has heard, he will be telling the public which way to vote. That is not the judge's responsibility. </p><A NAME="T1030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1030)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judiciary has nothing to do with politics. The issues raised by the sponsorship scandal are directly related to public interest. This is political. The Canadian public, and not Justice Gomery,  has to make that decision as soon as possible, to stop these people from getting their sticky fingers on the cash.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1247321"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247327"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247297"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Keith Martin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, one thing I think most people in the House know very clearly, with the exception of the Bloc Québécois, is that our country is better than the sum of its parts. The province of Quebec, my province of British Columbia and all provinces in this wonderful nation, including the territories, are better together than individually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government has continued to treat all provinces and individuals, be they from Quebec or from any other part of this wonderful country,  as precious Canadians, as individuals to be respected. We have ensured that the concerns of all Canadians, be they individuals in Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, British Columbia, the Yukon, aboriginal or  non-aboriginal, immigrant or non-immigrant, are handled with grace and tact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the Gomery inquiry, our government wants to lay out all the facts about something  any member of Parliament or Canadian would find distasteful, where a small group of people misappropriated funds. The Prime Minister opened an inquiry to ensure that all Canadians would understand what went on, and the person who would be responsible for that inquiry would be Judge Gomery, an independent individual.  I do not know anything more that anyone else could possibly do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night's speech by the Prime Minister was a superb intervention directly to the Canadian public.  He talked about what he had done to get to the bottom of this.  He also underlined the fact that he had asked the RCMP to investigate and that he would try to recover the money.  He has made a promise to all Canadians that if any moneys, down to the dollar, have fallen into the hands of our party or into the hands of  anyone else in an illegal fashion, it would be returned the Canadian public. That is the honest thing to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the member describe to me in honesty how our government has not treated the people of Quebec with absolute fairness and respect by ensuring that their social and economic concerns are met?  I think he will be very hard pressed to come up with any credible criticism of that whatsoever.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1247327"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247321"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Yves Lessard: </b>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member asked two questions.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first concerns the advisability of waiting for the Gomery report. We would be prepared to wait for it  if its contents were challenged by the Canadian public.  Seventy-six per cent of Canadians say they do not believe the Prime Minister  knew nothing, as he claims.  Yesterday he said he was sorry and that he ought to have known.  What he ought to have acknowledged, instead, is that he did know.  Canadians know that he did. It is important to acknowledge this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect relates to my raising the point of injustice to Quebec.  This arises out of two things: first, the burden placed on the people of Quebec as far as  the sponsorship scandal is concerned.  The scandal is primarily linked to people from Quebec, people with whom we are not associated in any way, but from whom the Liberal Party is having a hard time dissociating itself.  That is the first thing.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many injustices, but the most flagrant one of these is perhaps the economic injustice of fiscal imbalance.  This involves a shortfall of a clear $2.4 billion annually.  That money does not get back into the coffers of Quebec. The federal government has a broader tax base than Quebec, so  Quebec, as we saw in Mr. Audet's budget yesterday, has all manner of problems in making ends meet. The situation will be the same whether the government  is PQ, Liberal or anything else.  Why is that?  Because  the obligations are in Quebec while the money is in Ottawa.</p><A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1035)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1247330"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247346"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247327"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Keith Martin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, the budget of this year   is a landmark budget.  I think what   some Canadians  do not understand is the balance between fiscal responsibility and social programs. There are some who would suggest that we should spend, spend, spend.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a certain level, that is perhaps attractive.  We have many needs in our country such as  homelessness, poverty, people who would like to find jobs, individuals with drug problems and children in poverty.  There are a whole host of social issues  with which we  have to be grapple, as in any country. Some people would suggest that we should pour money  into many different areas and spend without taking into consideration the bottom line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the bottom line important? Why does the Canadian government not print money?  Why does the Canadian government  not simply   pour money into all these programs without due responsibility to the bottom line?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our government came into power in 1993, we had a mess on our hands.  We had massive deficits and huge debts that were left by a Progressive Conservative government.  Those deficits were added on to a debt.  What does that do to the social programs? What does that do to the most vulnerable in our society? What does that do to the major income generators in Canada, which is the private sector?  It crushes all of those.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fiscally irresponsible is to be socially irresponsible.  To spend more than we take in and to engage in deficit spending hurts the most vulnerable in our society, damages the private sector, eviscerates our competitiveness and it destroys the pool of funds that we receive from our private sector, our tax base.  By deficit spending and increasing our debt, we increase the amount of money we must pay in interest.  That takes money from the sharp edge of what we need for our social programs and    puts it into debt repayment, on the interest on the debt.  That is irresponsible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our government came into power, we had to make some very difficult choices.  We had to engage in a process of belt tightening to ensure we could get into a surplus situation.  The Liberal government has over the last eight years produced those surpluses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at this internationally,  it is very intriguing. The last few <i>Economist</i> magazines have shown that Canada is leading in the G-8 countries in terms of our economy, and that is exceedingly important. By having a strong economy, we can provide the tax base and engage in what are called the ying and the yang of what this job is all about: having strong fiscal management and a strong tax base which provides us with the moneys to provide the social programs that our neediest require. That is the responsible thing to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do the alternative, which is to overspend, as some people would wish, or to go ahead and spend moneys that we do not have would only hurt the most vulnerable and damage our ability to pay for needed services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was formerly a part of the Conservative government.  One of the reasons I left was the income and  the economic plans for that party were absolutely irresponsible.  Quite frankly,   it shocked me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A parallel to this is what is happening south of the border. The Republican party, a party that one would think would be right of centre and would have good fiscal management, is doing the exact opposite.  It has engaged in a $470 billion deficit spending this year.  That will crush the economic backbone of the United States.  It is an irresponsible thing to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr.  Greenspan, head of the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States, came out in the last 48 hours and made a very strong statement to the U.S. government, saying,  “You must get your spending under control”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what I found in the Conservative Party's missive before the last election.  The economic budgetary plans for a Conservative government would have put us into a deficit situation. That is a line that we absolutely cannot cross.</p><A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is simple to be in opposition and  promise the earth, as the Conservatives did in its defence plans. One reason I left them was that their defence plans were so large and expensive.  In combination with the massive tax cuts in the spending priorities, that they would have put the country into a profound deficit situation.  This would have eroded and removed the ability of a government to pay for needed programs, including defence. That is something a government in the 21st century simply cannot allow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a government that spends within its means so it can do what it has to do. Indeed, we have made promises and we have fulfilled them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just this week we introduced a comprehensive veterans' benefit package, the best package in decades.  We are helping those veterans and their families who have given so much for our country, a wonderful country in which to live.  These Canadians have given their lives to preserve our peace and security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We owe them for their service and our government delivered on that promise this week. Much of the information in the package came from veterans, many of whom live  in my area of Victoria, British Columbia and  my riding of Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. I am profoundly grateful for the input of those veterans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, we have delivered on a balanced budget for the eighth year in a row.  We also will introduce new legislation for homelessness.  This will happen in the next few weeks. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have put into place the largest investment in defence in the last 20 years to ensure our men and women in uniform, who do a yeoman's job, will have the personnel, the equipment, the training and  be taken care of when they do their job for our nation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have done a lot more.  We have reduced taxes for some of the poorest people to address poverty.  The Minister of Social Development  and others are working on plans with respect to child care and early learning.  To ensure our children have the best chances for the future, we must reduce the number of social problems such as fetal alcohol syndrome and youth crime.  We must ensure that children stay in school longer and that they have a healthy start, or head start.  They need to live in a loving and caring environment that is secure, with discipline parameters and good nutrition.  They need to be engaged by their parents or parents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are working on this with the provinces, and we are committed to doing that.  By engaging in that healthy start, that head start program, we will ensure that a whole host of social issues and challenges will be reduced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen that clinically on the ground as a physician. We can look at the work that has been done in the last 20 years, from programs in Ypsilanti, Michigan to the work done by former labour minister of New Brunswick and her husband Doug.  This will ensure that kids will become well-adjusted, functional adults and that social problems will be reduced substantially.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, my province of B.C., of which I am very proud, is the first province to sign on with respect to the gas tax rebate. Those moneys will go directly to the municipalities for critical infrastructure. This is extremely important because the needs on the ground are extensive.  Municipalities know the needs in their areas. The moneys will be directed to these critical infrastructure needs, in cooperation with the province and the municipalities. I want to thank the minister involved for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very proud of the budget put forward by our government.   For the eighth year in a row we have surplus budget, which is the perfect compromise and  match of good fiscal responsibility and social responsibility. I think all Canadians will see that in the future and they will see it in the next election.</p><A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Aside from the breathtaking, staggering hypocrisy, the shedding of his political skin is one thing but he also   completely abandons  any memory of the factual basis of the debt load in this country.   He  refuses  to acknowledge that when the Conservative government came to power in 1984 the spiralling deficit left by the Trudeau administration was one never seen in a G-7 country in the history of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear  a lot of chirping coming from the other side.  I know  we have now changed the voting laws so that the Liberal government can now garner votes from inside prison but they may soon have an opportunity to campaign directly there for that support, Mr. Speaker,  in your constituency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member shows dexterity in sidestepping some of the accountability of his own government and is very deft at refusing to mention that his government is  mired in the largest fiscal scam ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting public.   What he is actually demonstrating is something that a friend of mine, Donald, once described as  podia-dexterity, which is the ability to put both feet in one's  mouth at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask him a direct question dealing with the offshore accord, which was jammed into the omnibus, blunderbuss budget implementation bill that is before the House.  What the government did, again in a very deceitful way, after having signed a stand alone deal with Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador to give 100% of the revenue stream from the offshore oil and gas to those very deserving provinces,   is  it hid it in with 24 other items and suggested that somehow it was an all or nothing offer to Canadians, that they had to take all of these unrelated items or take nothing and then somehow hold this over people's heads that they had to take this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador understand what the government is trying to do.   It is trying to back out of the commitment that the Prime Minister made in desperation during an election campaign and now it is trying to somehow weasel away from that commitment that is costing those provinces millions while the interest accumulates on their provincial deficits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it that the hon. member neglects to acknowledge that the offshore oil and gas accord can be a stand alone bill,  brought before Parliament, passed immediately in the House with the support of all members and we can put that implementation process in place, allow those provinces to start   receiving the revenue  to deal with the infrastructure challenges   and the education and health care challenges that they are still suffering under as a result of cuts of his now newly adopted government?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it that he can stand in his place and be such an adamant apologist for a government he once so fiercely condemned when he was on this side of the House before he abandoned his party and his principles?</p><A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1247349"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247356"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247346"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

What I will  do right now is let the member know the facts for his own edification.  He should look very carefully at where he is sitting in his party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I joined the Reform Party  I was   proud to do it because the party was standing up for getting our fiscal House in order.   Unfortunately, if the hon. member were to look at his party's last budgetary projections, he would see very clearly that his party stood for the same  Bushenomics  that is  taking place south of the border where it will  be engaging in deficit spending.  What the Conservative Party is pursuing with its large tax cuts in combination with massive spending will crush the economy of this country.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government will not  tolerate that for one second because, in doing that,   not only would we be  compromising  our social programs  but we would  eviscerate and damage the private sector, which is a major economic generator.  That is something we will not tolerate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the member to look at the facts.  He might want to look at the $41 billion we put into health care.  He may want to look at the gas tax rebate that we worked on with the provinces and the municipalities.  He may want to look at the Federation of Canadian Municipalities that  said very clearly that they were  profoundly grateful, deeply honoured and pleased to be working with the government to ensure  those moneys get down to the ground for the  infrastructure needs that the member is talking about.</p><A NAME="Int-1247356"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247441"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247349"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I welcome this brief opportunity this morning to address Bill C-43, the budget implementation bill. I want to acknowledge the member for Central Nova for giving me the opportunity to be next to speak. I am sure my constituents appreciate that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that, as I heard the last exchange between the parliamentary secretary on the government side and the deputy leader on the official opposition bench, I ended up shaking my head and thinking no wonder Canadians cannot make sense out of what on earth is going on in this Parliament today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not going to follow the rabbit tracks and use up my time to try to reconstruct the absurdity of that member, who sat first in the Reform and then in the Alliance caucus, pushing and pushing the Liberal government to cut and cut until there was nothing left of some of our most basic services, such as infrastructure, as the member himself acknowledged, post-secondary education, health care and the broken child care promise. All those things that the government promised in 1993 that it would do if elected to office, his party across the way, the ultra cons, kept pushing the government to cut further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he stands up and says that they on that side will repair the damage. However he does not quite say that he had a major role in pushing for the government to make these massive cuts in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to four brief points I want to make in the few minutes available to me. On the issue of the Atlantic accord, the government members and the official opposition members keep leading Atlantic Canadians to believe that they support the speedy delivery of the resources to Newfoundland and Nova Scotia that are contained in that accord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However it is clear that instead of making this Parliament work, instead of taking the fact that if not every member, at least the vast majority of members are committed to doing that, the government, for its own cynical reasons, has tied up the Atlantic accord in the implementation bill in such a way that it is costing the people of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia dollars that they cannot afford out of the most basic services that they desperately need rebuilt as a result of the hacking and slashing by the Liberal government, egged on by the Conservatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government were serious about making this Parliament work, it would immediately do what it has been urged to do by the New Democratic Party. In this instance, one of those rare instances where we actually agree with the Conservatives, the government must take it out of the budget implementation bill, get the commitment of dollars flowing and remove the uncertainty and the threat that the Atlantic accord may go down the tubes because of the government's cynical and ham-fisted handling of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to pick up on the government member's bleeding heart comments about how important the government's commitments are to infrastructure. In my riding a few nights ago, hundreds of people came together in the fire hall in Ketch Harbour to say that they were desperate to get the new water and sewer facilities that have been withheld from them for 40 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following statement was accurately reported by the provincial daily paper, the <i>Halifax Herald</i>, which reads:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>While the municipality is kicking in $5 million, the provincial and federal governments are giving a little over $2 million combined.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the combined contribution from the federal and the provincial governments is less than one-third.</p><A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1055)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years we were able to put together infrastructure projects that were about clean water and sanitation with a formula of one-third contribution from the federal government, the provincial government and the municipal government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that what is such a disgrace about the inadequate contribution of infrastructure funding to this project in my riding in Halifax is being repeated again and again all over this country because the government has systematically decided to give billions and billions of dollars in tax breaks to big corporations and the wealthiest of Canadians over the years, still including in the budget $4.3 billion in tax cuts to corporations while people go without the basics of clean water and adequate sanitation services. Those are the priorities that are still reflected in the provisions of the budget implementation bill that we have before us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say that hope springs eternal. Last night we heard the Prime Minister basically say that we had to get on with the job and do what needs to be done. I think every Canadian wants to see the government cooperating with the opposition parties to do what needs to be done but that starts today, this hour, this moment with indications from the government that it is prepared to do what needs to be done to make changes in the budget implementation bill that is before us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the government will not literally drop the promise made by the Prime Minister last night across the airwaves and the very next morning turn its back on the commitment made. Let us see if the Liberals mean what they say, and that means changing the legislation that is within their control and the budget that is before us and begin to get the job done, which requires the government changing some of its ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing I want to speak to is post-secondary education. During the election, the Prime Minister, in a desperate bid for votes in an all Canadian job interview targeting youth, the post-secondary education students, said he would return $8 billion to post-secondary education funding. I do not think anyone expected that he would return $8 billion of post-secondary education funding all in one budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dealing here with a Prime Minister who loves to talk about targets and timetables and who says that if we mean the commitments we make, we develop an implementation plan, develop timetables and targets and say how we will keep this promise of recommitting $8 billion to core funding and education, and at least begin to ease the burden that has been heaped on our students. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the government done this, even in the budget implementation bill now before us? Absolutely not. Not one red cent was recommitted to rebuild core funding for post-secondary education in the budget, and we know the disastrous results. The results are that tuition hikes continue. Students at Dalhousie University in the heart of my riding have seen almost a 10% tuition hike as a result of the $8 billion broken promise that was made by the Prime Minister on the eve of the election.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I tried to speak to what is happening locally and to what is happening nationally and internationally. It has to be one of the biggest disgraces of this budget that the Prime Minister and the government yet again have turned their backs on the long established commitment made by a previous prime minister, Lester Pearson, that Canada would lead the way in committing 0.7% of our GNP to overseas development assistance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again and again people before the foreign affairs committee have pleaded the case for us to honour our commitment to the millennium development goals, honour our commitment to actually be a good global citizen and commit to that 0.7%. </p><A NAME="T1100"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1100"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1100)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only was there no indication that they were prepared to do it in general, there was absolutely no implementation plan, no targets and timetables, to the utter disgrace and humiliation of Canada in the international community.</p><A NAME="Int-1247441"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247371"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247356"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>There will be five minutes in the time remaining for questions and comments for the hon. member for Halifax when this matter next comes before the House.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Super Cities Walk for MS occurs across Canada annually, including over 75,000 participants in more than 150 communities, fundraising over $9.7 million. Our event had over 600 participants who together raised over $65,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day in Canada three more people are diagnosed with MS. Although there are many different forms of treatment for MS, much more still needs to be done to combat this disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the success of events like this which will eventually result in a cure being found. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to heartily congratulate all those who organized the event as well as all those who participated with such great energy, dedication and determination. The commitment of all those individuals to this cause certainly brings great hope to the thousands across Canada who have been affected by MS.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us use this week to reflect on the importance of protecting this critical resource, our soil. This conservation effort aims not only to protect the soil as the foundation for a sustainable agricultural industry, but also to promote its environmental role as a natural tool for reducing greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthy soil can act as a natural carbon sink and, as such, may contribute to providing at least 20% of the solution in mitigating greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is true that from the soil comes life, then the sustainability of our planet relies greatly on the health of this fragile veneer.

This play, entitled <i>Famille sans respect, famille sans success</i> was part of the  program “Moi, je contrôle mon agressivité”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This play was part of a project to find positive strategies to curb aggressiveness in children.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Dalhousie University in my riding for example, medical, dentistry, law and international students face tuition hikes of over 9%  this year.

Yesterday the Prime Minister spoke to the nation to save his career.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a desperate and diversionary ruse to buy his moribund government more time, the Prime Minister promised an election, but only in 10 months. Why do we not first take a look at what he has done in the last 10 months: no meaningful tax cuts, no democratic reform, no dealing with the fiscal imbalance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has become an expert at making promises, but keeping them is a whole different matter. The Prime Minister has dithered so often that he does not ever actually get anything done. We must judge our politicians not on what they say, but on what they have done. The Prime Minister has shown that  the only thing he does is break promises.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sworn testimony before the Gomery commission he told Canadians he did not know Mr. Boulay very well. Yet according to Mr. Boulay's wife, they were part of the family that the Prime Minister worked with on his 1993 campaign. They worked at his office. Following the election the Prime Minister joined 11 other campaign workers for an intimate brunch at the Boulay home. Of course, we know the Prime Minister wrote a highly personalized and even flirtatious letter to Mr. Boulay and his wife.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the Prime Minister with these glaring contradictions on the record expect Canadians to believe him?</p><A NAME="Int-1247448"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247454"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247445"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to note that yesterday the communications director for the Conservative Party drew an absolutely horrendous comparison between the Prime Minister of Canada and Osama bin Laden.  Surely this defies all the rules of civility and decency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we begin today, I would invite the deputy leader of the Conservative Party to disavow that comparison.</p><A NAME="Int-1247454"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247457"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247448"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter MacKay (Central Nova, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, perhaps the Prime Minister should come here and deal with that situation himself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diane Deslauriers, Claude's wife, was known as the queen of ticket sellers. She was very active in the fundraising efforts of the Liberal Party and on behalf of the Prime Minister.  In her spare time from selling tickets she even organized a fundraising golf tournament for the Prime Minister. It is interesting to note where the former Prime Minister's balls are now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister was the senior minister in Quebec and we know his leadership campaign was well underway.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is just not believable when the Prime Minister says he barely knew some of the most active Liberal fundraisers in his home province. Just how stupid does he think Canadians really are?</p><A NAME="Int-1247457"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247459"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247454"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister's testimony is on the record with respect to Mr. Boulay. He stands by that testimony.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we are all best advised to let Mr. Justice Gomery review all of the facts of this matter to get to the bottom of it in a thorough independent way. When we have his judgment, when we have his view of what transpired, then  we can all draw conclusions.</p><A NAME="Int-1247459"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247462"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247457"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter MacKay (Central Nova, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, those are more desperate attempts at distraction from the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claude Boulay says he worked on the Prime Minister's 1990 leadership fund. He was at the 1993 election campaign. In fact in the 1993 campaign Mr. Boulay claims he met with the Prime Minister a couple of times a week, and his wife met with him daily at times during that campaign. They dined together at the Boulay home, yet the Prime Minister says it was a casual acquaintance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not the real truth that the only casual acquaintance the Prime Minister is having is with the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?</p><A NAME="Int-1247462"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247465"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247459"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.  Scott Brison (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, the fact is that what Madame Deslauriers said is that 12 years ago she hosted a brunch, a thank you brunch for campaign volunteers after the election.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that the Prime Minister has said in his testimony that he met Mr. Boulay occasionally as part of groups at political functions. That is entirely consistent because that was a political function. The Prime Minister is being completely honest, unlike that party which  compared the Prime Minister of Canada to a mass murderer and a terrorist.</p><A NAME="Int-1247465"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247475"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247462"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister had every opportunity during his remarks last night to clear up some of these glaring contradictions between his testimony and others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said that he only met the Boulays in 1990 and that their relationship was “short term”. He said, and I also quote, “I did make his acquaintance at the beginning of the leadership in 1990 but it didn't last for long”. Yet the Boulays both testified that they worked extremely closely with the Prime Minister on his 1993 campaign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the Prime Minister mislead the Gomery inquiry?</p><A NAME="Int-1247475"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247477"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247465"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. They spent most of the week talking about birthday greetings from a Prime Minister who sends out 50,000 of them a year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to remember what the member for Prince George--Peace River said last year,  “If we took action to remove a person every time someone is accused of something, there wouldn't be many politicians in this country”.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked about his relationship with Claude Boulay and his wife Diane Deslauriers, the Prime Minister said, “I do not know Mr. Boulay very well, nor do I know Ms. Deslauriers very well”. Ms. Deslauriers, however, testified under oath yesterday that she worked every day with the Prime Minister on his 1993 campaign, that they were like family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Prime Minister explain the glaring contradiction in his sworn testimony?</p><A NAME="Int-1247480"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247482"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247477"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

That is a big difference from what the member is inferring. Mr. Boulay said in fact that he never met with the Prime Minister one on one, only at political functions.  That is entirely true.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition members are once again misrepresenting daily testimony.  They are taking selectively from testimony to support their own narrow partisan argument.  That is the true dishonesty. Our Prime Minister is interested in the truth and he stands with Canadians to support Justice Gomery.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The announcement allowed parents and grandparents to come here on multiple entry visas.  Those multiple entry visas are contingent upon health care insurance that is provided by the applicants.  It is not a burden on the system.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to state at the outset of the debate today on this concurrence motion that I am very pleased  to split my time with my leader, the leader of the official opposition, the member for Calgary Southwest. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it has become a national  story, despite the poor performance, I would like to begin by making a few comments about the Prime Minister's pitiful performance last night. He confused a crisis in the Liberal Party of Canada with a national crisis. He abused the office of Prime Minister to have a national television event, which normally would be reserved for times of crisis for the nation when the prime minister, the leader of a nation, would have to communicate very clearly to the people, in both official languages, on something that would threaten the very survival of the nation. That is not the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about is a scandal, the worst in Canadian history, that threatens the very existence of the Liberal Party of Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has said and has maintained that we should cut him some slack because he is the one who launched the Gomery inquiry.  I think it is obvious to all Canadians that he had no choice in launching the Gomery inquiry.  We need to be very clear about this.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Prime Minister wanted to have an election last year, early in his mandate as Prime Minister, as Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, to get his own fresh mandate. He knew the only way he could go to the people of Canada last year in an election was if he called that inquiry.  It was his only defence. Therefore, he called it.  He set it up and then he determined that he would have to circumvent it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an inquiry taking place at the public accounts committee, as we all know, it was televised, but he shut that down.  He had his members on that committee shut down the only inquiry that was ongoing. Then he went to the people last May and June in an election campaign without waiting for one witness to appear before the Gomery inquiry. Very clearly, he had to do that.  It was his only defence in the election campaign that he knew he would call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason he wanted to call it is he wanted to get even with the former prime minister of this country.  He wanted to seek revenge when the former prime minister happened to time his retirement just before the final report of the Auditor General.  He left the whole mess for the current Prime Minister.  The current Prime Minister decided that a good way to get even with the former prime minister, Jean Chrétien, was to call an inquiry and point the figure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, last night we found out the truth about one thing at least.  He finally accepted the responsibility that he was negligent as finance minister in not watching over the public purse.  He had to know what was going on and he chose to look the other way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally admitted last night to the Canadian people that he should have been more vigilant.  Therefore, I would as the question. If he should have been more vigilant when he was number two man, when he was finance minister, in watching over the public purse, why in heaven's name would Canadians want to wait eight more months for that Prime Minister when he is in control of the federal treasury?   Imagine how much money will be wasted in the next eight months?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People say  that we should not have an election right now. It might cost $250 million to $280 million.  How many billions will the Liberal government blow over the next eight months if Canadians were to let it stay in power?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I want to very quickly make is a reality. It is how this place has become dysfunctional and who is to blame.</p><A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1215)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As House leader for the opposition, I can say we have acted responsibly. We have tried to make this Parliament work.  The leader of the official opposition took the unprecedented step of having the official opposition in this Parliament abstain on the budget to ensure the survival of this Parliament.  That had never been done in history.  Our leader did that because he wanted to try everything possible to make this Parliament work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we get for it in return?  On Monday night the government House leader cancelled opposition day motions, one of the basic tenets of democracy in this place.  The basic tenet of democracy is opposition parties having the opportunity of  holding the government accountable, and the government cancelled those days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move forward, let us ensure that Canadians clearly understand who is to blame for this place being dysfunctional.</p>

Stephen Harper (Leader of the Opposition, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker,  this has been a remarkable week that began with an unprecedented decision by the government to cancel opposition days, one of the fundamental rights in this House. During the rest of the week, we hardly saw the Prime Minister, here or in public. Last night, the Prime Minister delivered a public address, as if in a national crisis, but it was solely for partisan reasons. It was a partisan speech broadcast on television to the entire country. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is remarkable when the Prime Minister does not appear here in the House or in public and communicates with the public only via a tape recording. It is incredible.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been a remarkable week.  Even more remarkable were some of the things in the Prime Minister's speech last night.  The Prime Minister effectively went on the air to give a partisan speech and to launch an election campaign. It is  a campaign which  he says he wants to set for some 10 months out, if I calculate correctly, that is if the Gomery report is ever tabled,  since half of the Liberal Party is going to be before the federal courts trying to quash the Gomery report within the next month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a Prime Minister who has already decided we should have an election at a time of extremely unusual choosing, a Prime Minister who has acknowledged corruption in his own party.  The question that we face as the official opposition, the question that  all Canadians face, is can a corrupt party remain in power while all this is going on?  Can it remain in power month after month?  The question we have to face as the official opposition is, can we prop up that party in power? Can we prop up a corrupt party at this time, particularly when, as my colleague the House leader  has pointed out, that the two other opposition parties have already voted non-confidence in the government?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not use the term “corruption” lightly.  What we are hearing at the Gomery inquiry is sworn testimony, in many cases sworn unrefuted testimony that certainly points to widespread corruption, but we have incidents outside of the Gomery inquiry that are not even subject to the Gomery inquiry.  We have  illegal lobbying done by the Prime Minister's Quebec lieutenant.  We heard once again  evasive answers today.  There was improper contracting done by the Prime Minister's campaign manager at Earnscliffe. The campaign manager and the chief of staff just happen to be common law partners. We have investigations going on into that. We have the accusations, allegations of the partisan use of judicial appointments.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out that a Liberal member said to me that people do not believe it.  Virtually all of these allegations are coming from senior members of the Liberal Party.  I repeat what I said earlier this week. If each group of Liberals says that the other group of Liberals is a group of crooks and liars, what does it really matter which group we choose to believe?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a principle in our parliamentary system.  That principle is that the government must maintain the confidence of the House of Commons to remain in office.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know what the supply day manoeuvre was about earlier this week.  Late last week the government removed Bill C-43, the budget bill, from  the notice paper.  I smelled right away an attempt to avoid a confidence motion at all costs, so I moved that our supply motion would make sure supply days would exist.  That is what the government cancelled.  Clearly the government has in mind, and it will do more manoeuvres, to avoid any kind of confidence motion in the next month.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an option.  This is a violation of the principle of our democratic system. If the government cannot maintain the confidence of the House, it must seek the confidence of Canadians.  It cannot circumvent this fundamental principle through procedural manoeuvres.  We will do whatever we can to ensure that when we return and have heard from the population of Canada that all options are available to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that in mind,   I move:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.</p><A NAME="Int-1247743"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247771"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247741"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Ralph Goodale (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am very interested in the amendment that the hon. leader has just moved. I have not seen it and I am sure I will in due course, but I believe the gist  of it is to say that there were some recommendations of the Standing Committee on Finance having to do with the budget that the government did not implement, and the Leader of the Opposition takes exception to that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact in the preparation of the budget, I went through one by one all of the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Finance. I found, given the rather raucous nature of the committee, that sometimes the recommendations made by the NDP were not consistent with the recommendations made by the Conservatives. Some of the recommendations made by the Conservatives did not match the recommendations made by the Bloc Québécois. Sometimes the government and opposition parties agreed. Sometimes they disagreed. There was quite a potpourri of recommendations from the finance committee. Quite frankly, it would be absolutely impossible for this government or any government to implement all of the recommendations of the finance committee without totally contradicting themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that the work of the finance committee was very helpful. Indeed the majority of the recommendations made by the committee, at least where there was a consensus among the political parties, were in fact implemented in the budget. Therefore the factual basis for the hon. gentleman's motion is simply not in existence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take a moment or two to address the broader context in which this motion is made and the context that was described by the Leader of the Opposition and by the House leader for the opposition in putting this motion on the floor. It has to do with the current political environment and the issues that preoccupied us in  question period a few moments ago and indeed for much of the last several weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in political life is more important than the public's trust. To me, and I am sure to the Prime Minister, to all members of the cabinet and to all members of the government, earning and keeping that trust is now and always has been our first and most basic principle. I share completely the concerns of the vast majority of decent Canadians upon hearing the various descriptions of events, some of them contradictory, all of them, to date at least, uncorroborated, coming from the various witnesses appearing before the Gomery commission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commission, as all Canadians know, is conducting a transparent and comprehensive judicial investigation into certain publicity activities of the previous government prior to the year 2002. Where such activities crossed legal or ethical boundaries, they must be exposed, condemned and punished to the fullest extent of the law. There can be no defence of the indefensible. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trail does have to be followed wherever it may lead. Any and all wrongdoers must suffer the full consequences of their misconduct, whoever they may be. That is why Judge Gomery must finish his entire inquiry and reach his final conclusions about exactly what happened and who carries the responsibility. A partial story is not good enough. The judge's mandate is to get to the whole unvarnished truth. Nothing less will do. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this work is ongoing, it is significant to note that the Gomery commission was launched by the Prime Minister himself, voluntarily and very quickly upon coming into office. That in itself is a strong indication of two key points. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the Prime Minister has nothing to fear and nothing to hide from this inquiry. The issues under investigation are not ones that he created. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister is a man of principle and conscience who is determined, and his actions prove this, to root out these problems regardless of the political consequences. The Prime Minister is also the one who cancelled the impugned sponsorship program and eliminated the agency that ran it.</p><A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an unprecedented move to help investigators, he ordered the release of more than 12 million pages of normally confidential internal documentation from within the Privy Council.  He launched 19 legal actions to recover any public money that was improperly spent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister also ordered the independent forensic examinations of the financial records of the Liberal Party, the results of which are now available to the public on the Internet. He strengthened the rules on the ethical standards expected of cabinet ministers and public officials.  He provided the independent ethics commissioner with more clout. He restored the office of the Comptroller General of Canada. He bolstered government-wide internal audits. He provided automatic public disclosure of government contracts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear the deputy leader of the opposition once again interrupting rather than participating constructively in the debate. I would point out that in his last intervention he said that it was the Liberal Party that took away the office of the Comptroller General. I would remind him that the initiative to eliminate the office of the Comptroller General was introduced by the previous Kim Campbell government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the Prime Minister and the government that terminated a number of crown corporation CEOs and implemented tough new standards of governance. All of that is a clear reflection of the Prime Minister's respect for the public trust and his absolute determination to safeguard the public interest ahead of all personal or partisan considerations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last evening in his address to the country, I believe the Prime Minister made a very compelling argument. He spoke directly and honestly to Canadians about the crucial work of the  Gomery Commission which he himself created. He spoke about political responsibility and political accountability. He spoke about calling a national election quickly upon the publication of Judge Gomery's report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Canadians will find the Prime Minister's case to be both reasonable and convincing, based upon the complete and unvarnished truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sampling public opinion, I know that political parties like to revel in the outcomes of public opinion polls, which vary. They go up,  they go down and they change from time to time. I have had a sampling of the opinion of prominent Canadian journalists over the course of the last couple of weeks while these issues have been very prominent in the media. Let me just put a few of those views of people who watch the political process on a daily basis and who have some background and knowledge in these matters, on the record. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an article not long ago by Mr. James McNulty in the <i>Vancouver Province.</i> The headline on that article was “Early election call will snub public opinion; opposition should heed public support for Gomery inquiry to finish”. About the same time there was an article in the <i>Calgary Herald</i> that said “Canadians may well get to the bottom of the scandal, just as Martin promised”. Third, from the <i>Regina Leader Post: </i></p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>There was an election only last year and we detect no public appetite for another so soon. We believe that in the real world, a majority of Canadians want the government to get on with running the country, the opposition parties to hold them to account on their policies and Justice Gomery to complete his work and report his findings. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was this commentary from University Dean William Neville appearing in the <i>Winnipeg Free Press.</i> He said:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>--it would not be entirely unprecedented to have a verdict first and a trial afterwards. It happened, after all, in Alice in Wonderland.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was a comment from CanWest Global in the <i>National Post</i>  not long ago where this was said:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>At the time the Prime Minister created the Gomery inquiry, he knew a feeding frenzy like this might result. And so you have to give him a good deal of credit for ignoring the politics and doing the right thing.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have an editorial today in the <i>Globe and Mail</i> that makes the case for hearing everything that Judge Gomery has to say when his report is finalized. </p><A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1235)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even earlier the <i>Globe and Mail</i> said this:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Whoever pulls the plug has to have a good reason to put the country to the expense and disruption of another election only one year after the last. If the most compelling reason is political opportunism, and if the voters sense they are being summoned to the polls prematurely, they may not reward the perpetrator.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also refer to the <i>Ottawa Citizen</i> and an article that was written not long ago by Susan Riley.  She noted she was no particular friend of the government or the Prime Minister, but this is what she had to say:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>What is going on is hysteria, a lynch-mob mentality, a potent mixture of genuine public outrage and political opportunism that threatens to derail the disinterested pursuit of justice and the whole truth.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the <i>Montreal Gazette</i> which not long ago had this to say:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The election buzz is largely a media invention, rather than a measure of reality. The public has no interest in a quick election; we had one just 10 months ago.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me refer to the Halifax <i>Chronicle Herald</i>.  The Halifax newspaper had this to say:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The case [the Prime Minister] laid out in his own defence is stronger than any case mounted against him. He is the one who cancelled the sponsorship program on Day 1 of his tenure. He is the one who set up the Gomery inquiry...</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right across the country there is consistent editorial opinion that simply says as a matter of fairness and justice, as a matter of letting the whole truth be known, that the proper course of action here is to allow Judge Gomery to finish his inquiry, to find the facts, to make his recommendations and on the basis of those recommendations, then all of us will have both the information and the obligation to act and to act appropriately.  That is essentially what the Prime Minister said last evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another reason why it would be appropriate, I believe, for this Parliament to take a more considered course, as we approach the days and weeks immediately ahead, rather than some blind and irrational rush to judgment, and that is because the House has before it some very important business.  I know various ministers want to sponsor and promote their portfolios of activities.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would simply refer to the budget.  It is a budget that provides $5 billion for cities and communities to build the healthy infrastructures that they need for the future.  It is a budget that puts in $5 billion--</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Bev Oda:</b> Not this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Ralph Goodale:</b> Yes, indeed this year if the people across the way have the capacity to pass the budget bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities.  We have heard from Saskatchewan municipalities.  We have heard from British Columbia municipalities.  We have heard from Quebec municipalities.  They say that they want the budget passed.  They want the new deal for cities and communities and they want it now. We have signed one agreement with British Columbia.  British Columbia wants that program, nearly $700 million, if my memory serves me correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Parliament will have lots of time to debate the hot political points that flow back and forth across the floor, but now is the time to deal with the budget, now is the time to ensure that money flows to the cities and communities across this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more in the budget.  There is child care, establishing a $5 billion program to ensure that there is early learning and quality child care across this country, child care that is high quality, that is universal, that is affordable and accessible and that is developmental, not just a form of babysitting or storage, but that brings education and life skills development to the youngest of our citizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would encourage members of the House to listen to the child care advocates, to listen to the social service groups across the country, to listen to provincial governments. The Hon. Joanne Crofford, who is the minister of social services in the province of Saskatchewan, has  said that the child care initiative is bold, innovative, and exactly what Saskatchewan needs, and she wants to see it passed.</p><A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are provisions for senior citizens.  These are extremely important.  We have undertaken to increase the guaranteed income supplement.  That will be worth $2.7 billion to senior citizens over this next five year period, as we implement it in the next two years and then the flow of funding over the following three years, to the oldest and the poorest people in the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have provisions in the budget for the disabled to try to improve the credits and the benefits that flow to those who want to be more self-sufficient, to find their way into the workplace, to have a more comfortable and high quality of life.  That is one of the things in the budget that ought to be passed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a provision to double the credits available to the caregivers of seniors and disabled Canadians.  We want to give those caregivers some recognition of the benefit and the value of the huge supports that they provide to those in their families who need that kind of assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also $1.4 billion in the budget for measures dealing with aboriginal Canadians.  The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has pursued an ambitious program over the course of the last number of months and it has some further months to run.  The minister will be consulting with aboriginal Canadians, with all ministers of the cabinet and with the provinces.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a retreat toward the end of May, where a number of bold new ideas will come together about how to rebuild and re-establish a better relationship between aboriginal Canadians, the Government of Canada and all Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a first ministers meeting in the fall of this year, where governments can specifically lay their plans to move this important file forward.  In the meantime, the budget provided $1.4 billion to begin on issues such as housing, the care of children and education to move the files forward.  That too should be passed at the earliest possible date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is what we had to say about the environment.  I was rather pleased when the Coalition for Clean Air and Renewable Energy made the comment that it thought the only thing wrong with the budget was the date.  It was in February.  They said that it should have been on March 17, on St. Patrick's Day, because it was the greenest budget in Canadian history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All together there is about $7.5 billion in the budget directed toward environmental issues.  It is very important that those proceed, not necessarily to satisfy the technical requirements of some international treaty, as important as that is, but to ensure that Canadians have clean air and clean water and a high quality of life for them, their children and their grandchildren.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget also dealt with foreign affairs and with foreign aid.  The budget dealt with the Canadian Forces.  It contained the biggest investment in the Canadian Forces in 20 years, $13 billion to rebuild and refurbish the Canadian Forces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the measures on productivity, workforce training, immigrant settlement, training and skills and literacy.  We have the innovation agenda, $1 billion for science and technology and to ensure that Canada stays in the forefront of the knowledge based technology driven and highly skilled world of the 21st century.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget brings forward tax reductions to try to ensure that Canadians are fully competitive with the forces of competition that they have to face from around the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were reductions in personal taxes.  Especially there, the government will take 860,000 of the lowest income Canadians off the tax rolls all together, a quarter of them, 250,000, are senior citizens and most of them are women.  That is a very progressive measure and it needs to be implemented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all of these reasons, as well as the importance of the Gomery commission, there is no need in the House for a rush to judgment.  It is time to do serious work on behalf of serious Canadians who do not particularly appreciate the heckling and the hullabaloo that comes across the way.  They want to see respect,  they want to see civility and they want to see a Parliament that works.  We are dedicated to that.</p><A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1247771"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247772"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247743"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Speaker: </b>Before I move to questions and comments, I have a notice of a question of privilege from the  hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge him to be a little less repressed with the truth in this case and to actually provide to Canadians the dignity of the House that they deserve and retract what he said because he knows full well that he misled the House when he said that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul Wells said, referring to the Prime Minister, “who is said to have released a new tape to Al-Jazeera”. That is what the journalist said.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps he would like to retract that. And further, I stand by the comments in the 2003 article in the<i>National Post</i> which refer to this hon. member having said that the current Prime Minister was sending tapes out to Al-Jazeera. A very clear reference to the one and only, Mr. bin Laden. Therefore, I would further ask the member who is known to be--</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.</p><A NAME="Int-1247782"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247786"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247781"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I will be the first to admit in a totally non-partisan way that there are some minor things in this budget plan 2005 that I would agree with, albeit, as I noted in my speech to the budget, all of them tend to be three, four, or five years down the road. That is very disconcerting and discouraging for taxpayers that are and have been waiting a long time now for tax relief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have pointed this out many times in this chamber. As I travel across the country, what is a surplus to a Liberal is overtaxation to a Conservative. It is pretty basic and it comes down to that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the Minister of Finance rise in his place and give an off-the-cuff, eloquent defence of his budget for 20 minutes. He  talked about the changes and tax relief. Let us take a look at that, right from his own document. The basic personal amount will be increased over a five year period as follows: $100 in 2006, an additional $100 in 2007, $400 in 2008, and $600 in 2009.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Minister of Finance a simple question on behalf of overtaxed Canadians, especially those whom I am always honoured and privileged to represent in Prince George--Peace River. What would lead him to believe that we, the Canadian people, should leave this corrupt government in power for eight more days, let alone eight more months, and not give them substantial tax relief now?</p><A NAME="Int-1247786"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247789"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247782"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Ralph Goodale: </b>Mr. Speaker, the provisions that he refers to are just part of the tax relief measures that are included in the budget, but even the ones that he referred to will add up, over the five year implementation period, to tax relief for ordinary Canadians of $7.1 billion.  That is not insignificant. When they are fully implemented, those tax measures will take 860,000 of the lowest income taxpayers off the tax rolls all together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included among those who will receive this benefit, there are 240,000 senior citizens.  Those senior citizens are largely single, elderly women living alone. Therefore, there are benefits that flow from the tax measures.  All of these too come on top of $100 billion in tax reductions that we have implemented over the last five years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very proud to say that since we balanced the books in 1997,  in every budget we have reduced the tax burden on Canadians and we intend to continue to move in that direction.</p><A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1255)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1247789"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247792"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247786"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pierre Poilievre (Nepean—Carleton, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I want to ask a substantive question about the direction of the government. The government promises to spend at least $5 billion on a day care bureaucracy. Experts in the field, advocates who support this plan, actually say it will cost ultimately $10 billion a year to bring in a fully institutionalized day care bureaucracy, the kind the government is ultimately promising.  That is $10 billion per year which is a massive cost for Canadian parents through higher taxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why will the government not have the modesty to just give those child care dollars directly to parents, so that they can make their own decisions as to what is in the best interests for their own children?</p><A NAME="Int-1247792"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247795"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247789"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Ralph Goodale: </b>Mr. Speaker, I have heard this argument from not only other members of the opposition but other Canadians, and indeed, I have listened to that argument very carefully. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want a system, in terms of supporting families and children, that is equitable to all concerned. That is why, when we implemented our tax cuts over the last six or seven years, we have focused on families with children. I will do the calculation between questions and come back with the exact arithmetic, but the largest portion of the benefit of those tax reductions up to now has flowed to families with children, particularly low income families. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize that need to bring down that tax burden and thereby leave more flexibility in the hands of those families to make their child care decisions. However, at the same time, the national system of child care is clearly underdeveloped. We need more spaces. We need more skilled workers who are properly positioned to provide the kind of duties that they are called upon to perform. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want a system that is high quality, universal, affordable, accessible and developmental. That is what this $5 billion is for, and it is not instead of tax reductions but in addition to tax reductions.</p><A NAME="Int-1247795"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247792"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Maria Minna (Beaches—East York, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite talks about child care and seniors.  The women's caucus of the Liberal Party worked for two years to ensure we had a good increase for seniors. The bulk of unattached seniors are women who are living in poverty, who cannot pay rent, who cannot buy medicine, and who cannot buy food. We are talking about basic survival. The GIS increase helps seniors, especially female seniors in our society. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding children, we worked for a long time, for 10 years, to get provinces to agree on a child care program. In 2000 we had the early education program with  $2.2 billion. Now we finally have an early education program that is national, with $700 million and then $5 billion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax cuts to individuals do not build infrastructure. It is like saying, “Give me a $300 tax cut for health care”, but then who builds the hospital? Who knows? Who gets the equipment? Who knows? We need infrastructure. Early education and care is fundamental to give every child equal opportunities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask the Minister of Finance to tell me today, what will happen to those seniors and children if this budget does not pass?</p><A NAME="Int-1247800"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247802"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247795"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Ralph Goodale: </b>Mr. Speaker, the budget that we presented on February 23 was intended to do a number of things. It was intended to reflect largely the advice of the finance committee, which it did. It was intended to reflect  the consultation that I held with literally hundreds of Canadians across the country and all of the provincial governments. It was intended to reflect the priorities of Canadians as they had stated them directly to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have said very clearly that they want to see improvements in the support systems for senior citizens. That is why in the election last summer we made our commitment to increase the GIS to bring back the new horizons program and to establish a national seniors secretariat. All of those investments will cost $2.7 billion. It is important for those investments to be approved by this House so that program can go forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolutely clear that our country will not have an adequate child care program unless the provisions contained in this budget are allowed to proceed. That is not just my view. I would quote ministers of social services and family services across the country, including the Hon. Joanne Crofford, from my own province of Saskatchewan, who has said the social measures in this budget are among the most progressive that she has ever seen.</p><A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1300)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1247802"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247804"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I had two questions, but the minister was kind enough to respond to the first question of  GIS with respect to seniors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was elected in the greatest city of Toronto. A strong city makes for a strong province and a strong country. I know he has been speaking with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. My second question is, what are we doing with the city of Toronto and other cities, and what are the mayors saying because they need support? What has the minister done in the budget with respect to cities?</p><A NAME="Int-1247804"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247807"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247802"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Ralph Goodale: </b>Mr. Speaker, I am tempted to defer to my colleague, the minister  responsible for cities and communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have in the last two budgets taken some very bold initiatives.  We  have provided a 100%  rebate of the GST to all municipalities on all  their  purchases.  That is worth $700 million per year to the municipalities of this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we have taken the existing infrastructure programs and we have condensed them, particularly the municipal and rural program, from what used to be 10 years, down to 5 years so the money will flow more quickly.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the budget gets passed, we will be begin to share the gas tax.  That will amount to a huge new flow of long term  predictable revenue to municipalities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just make two quick points. All of this is in addition to our existing infrastructure programs.  Our intention is that funding will be ongoing permanently and it will be there for the municipalities of this country to rely on.</p><A NAME="Int-1247807"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247818"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247804"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Rob Nicholson (Niagara Falls, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to split my time with the member for St. John's South—Mount Pearl and to make a few comments on this issue.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to pick up on one of the things the Minister of Finance said  about the gas tax money for the cities.  I have to say that this is one of the most disappointing things that I can remember in public policy announcements in the last couple of years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little over two years ago I was in Winnipeg  when the Federation of Canadian Municipalities held  a meeting.  The Prime Minister, who was the  finance minister at the time, made an  announcement  about gas money for the cities.  I thought it was a great idea because the  municipalities could use more funding as they are underfunded and the provinces are underfunded.   This was in the spring of 2003.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spring became the summer, the summer became the fall and the government made  another announcement that it would  move toward giving gas tax money to the cities. However 2003 became 2004 and   still no cheques were in the hands of the municipalities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This then  became part of the Liberal platform for the 2004 election.    I thought we would wait to see what kind of progress would be made. The election of 2004 came and went, the  summer became the fall and then we heard another announcement. My problem with all this is that we cannot eat announcements, which is all  we seem to get.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to know where the cheques are.     When will  the cheques finally   be put in the mail, or will this be an announcement for the next election?  Let me guess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> It sounds like it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Rob Nicholson:</b> That is right.   Part of the unveiling of the election campaign for the Liberal Party will be that it is going to give money to the municipalities.  The municipalities have been waiting months and seasons and will probably have to wait  years to get it.  That is the problem I have with all announcements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember  almost 30 years ago  when  a former Liberal prime minister said that he wanted to do something about the marijuana laws in this country.  He wanted to decriminalize or legalize marijuana.  For Heaven's sake, it was 30 years ago.  I disagreed with it then and I still disagree with it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens is that this is announced by every Liberal government.  In fact, one voter told me that he was voting  for the Liberals because they were going to  legalize marijuana.  I told him that he would  have to vote for the Liberals all his life because they just keep  announcing it but nothing ever happens with it.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from the problems that the Liberals think they are having with their agenda, that bill has moved  through the system and we in  the official opposition oppose  it.   This is part of the government's agenda. I disagree with it but it  is one of the government's hallmarks, one of the centrepieces of the 38th Parliament, that it will bring in marijuana legislation and  move it forward.  However nothing ever quite happens. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like the money for the cities.    The cheque never gets sent. That is the problem with all these announcements. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister talked about the day care provisions. We do not agree with what they are doing.  I suppose the great thing about opposing it is that nothing ever happens.  I was   asked in the 2004 election what I thought  about the Liberal day care proposal and    I said that   about the same as I thought about the last three or four times the Liberals put it in their platform.  More money for day care goes back to 1993.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> 1988.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Rob Nicholson:</b> Does it go back to 1988?  I stand corrected. The Liberals started promising more money in 1988 and  thank goodness  they did not form the government that year.  However it was certainly part of their platform in 1993 and again  in 1997, 2000 and 2004.  Has anybody ever seen a dime?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only expense has been  setting up the press conferences and putting out the coffee and cookies for these announcements.  The only thing  we get are announcements on  day care and other things. </p><A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1305)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals say that they are moving ahead on these things and then   we wait and wait.  They get buried somewhere and become part of the Liberal platform for the next election. They will  have their hands full because they have a lot of explaining to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things I want to  hear them explain, which  I did not hear   earlier when I raised this matter, is the whole question of organization in the Liberal Party with respect to the elections in the province of Quebec.  This is one of the most disgraceful things that has come to light in our democracy in a long time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. members   complain and say that  they want to wait for Mr. Justice Gomery's report.  I want to tell the House that it is  not members of the Conservative Party or  the New Democratic Party making these accusations.  What is fascinating about this is that it is   the Liberals own organizers who  are making the allegations on all of these things.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that has become very clear in all of this is the corruption that exists within the Liberal Party and specifically how it conducted the election campaign in the province of Quebec. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say what is very disappointing about this.  I have been involved in public life in this country for many years. People have said to me that it was too bad   my party did not do better in Quebec.  They would ask me why we did not elect some candidates in Quebec because it  would help our party.     I   agreed with them.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after hearing the testimony that came out this past week, I have to ask what chance honest candidates in the Conservative Party have in running when the fix is in. We  would be running against a corrupt political machine.  The Liberals  can bleat, they can blare, they can cough and  they can yell  but they cannot get away from it.  The Liberals have  put together a corrupt political machine and that is a disgrace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister says that he  wants the election in eight months.  The Bloc Québécois and the NDP have already voted for an election.  It has only been the Conservative Party that has not made a move on this.   The Liberals want the election  in the middle of winter  in the middle of a snow storm.  They would like to have it on another planet, no doubt about that.  Somewhere else, some other time, is what the Liberals want.  They have already told Canadians that they want the election.  Members of the New Democratic Party and the Bloc have already voted against the government.  They have made it plain that they want an election.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However when the election does come we will be very vigilant.     The same tricks, the corruption, the misused money, the cash under the table, the cash on top of the table, those kinds  of things will not work again. Our honest candidates from coast to coast will be carrying  the message that this country is greater than the Liberal Party and all of its corruption.  We will prevail I am quite sure of that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to emphasize that this is sworn testimony, not just members of the opposition coming up with this.  It is their own members, their own organizers, their own activists who have taken an oath. This is all in public.  They can laugh  but Canadians will have  the last laugh on those people, and it may come sooner as opposed to later.</p><A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1310)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1247818"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247807"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

It is in the budget. It is before the House at this very moment.  </p>

Would they rather have a plan by a new government, a Conservative government, where they might actually see some improvement in their financial situation or would they prefer another decade of promises from the Liberals? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a feeling that I know the answer.  The hon. Minister of Finance talks about the minister of finance from Ontario.    I can tell the minister what Mr. McGuinty, the premier of Ontario, says.  He says Ontario has not been getting a fair deal from this government. He says this government is out of touch and, in particular, the Prime Minister is “out of touch” with the electorate of Ontario. That is not a Conservative talking.   That is not a  New Democratic.  That is not somebody else; that is a member of his own party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the problem the Liberals have.  The Liberal premier of Ontario is unhappy with what this Liberal government has done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the minister not take Mr. McGuinty up on his offer to meet and talk about this?  This province of Ontario is a great province.  I am very proud to be one of Ontario's members here and it concerns me when I see the comments of the premier of Ontario in which he says how out of touch this Prime Minister is.  Members can check it out.  It was right there on the front page of the <i>Toronto Star</i>.  I am not the one making it up.  The <i>Toronto Star</i> has taken these comments by the premier of Ontario  and I find it very unfortunate.</p>

When we put something on the table, they will know they can count on it. They will not be waiting for years checking their mail every day to see whether anything arrives. That is what has been most unfair about this government.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the members of the Liberal Party.  Their strategists are somewhere saying, “Let's cook this up one more time.  Let's trot it out for another election campaign”.  But it did not sell very well last year and I do not think it is going to sell in the next election.</p><A NAME="Int-1247826"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247828"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247824"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Bryon Wilfert (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe that the member, who was part of the Mulroney fiasco  for 10 years, could stand up and say that.  As a former president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, I know that the government under Mulroney did nothing for infrastructure, nothing. The member says they will put in a new plan.  If it is like the old plan, it will be nothing.  The cupboard will be bare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That member and his party have never, ever supported cities and communities in Canada.  We have had numerous infrastructure programs.  In fact, this government, and I would take it to the people, has done more for communities and cities than any government in history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask the member this. What new plan does he have given the fact that his party voted against the gas tax and the fact that his party has never supported infrastructure? How can he stand up and say such nonsense to Canadians with a straight face ?</p><A NAME="Int-1247828"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247826"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Rob Nicholson: </b>Mr. Speaker, I can say a couple of things. One of the things I want to say to the member is that despite all the noise we have heard this afternoon in the House of Commons, I would ask the hon. member this: where is last year's budget?  The Liberals are still not through the last budget, never mind the new one for 2005.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is how ridiculous it is.  I would like to submit that as exhibit A that they are not serious about what they are telling the Canadian public.  They do not even have last year's budget passed. Who are they going to blame for that?  Why do they not call their friends down in the other place?  They could ask them to step on it and get it passed, but they have not done that. I think that sums up the whole sorry mess that we are looking at across the aisle.</p><A NAME="Int-1247830"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247833"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247828"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's South—Mount Pearl, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate in what could be a very record-setting debate.  It may be the last sensible debate we have in this place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I get into the gist of my speech and the comments on the speech made by the Minister of Finance, I want to refer to the last speaker from the opposite side. He talked about infrastructure and infrastructure agreements and the lack of involvement by the former Conservative government under Prime Minister Mulroney.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot speak for the hon. member's province of Ontario, but I can speak for my own province of Newfoundland and Labrador. During that time, when I was a member of the provincial government, we had two major funding agreements on infrastructure for the province, very substantive ones, which certainly improved the infrastructure throughout the province, particularly in relation to highways. The last one was back in the 1980s. Since then, we have not had one cent coming to our province by way of major infrastructure agreements with the federal government. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Ralph Goodale:</b> Nonsense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</b> It is true. Check your records. You were the minister. You should know, unless you are like the former minister--</p><A NAME="Int-1247833"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247834"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Speaker: </b>Excuse me.  I have to interrupt. The hon. member should make his comments through the Chair, and we will keep things quiet, I am sure.</p><A NAME="Int-1247834"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247849"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247833"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn: </b>Mr. Speaker, I remind the Minister of Finance that  he should know.  He is the Minister of Finance. But if he is like the former minister of finance, he probably does not know either what is going on in light of his department and the funding that flows through to provinces or to agencies or to friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I note the record will show that the last major infrastructure money that went to Newfoundland and Labrador came from the Mulroney government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, the Minister of Finance would want the people of this country to believe that should his party be put out of power, all the topics that would be covered by the budget, money for seniors, money for cities, money for homelessness, money for child care, would disappear. No one in his right mind would even think that any government, even--I will not say even--the NDP, the Bloc--</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> You said it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</b> If I said it I will leave it on the record. I will not bother to withdraw it.  Anyone worth his or her salt  representing the people of Canada in this House will deliver for the needs of the people of the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an interesting thing about it, and it is why people are more interested now in looking at this side of the House forming the government than in bringing back what they have seen over the last    <i>x</i> number of years.  It is that not only will we put money where it is needed, into seniors, into homelessness, into the veterans, into infrastructure and into municipalities, but we would have more money to put in.  We would not be giving away money to our friends and ad agencies.  We would not be letting other people rip off the people of this country.  We would not be spending $2 billion on the gun registry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at some of the other issues. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> How many Conservative cabinet ministers resigned in disgrace?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</b>  I had a meeting yesterday with representatives of the Canadian Coast Guard and--</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Tell us who they are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</b><i>The Gong Show</i> is playing around me, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday I had a good session with representatives of the Coast Guard.  One of the concerns they had with the budget is that a lot of money has been cut out for the Canadian Coast Guard.  They raised the question of what would happen if the budget does not pass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I had a chance to answer it, they answered it.  They know that the money in the budget for the Coast Guard came strictly as a result of a tremendous report done by the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, a report that forced the government and embarrassed the government into dealing with one of the greatest agencies in this country, particularly now in light of the movement of oil around our coasts, in light of the security needs of this country, in light of the fishing that is going on off our coasts, where, because of mismanagement, more and more fishermen are being forced further and further to sea in small boats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people know that the report was done because of the people on this side of the House, with the support of other good, conscientious members on the other side of the House, and it had nothing to do with government.  They know that we would remember the Coast Guard, as we would remember the cities and as we would remember the seniors.  The records will show that this party over here has stood up more for seniors and more for students who are trying to achieve an education in this country. The record speaks for itself.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members can check the number of times education has been raised in this House and see where it came from. They can check the number of times the word “seniors” has been raised in this House and see where it came from.  It was certainly not from the governing party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for all this bit about the fearmongering, the scare tactics and how unless people vote for the Liberals everything in the budget will be gone, no, not at all, because conscientious people sit in this House of Commons, conscientious people who are here to represent their constituents and who are here to make sure that the people of this country are looked after.</p><A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forget that foolishness about who will do what. It is who will do it better.  That is the question and it is the question the people of Canada will soon get a chance to answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I run out of time, I want to mention two other important topics. One is agriculture. Again, who has been the champion for agriculture in the House? The answer to that is quite clear. The people on this side of the House. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one advantage for the people to my left is when the election is over, if any of them are looking for jobs, there is no doubt about it, it is one of the best comedy shows I have seen in quite some time. They can do very well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue is the Atlantic accord. Last year during the election our party committed to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia that should our party be elected, they would receive 100% of their share of revenues flowing from offshore development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister when he was in St. John's and under great pressure from his candidates made the same commitment to Premier Williams in a phone call at seven o'clock in the morning, after a hard night's pressure.  He said to the Premier that he would accept his offer.  Then he did the same thing in Nova Scotia the day before the election.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We came back to the House and it was like pulling teeth.  We had to beg, borrow and steal to try to get the government to make a commitment.  The premiers had to try to embarrass government to get a  commitment.  In our case in Newfoundland and Labrador, the flags were taken down to create attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Cannis:</b> That  was shameful. No respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</b> People are saying that it was shameful.  It drew attention. There was no disrespect to the flag or country.  It was a sign to the government that it had better pay attention to the provinces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the attitude our provinces faces, the attitude that it is only Newfoundland and Labrador, it is only fish, it is only oil.  Who cares? We do not. We care. We will make sure, when the election is over, that the funds will flow from the agreement that has been signed already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the agreement was signed, we still had to force the government to try to deliver.  It brought in the   bill, part of an omnibus bill, which it knew would not go through the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give one example why the budget bill will be slow in going through. One of the clauses gives the Department of Public Works the right to manipulate all contracts.  If we look at the news today, we see the same department has rented a building for $1 million a month with no one in it just because it is owned by a friend. That is terrible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is so much more to talk about and we will get the chance.</p><A NAME="T1325"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1325)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1247849"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247853"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247834"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed from February 16 consideration of the motion.</p><A NAME="Int-1247862"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247867"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247861"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Lloyd St. Amand (Brant, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to private member's Motion No. 170. I am sure I speak for all of my hon. colleagues when I say that occasionally forget things. We forget the names of former college friends or where we put our glasses or our car keys. This is a normal occurrence that we can honestly say has happened to all of us. However, a person with Alzheimer's disease may forget things that have happened yesterday or an hour ago and soon forget what day, month or year it is. Eventually those affected stop recognizing family members and friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alzheimer's patients have difficulty performing regular tasks, have problems with language, disorientation of time, disorientation of place and have varied mood swings and many more symptoms that are not a normal or typical part of the aging process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in 1906 when Dr. Alzheimer, a German neurologist  and psychiatrist, first discovered Alzheimer's disease. The disease is a progressive, degenerative brain condition with no known cause or cure. Since 1906, many organizations have been created to study, to educate and to offer support for Alzheimer's patients and their families. For example, the Alzheimer Society of Canada was founded in 1978. It has grown and expanded to serve Canadians from coast to coast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education of the early warning signs of any health problem is of great importance to people of all ages. There is a growing influx of Canadians who are showing signs of Alzheimer's and other related dementias, and people are being diagnosed at much earlier ages. With proper consultation and programs, Canadians will be able to recognize the signs of diseases such as Alzheimer's and many others which may affect their daily lives and the lives of their families and friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding of Brant alone, approximately 1,800 residents have been diagnosed or who have shown signs of Alzheimer's or other forms of related dementia. By the year 2021, in Brant the estimated portion of the population over the age of 65 suffering from Alzheimer's or a related dementia will increase by 50% from the year 2000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our high percentage of an aging population, Alzheimer's and dementia are issues that will in time affect all of us. Whether a personal diagnosis or a diagnosed member or friend, our lives will be changed by a disease that will and has become an epidemic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It comes as a great surprise to most individuals when they learn that Alzheimer's disease and dementia are the fourth leading cause of death in our elderly. With proper research facilities and federal, provincial and territorial support  and funding Canadians will be better suited to address issues such as Alzheimer's and many other diseases which may affect us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many educational organizations and groups already exist. I would point to groups such as the Alzheimer Society of Brant, which provides a wide variety of support in my community through support services, counselling, education and training of caregivers and of those affected by Alzheimer's and dementia. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alzheimer Society of Brant has members present in many of our local long term care facilities, in our seniors residences and in our hospitals, but more needs to be done. Individuals such as Vic Prenderjast, president, Janet Lovekin, executive director, and Wanda Dzierzbicki, community development coordinator of the Alzheimer Society of Brant, to name just a few, are present in many of our health facilities training staff and speaking directly to those who are affected by Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these organizations survive through the kindness and generosity of others. It is evident that the need for research, education and community support is a vital part of Alzheimer treatment and care. </p><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1335)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to accomplish significant steps in treating this debilitating disease and many other illnesses which affect the lives of so many, governments, medical professionals, communities and individuals must continue working together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Alzheimer's is a disease that can affect any of us with little or no warning, many other chronic ailments exist. Through a combined strategy and partnership, we as Canadians may one day be able to win the difficult battle against Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia  and the many other diseases that affect our lives.</p>

I congratulate her for thinking of the many people with this terrible disease, particularly at a time when the Canadian population is ageing. It is really an honour for me to have this opportunity to speak about this terrible disease in relation to my colleague's motion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Outaouais region, the Alzheimer  society is a very dynamic organization.  I have been involved with a number of their activities over the years.  We all have people in our family or family friends  who are struggling with this terrible disease.  There is nothing worse than losing one's own memory, or realizing that a loved one no longer remembers who we are.  We have all had to cope with such experiences, which is why this motion is so important.  It is wholly justified, given the number of people in Canada affected by Alzheimer's. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to salute all those who work in the background. We are coming to the end of volunteer week, so I would like to take this opportunity to salute, among others, Alain Tremblay of the Société Alzheimer de l'Outaouais, Robert Courchesne and Yolande Gravel.  I could never manage to name all those who give of themselves day after day,   including those who raise funds for Maison Fleur-Ange, which is already no longer able to meet the need.  That is why I am so pleased to be able to support my colleague's motion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage my colleagues in the House to work together on this, as we did for hepatitis  C.  Times like this are what make me proud to be a member of this 38th Parliament.  There have been plenty of times when we have been less proud, for example when we see the kinds of games that go on here. In the case of the motion on hepatitis C, however, and this motion my  colleague, as well as many other instances, it is interesting to see how what we do as MPs can impact on the everyday lives of those who have sent us here to represent them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what I wanted to say today about this motion. I will be pleased to support it.  I really encourage everyone to follow suit, because this dreadful disease and  related dementias must be addressed. That is why the motion deserves our support. </p><A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alzheimer's disease is a brain disorder that affects thinking, memory and understanding. It creates changes in personality, mood and behaviour.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alzheimer's is the most common form of a group of degenerative brain diseases known as dementia. Other forms include Pick's disease, Creutzfeldt Jakob disease, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia and primary progressive aphasia, among others. Although these illnesses affect other parts of the brain, most of the symptoms resemble those of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several changes occur in the brain of a person with Alzheimer's disease.  The brain cells shrink or disappear and are replaced by dense, irregularly shaped spots or plaques.  Another indicator of the disease is thread-like tangles within existing brain cells.  These tangles eventually choke healthy brain cells. A person with Alzheimer's disease has less brain tissue than a person who does not have the disease.  This shrinkage will continue over time, affecting how the brain functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Alzheimer's disease affects each area of the brain, certain functions or abilities are lost.  This results in specific symptoms or changes in behaviour.  People who have the disease gradually lose their independence, becoming  incapable by degrees of performing simple tasks, remembering recent events, controlling thoughts or moods  or relating to others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually people with Alzheimer's disease can no longer remember the names of family and friends or find their way around in places that are not completely familiar.  They may avoid social contacts because they cannot follow the drift of a conversation.  At this stage, many people can still live well using simple routines in a familiar environment but they may experience a sense of powerlessness and frustration that can lead to emotional turmoil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hundred and sixty-four thousand Canadians aged 65 and older have dementia, with Alzheimer's disease representing about two-thirds of all dementia cases.  It is estimated that by 2031 this number will increase to 778,000 cases.  In B.C., over 50,000 people have dementia with that number expected to nearly double by 2031.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least 1 in 12 people aged 65 or older have Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia.  The rates of Alzheimer's increases with age: 1% of people aged 65 to 74; 7% of people aged 75 to 85; and 26% of people aged 85 and older.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alzheimer's disease and related dementia cannot be cured, reversed or stopped in their  progression.  Today's treatments, which may include medications, are designed to reduce the symptoms and help both the patient and the family live through the course of the illness with greater dignity and less discomfort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians spend about $3.9 billion each year for the treatment of persons with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.</p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1345)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantages of a coordinated, national approach to addressing Alzheimer's disease, in fact any disease for that matter that afflicts a large number of Canadians across the country, are huge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A broad based national approach to disease achieves economies of scale not possible with several different plans running in parallel or at cross-purposes. With national coordination, redundancies and duplication can be eliminated, freeing resources to be shifted elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, with national coordination, best practice  guidelines for consistency and equity of care across Canada can be developed. This is a system that has  worked well in Europe for cancer care.  Various autonomous jurisdictions, through a system that transparently reveals what practices they follow and to compare with others, are inclined to adopt best practices. Working together and sharing information has led to improved care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A national strategy would also allow stakeholder engagement and coordination among stakeholders to be maximized. Major diseases require a sustained platform that will provide focused and ongoing attention. It is not enough to commit to an ambitious program and  then lose enthusiasm in a couple of years. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a national strategy will help establish a platform. Why now? There are several reasons why the time is right for national disease strategies now. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, our population is aging. As I stated earlier, unless something is done, we are  looking at the number of cases of Alzheimer's going up threefold in the next 25 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, due to recent scientific breakthroughs, many new efficiencies and effective treatments have become closer to reality. A national strategy would increase the likelihood of a breakthrough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there is a growing momentum to develop national strategies for a variety of diseases. We need to take advantage now of this growing momentum. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, any strategy must respect provincial jurisdiction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian strategy for cancer control provides a perfect example of how a national coordinating effort can focus resources and efforts while allowing the provinces, the regions and the communities the freedom to apply shared knowledge in a way   best suited  to their individual needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada urgently needs a national strategy on Alzheimer's and related dementias. This  is our best hope for developing new medicines to help those with the disease and to ultimately find a cure. Unless we invest in Alzheimer's research now, the disease will become a bigger and bigger drain on a health care system that is already at the breaking point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the population of seniors is increasing in Canada and so are their  health care needs because of the diseases that  are directly related to old age. Now is the time for us to  do something about it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year will mark the 100th anniversary of the naming of the disease by  Dr. Alois Alzheimer. This is the right time to focus our resources on the diseases that  are particularly related to old age and our growing population of seniors. I hope  we will be able to mark the occasion of the 100th anniversary with a national strategy on Alzheimer's and related dementias, as proposed by Motion No.  170.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion strongly and I urge all members to support the motion.  </p><A NAME="Int-1247891"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247908"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247874"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am delighted this afternoon to have an opportunity to speak on the motion that is before us, and to indicate my personal support and that of my caucus for Motion No. 170 that addresses the desperate need for a national strategy on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am delighted to have an opportunity to do so because there are a number of things that need to be said if we are serious about making this Parliament work.  This is very practical and concrete. It is something that would make an enormous difference in the short, medium and long term for those who are now struggling with Alzheimer's disease. It will also assist support workers who are helping families deal with the disease and over the longer term for those who are working very hard on research to find a cure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something about which I have a great deal of personal experience. My dad died of Alzheimer's disease.  It was a great sadness to me. I was born in Ottawa and my father worked on the Hill as the first researcher of the CCF, the forerunner to the New Democratic Party.  We moved back to Nova Scotia and lived there. He passed away just before I became the federal leader of the New Democratic Party.  Had he still been alive, sadly, he would not have understood what that meant.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a devastating disease that literally wipes out memory and cognitive abilities.  He was aphasic, could not speak and  was immobilized in a wheelchair in his latter days.  He was fiercely devoted to health promotion and prevention. Just as tens of thousands, in fact hundreds of thousands of people who have been struggling with this disease and lost the fight against Alzheimer's, the latter days of his life were very difficult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That experience makes me very supportive of the cry for a national strategy for Alzheimer's disease.  I want to pay credit to the member for Thornhill who introduced this motion, as well as to the health critic of the New Democratic Party who is very supportive.  We know this is the kind of issue that simply cannot fall prey to divisions of any kind among members of the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very proud of the research that is being done by an outstanding medical research team in Nova Scotia associated with Dalhousie University.  They are doing superb research while also offering amazing teaching to health professionals and support workers who are constantly learning about how best to support patients and families who are dealing with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Nova Scotia Alzheimer's Society, like similar societies right across the country that have been doing yeoman service with totally inadequate resources,  held a breakfast fundraiser, but probably more important than the fundraising potential of that particular event was the community education that was offered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I looked at the program, I groaned and thought, “Good heavens, over breakfast we are going to hear six speeches from six medical researchers and we are going to be here all day”.  This was an event chaired by Bill Carr, a close friend and colleague, who is the official spokesperson for the Alzheimer Society of Canada, and speaks with enormous passion to the challenges of dealing with Alzheimer's and does it with the most endearing humour that I have never known.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be hard for people to imagine.  Maybe one has to struggle with Alzheimer's in one's family or someone near and dear to understand why humour is such an important part of the tool kit needed to deal with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a very humourous introduction, Mr. Carr was a very tight MC who allowed each of six speakers three minutes each.  Mr. Speaker, you would have been impressed with six speakers who could speak for no more than three minutes each and in that time allotment give us an  amazingly clear glimpse of the important research that is being done.</p><A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1350)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it were not for the Alzheimer's Society working to drive this agenda all the time, if it were not for the National Advisory Council on Aging and the many others in the broad human services field who have worked together, families struggling with Alzheimer's and Alzheimer's patients today would not be living with improved quality. There have been important breakthroughs in terms of drugs.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things about a national strategy is the importance of our having a national pharmaceutical program, a national drug program. As it exists today, shamefully, there are five provinces in this country  that do not make those drugs available under existing drug programs.  That is one of the many reasons we need a national strategy.   We need a national strategy  that deals with the education in the sensitization not just of decisions but all health care workers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have personal knowledge of how devastating it is for a family to have the spouse of someone struggling with Alzheimer's go to the family doctor and say, “I really feel there is increasing evidence that my spouse has Alzheimer's”, and have the doctor say, “Well, why do you want me to try to diagnose it?  Because you can't really do anything about it anyway.  Just live with it”.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was probably the single most devastating thing that my mother had to live with in the early stages of my father's Alzheimer's.  Yet, it is the person, the loved one, the family member closest to the Alzheimer's patient who always can see, usually before the evident memory loss, mood changes, behavioural changes, uncharacteristic outbursts of difficult behaviour, irritability and unreasonableness.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ensure that   the educational support is there and is assured across the country.  It is not episodic or accidental as to whether every single person working in the health care system, in human services, has that kind of education that allows them to be part of early detection as well as providing the kind of care needed. We need to address the compassionate care leave inadequacy in the current legislation that the government has brought in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Sackville—Eastern Shore must take a huge amount of credit for pressing  this issue to ensure that there is a way in which a family member dealing with a victim of   a debilitating disease and nearing death can be supported in terms of being able to take leave from a job, for example, if that is what is required and have some income replacement.  However,  what the government has done is totally inadequate in that regard.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the member for Sackville--Eastern shore has already tried to press the government further to deal with the virtual abandonment of the promise and the commitment made.  The government has made the eligibility so restrictive that there are family members who want  and are able to devote themselves to the care of a victim and a dying family member, but who are outside the narrow definition of what family members can qualify.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the narrow time of six weeks compassionate care does not come anywhere close to addressing the realistic needs of families. We are talking about the dying days of Alzheimer's patients and about the whole range of debilitating diseases that are resulting in death, and where that compassionate care is desperately needed. If we want to make this Parliament work and impress upon Canadians that we are serious, we will deal with the inadequacy of that compassionate care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, home care was promised in 1993 by this government and  in every election since. We still do not have what is remotely adequate in the way of a national home care system.  It needs to be part of the national strategy.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are pleased to support this motion.  We hope we can cooperate  with early passage to send a clear signal to the government that it needs to get on with dealing with this matter.</p><A NAME="T1355"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1355)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1247908"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247914"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247891"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Merv Tweed (Brandon—Souris, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Motion No. 170.    I  too want to congratulate  the member for Thornhill for bringing the motion to the House today  and accepting the amendments. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to understand that when a motion gets to this position where we seem to have agreement from all members of the House,  a lot of the national strategy that will  be discussed and   developed over a period of time will deal with some of the issues raised by   some of the members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member should be commended for the fact that it reached the House with agreement from all parties and we are able to speak to  it today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  is a national issue and it is an issue that affects all people of Canada. It does matter where one lives, be it in Canada,   in North America or  around the world, it has an impact on  every family. There used to be a saying, “you never really understand something until it impacts you or your family personally”, and we are at that point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the opportunity to experience this, not only first-hand in family issues, but with friends and family of friends. I have seen the struggles that families go through to not only understand the issue  but to accept it and  deal with it. I have seen parents and    brothers and sisters who really anguish over the fact that a member of their family, who they have known all their life, has suddenly become someone else and, through no fault of their own, can do nothing to bring back these family members  to what they   once were. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is devastating to the family and it does create hardships. The fact that we are identifying it as a national issue and prepared to discuss it will help everyone  understand it better and  to get a better comprehension of what we can do currently and what is available to us, but also what will be out there in the future in order to make the lives of the people afflicted by this disease, not just the individuals, but the families of these individuals and how we might develop a long term plan to help meet their needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local organizations in my communities have brought me up to speed on this issue and made me very aware of it. I told them that if I had the opportunity to present on this motion, which they were certainly aware was in the system and being discussed, that I would  raise the voice of the people that I represent and hopefully create an interest in all Canadians as to what we can do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to go on forever but I do want to suggest that one of the  benefits in talking to this motion today is that  we are looking at coordinating a national approach. So many times in health care, provincial governments and  provincial bodies move forward on specific issues of health care and, unfortunately, we forget to share the benefits or the good things that we are developing within our system. Therefore  we get people moving or provinces moving ahead in some areas and others fighting to catch up. By sharing the information and by working together with a national strategy, I believe we will see the understanding and the development of solutions, or at least the care   and the opportunities that will be offered to people will be enhanced greatly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be remiss if I did not suggest  that by doing this we will  create an economy of scale that  will  allow more money to be applied within the system as opposed to within the bureaucracy and the management of the system. Whenever we can eliminate the duplications and share the information, we can save a lot of steps and it frees resources to deal with the issue in many other ways. Also,   from my own experience dealing with health in other provinces and  sharing those good ideas is  of benefit to  everyone.</p><A NAME="T1400"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1400"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1400)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians will benefit from the system once it is finalized. This is not just limited to Canada. It allows us to discuss the issue,  the solutions and what is being done not only in Canada but in other countries. It certainly helps us  in creating a national strategy to develop a platform to provide  this service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to the motion going forward.  Members on this side have said that they will be supporting it.  I will certainly be supporting it. I encourage other members of the House to support it. It is a good motion and  Canadians will be very proud when it is finally realized. The families and the people impacted by this disease will be very thankful that the national government and their members of   Parliament see that and have worked together to make this happen.</p><A NAME="T1405"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1405"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1405)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1247914"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247916"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247908"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Susan Kadis (Thornhill, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased  to encourage all hon. members of the House to support my motion to include Alzheimer's disease and related dementias as a significant integral component in the existing chronic disease strategy. Other chronic diseases currently within this initiative may likely share some common preventive measures which may prove mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to recognize and pay high tribute to all the families, caregivers, volunteers, often unpaid, and health care professionals who work tirelessly to provide those with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias the dignity and the caring environment they deserve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our population rapidly ages, a significant number  of the Canadian population is and will be affected by this catastrophic disease directly and indirectly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to thank all hon. members who have spoken passionately in support of this important issue They  have shared their own experiences in their ridings and in their families with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that by taking this important step forward today we will build steadfastly on the progress that is being made. With the convergence of two realities,  the increase of incidence of Alzheimer's disease and the possibility of an extended delay and hopefully a cure within our grasp, action now is undeniably the right thing to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians will gain more needed knowledge, share best practices and enhance the potential for greater availability and options of care. Supporting this motion today will be a recognition that we do embrace this challenge, that we will fight vigorously in the name of all our courageous loved ones who have been taken from us as a result of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and for all those who will hopefully never ever have to experience this devastating disease.</p><A NAME="Int-1247916"></A><a HREF="#Int-1247918"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1247914"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Speaker: </b>The question is on the amended motion.
