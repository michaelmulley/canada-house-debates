	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, according to Standing Order 29(4) whenever the Speaker 
adjourns the House for want of a quorum, the time of adjournment 
and the names of the members then present shall be inserted in the 
<I>Journals</I>.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I was present yet my name was not recorded. I 
signed the sheet.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member signed the sheet and 
there is a mistake. It will be checked out and if somehow it has 
been lost, his name will be added in the journals branch, so he need 
not worry about that.
<P>
	I thank you for bringing it to the attention of the House.

	The House resumed from October 19 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-107, an act respecting the establishment of the 
British Columbia Treaty Commission, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Labour had the floor. The hon. member for Surrey 
North has the floor for 40 minutes on behalf of her party.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on September 21, 1992 the federal government, the British 
Columbia provincial government and the summit, which is a group 
representing aboriginal groups involved in this matter, reached an 
agreement to establish a commission called the British Columbia 
Treaty Commission. It would aid in the treaty negotiation process 
by assisting the groups involved to become fully prepared for their 
role in this process.
<P>
	In other words, the commission itself would not be directly 
involved in the actual negotiations but would ensure those persons 
who would be at the negotiation table would have arrived there 
fully prepared with all the <I>i</I>'s dotted and the <I>t</I>'s crossed. I am 
assuming the objective of this approach, i.e. the creation of a 
commission to facilitate, is to speed up the negotiating process and 
to ensure all parties are fully informed as to the nature and intent of 
the negotiating dialogue.
<P>
	The September 21, 1992 agreement committed the three 
principals involved to establish this treaty commission via statutes 
in the case of the governments and a resolution in the case of the 
summit. This agreement also addressed the B.C. Treaty 
Commission's organization such as the membership, the terms of 
office, the location of the office, the quorum, the funding 
arrangements at least for the first five years, and so on. The 
agreement also identified the commission's mandates and its 
parameters.
<P>
	It was all there on September 21, 1992. Very early in May, 1993, 
less than one year later, the summit passed its resolution. Later that 
same month the B.C. legislature also passed its enabling 
legislation. However, here in October 1995, almost two and 
one-half to three years later, we are debating Bill C-107 which is 
the bill respecting the establishment of the B.C. Treaty 
Commission.
<P>
	There has been an awareness of this need for legislation for some 
time, actually one year and three months since September. One can 
ask why this government is taking so long, since January 1994 for 
example when Parliament opened here, to carry out its obligations 
on this process.
<P>
	The commission does exist but because of the delay in the 
passing of legislation here to establish it, it has been functioning 
informally. The fact that the commission has been functioning in 
our immediate past provides us here today with an insight as to the 
possible effectiveness of its role in the whole negotiating process to 
date.
<P>
	For example, we have had some difficulties. In British Columbia 
six blockades were erected by the natives in the past year. One was 
a blockade on a road for private residences on Adams Lake near 
Kamloops that ran through an Indian reserve. Not far away was a 
two-week blockade disrupting business this spring at the Douglas 
Lake ranch after the ranch had asked natives to stop net fishing on a 
lake that was privately stocked by the ranch.  Only the delicate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15630"> 15630 </A></B>
<P>
negotiations of the RCMP kept the peace and brought that blockade 
down.
<P>
	A third blockade was outside Penticton. Three native bands 
disrupted last winter's season for the Apex ski resort with their 
so-called checkpoints on the access road that ran through the 
reserve.
<P>
	Early this summer the province shelled out millions to a 
developer to buy waterfront property on Vancouver Island which 
was later discovered to be another burial ground. This triggered 
another obstruction.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	Then in northern B.C. the Gitksan Indians, who are well into 
negotiating land claims, erected blockades to frustrate forestry 
operations on the land they wish to claim. Number six was 
Gustafsen Lake. The owners of the cattle ranch company at 
Gustafsen Lake were victimized by renegades who had no direct 
association with the North Shuswap Band.
<P>
	These behaviour patterns are not condoned and they are certainly 
not conducive toward achieving a constructive negotiating process. 
They are occurring regardless of the negotiations today and 
regardless of the commission's activity to date. Be it legal or 
illegal, behaviour patterns are occurring suggesting that one, there 
is a frustration with the whole process, possibly partially due to 
delays such as the one we are experiencing today; and two, that the 
present approach of the negotiations is not effective or at least not 
as effective as it should be.
<P>
	In addressing the slowdowns or the delays, it is quite obvious in 
British Columbia how long the land negotiations have been 
dragging on. We can see that right across the country. Negotiations 
on the Nisga'a claim have carried on for some 23 years.
<P>
	As negotiations proceeded into the 29th Parliament, which was 
1972-74, the current Prime Minister was then the minister of Indian 
affairs. Negotiations continued on through the 30th Parliament of 
1974-79 and again our Prime Minister was present. Negotiations 
marched on through the 31st Parliament of 1979-84 and our Prime 
Minister was there as well. As negotiations sped along during the 
32nd and 33rd Parliaments of 1984-88 and 1988-93 respectively, 
our Prime Minister was in the opposition, except for a very brief 
period of time.
<P>
	Now the Prime Minister has held a large majority in the 35th 
Parliament since October 1993 and here we are over two years later 
creating a commission to facilitate discussions between 
aboriginals, the B.C. government and the federal government. I 
wonder, will the right thing be done now on the treaty negotiations?
<P>
	The second suggestion I mentioned earlier arises from the 
various behavioural signals we are getting, that is, the possibility 
that the present approach for constructive negotiating is not 
effective or is not as effective as it  should be. As I stated earlier, 
the commission is functioning in its facilitating role. Therefore, it 
should be preparing the parties involved for effective participation 
in the negotiating process.
<P>
	Possibly it is this preparation aspect which may be the weakness 
in achieving the effective results for all those involved or for all 
those affected by the decisions which are being reached. Possibly 
the present method which we are using to prepare for these 
negotiations should be reviewed. We strongly recommend that the 
commission review this situation and insist that the parties 
involved listen to the concerns of both aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal peoples at the grassroots level and formulate their 
negotiating position with input from that source.
<P>
	In our discussions with people at the grassroots level we found a 
common concern for jobs, public safety, health, racism, education, 
et cetera. We also found a common lack of understanding of the 
land claims and the self-government demands. We further found 
that there was a common mistrust of the federal department of 
Indian affairs and of politicians.
<P>
	We recommend that the commission also promote the need for 
creating or establishing a fundamental change in the relationships 
between the aboriginals and governments, with less dependency on 
the federal government and more democratic control by the 
aboriginals over aboriginal governments. Our aim is to give 
aboriginals more responsibility for their own well-being, the tools 
to discharge that responsibility and more accountability for the 
results.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	We strongly recommend that the commission prepare the parties 
involved to achieve that objective by incorporating the following 
principles into the agreements while they are at the negotiating 
table.
<P>
	First, the development of democratic, accountable and 
responsible local governments on the reserves should be supported 
and subject to the laws of Canada and the provinces. Members will 
recall during the constitutional wranglings of the Mulroney 
government that aboriginal women were very concerned about 
protection of their individual fundamental rights and freedoms.
<P>
	Second, aboriginal people on reserves should have access to the 
services of Elections Canada to guarantee democratic process is 
respected in band council elections and access to the services of the 
auditor general to maintain the fiscal accountability of local 
governments. We have been approached by band members who are 
very unhappy with what they view as this huge process in band 
elections and what they allege to be the misuse of band funds.
<P>
	Third, land settlement processes should be not only fair, 
affordable and final but publicly negotiated and open to all the 
affected 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15631"> 15631 </A></B>
<P>
interests. The negotiations that  led to Bills C-33 and C-34, being 
rushed through the House, were not publicly conducted.
<P>
	Fourth, individual aboriginals should be able to opt for private 
ownership of a share of any land entitlement and the property rights 
and reserves should be expanded and respected. Presently 
aboriginal farmers have difficulty getting operating loans for each 
crop year because they do not hold title. A newly formed aboriginal 
association, the First Nations Agriculture Association of Alberta 
wants to address this and other related issues.
<P>
	Fifth, aboriginals living on reserves should be able to receive 
federal financial transfers directly as other Canadians do rather 
than from a band council.
<P>
	Sixth, direct federal funding of aboriginal political associations 
should end, allowing the aboriginals to decide which organizations 
they will support financially or otherwise. Why should anyone 
have to support something whose aims do not agree with his or 
hers?
<P>
	Seventh, special tax exemptions for aboriginals provided for 
under the Indian Act should be rescinded and aboriginal 
individuals and companies should be subject to the same taxation 
laws as all Canadians. This would do much to counteract 
resentment and would give the aboriginals a stake in what happens 
in the federal government.
<P>
	Eighth, existing treaties should be honoured in accordance with 
court interpretation and laws enacted by aboriginal governments 
should conform to the laws of Canada. Another point the 
commission could prepare the parties for discussing is Canadian 
law, including the Criminal Code. Laws should be enforced 
uniformly across the country regardless of race, language or culture 
of the victims or perpetrators of the crime.
<P>
	In the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
policy guide on self-government listed among: ``The subject matter 
where there are no compelling reasons for aboriginal governments 
or institutions to exercise law-making authority'' are: 
``maintenance of the national law and order and substantive 
criminal law including offences and penalties under the Criminal 
Code and other criminal laws, emergencies and the peace, order 
and good government power''. That was page 7. We hope the 
minister will follow through on this commitment to universal 
application and enforcement of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	A ninth principle for consideration at the table would be regional 
conventions of aboriginal representatives elected by aboriginals to 
discuss particular application of the principles of self-government. 
The commission can achieve the objective of giving aboriginals 
more responsibility for their own well-being and the tools to 
discharge that responsibility plus more accountability for the 
results by preparing the parties involved to negotiate the previously 
mentioned principles at the table.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	Regarding the whole concept of treaty negotiations not 
specifically in the negotiating component, in British Columbia 
another concern comes to mind at this time. Article 13 of the 
British Columbia Terms of Union is: ``The charge of the Indians, 
and the trusteeship and management of lands reserved for their use 
and benefit shall be assumed by the dominion government''.
<P>
	The document goes on to say: ``To carry out such policy, tracts of 
land of such extent as it has hitherto been the practice of the British 
Columbia government to appropriate for that purpose, shall from 
time to time be conveyed by the local government to the dominion 
government in trust for the use and benefit of Indians on 
application of the dominion government''.
<P>
	By order in council P.C. 1265, dated July 19, 1924, the federal 
government formally acknowledged that B.C. had satisfied all the 
obligations of article 13 respecting the furnishing of lands for 
Indian reserves and had described the process as: ``full and final 
settlement of all differences between the government of the 
dominion and the provinces''.
<P>
	One tends to think that would imply the negotiating aspect, as far 
as British Columbia is concerned, has been completed. However, 
here we are negotiating treaty settlements in British Columbia with 
British Columbia aboriginal groups which according to a release 
from British Columbia's aboriginal affairs minister will cost 
taxpayers some $10 billion.
<P>
	In studying Bill C-107, I became concerned about some of the 
clauses. The first concern is there are several money spending 
clauses. For example, clause 6(3) assumes the commission has 
been functioning informally already, that any transactions which 
occurred previous to this will be assumed by the commission once 
this bill passes.
<P>
	Clause 9 is remuneration and other terms and conditions of 
appointment of the commissioners. Here we are possibly talking 
about salaries or expenses, et cetera.
<P>
	Clause 16 is a money clause which illustrates that the federal 
government will assume the financial responsibility of any claims 
or damages that the commission may incur. But it is directly related 
to the proportion of their original funding.
<P>
	Clause 17 allows the commission to hire persons to assist it. In 
clause 5 allowances are made for the commission to have moneys 
to enable aboriginal groups to participate in the negotiations. 
Further to that, in clause 5(3)(c), should a dispute arise, money will 
be provided for the parties to prepare themselves to resolve the 
dispute.
<P>
	Those money clauses are included in the bill. The agreement of 
September 1992 identifies a cost sharing  program between the 
federal and provincial governments. It only addresses this issue for 
the first five years of the activities of the commission. No apparent 
indication is made of what occurs in the sixth year or thereafter and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15632"> 15632 </A></B>
<P>
no date is available in the whole process to say how long these 
negotiations in British Columbia will continue.
<P>
	On the money concept a clause states that an annual budget will 
be presented to the principals. Considering all these points, 
auditing is essential. Clause 20 does address the audit situation, but 
it says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The accounts and financial transactions of the Commission shall be audited 
annually-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	That's good.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-by a qualified independent auditor designated by the Commission, and a report 
of the audit shall be made to the Commission.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It does not go any further than that. Considering that a portion of 
this is federal funding, it seems very logical to me that auditing of 
the federal funding portion at least should be done by the auditor 
general.
<P>
	Clauses 18 and 22 are of concern as well. Clause 18 says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Commission may make by-laws consistent with this Act and the 
Agreement-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The agreement in this case means the agreement of September 
21, 1992.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Commission may make by-laws consistent with this Act and the 
Agreement respecting the carrying out of the work-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That in itself is all right. Clause 22 says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nothing in this Act shall be interpreted as preventing the principals from 
amending the Agreement from time to time.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the September 21 agreement. I find that quite difficult 
from the point of view the whole bill is the agreement of September 
21, 1992. Therefore, if the principals are going to go back and 
change this agreement after the legislation has been passed, it is a 
logical follow through that the bill should be amended to 
incorporate the changes the principals have made to the initial 
agreement.
<P>
	We offer qualified support to the establishment of the B.C. treaty 
commission and to Bill C-107. We are a little after the fact, but 
nevertheless we hope any discussions facilitated by the 
commission would include our recommendations which, as I said, 
come from the grassroots, both native and non-native.
<P>
	The concerns of aboriginal people are Canadian concerns. They 
are concerned about jobs, personal safety, social service, control 
over their own government just like the rest of us are. We need to 
give aboriginals the same rights and responsibilities for meeting 
those  concerns as other Canadians enjoy-they may not enjoy 
them-but as other Canadians have.
<P>
	We believe aboriginals will welcome the chance to free 
themselves from the paternalism of the department of Indian 
affairs, to assert a more genuine, democratic control over their own 
affairs and to realize brighter futures for themselves and for their 
children and their grandchildren.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in my place today 
to join the debate on second reading of Bill C-107. The 
Government of Canada has maintained that providing justice and 
equity for aboriginal peoples requires two ingredients, 
self-government and the process of making modern day treaties 
through comprehensive claims.
<P>
	Canadians have been wrestling with these issues for years. The 
Reform Party, for its part, has used the self-government issue to fan 
the flames of fear and apprehension during the debates over the 
Charlottetown accord and now it continues to stir up controversy in 
British Columbia through its misrepresentation of the treaty 
process.
<P>
	I have heard hon. members opposite make a great deal of the 
media reports of the total First Nations' claims adding up to 110 
per cent of the province. That total should not surprise us. Why 
should not the claims overlap one another? The First Nations have 
shared the land and its resources for centuries. They have migrated 
and tapped the resources of different locales at different times.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	They have been asked as part of the treaty making process to 
describe the geographic area of the First Nations' traditional 
territory in British Columbia. They provided a map of the 
traditional areas of their ancestors which depicts a territory that a 
nation occupied historically. These maps are used to provide 
negotiators with a general idea of what area of land is under 
question, which is part of stage one of the process, the statement of 
intent.
<P>
	A statement of intent is not a settlement. A claim is not a treaty. 
A treaty is a result of negotiations and the negotiations are just 
beginning. The claims are but the start of the bargaining position. 
No first nation would expect to receive the entire region described 
in its statement of intent. The First Nations do not expect fee 
simple title to the entire province.
<P>
	When two First Nations have overlapping traditional claims they 
will settle the matter as the negotiations proceed. The federal and 
provincial governments do not participate in negotiating an 
overlapping settlement. However, several of the members across 
the floor, members who ought to know better, have been using the 
claims to instil fear among British Columbians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15633"> 15633 </A></B>
<P>
	They infer that these opening positions will lead to lost property 
for third parties across the province. They ask: ``What will become 
of your cottages? What will happen to the jobs in the mining and 
forestry sectors? What will happen to the fisheries?'' They raise 
these fears without adding that the treaty process provides for all 
sectors of British Columbia from cottage owners to the broad 
spectrum of industries to have a voice in the process.
<P>
	They neglect to tell the people at the town hall meetings and on 
the radio talk shows that the Government of Canada consults with a 
treaty negotiations advisory committee representing many of their 
interests. They do not tell people that no negotiation can proceed 
until a regional advisory committee has been created to provide the 
views of British Columbians from that particular part of the 
province who are not at the negotiating table. They do not say any 
of these things.
<P>
	This pattern of misinformation and fear mongering is typical of 
the tactics some members on the other side of the House have used 
to score cheap political points. They have often criticized the 
government for its dedication to the inherent right of 
self-government as a cornerstone of the Government of Canada's 
aboriginal policy.
<P>
	We have said since the beginning, since the red book that 
provided our election platform, that we believe the inherent right to 
self-government to be an existing right within Canada's 
Constitution.
<P>
	Hon. members of the third party have often made the case that no 
one has defined what self-government means. The argument that 
self-government has not been defined has been erected as an 
obstacle to prevent justice from getting through to the aboriginal 
communities across Canada. That argument speaks to the kind of 
meanspirited and narrow minded approach that has thwarted efforts 
to bring justice to aboriginal issues for years. It speaks for the 
tyranny of the status quo. It speaks for the preservation of the 
paternalism of the Indian Act.
<P>
	Is that what Reform members want to uphold? Do they really 
want to impede progress, to impede righting past wrongs, to 
impede certainty, to impede economic stability, to impede job 
creation?
<P>
	We want to make progress. One way we are doing it is by 
acknowledging that the inherent right to self-government is an 
existing right. We are now negotiating with First Nations on how 
that right is to be implemented.
<P>
	No one wants to return to the constitutional debates to 
implement self-government. Self-government arrangements can be 
negotiated with individual communities based upon local culture, 
traditions and needs. That is exactly what we have been doing. That 
is how we are going about the process in British Columbia.
<P>
	I remind the House, especially members of the third party who 
seem to specialize in misinformation and misunderstanding, of the
<P>
six stages that a claim must go through before a treaty comes into 
effect. Hon. members will observe that it is a very thorough 
process.
<P>
	In the first step a first nation files a statement of intent with the 
B.C. Treaty Commission. The commission makes sure that the 
statement is complete and forwards it to the federal and provincial 
governments. It is at this stage that the First Nations describe the 
geographic area in British Columbia that they consider to be their 
traditional territory. Forty-seven statements of intent have been 
filed. They represent over 70 per cent of the aboriginal people of 
British Columbia.
<P>
	The second stage is the commission convenes a meeting to 
prepare for negotiations. All three parties exchange information, 
consider the criteria, discuss the research they will do to prepare for 
negotiations and identify issues of concern. Each party appoints a 
negotiator with a clear mandate. Each party establishes a 
ratification procedure and the parties agree upon the substantive 
and procedural matters that will be negotiated.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	This is the stage at which the Canadian and British Columbia 
governments establish their own mechanisms for consultation with 
non-aboriginal interests. One of the requirements the B.C. Treaty 
Commission imposes on the two governments is the establishment 
of a regional consultative mechanism to represent third party 
interests. It imposes that.
<P>
	When a commission determines that all three parties have met 
the criteria for readiness it confirms that they can proceed to stage 
three. This is where all three parties negotiate a framework 
agreement, a negotiated agenda, and identify the issues to be 
negotiated, the goals of the negotiation process, special procedural 
arrangements and a timetable for negotiations. So far four 
framework agreements have been signed and another three 
initialled by negotiators.
<P>
	It is in the fourth stage of the treaty process that the parties 
negotiate an agreement in principle. These are the substantive 
negotiations. The parties examine the framework in detail.
<P>
	Then the fifth stage is that the principals negotiate to finalize the 
treaty and remaining technical and legal issues are then resolved at 
this stage.
<P>
	The sixth and final stage is the implementation of the treaty. 
Long term implementation plans need to be tailored to specific 
agreements.
<P>
	All commissioners have agreed that significant progress has 
been made in the treaty process. The BCTC process is working. 
The process is fair. It is equitable and it is open. No one denies the 
negotiations ahead will be  tough. Negotiations are tough. All 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15634"> 15634 </A></B>
<P>
negotiations are tough. There are some very complex issues that 
must be brought to the table.
<P>
	It is time we settled these land claims so that all British 
Columbians, aboriginals and non-aboriginals, can get on with the 
job of building a prosperous society in our province, a society 
where all groups can enjoy the wealth, the resources that the 
province has to offer. This will benefit all British Columbians and 
all Canadians.
<P>
	I hope I have said it slowly enough so that the third party across 
the House can understand. It is time.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the government 
talking about dealing with the issue of land claims negotiations 
quickly and resolving the problems.
<P>
	We heard of an Indian settlement area on the west coast that has 
been working for 23 years to resolve these issues. A whole 
generation has spent time negotiating with governments that 
obviously have not come to any sort of agreement. The negotiation 
is still not finished after 23 years.
<P>
	My colleagues and I agree that it is very important to get on with 
the job to settle the land claim issue and to negotiate with the 
aboriginal people. However it is not right for the government to 
hold out unrealistic goals for aboriginal people. It is not fair to the 
aboriginal people to lead them to expect more than what they are 
likely to achieve through the process.
<P>
	I spent 15 years living in an aboriginal community in northern 
Alberta. I spent three years working to prepare non-treaty 
settlement areas for self-government. I know the process. I have 
been through the process and it can be done successfully. However 
they have to be very realistic in their expectations of what 
government and the people will help them to achieve.
<P>
	I do not think this government is any more able than the previous 
government unless it comes into these negotiations with a very 
realistic perspective.
<P>
	I am concerned. I would like to ask a question of the hon. 
member for Vancouver Centre. Why has it taken the government 
over two years to come up with legislation to support the process 
which I feel may work in British Columbia? Why has it taken the 
government two years to address that issue?
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously three parties participate in the 
process: the Government of British Columbia, the Government of 
Canada and the summit. These three parties have to agree on what 
the framework will be to set up the whole treaty organization 
process. That takes a long time.
<P>
	If the hon. member knows anything about negotiations, and she 
just said she did, you would understand also because you talked 
about-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I ask the hon. member to direct her 
remarks to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> The hon. member claimed that she understands 
negotiations. I would think the member would know that setting up 
the intent in an opening position is not what one ends up deciding 
on. Realistic agreements do not come until the process has taken 
place, until people have come to the table and have talked. Then 
they come with a settlement.
<P>
	I do not think the hon. member understands negotiations at all.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
repeat my colleague's question to the member for Vancouver 
Centre. Why did Bill C-107, which recognizes the fact that we have 
B.C. Treaty Commission, take the government two years?
<P>
	I do not want to get into a debate on levels of understanding of 
the process. It did not take the past two years to come to an 
agreement. The agreement was reached on September 21, 1992. In 
May 1993 the summit brought in its resolution. In May 1993 the 
B.C. government passed its resolution. In October 1995 we are 
debating it. Why so long? This is a typical example of the 23 years 
or however long it has taken on these issues. Why did it take two 
years for the government to bring it to the table now?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I really thought I had answered that 
question. However it is obvious I have to repeat it so it is 
understood.
<P>
	Getting three groups together to come to an agreement to write a 
piece of legislation takes time and agreement on every single part 
of the legislation before it can be brought to the table. This is a very 
technical and difficult process. We need to ensure when the 
legislation is done and on the table that everyone can agree to sign 
and can believe and trust it. It takes time to work that ground to 
ensure there is trust and there is agreement on the process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is both a pleasure and an honour to speak to Bill C-107 today. 
The time has come to move forward on the issue. I am reminded of 
a comment made by the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville who, 
unlike his fellow members in the third party, does not realize this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15635"> 15635 </A></B>
<P>
issue of land claims is what we have been talking about for many 
years. I refer to a quote of the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville 
in the Melville <I>Advance</I>: ``Nobody even talked about it for 20 years 
and suddenly we're asking how did this ever come to be''. That is 
quite  unlike the position put forward by his party colleagues who 
just spoke.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	This is a very important bill and it is long overdue. However, the 
understanding should be that we are now at this stage and we 
should move forward on it. Today marks the culmination of a long 
and at times very difficult struggle. It is born of British Columbia's 
unique history. It is the product of many years of hard work and 
goodwill.
<P>
	Fairness, clarity and justice are not issues of party politics; they 
are elements of principles we all share as Canadians. Over the 
decades many people have played a part: people from various 
parties and political ideologies; people who share little in common 
except a desire to see justice done and to get on with building a 
brighter future for British Columbia.
<P>
	To understand why in 1995 we are still talking about negotiating 
treaties, we need to look at our history. Unlike most other 
provinces, where treaties were signed to clarify jurisdiction over 
land and resources and to forge new relationships between First 
Nations and the newcomers to this great land, few treaties were 
ever concluded in British Columbia. As a result, some 124 years 
after becoming a province the key questions of unextinguished 
aboriginal claims and rights remain unresolved and the majority of 
the province remains subject to outstanding aboriginal land claims.
<P>
	Few treaties were signed because of the position historically 
taken by the Government of British Columbia. From the late 1800s 
the position was that aboriginal rights had been extinguished prior 
to B.C.'s entry into Confederation in 1871, or if these rights did 
exist they were the exclusive responsibility of the federal 
government. In 1990, under the leadership of Premier Vander 
Zalm, of the Social Credit Party, B.C. reversed its longstanding 
position and the way was open to resolving these issues.
<P>
	It is only fair to point out that one of the key players in 
convincing the provincial government to reverse its historical 
opposition to negotiating treaties was the B.C. minister of native 
affairs at the time, Mr. Jack Weisgerber. I know that many of my 
Reform Party friends will recognize Mr. Weisgerber's name. One 
of the early and enthusiastic architects of this process, Mr. 
Weisgerber now leads the provincial Reform Party in British 
Columbia.
<P>
	Following on the heels of the B.C. government's decision, the 
Government of Canada and the B.C. government acted quickly to 
advance this process. Later that same year the federal minister of 
Indian and northern affairs, the Hon. Tom Siddon, along with Mr. 
Weisgerber and Bill Wilson, chairman of the First Nations 
Congress, agreed to establish a task force to  make 
recommendations on the mandate and process for treaty 
negotiations.
<P>
	By June of 1991 the B.C. claims task force had released its 
report. One of its key recommendations was the creation of the 
arm's length B.C. Treaty Commission. In the ten months that 
followed, representatives of Canada, B.C., and the First Nations 
Summit negotiated the British Columbia Treaty Commission 
agreement, which was the blueprint for the commission.
<P>
	On September 21, 1992, the Prime Minister of Canada, the Right 
Hon. Brian Mulroney, Indian affairs minister Tom Siddon, and 
B.C. Premier Mike Harcourt and native affairs minister Andrew 
Petter joined with the First Nations Summit leadership in signing 
the B.C. Treaty Commission agreement. In the three years since, 
the commission has made great progress. To date, 47 First Nations 
groups, representing over 70 per cent of British Columbia's 
aboriginal peoples, have submitted statements of intent to 
negotiate. In the agreement creating the treaty commission was the 
commitment to establish it in legislation. In May 1993 both the 
aboriginal summit and the province fulfilled their part of that 
commitment. Now the time has come for the federal government to 
honour its part of the bargain.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	These are the events that have led us to this legislation and this 
debate. Across the years and across party lines people have joined 
in a common cause. It is their vision and determination that we 
celebrate and formalize today. Their cause was simple: the desire to 
bring justice to the aboriginal people and certainty to their 
province.
<P>
	A Price Waterhouse study prepared in 1990 estimated that $1 
billion in investment had not occurred because of unresolved 
claims. Since the time of that study the price has continued to be 
paid, year in and year out. Some 300 badly needed jobs have not 
been created and $125 million in capital investments have not been 
made. That has been the price of denying the problem or pretending 
that it would go away. That is the price of the status quo for the 
people of British Columbia. It is a price we can no longer afford. 
With the passage of this legislation, we will no longer have to pay 
it.
<P>
	If the price of inaction has been high for the general population 
of British Columbia, for aboriginal people it has been far higher. 
For aboriginal people it has meant great hardships and poverty. It 
has meant the denial of historic rights and future hopes. It has 
meant generations of dreams deferred and promises unkept. It has 
meant a quality of life few in the House can imagine and none of us 
should have to tolerate.
<P>
	Aboriginal socioeconomic conditions are appalling. Almost one 
third of aboriginal homes on reserves lack running water. Diseases 
such as hepatitis and tuberculosis, virtually eradicated in the 
non-native population, persist in aboriginal communities. Deaths  
from fires are three and a half times the non-aboriginal level 
because of unsafe housing and lack of proper sanitation. The 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15636"> 15636 </A></B>
<P>
suicide rate among aboriginal people is 50 per cent higher than for 
non-aboriginal people. That difference is even more pronounced in 
the age group between 15 and 25.
<P>
	The country simply cannot afford to lose another generation of 
aboriginal people who are able and willing to make a contribution 
to this country. The people of British Columbia have told their 
government to get on with it and negotiate fair and just agreements 
that protect the rights of both aboriginal and non-aboriginal people 
alike. They want to establish a stable economic climate, which in 
turn will help to bring investment dollars and opportunities to all 
British Columbians.
<P>
	In 1993, speaking in favour of the legislation creating the B.C. 
Treaty Commission, Mr. Jack Weisgerber recounted his experience 
in 1989 as a member of the premier's advisory council on native 
affairs: ``It became clear to us, as we travelled and met with groups 
around the province, that if we were going to address the root of the 
social and economic problems we had to deal with the land claims 
question''. Those words were from a man who now leads the 
Reform Party in British Columbia, words echoed by members of all 
parties in the B.C. legislature when that body passed its own 
enabling legislation. I commend to my friends across the floor 
today those words, which we now have the opportunity to honour 
through our actions.
<P>
	The history of this legislation is the story of partnership between 
cultures, between political parties, between generations. Let us 
continue in that same spirit of partnership now as we open the way 
for a brighter future for all British Columbians and a prouder day 
for Canadians.
<P>
	I would also like to comment on some things the hon. member 
for Yorkton-Melville said. Again from the same paper: ``We are 
giving tax exemptions to anybody who carries an Indian treaty 
card. They do not have to pass a DNA test''. That is an insult to all 
aboriginal people across the country or anybody of colour.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	Does that mean that if I say I am an Inuk this person expects me 
to pass a DNA test? Does that mean that my colleague from 
Vancouver Centre, if she says she is a certain colour, has to pass a 
DNA test in order to prove to the hon. member for 
Yorkton-Melville that she is the colour she is?
<P>
	This is part of the Reform Party. By the way, DNA does not tell 
what colour the person is. The ignorance of some of the members 
of the third party is appalling, to say the least.
<P>
	Again, this is what the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville said: 
``The general public does not know the sellout that is taking 
place''. Who is selling out?  The aboriginal people from British 
Columbia have been in British Columbia for in the neighbourhood 
of 36,000 years.
<P>
	When British Columbia joined Confederation in 1871, the 
aboriginal people of British Columbia were in the majority in 
British Columbia. What did the government, when they joined 
Confederation, do? It passed a law forbidding the aboriginal people 
of British Columbia to vote.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We will pick up the debate a little later. It being11 a.m., we will now proceed to statements by members.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
many Saanich-Gulf Islands constituents complain about Canada 
Post's service. Despite rate increases, mail delivery is notoriously 
unreliable. Personal mail boxes have been replaced with 
centralized superboxes. Service, rather than improving, is 
deteriorating.
<P>
	By legislating that anyone who delivers letter mail must charge 
three times what Canada Post charges, government has created a 
monopoly operation and, typical of such enterprises, an inefficient 
one. Furthermore, using its financial advantage on letter mail to 
cross-subsidize, Canada Post can sell junk mail delivery at a loss, 
thus prohibiting effective competition from other agencies.
<P>
	Because there is no alternative mail delivery system, Canada 
Post has no fear of dissatisfied customers. The advent of facsimiles 
and E-mail gives some Canadians an option but many Canadians 
have no access to these alternatives. What is missing and vitally 
needed is fair competition. Government should remove the Canada 
Post competitive price advantage and let the free market set prices 
and standards.

	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Lib.):</B> Mr.

Prefontaine.
<P>
	In 1985 Anne was commissioned by the French Cultural 
Association to make a painting for the town of Gravelbourg, 
Saskatchewan. This painting was ultimately presented to the Right 
Hon. Jeanne Sauvé, former Governor General of Canada, on 
September 17, 1986. Mr. Speaker, you will recall that Madam 
Sauvé was a francophone who spent part of her childhood in 
Prud'homme, Saskatchewan, a small village in my riding of 
Saskatoon-Humboldt.
<P>
	Mrs. Prefontaine's painting is called ``My Canadian Bouquet'', 
en français ``Mon pays en fleurs''. The painting depicts a beautiful 
bouquet of flowers. On closer inspection, we see it is made up of 
the floral emblems of each of the provinces and territories, 
including the prairie lily, the floral emblem of Saskatchewan. Each  
flower is beautiful on its own, but as part of this floral arrangement 
the beauty of each is further enhanced. Like Canada, the final result 
is truly more than a mere sum of its parts.
<P>
	Thank you, Anne, for stepping forward again with your message 
of love and hope for a united Canada.

example is a recent letter I received signed by over 100 beef and

against the sovereignist option, Mr. Blanchet, the president of the

sovereignty is not only economically viable but that it will be 
profitable''.
<P>
	Since its inception in 1983, the solidarity fund has become the 
largest venture capital fund in Canada with over $1 billion in 
assets. This represents almost 30 per cent of the total value of all 
venture capital funds in Canada and it is at home, in Quebec, that 
this money is invested.

all he wants, it is not up to him to make the final decision that will 
seal the  outcome of these negotiations. Jacques Parizeau will make

relationship Quebec separatists have maintained with Canada over 
the past 30 years. This is what the separatist said: ``Stop bothering 
me with this idea of a distinct society. I am not interested. I want a 
country''.
<P>
	The sacrosanct concept of distinct society that one separatist 
dream weaver after another cloaked themselves in was really 
nothing more than a gimmick, a trap, a ruse to create constitutional 
deadlock. Quebecers are staggered to learn that, for the PQ leader, 
the distinct society concept was only a separatist gimmick. The 
people of Quebec are aware of their distinctiveness and, on October 
30, they will say No to this man who has been fooling them for all 
these years.

when he said: ``Let us not forget that the mandate sought by Mr.

	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the true face of the separatists has emerged in a document 
released by the office of the hon. member for Chateauguay. The 
document is a parody of the Lord's Prayer.
<P>
	It might well be considered sacrilegious in both the religious and 
the secular meaning of the word. The prayer in question, if we can 
glorify it by that name, petitions as follows:
<P>
	Forgive us for having been Canadians<BR>
	As we shall forgive those<BR>
	Who so remain.
<P>
	We will never ask anyone to forgive us for being Canadian. 
Quebecers will never prostrate themselves before the Leader of the 
Opposition, or the other separatists, either October 30 or at any 
other time.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="REFERENDUMCAMPAIGN">REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a very 
revealing speech which included references to duplication and 
overlap, the Minister of Foreign Affairs explained that Quebec was 
too small to negotiate on equal terms with the rest of Canada. This 
unfortunate statement is one more example of what we have been 
hearing from Laurent Beaudoin, Claude Garcia and the Prime 
Minister himself, each of whom either think Quebec is too small, 
want to crush it or want to give it a drubbing.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Could he tell us 
whether he agrees with the Minister of Foreign Affairs who 
considers that Quebec is too small to negotiate on equal terms with 
the rest of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I would like to know what kind of negotiations 
they have in mind, because when the Leader of the Opposition is on 
the hustings, at one point like yesterday, for instance, in the 
morning he was all for sovereignty without association or without a 
partnership, while that afternoon and evening it was not the same 
message.
<P>
	It is clear, and this bears repeating, that when in Quebec they say 
that, after Quebec separates, there will be a new structure in which 
Quebec will have exactly the same number of representatives as the 
rest of Canada, which represents three times as many people, the 
rest of Canada will never go along with that. This is like suggesting 
that in the parliament of an independent Quebec, just because 
Quebec City is the capital, it should have the same number of 
members as Montreal.
<P>
	In a democracy every person counts. If there is to be a Canadian 
structure, it must respect the democratic principle according to 
which members are elected in their respective ridings, while the 
Canadian constitution provides for a minimum level of 
representation for the smaller provinces like Prince Edward Island, 
which is protected in the constitution.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15641"> 15641 </A></B>
<P>
	However, when someone claims, in referring to the issue of a 
future partnership, that the rest of Canada will have a parliament 
with the same number of members as Quebec, and the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs, in referring to this, says that is out of the 
question, this is exactly what the provincial premiers have said. 
Anyone who is the least bit realistic, is not a magician and really 
wants to face the facts will have no problem understanding this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be 
glad to clarify my question for the Prime Minister. I do not think 
this is a matter of bad faith, not at all, but it is not at all what I 
meant.
<P>
	His Minister of Foreign Affairs said that Quebec, with a 
population of seven million, was too small to expect to negotiate 
with the rest of Canada with its population of 22 million. This was 
not about partnership or whatever, this was about negotiating from 
country to country.
<P>
	My question is this: Does the Prime Minister agree with his 
Minister of Foreign Affairs that Quebec is too small to negotiate 
with the rest of Canada and if he does not agree, is he prepared to 
set the record straight? That is my question.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all countries conduct negotiations. We negotiate with the 
Americans. We negotiate with Trinidad and Tobago. We negotiate 
with countries large and small. That is normal. The political clout, 
however, is not the same. That is where I notice another change in 
perception.
<P>
	For the first time, the hon. member for Roberval said they are 
going to have a country. He was not talking about partnership. He 
referred to his country.
<P>
	When will they have the courage to come out and tell Quebecers: 
``I am a separatist''? It is nothing to be ashamed of, so why not 
admit it instead of playing with words and saying at one point that 
``we will have a partnership'', and then ``we will not'' and then 
``we will have half, or three quarters''. Be honest.
<P>
	Just say: ``We want to separate'', and Quebecers-30 per cent of 
the people who are now saying they intend to vote yes think they 
will stay in Canada- Does the hon. member want to remain a 
Canadian, yes or no? I would like to know.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister shows very little tolerance for others, although his own 
positions are entirely opposed to those of the No committee to 
which he belongs, an issue that was raised with him yesterday. Why 
is he so anxious to look for discrepancies in our points of view, 
when he knows perfectly well that representatives for the No side 
in Quebec most certainly do not share his position on the Canadian 
federation. He should be more careful.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister agree, since we are talking about his 
Minister of Foreign Affairs-I realize it annoys him to discuss this 
but, after all, he should answer the question-does the Prime 
Minister agree with his Minister of Foreign Affairs, who feels that 
to deal with duplication and overlap, Quebec should become a 
province like the others, in other words, close its Travail Québec 
centres and let the federal government collect its taxes?
<P>
	That is what his minister said yesterday. Does he agree?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I would like to clarify one of the hon. 
member's statements. The program being circulated was prepared 
and accepted by all partners on the No side.
<P>
	It says in this program that it would be desirable for Quebec to 
have a veto, and the answer I gave yesterday in the House was 
clear. We were in favour of a veto for Quebec, but René Lévesque 
and the separatists dropped the veto. You cannot blame me.
<P>
	We voted for a distinct society and you voted against it. So today 
you rise in the House. I want to ask you a very short question: Do 
you want to remain a Canadian? It is not a difficult question, but 
you are afraid to tell the truth. He does not want to answer any 
questions because he is afraid of the truth. We are not. We are 
Canadians, we want to remain Canadians, and Quebecers want to 
remain Canadians.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleagues, I would ask you once more to 
address your comments to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us recall once again that René Lévesque trusted the 
other premiers, and that they plotted with the present Prime 
Minister to betray him. This is what happened, and history is a 
witness.
<P>
	Lisa Frulla, the deputy chair of the no committee said, this 
morning, that the principle of the distinct society had to be 
enshrined in the constitution. She is the deputy chair of the no 
committee.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister, who has been a member of the no 
committee up to now, as far as we know, agree with the proposal 
made by its deputy chair?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we voted for a distinct society, and he voted against. He 
has the gall to rise and talk about it.
<P>
	Secondly, he does not show a lot of respect for Mr. Lévesque in 
saying that he did not know what he was doing when he signed it. I 
think Mr. Lévesque was intelligent enough to know very well what 
he was doing when he signed it. I have never underestimated Mr. 
Lévesque's intelligence as the hon. member is doing. He did it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15642"> 15642 </A></B>
<P>
consciously. What were his reasons? I am not a member of the PQ, 
I do not know. We, however, were in  favour of a veto, and it was 
Mr. Lévesque who did not want the veto.
<P>
	Imagine rising and talking this way. As far as the distinct society 
is concerned, in Charlottetown, we voted for it.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	We campaigned for a distinct society, like Ms. Frulla-Hébert. 
Yes. It was the PQ, Mr. Parizeau and Mr. Bouchard and all of you, 
who once again scuttled that, because you want separation and 
anything goes in the name of separation, except telling Quebecers 
the truth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the distinct society the Prime Minister is talking about is 
not the one in the original Meech Lake accord, it is the one in the 
Charest report ``à la'' Clyde Wells. Thank you Clyde, we remember 
the emotional outpourings on television. As for the original Meech 
Lake accord, the Prime Minister fought his whole leadership 
campaign against it, and he won. The Minister of Finance, on the 
other hand, campaigned for the Meech Lake accord and lost 
because of it. This is what history teaches us.
<P>
	We must get back to Ms. Frulla, who made another statement 
this morning. She said that, in the case of culture, what was 
upsetting was the federal government's power to spend according 
to its own priorities. She went on to say that the federal government 
had to get out of the field and give the money to Quebecers to 
administer themselves. Her remarks were clear.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister agree with his deputy chairman, Ms. 
Frulla, and does he intend to withdraw completely from the field of 
culture, with full financial compensation, as his deputy chair wants 
him to?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what a distortion of history, again. We were talking about 
the Meech Lake accord; the PQ was opposed. You were against it. 
Why are you criticizing us for siding with you at the time?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You were against it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Yes, but so were you.
<P>
	I said at the time that it was not satisfactory, and you did not find 
it satisfactory either. Then, after we made the necessary changes 
and it became Charlottetown, I was in favour, and you were still 
opposed. So you have always been in favour of Quebec developing 
within Canada? This is where your problem lies. We, on the other 
hand, want Quebec to develop inside Canada. And when you talk 
about culture, there was a proposal in Charlottetown, and you voted 
against it. So shame on you, you are always opposed. Quebecers 
will be in favour of staying in Canada on October 30, in two weeks' 
time.
<P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FOREIGNAFFAIRS">FOREIGN AFFAIRS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on Wednesday afternoon the Minister of Foreign Affairs stated in 
Washington that ``Canada will contribute to any U.S. led NATO 
force in the former Yugoslavia''.
<P>
	Later the Minister of National Defence confirmed this 
commitment saying: ``It will not be a peacekeeping role. It will be 
more of a protective force and therefore have a combat capability''.
<P>
	Yesterday, however, the Prime Minister and the government 
tried to backtrack saying Canada's participation is yet to be 
determined. But this does not alter the fact that American officials 
took these statements as a definite support for their plans.
<P>
	What was promised to the American government? Will we be 
sending troops? More important, why was Parliament not 
consulted?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the ongoing initiative at this time to have a permanent 
peace situation in Bosnia should be welcomed by everybody. At 
long last the Americans seem to be willing. I am not sure if they 
will be able to send some troops but the president says that he will 
send 25,000 soldiers there.
<P>
	I was talking a few days ago with the Prime Minister of Great 
Britain who told me that he would send some soldiers there. I 
talked with the President of France who said that he would send 
soldiers there. I said that we would consider being there.
<P>
	I said in the House that before we made the final decision there 
would be a debate in the House of Commons. We have to talk with 
them first to know what they want, what kind of role, and nothing 
has been determined yet. We will come to the House of Commons. 
It is the first time in the history of Parliament that we have had a 
debate before a final decision of this kind.
<P>
	We have the right to talk with the people who are asking us to be 
there. We cannot do it in a vacuum. Probably there will be another 
flip flop. For months they all supported the presence of troops in 
Bosnia. However, yesterday they said they did not vote for it. They 
supported it all along at a time when they were trying to score 
political points. They are now gauging the wind, and it would not 
surprise me if they flip flopped again.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are talking about consultation before commitment.
<P>
	The Liberals have long forgotten their red book promises. They 
promised to reject the camp follower  approach to the U.S. They 
promised a more open process for making foreign policy. They 
promised to expand the rights of Parliament to debate major 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15643"> 15643 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian foreign policy initiatives such as the deployment of 
peacekeeping forces.
<P>
	The government is not only violating its own principles, it is 
acting like the Mulroney Tories during the gulf war. Why has the 
government broken its red book promises? Will it commit, here and 
now, to have a full parliamentary debate on Bosnia before we send 
more troops?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for the first time we have had debate in the House about 
our presence in Bosnia before the decisions were made. Today I am 
standing here saying that the Americans, the British, the French 
and others have asked us if we would participate. We told them we 
would consider it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> And we said yes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> We said yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> The decision has not yet been 
made because I have not taken the problem to the cabinet and to the 
House of Commons. The only thing we know for certain is that the 
Reform Party does not know anything about the facts and it is 
already against it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
let us go from France and other countries to Hungary for a moment.
<P>
	Last May at a meeting of the NATO Parliamentarians 
Association in Budapest I spoke with representatives of that 
fledgling democracy in Hungary. Hungary will not permit military 
movement without consulting Parliament. It will not even allow 
military planning for deployment without consulting Parliament. 
When it comes to troop deployment, Hungary is more democratic 
than Canada.
<P>
	Will the government do more than pay lip service to this 
fundamental principle of democracy, which is consultation, which 
it preaches so eloquently but violates so consistently?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for a person who has spent his career as a high ranking 
officer in national defence-who as a member of Parliament is 
double dipping by having his pension from the army-he should 
know there are always discussions at the military level on how to 
deploy troops. It has never been done by parliamentarians. It has 
always been done by the military under instructions by the 
government.
<P>
	At this time peace is coming to Bosnia, which we hope will be a 
permanent peace situation. Canada is always there when there is a 
need for peace. If we are needed we will look on it favourably. 
However, I have not made up my mind. If Parliament were to tell us 
not to go there, we would not. However, it would surprise me if the 
people  of Canada did not want to be in a place where we can save 
lives, have peace and make progress for the poor people who have 
suffered so badly over the last four years.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	We knew that there was some confusion between Daniel Johnson 
and the members of the federal government regarding the 
recognition of Quebec as a distinct society and the right of veto.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Yesterday, some confusion emerged within the federal cabinet 
when, unlike the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs expressed his support for a right of 
veto. As for the Prime Minister, sometimes he is in favour, 
sometimes he is opposed, depending on what day it is and on whom 
he is addressing.
<P>
	Given the confusion prevailing in cabinet with regard to the right 
of veto and the Prime Minister's occasional hints that he supports 
the notion of distinct society and giving Quebec a right of veto, 
why did the Prime Minister vigorously oppose the Meech Lake 
accord, which he played a large part in killing? On the night this 
agreement was rejected, he said to Premier Wells: ``Thank you, 
Clyde, for a job well done''.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the number of unfounded statements in that question is 
unbelievable. First of all, yesterday, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs did not discuss the right of veto issue 
with anyone. So much for that. There was no mention of a right of 
veto in the Meech Lake proposal. It was not an issue because the 
amending formula had been accepted by René Lévesque several 
years earlier. Another faulty interpretation by the hon. member.
<P>
	Third, he said that on the night I became leader-I explained this 
but they do not want to tell the truth. I simply said-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> No, you may be reluctant to 
admit it but, on the night of the convention, the vast majority of 
Newfoundland delegates supported my candidacy. So I thanked the 
people of Newfoundland for voting for me at the convention. 
However, that is not what they want to say. It was during the 
celebration following my election as leader of the Liberal Party, 
and I was saying thanks to Mr. Wells and all my other supporters. I 
also expressed my thanks to those who had run against me. I said 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15644"> 15644 </A></B>
<P>
that, for the sake of the party; to  have a good convention, one 
needs opponents, and after it is all over, one should thank everyone 
and help the Liberal Party move forward. That is why I am Prime 
Minister today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister can say all he wants about the right of 
veto issue, but if he wants to be serious, does he admit that he is 
unable to deliver the goods precisely because of the opposition of 
Clyde Wells and Roy Romanow, which is preventing him from 
getting the required unanimous approval of the other provinces?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> The hon. 
member should blame René Lévesque, who, with the leaders of the 
other eight provinces, imposed this formula on the federal 
government. It is true that unanimity is required. We were against 
this. Still, it was the Quebec government led by René Lévesque 
which imposed this amending formula, and now he is saying that it 
will be difficult. I agree that it will be difficult, because of the 
mistakes you have made in the past. Quebecers, however, will not 
let you make other mistakes when the referendum is held on 
October 30.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have learned that Canadian taxpayers contributed over 
$300,000 for advertising in a special edition of <I>Homemakers</I> 
magazine.
<P>
	Ruth Cardinal, public affairs director for the Department of 
National Defence, defended DND's participation because it will 
encourage recruiting in the Canadian forces, this even though the 
average age of readers of <I>Homemakers</I> is 42 and the forces are 
downsizing.
<P>
	How can the minister possibly justify such Cadillac advertising 
when the defence department budget has been slashed and 
thousands of military and civilian jobs are disappearing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
	If his question is do we have a recruiting policy in the Canadian 
forces, the answer is yes. If his question is do we have procedures 
in place for recruiting, the answer is yes. If his question is do we 
have a policy where we actually advertise in reputable magazines, 
the answer is yes. If his question is do we have a policy to recruit 
women for the Canadian forces, the answer is yes. The answers are 
yes, yes, yes and yes.
<P>
	I want to reinforce to the House that the government, unlike the 
third party, has a policy of equal opportunity for men and women.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> The average 
cost of an advertisement in <I>Homemakers</I> is $26,000, not $300,000.
<P>
	The documents also show that Ms. Cardinal received the idea 
from Alex Morrison, president of the Pearson Peacekeeping 
College, who also sits on the board of directors for the Canadian 
Institute of Strategic Studies. I remind the minister that the institute 
receives almost $100,000 a year in grants from the Department of 
National Defence. As well, Sally Armstrong, editor of 
<I>Homemakers</I> magazine, and Duncan de Chastelain, son of the 
Chief of Defence Staff, also sit on the board.
<P>
	Can the Minister of National Defence spell conflict of interest? 
Can he explain why his department is engaging in such obvious 
objectionable cronyism?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thought I had answered the question. Perhaps I can 
answer it in another way, with a different emphasis.
<P>
	Do we have a credible policy?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> The answer is yes.
<P>
	Do we have credible procedure?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> The answer is yes.
<P>
	Do we have a credible magazine?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> This magazine enjoys the widest circulation among 
women in Canada. Three million women read that magazine.
<P>
	Do we have a credible policy with respect to recruiting women?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Yes. Again: yes, credibility; yes, credibility; yes, 
credibility; yes, credibility.
<P>
	The problem with the third party is it has trouble with the word 
credibility; it just does not comprehend it.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In a brochure sent to all Quebecers by the director general of 
elections in Quebec, the No committee states,  and I quote: ``-the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15645"> 15645 </A></B>
<P>
government of Quebec must control its areas of responsibility''. 
What this really means is that Ottawa must stop using its spending 
power to interfere in Quebec's areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister tell us if his government agrees with 
this position? And if so, does it intend to withdraw from areas of 
jurisdiction in which it is interfering through its spending power, 
notably education, culture, health and manpower training?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this document has been issued collectively by all 
members of the coalition. That is clear as day. However, before 
attacking us on this kind of thing, because this is a written 
document, Bloc Quebecois members should start by- When you 
see their leader crisscross Quebec with his magic wand in hand and 
come out with a statement like: ``I am for sovereignty pure and 
simple; we will not even need Canadian citizenship or Canadian 
passports''.
<P>
	That same afternoon, he said: ``Well, no, we will negotiate a 
partnership'', but later qualified his statement. He was not so 
categorical any more. He was apologetic. That is in essence how 
the week started off, with all this talk about being among ourselves, 
francophones, people of colour, with women bearing more children 
and so on. Later in the week, they changed their tune once again. 
That is what really happened.
<P>
	They do not want to tell people the truth. We, on the other hand, 
put our position in writing.
<P>
	A moment ago, I asked the hon. member for Roberval if he 
wanted to remain a Canadian. Let me put the same question to the 
hon. member: Does she want to remain a Canadian or would she 
rather abandon Canada completely? She should answer this 
question, so that her constituents know where to stand come 
October 30.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, will 
the Prime Minister tell us clearly whether or not his government 
intends to withdraw from Quebec's areas of responsibility such as 
education, health, manpower training and regional development 
and to fully compensate Quebec through tax point transfers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, education comes under the full responsibility of Quebec's 
Minister of Education.
<P>
	I am happy that the matter was raised because he should do a 
good job. Quebec has the highest dropout rate in the country. This 
has nothing to do with the policy governing transfer payments. The 
policy is exactly the same for all provinces, including Quebec. 
Why are there more dropouts in Quebec? They should start by 
dealing with that problem.
<P>
	Provinces have complete control over the hospital sector. We do 
not do a thing in that area, except send money. If they want us to 
stop collecting taxes and  sending money, we can, but that is not 
what they want, of course.
<P>
	They do not want to do the dirty job of collecting taxes. They 
want us to do it and to send them a blank cheque.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	However, we have national responsibilities. The federal 
government is the one providing a national health care system to 
which all Canadians have equal access, instead of what some 
provinces would like to put in place at this time, that is to say, one 
system for the rich and one system for the poor. It is thanks to the 
Canadian government that we have a national health care system 
ensuring that all Quebecers as well as all other Canadians have 
equal access to health care. Under this system, when you are sick, 
you can be admitted to a hospital not because you have money but 
because you are a Canadian. It is a simple as that.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
National Film Board funded movie ``Léolo'' features a scene in 
which a child engages in an act of bestiality. As reprehensible as 
that is, it is made even more so by the fact that Canadian taxpayers 
have helped to fund this movie and that it was shown on Canada's 
public broadcaster across the country, the CBC.
<P>
	I wonder if the Minister of Canadian Heritage can explain why 
he thinks this reflects Canadian culture and Canadian values and 
why in the world are Canadian taxpayers paying for that kind of 
garbage?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for the question and for providing the notice.
<P>
	The issue of government funding for independent agencies is a 
thorny one. Certain artistic expression, while it may appeal to 
some, is clearly offensive to others. The film in question which 
aired on the CBC at 11.30 p.m. was produced under the former 
government. I understand it contained some controversial images.
<P>
	However, I think even the member can appreciate that the CBC, 
with the airing of NFB and Telefilm movies, will allow the public 
to judge the works on their merit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
not surprised the government is trying to justify this. I knew it 
would try to wrap this in the cloak of an artistic film. However, the 
great majority of Canadians would never let that kind of trash in 
their houses under any circumstances. It has been permitted in 
under the CBC.

<P>
	At a time when the government regulator, the CRTC, is looking 
at the issue of violence in television, how can the minister explain 
his own broadcaster airing a film that has many scenes that most 
Canadians could only describe as disgusting and tasteless?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, surely on the basis of 
one scene in one film the member would not want us to unleash a 
new age of censorship or abandon the Canadian film industry. The 
CBC is protected under the Broadcasting Act which allows it to 
have journalistic freedom.
<P>
	The hon. member might consider separating the two issues: on 
the one, censorship; on the other, our investment in the film sector 
and the cultural sector which is a thriving industry that results in 
about 600,000 jobs in this country.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The No committee says that Quebec must have full control over 
those sectors which fall under its jurisdiction. The federal 
government goes against that position by continuing to interfere, 
with its spending power, in the manpower, education and health 
sectors.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister recognize that Ottawa is using its 
spending authority not only to interfere in fields of provincial 
jurisdiction, but also to impose national standards that do not 
reflect Quebec's priorities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first, the claims made by the 
member opposite are absolutely false. Second, the real issue is that, 
today, the member for Roberval talked about a country. Yesterday, 
the Leader of the Opposition talked about a Quebec citizenship and 
said that the Canadian passport would no longer be used by 
Quebecers. Today, he changed his tune. The burden of proof rests 
with those who want to split the country.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	I ask them: do they want to remain Canadians or not? If not, they 
should tell the truth to Quebecers before October 30.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can 
the Deputy Prime Minister expect to be taken seriously, 
considering that the establishment of the human resources 
investment fund, through which Ottawa will interfere even more in 
the manpower training sector, amounts to a blatant rejection of the 
position held by the No committee?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the  government which is 
refusing to negotiate on manpower issues is the Quebec pequiste 
government, not the federal government. The real issue on October 
30 is the one raised this morning by the member for Roberval, and 
also by the Leader of the Opposition, who said that Quebecers 
would no longer use the Canadian passport. This will be the real 
issue on October 30. We are prepared to negotiate with the 
provincial governments. We are not in favour of status quo. There 
is only one government in Canada using the status quo as an 
excuse: it is the separatist and pequiste government in Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the francophones of Ontario and other Canadian provinces feel 
insulted and revolted by the disdainful remarks made at their 
expense earlier this week by the separatist member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs be so kind as to 
inform the House of the status of the francophone communities 
within Canada and to indicate the key measures taken by our 
government to support their development?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, not only has the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata shown her ignorance of, and probably 
also her disdain for, francophones outside Quebec, but this very 
morning the regional delegate of the Parti Quebecois in my area 
had the nerve to make the statement that francophones outside 
Quebec are a colonized people.
<P>
	This is an area in which the federal government has always 
assumed its responsibilities far better than the Parti Quebecois. 
Allow me to offer this quote: ``The government of Quebec has not 
done enough, even the PQ has not done enough. The federal 
government has certainly done far more than Quebec has. I am 
prepared to admit that. But I think that all of us, in Ottawa and in 
Quebec, ought to promote francophones outside Quebec''. The 
author of that quote is Lucien Bouchard himself.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Solicitor General of Canada. Oresto Panacui and 
Jean-Guy Dipietro were convicted and sentenced to jail for armed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15647"> 15647 </A></B>
<P>
robbery, kidnapping and attempted murder. They were released  
and the minister is well aware that Panacui has already reoffended.
<P>
	The parole board released Panacui even though they 
acknowledged: ``You are serving a very long sentence for a very 
violent crime and drug addiction was a factor in your criminal 
lifestyle''.
<P>
	Why is the minister allowing the parole board to release violent 
criminals and jeopardize the safety of Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the law passed by Parliament creating the parole board set it up as 
an independent organization, an administrative tribunal operating 
at arm's length from the government. The law I referred to does not 
give the Solicitor General of Canada any authority to intervene in 
the decisions of the parole board.
<P>
	However, I will be happy to make sure the hon. member's 
concerns are brought to the attention of the board.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
another case in point. Dwayne Archie Johnson, who in 1970 
abducted, beat and eventually stabbed Helen Betty Osborne 56 
times before he left her body in a ditch, was convicted of second 
degree murder and in 1986 sentenced to imprisonment for life with 
no chance of parole for 10 years.
<P>
	In March of this year he was granted day parole after serving 
seven years of his sentence. According to section 135 of the 
corrections act, the minister can direct the commissioner of the 
parole board to review and revoke parole.
<P>

	When will the minister intervene against violent killers or will 
he continue to jeopardize the safety of Canadians by not acting at 
all?

Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would be very happy to carry out the duties given to me by 
Parliament.
<P>
	It is my understanding that the parole board operates at arm's 
length from government and from parliamentarians. Having said 
that, I will be happy to review the act and see what should and 
could be done under the terms of the law passed by Parliament.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	On three fundamental elements, namely the right of veto, a 
distinct society and respect of Quebec's areas of jurisdiction, there 
is an increasingly marked contradiction between the positions of 
the No committee and of the federal government.
<P>
	Quebecers have a right to know whether the federal government 
fully endorses the position given in the brochure of the director 
general of elections distributed throughout Quebec with respect to 
the right of veto, a distinct society and respect of Quebec's areas of 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, there is no contradiction 
whatsoever between the policy adopted by the committee for the no 
and that of the government of Canada. This is a written document 
in which there is a full partnership. Where the contradictions lie, 
however, is in the policy of the Leader of the Opposition, who 
claims one day that he will negotiate Canadian citizenship and the 
next day Quebec citizenship.
<P>
	One of them says he wants to negotiate with Canada, the other 
says what he wants is a country. Where the glaring contradictions 
lie is with the policies of the separatists, who do not want to tell 
Quebecers the truth. I know that Quebecers are not fools and they 
will certainly understand that the question on October 30 is yes or 
no for the separation of Quebec, and the answer will be no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is a simple one. We are 11 days from 
referendum day. Does the Prime Minister endorse all of the 
recommendations of the committee for the no in this brochure, or 
does he not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister himself 
has stated that he had a hand in these documents and endorses them 
fully. The issue about contradictions lies not with the document of 
the no side, but with the separatists themselves, who are going all 
around Quebec claiming that they want to negotiate something 
with Canada while at the same time, as they finally admitted 
yesterday, really wanting a separate country. They want nothing to 
do with Canada, they want Quebec passports, Quebec citizenship, 
and that is the choice that will be made clearly on October 30 by 
Quebecers, when they say no to the separation of Quebec from 
Canada.

	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	When the Atlantic groundfishery was announced last year, $300 
million was allocated for capacity reduction.  To date one-third of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15648"> 15648 </A></B>
<P>
this allocation has been spent. How many licences have been 
retired? Two hundred and fifty-two out of 14,000. That represents 
less than 2 per cent of the groundfish licences on the east coast, 
nowhere near the 50 per cent reduction that was targeted.
<P>
	Given that the minister has already spent one-third of his budget 
for a capacity reduction of only 2 per cent, can he explain how he 
intends to reach his 50 per cent target?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. 
member knows, the TAG program has a $1.9 billion budget. 
Because more people applied and were approved, there is a 
shortfall in some parts of the program.
<P>
	The total budget of $1.9 billion will be respected. We will ensure 
that that we live within our means. Within those programs is a 
retirement program and a training program. We will work closely 
with my colleague the Minister of Human Resources Development 
to ensure that we stay within that budgetary program.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	Some adjustments will have to be made. Those retirement 
programs will be part of the overall program to deal with TAGS and 
to deal with the issues on the east coast.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary 
secretary acknowledges that cuts have been made to training, to 
green projects and to capacity reduction. The list goes on and on.
<P>
	When the program was introduced it was clearly stated by the 
government that the program would only meet its financial targets 
if training, green projects and capacity reduction were successful at 
getting people off the program. Now that the government has 
slashed these programs and capacity reduction targets cannot be 
met, will the minister tell Atlantic fishermen what they are 
proposing to do when the $1.9 billion run out?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, these are 
the members of the Reform Party who after spending a weekend on 
the east coast were telling everybody the problems of the east 
coast. They do not have a clue about the problems of the east coast.
<P>
	These are the same members who did not support TAGS. They 
wanted to cancel the whole TAGS program. I am very glad to see 
they have developed some understanding of the east coast 
problems by spending one weekend there.
<P>
	I can assure the members that the training programs will 
continue. We will work closely with the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. There have to be some adjustments in the 
program. The green projects are continuing.
<P>
	I hope the member will make another trip to the east coast so that 
he can see the training programs, so that he can see the green 
programs that continue to help with the disaster on the east coast.

cancer awareness month. Although progress has been made, much 
more needs to be done to eliminate breast cancer. Can the Minister 
of Health tell the House if the government has met its goals and 
what is further being done to eliminate breast cancer in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have done considerable work to ensure that more and more 
dollars are channelled toward research in breast cancer.
<P>
	Within our department we have reallocated an additional $2 
million a year. Better still, along with those additional dollars we 
are working very closely in partnership with other groups so that 
huge sums of money are now being expended on breast cancer 
research.
<P>
	We are not only doing more in research for breast cancer; we are 
also funding such things as the breast cancer information exchange 
projects. We are participating in setting standards of care and 
professional education so that the women of Canada have uniform, 
first class care when they are diagnosed with breast cancer. We are 
participating in the Canadian breast cancer screening initiative, one 
method of early intervention so that more people can be cured 
when breast cancer is detected at an earlier stage.
<P>
	We will continue to do everything we can with the resources of 
Health Canada. We will also work in partnership with many other 
groups which have a very big interest in seeing this disease 
minimized, if not completely abolished.

	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
during question period I was asked a question by the critic for the 
solicitor general from the Reform Party, the member for Calgary 
Northeast. He alleged that in section 135 of the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act the solicitor general is empowered to 
direct the parole board to cancel or suspend parole.
<P>
	I have before me section 135 of the act. I see no reference 
whatsoever to any power of that sort given to the solicitor general. 
It says rather that this power can be exercised by a member of the 
parole board or a person  designated by the chairperson of the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15649"> 15649 </A></B>
<P>
board. The chairperson of the board is not the minister. I therefore 
ask that the member for Calgary Northeast have an opportunity to 
correct the record.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Would the member for Calgary Northeast like to 
add something to this point of order?
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
directed my question to the solicitor general indicating that under 
section 135 it was within his power to address the commissioner of 
the board to review and revoke the decision made at the parole 
hearing. I understand that is what section 135(1) indicates.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
with the utmost respect to the hon. member, he should read the 
section of the act before asking his question. It makes no reference 
to any power of the minister to give any direction to the chair of the 
board or any member of the board.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank both hon. members for their interventions. 
The point has been made.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, earlier today, in answer to a question from the official 
opposition, the Deputy Prime Minister said that Quebecers were 
not fools and that they would vote no on October 30.
<P>
	That statement implies that 50 per cent of Quebecers, including 
all the Bloc members who intend to vote yes are fools. I ask-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This is a point of debate, certainly not a point of 
order. I thank the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, since the member claims in 
his point of order that I made a derogatory comment regarding 
Quebecers, I want to point out that my remarks concerned the 
blatant contradictions contained in the separatists' policy.
<P>
	In that context, I believe those comments are not only 
acceptable, but also understandable.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, this is not a point of order. Both 
sides have had an opportunity to say a few words. This is not a 
debate. I thank you.
<P>
	The hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie has the floor on 
another point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to ask you to clarify a point. What you just said is 
that both sides of the House can use the word ``fool'' in reference to 
people who do not agree with us. Is that so?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> As I said before, there is no word which is 
unparliamentary in itself, and that applies to this word. The 
important thing is how a word is used. Today, the word ``fool'' was 
used. It has been before. I would appreciate it if we never used it 
again. Sometimes, words are used during a debate and then we try 
to justify them.
<P>
	I gave an opportunity to both sides to express their views. I want 
to leave it at that. Again, this is not a point of order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
relating to the solicitor general's earlier point of order regarding his 
intervention or involvement with parole board decisions, there is 
nothing in the act which prevents the solicitor general from 
approaching the parole board or the commissioner. It is on this 
basis under section 135 that I am appealing to him to intervene in 
those parole board decisions.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank all hon. members and I hope that clears the 
air a little.

	My constituents' concerns deal with the interdepartmental 
committee on household goods removal services which is chaired 
by the Department of National Defence. The allocation of all 
moves to one bidder will cause more problems and cost more

proposal would force many small family owned businesses to cease 
operation, causing job losses in regions already hard pressed to 
maintain employment opportunities.
<P>
	The petitioners humbly pray and call upon Parliament to direct 
the interdepartmental committee to drop this proposal and to work 
directly with the Canadian moving industry to develop other 
alternatives to reducing federal expenditures.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-107, 
an act respecting the establishment of the British Columbia Treaty 
Commission, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, before question period I was pointing out some of the 
contradictions of the party opposite in terms of its aboriginal affairs 
policy. I was referring to the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville, 
who has made some contradictory and naive observations 
regarding the hardships aboriginal people in British Columbia and 
all across Canada have faced over the last 300 or 400 years. I 
mentioned the attitude of wanting something like a DNA test for 
Indian people, which is very insulting to aboriginal people across 
the country.
<P>
	The hon. member for Yorkton-Melville stated: ``We cannot 
continue to assemble a system that creates entitlements because of 
the colour of your skin. We are building a South Africa. That may 
sound extreme, but that is exactly what we are doing. We are going 
to have the same strife that South Africa is going to have''.
<P>
	If the hon. member were up to date on the issue he would know 
that South Africa is enjoying good times as a result of doing away 
with the apartheid policies of the previous government. Now 
Nelson Mandela is president and he is doing great things for the 
people of South Africa. That is probably the way we should go with 
respect to aboriginal people in Canada.
<P>
	The South African people who have resided in and maintained 
their lands in that area are finally getting an opportunity to address 
their concerns, which we are also doing in the area of Nunavut. I 
am happy to state that the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development a couple of weeks ago announced to the general 
public of Nunavut that they will have a role in deciding where the 
capital of Nunavut will be. There will be a plebiscite in the 
communities to determine that. Such a decision-making role is 
precisely what the aboriginal people of British Columbia have 
always wanted.
<P>
	British Columbia entered Confederation in 1884. I think I said 
1871, which is the wrong date. At the time British Columbia 
entered Confederation, the aboriginal people of British Columbia 
were the majority. To overcome that fact, the government of the 
day quickly passed a law that basically stated that the aboriginal 
people would not have a vote.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	I will correct a date I mentioned. It was in 1871. But in 1884 
people all of a sudden found that because the aboriginal people 
were the majority they would able to do a lot of commercial 
fishing. The government of the day passed another law, which 
banned the aboriginal people of British Columbia from commercial 
fishing. They have debated that ever since.
<P>
	I do not particularly like to revisit the history. We have to 
improve the state the aboriginal people are in and move forward. 
However, a lot of Canadian people do not know the history. 
Sometimes it has to be revisited or the people of British Columbia 
will not have the opportunity to correct a lot of the wrongs that 
were committed against aboriginal people at that time.
<P>
	I have a letter written on October 13, 1995, from someone who 
says: ``We the people of British Columbia will not give up our 
property, our home and our land, to which we have registered 
rights''. This person reiterates what Squamish Chief Joe Mathias 
claims, that the aboriginal people own British Columbia 100 per 
cent. This person says: ``Members of my family are Friesians. We 
were in Holland well before the Dutch. Are we now going to go 
back and say to the Dutch government that we own Friesland 100 
per cent and we want compensation?'' I do not think we would give 
that advice to this person, to go back to Holland to claim it back 
from the Dutch government. However, this person should 
understand that when he came from Holland the aboriginal people 
were already in British Columbia. They are still there.
<P>
	I do not think aboriginal people are suddenly going to say you 
cannot stay on this land because it belongs to the aboriginal people. 
However, I think they have a very strong case. As aboriginal 
people, we believe we were here long before anybody else came 
along. People who took our lands do have some redressing to do. 
We have to face the fact that a lot of aboriginal people in British 
Columbia will say it is our land. If people can accept the premise 
that they were here first, then maybe the negotiations would go a 
lot more smoothly and hopefully will result in making sure that 
justice is served to the aboriginal people of British Columbia.
<P>
	I would be prepared to answer any questions that may arise.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have two questions for the hon. member.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	In his role as parliamentary secretary, is he quite satisfied with 
the length of time it has actually taken this government to bring this 
legislation to the House? As was said earlier, the legislation was 
already established through the agreement. It was just a matter of 
recopying it into a format for this House. I would like to know  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15652"> 15652 </A></B>
<P>
whether he is satisfied with that type of delay of two years for 
something as straightforward as this.
<P>
	The second question I have was referred to by the previous 
government speaker from Vancouver Centre, in which she implied 
that this commission has the authority to actually state whether or 
not the parties involved are ready to negotiate. That is not 
necessarily my interpretation of what the act actually states. It 
states that the commission can assess the readiness of the parties. I 
think that is possibly a little loose from the point of view of what 
the criteria are to base that assessment on. It could turn to a 
dictatorial type of thing from the commission's point of view that 
you must meet these specified criteria.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, in responding to the question I may 
not necessarily satisfy the member. I look at it from the point of 
view that it has taken two years for this particular government, but 
it has taken since 1871, which is 124 years, to arrive at this stage. I 
think what we should be rejoicing in is the fact that we have finally 
come to this stage today, so let us move forward from here. While I 
would be very hopeful that the negotiations will be expeditious, it 
has taken 124 years. I would hope that when the negotiated 
settlement arrives it will be the best for all concerned, but 
especially for the people who have been trying to get to this stage 
for the last 124 years.
<P>
	On the other question, we have to do our bit as members of 
Parliament to ensure that the best possible procedure is taken to 
ensure a more expeditious conclusion of land claim negotiations in 
British Columbia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was a little bemused at 
the secretary's remarks with respect to the hon. member for 
Yorkton-Melville's question on treaty cards and DNA. I would 
expect that a secretary of state could recognize a bit of sarcasm 
when he sees it.
<P>
	The secretary must be aware that there is a stampede of people 
who have just a few drops of aboriginal blood trying to get their 
hands on treaty cards. If he thinks this is not a problem, he should 
consult with the band councils that have to deal with this and the 
problems created by Bill C-31. The secretary has to be aware that 
treaty cards have become articles of commerce. If he is not aware 
of this, he should not be secretary of state. If he is, he should not 
pretend to misunderstand the member for Yorkton-Melville.
<P>
	With regard to the question of apartheid and who has it and who 
does not, it does strike me as curious that while South Africa is 
doing away with apartheid, the secretary of state advocates and 
applauds the establishment of homelands within the Dominion of 
Canada. I think we should be moving beyond all of that and be 
talking about one Canada, not a whole bunch of little enclaves 
divided on the basis of race and history. I know all that was 
irrelevant to Bill C-107, but it was a  response to the irrelevant 
remarks of the secretary of state.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to get a 
question from the hon. member.
<P>
	I am a member of Parliament and the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, but I am 
also an Inuk.
<P>
	Whether the government of the day or governments past or the 
member believes it or not, as far as I am concerned all of Canada 
belonged to the aboriginal people long before, in some cases 
30,000 years, anybody else came along. That is my belief. However 
I have to be realistic. Some 30 million people now live in Canada, 
the majority of whom are other than aboriginal. We have to deal 
with that reality.
<P>
	However, the wrongs that have been done to the aboriginal 
people are very wrong. This is how I feel. I am not naive about 
aboriginal concerns. If the hon. member wants me to elaborate on 
aboriginal issues and aboriginal concerns I can do that quite well 
without any lessons from the member across.
<P>
	I live in the small community in the north in which I grew up. In 
1962 the Inuit got the vote. I know about aboriginal concerns. I 
know some people came north and started putting up ``no 
trespassing'' signs on gravel deposits. No trespassing signs on my 
land? I have no lessons to learn from the hon. member across. 
Aboriginal people have been on the receiving end of a lot of wrongs 
for a long time. This attempts to correct the injustices that have 
been done.
<P>
	When the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville makes a 
statement like that I am unlike the member across. I do not think 
the person is joking. I realize there may be some problems with the 
status cards. That probably is the case. Is it the Indians, the 
aboriginal people doing that? I do not know. I must say I am naive 
in that regard. I can honestly tell the member that I do not know. I 
apologize for not knowing because it is part of my responsibility.
<P>
	One my responsibilities is to ensure that there is expeditious 
approval of bills that deal with the concerns of aboriginal people. I 
hope the hon. member, when we are dealing with this particular 
bill, will give his support to it so that we can correct the injustices 
that have been dealt to the aboriginal people in British Columbia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I get into 
the text of my remarks I will make a few comments on the 
parliamentary secretary's remarks.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary was discussing the issue of land 
ownership. He said that in his opinion the land that we know as 
Canada is owned by aboriginal people. I remind the parliamentary 
secretary this issue has been dealt with in the courts. It has been 
dealt with in the Delgamuukw decision which was originally heard 
in the  B.C. supreme court and was appealed to the B.C. court of 
appeal and is going before the Supreme Court of Canada at some 
point in the very near future. The decisions of the courts to date 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15653"> 15653 </A></B>
<P>
have been that land ownership and ownership of resources resides 
with the crown.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I will talk for a minute about who benefits from that ownership. 
Thirty million people live in Canada and to a great extent the 
wealth of the nation and the standard of living that those people 
enjoy depend on the land base and resources.
<P>
	We are talking about the B.C. Treaty Commission. In British 
Columbia approximately 96 per cent of the land is owned by the 
crown. The balance is owned by individuals on a fee simple basis. 
What the Government of British Columbia is talking about doing 
under the auspices of the B.C. Treaty Commission is negotiating 
agreements which will convey, in its own words, approximately 5 
per cent of the land base to approximately 3 per cent of the 
population. A good deal of that population does not live on 
reserves.
<P>
	In addressing the concerns of people in British Columbia who 
depend on forestry, fishing and mining for their livelihood and all 
of the secondary and tertiary jobs that spin from that, it is clear that 
the issue of land ownership and resource ownership is a very 
serious one.
<P>
	I will talk a little about British Columbia's participation in this 
process and the concerns expressed by ordinary citizens in that 
province. As I have said, the land base is very important to the 
economy of the province.
<P>
	The Government of British Columbia and the Government of 
Canada are entering into a negotiating process to settle, depending 
on who you are, treaties or land claims with aboriginal peoples. 
There has been virtually no public consultation. The beginning of 
that consultation process is starting to happen, but in my view it is 
happening in a way that is going to make it very difficult for the 
real views of ordinary British Columbians to be heard.
<P>
	On a straightforward philosophical basis, most British 
Columbians are opposed to the general principle behind the treaty 
process. With the negotiation of the agreements described by 
government to date we will have, as my Reform colleague said a 
few minutes ago, enclaves within Canada which will have a land 
base and which will have their own governing bodies.
<P>
	There is a great deal of concern over the divisiveness this will 
create. The parliamentary secretary referred to South Africa as 
have other people in the Chamber. In South Africa the people are 
working to break down barriers between different parts of society, 
between black and white. They have been working at removing the 
different status that people received in that country based on their 
racial origins.
<P>
	In Canada we are going in the opposite direction. We are erecting 
further barriers. I suggest there are barriers right now. I think they 
are inherently wrong. That is one of the reasons native people find 
themselves in the very difficult circumstances they find themselves 
in. As a country we have treated them differently.
<P>
	Most of us on this side of the House believe very strongly that 
Canada is a very big welfare state. The welfare state that 
government policy has created around native people is many times 
larger and it has been very harmful to native Indian people. It has 
been very destructive. We need to do away with that, to break down 
those barriers, to do away with the Indian Act and start to treat 
everybody in our country as equals.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	That leads me to the next point. In a democracy one of the 
fundamental principles of democracy is equality before the law, 
individual freedom, individual liberty and the notion that we all 
participate in a democracy on the same basis.
<P>
	Sovereignty inherently rests with the Government of Canada. 
The provinces are way stations but in the end, citizens have to a 
certain degree an ability to exercise personal sovereignty in that 
they are able to vote, they are able to participate in the democratic 
process and they are able to influence to some degree at least the 
direction the government takes.
<P>
	When we start looking at people, whether native Indian or other 
racial minorities or groups that have distinctive characteristics and 
start treating those people differently and we suggest they should 
have different status, whether that status is supposed to assist those 
people or not however well meaning that might be, the end result is 
that we create divisions in our society.
<P>
	We create an us versus them mentality and we violate the 
fundamental principles of democracy. We violate the fundamental 
principle of equality before the law. We do that as a nation at our 
peril.
<P>
	We can see what has happened in British Columbia with the 
implementation of the aboriginal fishing strategy. No doubt it was a 
well intentioned strategy. The result is that we have native 
fishermen and non-native fishermen on the rivers in conflict with 
each other. We have the very real possibility of violent conflict 
right on our doorstep as a result of that policy. I would suggest to 
the House that the aboriginal fishing strategy is one component of 
what the government's agenda is all about.
<P>
	We are not talking in negotiating these treaties about moving 
away from the apartheid that we already have and treating people 
as equals, we are talking about building further walls. We are 
talking about finding new and better ways to segregate people by 
race and treat them differently. By doing that, as I said earlier, we 
are endangering the future civility and peace in our country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15654"> 15654 </A></B>
<P>
	We need to not stand with our backs to the future gazing 
serenely over the past, over the wreckage of failed policies and 
massive outlays in expenditures by governments which have not 
worked and which have created a system of dependency and 
paternalism. We need to strive toward policies that include all 
people.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has a serious obligation to deal with 
this problem and to deal with it in a manner that is going to at the 
end of the day bring all Canadians together as equals.
<P>
	At the time British Columbia joined Confederation in 1871 the 
terms of union clearly spelled out that the federal government shall 
take all responsibility for existing and future obligations to native 
people.
<P>
	There was one proviso in that agreement. The provincial 
government had an obligation to designate areas for reserve lands. 
The provincial government from 1871 through into the 1920s 
continued to set aside and designate lands as reserve lands to the 
point where in 1924 the federal government acknowledged in 
writing that B.C. had met its obligations under the terms of union 
and therefore was discharged from any further obligations in that 
regard.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	This is a very important and fundamental point because 
Canadians residing in British Columbia have been contributing 
through the tax system to the settlements of land treaties in other 
parts of Canada. They have been required to assist in the 
underwriting of the costs of the Nunavut settlement, of the Yukon 
land claims agreement, of the Saulteaux-Dene-Métis agreement 
and so on.
<P>
	Now British Columbians will be asked to pay twice: once as 
taxpayers through the federal system and once as taxpayers and 
citizens of British Columbia through the alienation of land and 
resources. That is fundamentally wrong. That is asking the people 
of British Columbia to accept a situation of double jeopardy.
<P>
	I believe very strongly the province of British Columbia should 
not be at the negotiating table other than as an observer. If the 
federal government intends to convey land and resources, it ought 
go to the province to find out for what the province is willing to sell 
those assets, the land and resources, in pursuit of the land treaty 
negotiations.
<P>
	When we talk about these land claim issues and when we talk 
about treaty settlements and so on, as I said in my remarks a few 
minutes ago, the government tends to treat native Indian people as 
if they are all the same, whether it is the Gitksan and Wet'suwet'en 
people in my riding, the Niska people or the Casca-Dene people. 
They are not. They are individuals like all Canadians. They have 
many different aspirations, goals and desires. They do not all think 
the same way. They do not all want the same things; they want 
many different things.
<P>
	In many cases the leadership in these native communities is 
acting in a fashion that is not supported by the majority of people 
they supposedly represent. I am deeply concerned when native 
Indian people come into my constituency office and say that they 
are very concerned about the ramifications for self-government 
because they do not know what it means. Quite frankly I do not 
think any of us know what it means. The Government of Canada 
and provincial governments have been talking for the last couple of 
years about recognizing an inherent right of self-government but 
they have never defined it. They have never said what that means.
<P>
	The implications for that kind of statement are very serious 
indeed. It is instructive to note the native Indian people of British 
Columbia voted against the Charlottetown accord at almost the 
same rate as non-native people did although the provision for 
native self-government was one of the five key components of the 
agreement.
<P>
	The ordinary grassroots people in native Indian communities 
certainly are not overly enamoured with the idea of native 
self-government. Their leaders are because their leaders 
understand the position of power and the position of authority they 
will end up in as a result. However the ordinary grassroots people 
in native communities are not in favour of it and certainly have 
grave reservations.
<P>
	I remember very clearly that the Native Women's Association of 
Canada actively campaigned against the Charlottetown accord for 
the very reason the inherent right to self-government was one of the 
five key components of the agreement.
<P>
	It is fine for the parliamentary secretary to stand and say that this 
is what all native people want, but it clearly is not what all native 
people want. They voted against it. I suspect that if I were to go into 
his riding I would find many native Indian people, aboriginal 
people, who would be very much opposed to the concept of 
self-government even though the member supports it.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Having given this matter a great deal of thought and having 
expressed my concerns, particularly in British Columbia, for two 
years now, I am convinced there has to be a better way. There has to 
be a way that the Government of Canada in concert with the 
provinces can negotiate agreements which will be inclusive rather 
than exclusive, which will bring Canadians together rather than 
separate them forever on the basis of race.
<P>
	We have to recognize we are settling agreements that will be set 
in constitutional concrete. We have to think in terms of 50, 100 and 
150 years down the road. We cannot settle the agreements on the 
basis of a five, ten or fifteen year window.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15655"> 15655 </A></B>
<P>
	It is for these reasons that I have grave concerns with respect 
to the work of the B.C. Treaty Commission. I am convinced that 
the province of British Columbia should not be at the table other 
than as an observer. If we continue down the road we are going, 
I am certain it will only create further problems in our society. 
The net result will be that those people who we would most like 
to help will be the people who will be most hurt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the comments about my riding demonstrated the need 
for some lessons on the history of aboriginal people in Canada.
<P>
	My riding, Nunatsiaq, spans over three time zones from 
Tuktoyaktuk in the west to Pangnirtung in the east, from Arviat in 
the south to the home of Santa Claus in the north. However the fact 
remains that the native Indian population of Nunatsiaq is probably 
less than .05 per cent. The area I represent is Inuit. It is 85 per cent 
Inuit.
<P>
	The ignorance of people like the hon. member opposite is why 
aboriginal people in Canada must be recognized. At the beginning 
of his comments the hon. member quite clearly said that this could 
not be native land because the courts said so. He may very well 
believe what the courts have said, but whose courts? Whose justice 
system determined that this was crown land? We did not set up the 
present justice system. By the way, we were not asked whether it 
was the kind of justice system we wanted or whether it was the kind 
of government we wanted. We were not asked any of those 
questions by the Government of Canada when the provincial and 
territorial governments were set up.
<P>
	There has to be an understanding. We have a bit of a problem 
with all the things that have happened. I do not want to revisit all of 
it. However I want to point out to the member and to all other 
Canadians that a great injustice has been done in the past and we 
are trying to correct the situation. If we take a little more time as 
the government than members opposite would like to see, I say we 
can afford to do it because it has taken 124 years to arrive at this 
stage.
<P>
	We have to ensure that expeditious approval of negotiated claims 
is achieved. I am sure members opposite will ensure that we have 
their support when the bill comes to committee. I hope the member 
ensures that he understands the issues, whether it is the justice 
system or righting the wrongs that have been done over the years, 
before thinking that every aboriginal person who comes to him is 
representative of aboriginal peoples at large.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	I take back my comment about all aboriginal people, but the 
majority of aboriginal people know that wrongs have been done to 
them and are trying to right those  situations. I apologize for 
making the hon. member think that I was representing all 
aboriginal people. I am a Canadian, I am an Inuk, and I do not 
represent all aboriginal people. However I have a problem telling 
the House that in a lot of cases I do not always agree with the 
president of Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, but I have no problem saying 
that she is my leader for the benefit of the Inuit people at large. We 
as aboriginal people have leaders who may not necessarily be 
representative of all aboriginal peoples, but by and large they 
represent the majority.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the parliamentary 
secretary's remarks. I was offended that he would refer to me as 
ignorant. He may disagree with me on a philosophical basis and 
that is fine; that is what Parliament is all about. However I can 
assure the House that I am not ignorant. I am not ignorant on this 
issue. I have spent a great deal of time on it.
<P>
	I should like to respond to some of the remarks the member 
made in talking about representatives of native people. I have never 
had the opportunity to spend much time in the member's riding, but 
I have spent a great deal of time in British Columbia and I have met 
with many aboriginal people. I can assure the member that great 
numbers of aboriginal people have real concerns about their own 
leadership.
<P>
	In my riding massive amounts of federal tax dollars are turned 
over to aboriginal leaders with no accountability whatsoever. 
Members of that community cannot even go to into the band office 
to get a breakdown of how the money is being spent. We see 
aboriginal leaders driving around in fancy new pickup trucks and 
fancy new cars while the people in their communities are getting by 
on virtually nothing. That is the kind of situation we are faced with 
in British Columbia.
<P>
	I find it very difficult to listen to the member talk about 
representatives of aboriginal people. There are any deeply 
concerned people in my constituency who write to the ministers 
involved: the Minister of Health, the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans, and the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development.
<P>
	In the case of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans they write to 
tell him they have a problem supporting the AFS. There is no 
accountability for how that money is being distributed. They just 
see a bunch of rangers going around their communities with fancy 
new pickups and new jet boats. There is no accounting of how the 
money is being spent.
<P>
	The Minister of Health is signing health agreements with 
aboriginal hereditary groups, not elected representatives, in my 
riding. The people who live in those communities come to me with 
serious concerns about the future of health care for them under that 
kind of system. The native leadership in those instances is always 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15656"> 15656 </A></B>
<P>
talking about how it is working for the good of its  people and how 
it is trying to further the interests of its people.
<P>
	In many instances they are not concerned about their people. 
They are concerned about their personal well-being. They are 
making sure they are well off while the rest of the people in those 
communities are left to suffer and are hung out to dry.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	That is why the aboriginal people in British Columbia voted 
against the Charlottetown accord. That is why they do not want 
self-government. In spite of all the grandiose statements by people 
like Ovide Mercredi and the federal minister of Indian affairs and 
the minister of aboriginal affairs in British Columbia, these people 
do not want it and it should not be shoved down their throats. Their 
individual rights and equality should be respected by the 
Government of Canada, not abrogated and trampled on.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the last speaker was concerned about 
the word ignorance. I would not use that word but would use the 
term misunderstanding and misinformation.
<P>
	I have heard members of the third party mention a few things 
which I perceive to be a complete misunderstanding of what this 
commission is being set up to do. The question was asked about 
whether the commission had any role to play in making sure that 
the parties were ready to negotiate. There was no understanding 
that that was a role.
<P>
	I will read very quickly the role of the commission: ``The duties 
of the commission are assessing the readiness of the parties, 
Canada, B.C. and First Nations, to negotiate''. A clearly stated duty 
is to encourage timely negotiations. Therefore, with respect to the 
concern over stalling, that is something the commission is set up to 
ensure does not happen.
<P>
	Another comment from members of the third party was that 
everything was being done in secret, nothing was being done in the 
open. The role of the commission is to prepare and maintain a 
public record of the status of negotiations.
<P>
	I have another comment with regard to constant references to 
being Canadian together rather than apart because of race. This is a 
clear denial of the cultural heritage of people who do not belong to 
a majority group.
<P>
	One of the things I clearly saw as a physician when we discussed 
aboriginal health issues was that the aboriginal people had a great 
deal of health problems. This was because their culture had been 
denied for so long. The lack of spirituality which is an inherent part 
of their culture has led to loss of self-esteem and hopelessness. This 
has led to the large number of suicides and abuse we now see in the 
aboriginal community which have clearly  been traced back to loss 
of cultural identity. These things are important to a people. It does 
not mean that people are different because they are given their 
cultural heritage. Cultural heritage is inherently what people are; it 
is what makes them the way they are.
<P>
	I am really concerned about those statements. They show a lack 
of understanding of basic human dignity and human rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member is quite right in 
saying the role of the B.C. Treaty Commission is to assess whether 
the parties are prepared for negotiating.
<P>
	In the case of one aboriginal group within my riding, the 
government is entering into agreements for negotiating with 
hereditary governments, not with elected representatives. People 
from that community continually come to my office and ask: 
``Who do these people represent and why is the government 
dealing with them? Why is the government signing agreements 
with them? Why is the government going to negotiate with them?'' 
Their rights have been completely ignored in this whole process.
<P>
	Yes, there are very serious problems in Canada's aboriginal 
communities. It is not because of a loss of culture nearly so much 
as it is a complete reflection of the state of the welfare industry 
which has been built up around native Indian people. This 
symptom will be found in any community, be it aboriginal or 
non-native, wherever we go. If people are treated as wards of the 
state and are going to be forever on a short leash from the 
Government of Canada, those are exactly the kinds of problems we 
can expect to find in communities like that.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member could take time out of her busy 
schedule to come to my riding. I would be more than happy to take 
her to some of the aboriginal communities and introduce her to 
some of the people who have serious concerns about the direction 
in which both the federal and provincial governments are going. 
They have very serious concerns because they know it is not good 
for them. They know the government finds it very easy to deal with 
collectives but has a very difficult time dealing with individual 
rights and individual responsibilities.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
great pleasure to speak on Bill C-107.
<P>
	In the House we are usually pressured to deal with immediate 
problems. We get representations from constituents about existing 
problems and they want immediate solutions. This is one of the 
rare opportunities we have in this House to pass this bill and build 
for the long term health of Canadians, particularly young 
aboriginal Canadians.
<P>
	It is also fitting to be here with the member for Vancouver 
Quadra. Both of us were in Beijing. At that  meeting a platform of 
action was adopted. It particularly acknowledged the importance of 
including the aboriginal communities in decision making specifi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15657"> 15657 </A></B>
<P>
cally recognizing their knowledge of environmental management, 
addressing their right to education, to ensure equal access to health 
care and to acknowledge traditional health care. It is an important 
step. Around the world people are talking about giving aboriginal 
peoples the tools to do what they need to do.
<P>
	One of the key commitments made by our party in the last 
election was to act on implementing the inherent right to aboriginal 
self-government. We did so because we saw the place of aboriginal 
peoples in Canada as a litmus test for our belief in fairness, in 
justice and in equality. Sadly, it is a test which we as a nation have 
too often failed.
<P>
	In the red book we promised to implement the inherent right of 
aboriginal peoples to govern themselves by negotiating 
self-government agreements. On August 10 we delivered on that 
commitment. We released our policy on aboriginal 
self-government and presented the principles which will guide the 
negotiations. This is a pragmatic and practical policy, one which 
we believe will work.
<P>
	One of the key reasons we think it will work is that it is the 
product of some 18 months of consultation with aboriginal groups, 
provincial and territorial governments, as well as others on what 
they thought our policy should be in this area. In co-operation with 
provincial and territorial counterparts, our policy aims for direct 
negotiations with aboriginal people in their communities on issues 
directly affecting their lives.
<P>
	As a government we believe the time has come to stop the 
endless, fruitless debates about how many angels can dance on the 
head of the constitutional pin and get down to negotiating practical, 
pragmatic and realistic arrangements that implement the inherent 
right of self-government. Our approach is new but it is animated by 
principles as old as our country, principles of respect, of tolerance, 
of fairness and of compassion.
<P>
	In the case of British Columbia the policy provides that 
negotiations on self-government will take place at the same table as 
discussions on land and resources. The process and structures 
already in place for treaty negotiations and confirmed by Bill 
C-107, the British Columbia Treaty Commission act, will also be 
used to negotiate self-government issues.
<P>
	These two sets of discussions, self-government on the one hand 
and land and resource uses on the other, complement each other 
perfectly. It means that for the first time the parties will be able to 
have all of the issues dealt with at one table under one set of 
negotiations. This will be more cost effective, something I am sure 
members of the third party will herald as a great achievement. It 
eliminates overlap and duplication and permits a much more 
comprehensive approach to  achieve progress, something I also 
hope they will herald. We are committed to ensuring that the same 
principles and practices of openness which have characterized the 
B.C. treaty making process will also be applied to the 
self-government decisions and discussions.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	There seems to be some confusion on the part of members 
opposite, particularly in the third party, as to just what our inherent 
rights policy is all about. Let me lay down the main elements so 
they can see for themselves how the BCTC process can be utilized 
to negotiate fair and meaningful self-government agreements.
<P>
	As a government we propose to negotiate self-government 
agreements with aboriginal groups and the province or territory 
concerned. These negotiations and the agreements they produce 
will be based on a number of principles.
<P>
	We begin with the premise that the inherent right of 
self-government is an existing aboriginal right under the 
Constitution. What does that mean? It means we will recognize that 
aboriginal peoples were self-governing before the arrival of 
Europeans and that they never gave up that right to govern 
themselves, even though that right has been ignored or suppressed 
for many years.
<P>
	Because this right is in the Constitution, it is enforceable in the 
courts. Litigation, as we know, is lengthy and costly and often 
serves only to create conflict rather than engender understanding. It 
can discourage a willingness to work together as Canadians to build 
a better, stronger future for our country. Is that not what we are here 
to do?
<P>
	In the end, it is unlikely that the courts would go much beyond 
providing broad principles, leaving the details of self-government 
to be negotiated by the parties who would have to live with those 
agreements anyway. It is far better, this government believes, to 
negotiate practical ways of implementing this right at the outset, 
tailoring each agreement to the unique circumstances of each 
community or region.
<P>
	Bill C-107 is not a one size fits all exercise. That approach has 
been tried and it only led to gridlock and frustration on both sides. 
What we need is an agreement and a process that is flexible enough 
to accommodate the diverse needs of diverse communities. This 
policy will do that.
<P>
	The second guiding principle in our negotiations is that 
aboriginal self-government will be exercised within the existing 
Constitution. As a consequence, the right of inherent 
self-government does not include a right of sovereignty in the 
international law sense and it will not result in independent 
aboriginal nation states.
<P>
	Our goal is to enhance the participation of aboriginal people in 
Canadian society, not place them outside of it.  The policy will not 
create little enclaves dotted across the country. It will provide 
aboriginal people with the tools they need to manage their own 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15658"> 15658 </A></B>
<P>
affairs and realize their own potential. It will mean an end to 
conflict and it will open the door to progress for all Canadians.
<P>
	Third, the charter of rights and freedoms will apply to aboriginal 
governments as it does to all other governments in Canada. This of 
course makes sense only if we are talking about protecting rights 
within Canada.
<P>
	The fourth principle is that federal, provincial, territorial and 
aboriginal laws must work in harmony.
<P>
	While we are prepared to negotiate a wide range of powers, there 
are some areas that must remain with the federal government. As a 
general principle, matters which are integral to the aboriginal 
culture or internal to the aboriginal group are open for discussion. 
These might include areas such as education, health care, policing, 
natural resource management, agriculture, the establishment of 
governing structures, internal constitutions, elections and a 
leadership selection process.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	However there are a number of areas where there is no 
compelling reason for aboriginal governments to exercise law 
making authority. Those areas include matters relating the 
Canadian sovereignty such as international diplomatic relations, 
foreign policy, national security and defence, international treaty 
making, immigration and international trade.
<P>
	It includes as well matters affecting the fundamental national 
interest such as the management and regulation of the economy, the 
banking system, currency or broadcasting, postal service, the 
emergency and peace, order and good government powers and to 
matters relating to the maintaining of law and order such as the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	While this is a federal policy, we know we cannot go it alone 
because many of the jurisdictions contemplated by this policy are 
provincial. It is essential to have the territory or province 
concerned involved in the self-government negotiations. Its 
involvement will be crucial to the ultimate success of the process.
<P>
	Not only do the provinces have jurisdiction over many of these 
areas, they also bring with them invaluable expertise in their 
administration. Having the three parties at the same table will 
allow new aboriginal systems, such as education, to be harmonized 
with existing provincial structures and minimize conflict down the 
road so as to create the best possible aboriginal governments. I am 
sure that is something we all agree with.
<P>
	Fifth, where all parties agree we are prepared to protect rights 
and self-government agreements in new treaties. Finally, the 
government has made it clear that all funding for the negotiation 
and implementation of  self-government agreements must come 
from existing resources. There will be no new money.
<P>
	I have outlined the principles that will guide our discussions. As 
a government, we believe that they are both fair and realistic. We 
believe they provide a solid foundation on which to build. We 
believe they advance the rights of aboriginal people in a way which 
also protect the rights of all Canadians.
<P>
	I have spent some time discussing inherent right because I am 
pleased to report that those involved in the B.C. treaty process have 
endorsed our self-government policy. Chief Joe Mathias of the 
First Nations Summit said that the new policy ``means finally we 
have an important initiative that will bring First Nations into the 
21st century''.
<P>
	Surely that must be our goal. With this bill we can begin to create 
the certainty that will encourage economic growth. We can provide 
the aboriginal people of B.C. with the tools we need to create the 
future they deserve.
<P>
	We can move beyond the adversarial postures of the past to a 
new relationship based on mutual respect, trust and understanding, 
a new relationship that reflects the true Canadian values.
<P>
	Some 50 per cent of all the aboriginal peoples in our country are 
under 25 years of age. It is an important point if we are to address 
their needs and make sure they have the systems in place to be the 
best they can be so that Canada can ensure them a long and 
successful future. It is an important point because all too often we 
talk about how we believe our young people are one of our greatest 
resources. Yet we do not always put our money where our mouth is 
in terms of implementing policies that will allow them to be just 
that, our greatest resource. We must do that more and more.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I am pleased to support Bill C-107 and encourage all parties in 
the House to pass it quickly and to agree with us in our position.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is always encouraging to listen to members that 
understand what processes we go through, the hardships we go 
through. One of the most often asked questions by members 
opposite, and other people I am sure, concerns the definition of 
self-government or inherent right. The two seem to always be an 
issue with some members of the public or politicians.
<P>
	I will try to define what I think inherent right and 
self-government are. The hon. member elaborated on it. One time I 
was asked about the inherent right of self-government. I replied 
that as far as I am concerned it is the acceptance or the 
acknowledgement that we have been here for a few more years than 
anybody else. In the  Indians' case it is something in the 
neighbourhood of 35,000 years; 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15659"> 15659 </A></B>
<P>
in our case it is a little shorter, only 3,500 years. However, we do 
not feel left out by the fact that the Indians have been here 30,000 
years longer than we have.
<P>
	The words inherent right and self-government to us have always 
been accepted as they are without trying to put them in a little box 
the way people quite often like to do. It is asked, is this the way it is 
going to be? Some people would say there is no other way when in 
fact there could be 10 different ways to do the same thing.
<P>
	Would the member care to elaborate on her understanding of 
what is meant by self-government or inherent right? As far as we 
are concerned, it is the fact that we were here, we had a system in 
place. The Government of Canada and through it the Canadian 
people at large must acknowledge that we have the right to 
determine our future. We have that right to set up a 
self-government within our geographic areas without necessarily 
having to ask permission from a government that has been around 
for 125 years or so.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would care to elaborate.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the 
parliamentary secretary has outlined a number of principles related 
to self-government, I will identify some of the key principles that I 
think my constituents would be interested in and those that perhaps 
are a little greyer to some people than they should be.
<P>
	Aboriginal self-government will operate within the existing 
Constitution. It is an important tool which will allow our aboriginal 
peoples the ability to make a lot of the key decisions which they 
need to make for themselves. Sometimes it is not appropriate for 
the federal government or the provincial governments to make all 
the decisions for this diverse group of communities which have 
very specific needs and problems that have either been neglected or 
that government policies at the provincial and federal levels in the 
past have tried to ameliorate but have only served to exacerbate 
because we tried this one size fits all philosophy.
<P>
	The aboriginal peoples in the communities across Canada, 
particularly in B.C., need to be able to use their inherent rights to 
make the decisions within the context of the Canadian Constitution 
that will benefit their communities and see them be empowered.
<P>
	It is ironic that around the world people are recognizing the 
rights of empowerment of women, empowerment of individuals to 
make decisions, to have the tools to ensure they will be productive 
members of our communities so that we are more economically 
viable, we are more environmentally friendly and we take care of 
our population issues. All too often people within our own country 
do not recognize the importance  of those values when it comes to a 
very specific group of people, the first people of Canada, the 
aboriginal peoples. Whether it was 30,000 years ago or more, they 
still were definitely our first peoples and we must give them the 
tools.
<P>
	The other aspect, which seems to me to be common sense, but of 
course common sense is all too often not very common, is that the 
current system under which we have been operating has not 
worked. We have seen aspects of the aboriginal communities doing 
very well. I do not mean to draw from their success, whether it be 
in the arts, in business or in other areas of our communities. The 
aboriginal peoples have done very well in many aspects.
<P>
	However, there are too many problems. There are too many 
young aboriginal people in jail. There are too many aboriginals 
who are dropping out of school, who do not seem to feel a part of 
Canadian society. It is incumbent on us to do everything we can to 
give them the tools so that they can be the best people that they can 
be.
<P>
	This bill, this new approach to things, given that it was 
proceeded with after 18 months of consultations with the 
communities and with our provincial and territorial partners, has 
given us the answers and the policy decisions that they would like 
to see in here. It will be successful and it will make a huge 
difference in the lives of many Canadians, particularly our young 
aboriginal Canadians, to whom we must leave a good legacy.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am one of the first to support self-government 
at a local level within the context of Canada being the nation. Not 
only do I talk about it, I have worked hard to implement it.
<P>
	I do have a concern which I would like the hon. member opposite 
to address. How do we deal with the aboriginal communities who 
see inherent self-government as being separate and apart from 
Canada? They see the right of inherent self-government as a 
separate and distinct nation from that of Canada. How will we deal 
with those aboriginal communities which see inherent government 
as being separate from the Government of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Torsney:</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly this is a process which is 
evolving. I am pleased to have her support for the concept and for 
this bill in terms of self-government.
<P>
	There is going to be a series of negotiations, but I have outlined 
already the basic principles on which we are proceeding. It must be 
within the context of the Constitution and we must ensure the 
structures are appropriate on the issues they have decision making 
power on and it is all outlined in the bill and in the process we are 
going forward with.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 1.30 p.m., the House will now 
proceed to the consideration of Private Members' Business as 
listed on today's Order Paper.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, representation in the Senate should be 
equal from each province, elected by the people, and have sufficient power to 
make it effective in order to better represent the people of the less populous 
provinces.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, it is a great honour for me today to rise as 
the mover of Motion 459 and therefore to speak in favour of it.
<P>
	Advocating a triple E Senate has been part of the platform of the 
Reform Party of Canada virtually from its inception. As Senate 
critic over the past year I have had the opportunity to research the 
Senate. Senate reform for the Reform Party and for all of us from 
the less populous provinces addresses a feeling of alienation from 
central Canada and the central government, which has grown 
through the last two decades.
<P>
	This feeling of alienation stems from the reality that 
governments will respond positively to pressure exerted by the 
provinces or the regions that contain the largest portion of our 
population. Sometimes these policy responses are at the expense of 
the smaller provinces and their desires. Equality of representation 
of provinces in the second chamber of Canada's central Parliament 
we believe would give the people of the less populous provinces 
real clout over the policy agenda of the federal government.
<P>
	However, I am getting ahead of myself. I would like to spend 
some time today talking about the original purpose of the Senate; in 
other words, why it was created. I would like to speak about how it 
has performed this role, then deal with the criticisms of the Senate 
and attempt to respond to them. I will then conclude with the 
reasons why I believe the triple E concept for the Senate makes a 
lot of sense.
<P>
	The Senate was designed to perform two main functions, the 
review of legislation emanating from the lower House, and provide 
a forum wherein the regions would have a voice in the central 
Parliament's law making process. It was to provide an institutional 
voice to small governments and perhaps to minority groups against 
the popular majority of the lower house. One could say that it was 
designed to act as a political bridge between the component parts of 
the federation and the central government.
<P>
	The work of the Senate as presently constituted in the scrutiny of 
legislation has been praised by most political commentators. Also, 
Senate committees have carried out useful investigative studies 
over the years, which have  added new information to policy 
development. Yet criticism has been levelled against senators who 
have stayed in the post regardless of the fact that they may show up 
only once a year, some less often than that. This criticism stems 
from the fact that senators used to be in for life. Also, because of 
undeserving patronage appointments Canadians have lost respect 
for the Senate, so much so that it has resulted in uncomplimentary 
names and references such as the old boys' club.
<P>
	However, the main criticism of the role played by the Senate in 
our country concentrates on the inability of the institution to 
represent all regions. This has led to great frustration in western 
Canada predominately because there is a definite perception that 
central Canada, because of sheer numbers, sets and controls the 
public policy agenda.
<P>
	Following on this argument is the feeling that senators, because 
they are not elected, have no legitimacy to act. Therefore, even if 
senators decided to start voting in regional or provincial blocs, they 
would not have the ultimate legitimacy to do so, in that they are not 
elected by the people of Canada. This is a strong reason for an 
elected Senate.
<P>
	Bear in mind as well that our present Senate's powers are 
virtually equal to those of the House of Commons, except that 
while it can initiate legislation except money bills, it cannot hold 
up constitutional amendments for longer than 180 days. With these 
two exceptions, it is important to note that it can defeat, amend or 
indeed stall all legislation coming from the House of Commons. 
However, because of its lack of legitimacy its exercise of these 
powers is constantly subject to criticism. Therefore this lack of 
equality of representation and legitimacy to act to either defend or 
promote the interests of the smaller provinces has given great 
impetus to the movement of Senate reform.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	While the impetus to a triple E Senate seems to have grown out 
of actions by the previous Liberal government to implement the 
national energy program, there have been other proposals for 
reform. Let us take a look at some.
<P>
	The most popular subject for these proposals has been the 
method of selection of senators. Popular election, provincial 
government appointment, and a mixed formula whereby half would 
be appointed and half elected have been proposed through the 
years. As early as 1908 Senator David suggested one third of the 
Senate chamber be named by the federal government, another third 
by the provincial government, and the final third by universities 
and other public bodies.
<P>
	A popular suggestion for reform in the 1970s was the creation of 
the House of the Provinces. This second chamber would be made 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15661"> 15661 </A></B>
<P>
up of delegates appointed by the various provincial governments or 
perhaps provincial  cabinet ministers. This was a second chamber 
modelled on what was then the West German upper house. While 
this reform had many supporters, especially among the provinces, 
it was obvious that this Senate could quickly evolve into a house of 
obstruction or a constitutionalized permanent federal-provincial 
conference. Neither scenario would have a long term positive effect 
on how the country is governed. Provincial interests only would be 
advanced in the upper house, with the national interest taking, at 
best, second place.
<P>
	The idea of an elected Senate attained prominence in 1981 with 
the publication by the Canada West Foundation of ``Regional 
Representation-the Canadian Partnership''. It was based on the 
work of Dr. David Elton of the foundation and Mr. Burt Brown of 
Alberta. In 1982 Senator Duff Roblin, former Premier of Manitoba, 
proposed that senators be elected on a basis similar to the elected 
system in Australia.
<P>
	The first federal parliamentary report to espouse an elected 
Senate was written by the Special Joint Committee on Senate 
Reform and released in 1983. It is noteworthy that the Senate 
co-chair of the committee is now the Speaker of the Senate, Senator 
Gil Molgat of Manitoba.
<P>
	More recently, the Meech Lake accord proposed a hybrid type of 
appointment procedure for Senate vacancies, and the 1992 
proposed Charlottetown accord proposed an elected Senate. I 
remember in British Columbia just how this was interpreted by our 
present NDP government. As a matter of fact, it was the B.C. 
provincial government's interpretation of the proposals for Senate 
change in the recent Charlottetown accord that helped to precipitate 
my entry into politics. At the time there was some suggestion that 
the provincial government would control the format of how the 
elections by the people would proceed.
<P>
	In B.C. statements were being made by elected government 
MLAs and the premier that there would be equal men and women 
and the government would look after candidate selection for Senate 
seats. The first statement flies in the face of Canadian tradition. 
Canadians have long been committed to a system of merit for job 
applications. That is, those who can do the job best should do it. 
And any potential candidates for a Senate position must come from 
all spectrums of the province, not from government patronage lists.
<P>
	As a point of interest, we must recognize in our country that to 
hire employees according to an ethnic and gender preference 
program is not working. In California, where the selection of 
employees has been based on preferential treatment based upon 
race and gender over the last while, Americans are going to see a 
ballot question in the 1996 election year that will potentially forbid 
the use of ethnicity or gender as criteria for either discriminating 
against or granting  preferential treatment to any individual or 
group by the government.
<P>
	Those who take the time to think realize that discrimination, if it 
exists, cannot be cured by counter discrimination. It is very 
divisive and fundamentally unfair.
<P>
	During the 1980s a unique event in the history of the Senate 
occurred in Alberta. Alberta enacted legislation to enable persons 
to stand for election on a province-wide basis to contest a vacant 
Senate seat. An election was held and Reform Party member Stan 
Waters topped the polls. He was subsequently summoned to the 
Senate by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime 
Minister. Unfortunately we lost Stan Waters before he had the 
opportunity to show Canadians just how valuable an accountable 
senator could be. The election of Senator Stan Waters is a valuable 
precedent. Unfortunately, it was not followed with later Senate 
appointments from Alberta.
<P>
	That very briefly is the history of how we got to where we are 
now, the history of why the contents of this motion are so dear to 
the hearts of all of us who represent the Reform Party.
<P>
	The triple E Senate should be elected, and therefore accountable. 
It is our belief that a Senate must be popularly elected. In a 
democratic age in a country that prizes democracy so highly, an 
appointed upper house lacks legitimacy.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	More specifically, elected representation is essential in 
addressing issues of equity, since an elected Senate would place 
greater emphasis on increasing the likelihood that people will be 
elected based on merit rather than appointed simply to fulfil equity 
quotas. This would also address the longstanding problem of 
patronage appointments.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the issue of patronage and the practice of the 
government to promote adding party members and friends to the 
Senate, whether as a result of section 26 of the Constitution Act or 
just to fill vacancies.
<P>
	Section 26 of the Constitution Act 1867 provides that in 
exceptional circumstances an additional four or eight senators may 
be appointed. This provision was invoked in December 1990, when 
the Senate systematically opposed passage of the legislation 
introducing the goods and services tax, legislation that had been 
passed after much contentious debate in the Commons. Here it 
could be argued that the Canadian people did not want the GST, but 
in order to raise more money in taxes-sounds like England in the 
days of wicked King John and others-the government of the day 
forced through legislation that people did not want by invoking 
section 26 and adding more senators.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15662"> 15662 </A></B>
<P>
	If senators were elected by the people of Canada, the Prime 
Minister and present government could not run roughshod over the 
wishes of the people or set the odds in his government's own 
favour, but would have to abide by the will of the people.
<P>
	At this time I must remind the House that we have a similar 
situation in the House of Commons today. We have the hated 
legislation on the contentious Bill C-68. The people of Canada do 
not want the national gun registration. Most of them know that 
forcing law-abiding Canadians to register guns that have been 
collected over the years, some as collector's items, some to be used 
in hunting, and some left to them as heirlooms from their fathers 
from a previous period in history, will not make Canadians one bit 
safer in their homes.
<P>
	Most Canadians have done their research and know of the 
thousands of weapons smuggled in each year over our borders. 
Most Canadians know that these illegal weapons will not be 
registered. Most educated Canadians know that criminals or those 
with minds of criminal intent can get guns in all of our major cities 
from the underground network. Worst of all is the computer list that 
honest, law-abiding citizens will be placed on when they register 
their guns. They say those lists will be secure. American and 
Canadian authorities already admit that security cannot be 
guaranteed any more. The criminal element in the new computer 
world and information age breaks our security time and time again. 
American spokespersons readily admit the computer criminal gets 
access from supposedly secure documents.
<P>
	Now our law-abiding citizens are going to have their names 
placed on these lists. Criminals will be able to access these lists. 
How safe now will Canadians be in their homes? If they are 
law-abiding citizens already, their guns will be locked up with the 
bullets in different places. The criminal will have the advantage 
both of surprise and of being prepared for a fight. Is this what this 
government wants, to put good, law-abiding citizens in jeopardy? 
No, it says. Then why have the national gun registration? Will it 
make Canadians safer in their homes? No. Will their names being 
placed on a list for all and sundry to steal from make them safe? 
No. Is this then another way for this government to raise money, 
taxes, as it is already deep in debt and going deeper all the time? 
Possibly.
<P>
	This is the damage that occurs in our country when senators are 
placed in positions as vacancies occur, rather than being elected by 
Canadians, for the Senate can vote against government legislation. 
It can vote against poor government legislation.
<P>
	In the case of the GST, which costs us heavily in the 
administration of it, the Prime Minister of the day invoked section 
26 and appointed more senators at his own will and forced the GST 
on the Canadian people. In this way, the governing party became a 
majority in the Senate and the hated GST legislation finally passed.
<P>
	How has the GST helped Canadians? It has forced some 
businesses into bankruptcy. It has added extra tax burdens on
<P>
already heavily taxed citizens. At present, when Canadians get 
their pay cheques, after taxes they are taxed again. And the promise 
of the government of the day that part of the GST would go toward 
reducing the deficit and debt did not happen. What about the 
growing underground economy, growing because of the enormous 
tax load placed on Canadians?
<P>
	Today, because of attrition, the Liberals can stack the Senate and 
once again we will have the wishes of Canadians put second to the 
wishes of the Prime Minister and the cabinet. By placing the latest 
four senators, good strong Liberals, to the Senate we are seeing 
once again the upper house not accountable to the people. 
Canadians can do nothing about making senators accountable. 
Only with an elected Senate is this possible. If the hated gun 
legislation is forced on Canadians, down the road we will see 
happen exactly what Canadians warned today's government would 
happen.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Today's law-abiding citizens will be forced to break the law to 
protect themselves and their families. Canadians will be more 
vulnerable in their homes if the criminal element will know where 
the guns are.
<P>
	Another costly government bureaucracy will have been created 
as the present federal government attempts to administer this latest 
tax burden on Canadians. The present gun registration will have 
proved no more effective than the existing gun registration, which 
has been in force for many years. It is past time that we as 
responsible MPs looked to an elected Senate so unpopular laws are 
not forced on the Canadian people.
<P>
	As far as the method of election is concerned, I think we have a 
lot to learn from our Australian friends. In a recent edition of the 
<I>Canadian Parliamentary Review</I>, Professor Howard Caddy, in an 
article about the Australian Senate states that proportional 
representation ensures that the upper house in Australia does not 
reflect exactly the representation of the lower house.
<P>
	He also goes on to say that ``as a result of the fact that the 
political party composition of the Senate is usually different from 
the House, compromises can be obtained when there is a difference 
of opinion between the two houses on particular legislation''. It can 
be worked out.
<P>
	When we look at an equal Senate under the triple E Senate, each 
province will have the same number of seats. This is the present 
situation in both Australia and the United States. In such a Senate 
the less populous provinces would have a majority of the seats just 
as the more heavily populated provinces do now in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	Regarding equality, at present the Constitution stipulates that 
there shall be 104 senators, a number that  can be changed only by 
constitutional amendment. Distribution of Senate seats is by region 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15663"> 15663 </A></B>
<P>
now in Canada. If we look at Ontario and Quebec, they have 24 
each. If we look around the rest of Canada, the west has only 24 
between four provinces and the maritimes only 24 between three. 
The present representation favours central Canada and is unfair.
<P>
	Do we need 104 senators? No, we do not. Can we lower the 
numbers? Yes, we can if the will of the Canadian people decides so. 
Now that senators are no longer elected for life and leave the 
Senate at 75 years of age, it is opportune to look at the less cost 
involved in fewer senators and the fact that absenteeism should be 
a less serious problem than it was in the past. An equal number of 
seats from each province suggests a fairer representation.
<P>
	Should the two most populated provinces with the most MPs in 
the House of Commons also have the most senators in the Senate? 
No. This policy is unfair for the less populated areas of our vast 
country.
<P>
	To be effective the Senate must have adequate power to balance 
the House of Commons. We do not believe that defeat of a 
government bill in the Senate should lead to the resignation of the 
government. However when we are fine tuning the powers of this 
Chamber we must ensure that the Senate can amend or veto 
regionally offensive legislation.
<P>
	In conclusion, the adoption of an elected, equal and effective 
second chamber in Canada's central Parliament would be of great 
benefit to our political system. Through equality the interests of 
small provinces would be protected. With the combination of 
elected and effective, senators would have the legitimacy to act, to 
amend or to defeat legislation which did not respect regional 
differences in the country.
<P>
	It would also combine the best aspects of the present Senate, its 
scrutiny of legislation, with the legitimacy to act to defend regional 
interests.
<P>
	I realize as with all proposals there is some fine tuning to do. 
Ways must be found to ensure elected senators do not act to 
slavishly serve the interests of the political party they represent. 
They must have the freedom to represent their regions even if the 
interests of the region do not coincide with the interests of the 
national political party they represent.
<P>
	However these are details and we can work them out if we get 
the fundamentals right, an elected, effective and equal Senate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois on the motion by my 
colleague, the hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam, which reads as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, representation in the Senate should be 
equal from each province, elected by the people, and have sufficient power to 
make it effective in order to better represent the people of the less populous 
provinces.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This will be recognized as the proposal for the triple E Senate, 
that is elected, equal and effective.
<P>
	Let me state right at the onset that I am going to oppose this 
motion and I shall close my remarks with what it leads me to 
conclude about the present Senate.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	First, I want to deal with the concept of an elected Senate. To 
start with, obviously, we know that the Senate is one of the two 
Houses in this country. A number of countries have two houses, the 
USA and France, for instance.
<P>
	What sets the second chamber apart in Canada, as in England, is 
that it is not elected, in other words the members are appointed. 
The Senate we have is an elitist Senate, an aristocratic Senate, one 
that is not accountable. Often its appointees are men or women who 
have had a long career in politics, or business leaders who backed a 
given political party, or party organizers who find in the Senate the 
income and means to allow them to continue to serve their party.
<P>
	The Senate in its present form is an extremely negative aspect of 
our democracy. When reference is made to an elected Senate, I 
think that most people who want to have a Senate, to retain the 
Senate, would agree that in the current political situation and in 
response to current views on democracy, the Senate ought to be 
elected.
<P>
	Now, for the concept of an equal Senate. From what I have been 
able to understand, each province would have the same number of 
senators, like the U.S. Senate. I think some people here either 
watch too much American television or are at least very much 
aware of the American philosophy and would like to see in Canada 
people with the same power as American senators. When we look 
at American history and the process by which every State large and 
small, was given the same number of senators, we see that at the 
time the political philosophy was such that people wanted to create 
a certain equality between the States by having the same number of 
senators from each State.
<P>
	However, that was in the 18th century, and we are in the 20th 
century. I think that in the 20th century, people do not look kindly 
on the fact that states or provinces with a population that is 
relatively low compared with the more densely populated 
provinces, and I personally and the people of the Bloc as well do 
not look kindly on the fact that some provinces are given so much 
power, considering their low population numbers.
<P>
	If we look at the current system in Canada, each province is 
represented in the House of Commons, according to a certain ratio 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15664"> 15664 </A></B>
<P>
that is used to determine proportional representation. I think that 
considering the  present state of democratic thinking, people are 
well represented.
<P>
	There could be some special considerations on the basis of which 
one part of the country would be better represented than another 
part, there is the historical aspect, there is the cultural aspect and 
there are all kinds of considerations, but I do not see why, 
considering the present state of Canadian culture or Canadian 
politics, Prince Edward Island would have the same number of 
senators as Ontario. It would be interesting to see some evidence 
that this would be better than what we have now.
<P>
	The concept of an equal Senate takes us back to the Constitution 
of 1982, in other words, Canada as checker board, a vast country 
divided into ten parts, with each part being equal to the other. That 
is what we saw and that is what we see now, to a certain extent 
under the current amending formula for the Canadian constitution, 
and I think that if we consider the effectiveness of this mechanism, 
we may have some reservations about giving certain parts of the 
country so much power that they could easily obstruct the 
operations of our institutions.
<P>
	I am referring to the potential power of entities that may 
represent as few as 300,000 people out of Canada's total population 
of 28 or 29 million, so I do not think that today's proposal for an 
equal Senate is in the interests of Canada and Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	And now, let me deal with the concept of an effective Senate. 
When the hon. member for the Reform Party introduced her bill, 
she made a connection between effectiveness and the Senate's 
power to obstruct, to hold up legislation passed by the House of 
Commons. I think there is something a little dangerous in all this. It 
would mean having a Senate that would obstruct the will of the 
representatives of the people. Two, three or four hundred years ago, 
the people in the Commons were not always considered to be 
sufficiently intelligent, knowledgeable or enlightened to debate the 
real problems, so people were appointed to block their decisions.
<P>
	Today, however, if we look at countries with only one house, we 
can see that democracy functions effectively and well there. In 
Quebec and Ontario there is no longer a second appointed house, 
and democratic institutions are functioning well. So I do not think 
we need a second house to block the democratic will of the 
representatives of the people, as is currently the case.
<P>
	Reference was made to the gun control bill. It is totally 
unacceptable, in my opinion, for appointed senators to be able to 
block legislation passed by a large majority of the representatives 
of the people. I see it as dangerous for democracy in Canada when 
people who have not been elected are given the power to prevent 
the will of the people's representatives from being effectively 
expressed in the administration of the country.
<P>
	Therefore, we in the Bloc oppose the motion. The motion is not a 
votable item, but if it were, we would vote against it, particularly 
because we have repeatedly called in the House for the abolition of 
the Senate. We consider the present Senate ineffective. We consider 
it too costly. According to the budget, the Senate will cost Canada 
$42 million this year. The services the Senate currently provides 
have a certain value. However, in comparing their cost with the 
Senate's potential influence, its effect, if it were operating at 
maximum capability, I think that, right now, the $42 million spent 
on the Senate is too much, given the needs and the cuts being made 
in various areas, where there are desperate needs.
<P>
	We are calling for its abolition, particularly because we have no 
hope or expectation of its being reformed. It is impossible. With the 
Canadian constitution as it currently stands, if we look at sections 
38 and 42 of the constitution, we see that Senate approval is 
required to amend the powers, role, election and appointment of 
senators in Canada.
<P>
	So, from what I understand of the way the institution works, I do 
not think the senators would go so far as to commit hara-kiri. So, I 
think the only way to abolish the Senate is along the lines of the 
motion I made in connection with the bill to implement certain 
elements of the latest budget. It would simply be a matter of cutting 
off the Senate, of arranging for senators not to be paid anymore, of 
abolishing the funds needed to operate the Senate so that the Senate 
dies on its own. With the state of Canada's constitution and the way 
institutions work, it is beyond reform, it is ineffective, it is not 
elected, and the powers currently in its hands serve more to hamper 
the flow of democracy in Canada than to help Canadians live better 
in this country.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there were some very interesting comments made by the 
hon. member from the Bloc-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Excuse me, colleagues. The Chair has 
received no indication that anybody on the government side wishes 
to speak. The Chair has not seen anybody on the government side 
stand up. However, there is a rotation and we have heard from one 
member of the Reform Party. Therefore the hon. parliamentary 
secretary to the government House leader has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. I know I would enjoy 
hearing his remarks, but I think in terms of the normal rotation of 
speakers among the parties that a government member should 
participate in this debate at some point.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15665"> 15665 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam has proposed a 
motion to the House and I am pleased to speak on it. I was 
surprised that she did not quote from her leader in the course of 
her remarks. I thought a decree had been issued from the leader's 
office that all members of the Reform Party were to quote the 
leader in every speech at least once. Perhaps she forgot the decree 
this afternoon.
<P>
	I would like to help her out because I have a quote from the little 
green book. It is the little book of Reform, the gospel according to 
the hon. member for Calgary Southwest and the Reform Party.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Southwest in one of his more lucid 
moments said: ``The three priorities of the present Senate are in 
order: protocol, alcohol and Geritol''. These remarks might be 
considered by some to be insulting of the Senate. I guess for that 
reason the hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam did not feel it was 
appropriate to quote those remarks. However, I have quoted them.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Southwest evidently thinks these 
remarks are appropriate. I know that his views are shared by the 
hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster because the last time I 
quoted this he was citing along with me. He remembered all the 
words. He had memorized the words of his leader and quoted them 
along with me.
<P>
	I point them out because there is a lot of agreement on that point 
among members of her party apparently. Yet, at the same time, they 
have not proposed the abolition of the Senate, as members of the 
other group which was largely western based, the New Democratic 
Party, used to do and still does. They now are back to abolition but 
for a while they supported the Senate.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will remember in the last Parliament when we 
were debating the GST that the NDP changed its principles. The 
principle was that there could not be an unelected body in 
Parliament; however, it changed its principles in the course of the 
GST debate.
<P>
	I see that I have hit a nerve.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am 
wondering what the relevance of all of this is to the matter which is 
under debate.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. parliamentary secretary will 
make his point relevant very soon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I remind the hon. member for Swift 
Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia that this motion deals with the 
Senate; it is not on gun control. He may have heard the hon. 
member for Mission-Coquitlam spend half of her time speaking 
on gun control. The only reason she did so was that her arguments 
on this motion were so thin she ran out of them in about ten minutes 
and had to fill in the rest of her time on gun control.
<P>
	This motion is about Senate reform. If the hon. member had read 
the motion instead of making these interruptions, he would realize 
what I am talking about. We are talking about the Senate and I was 
talking about the approach of the New Democratic Party to the 
Senate. It wanted to abolish it. The motion before us is not for 
abolition; it is for a triple E Senate and it is that to which I wish to 
speak.
<P>
	The hon. member's motion proposes changes to the powers, the 
method of selecting senators and the number of members by which 
a province is entitled to be represented in the Senate. Thus, the 
motion would require a constitutional amendment under the seven 
provinces with 50 per cent of the population general amending 
procedure. That is what would have to be done in order to achieve 
the amendment as proposed by the hon. member.
<P>
	This seven and fifty amendment as we call it, seven provinces 
and 50 per cent of the population represented by those seven 
provinces, must have the consent of the House of Commons and the 
legislative assemblies of two-thirds of the provinces representing 
at least 50 per cent of the population according to the most current 
general census. The Senate could in respect of such a constitutional 
amendment exercise a six-month suspensive veto.
<P>
	Once again, I would say to the hon. member that the 
Charlottetown accord contained a Senate amendment proposal 
along the lines proposed in the hon. member's motion, but it was 
defeated by a majority of Canadians in a majority of the provinces. 
There is little evidence to indicate that Canadians wish to reopen 
this constitutional debate. Other issues, such as the economy and 
job creation, are the priorities of Canadians. That is why the 
government is dealing with those issues and not the one the hon. 
member has raised today or any others like it.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	I think the hon. member would agree that despite her best 
intentions, this is not a good time to be opening a constitutional 
debate in this country, as her motion would suggest. In Quebec the 
current government of that province is unlikely to approve any 
constitutional changes, save for an amendment making the 
province an independent country.
<P>
	It is important to note that because Quebec's approval will be 
necessary to achieve the kind of Senate reform she wants, we 
should not bother pursuing it. We have to have that agreement. It is 
not just because it has to be part of the seven and fifty portion of the 
agreement; Quebec has a special arrangement.
<P>
	Quebec of all the provinces is divided into 24 electoral divisions 
for the purposes of representation in the Senate pursuant to section 
22 of the 1867 Constitution Act, the British North America Act. 
Because Quebec senators must meet their property or residence 
qualifications in  the division they represent, it could be argued that 
a scheme for Senate reform which sought to provide equal 
representation for the provinces, as this motion does, might require 
not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15666"> 15666 </A></B>
<P>
only seven of the provinces representing half the population but 
also a bilateral amendment with Quebec if the current provisions 
respecting these 24 seats were to be altered.
<P>
	Bilateral and multilateral amendments are covered by section 43 
of the Constitution Act. It provides that an amendment to the 
Constitution in relation to a provision applying to one or more but 
not all provinces requires the consent of the Senate, the House of 
Commons and the legislative assemblies of each province to which 
the amendment applies. Imagine getting that kind of agreement in 
the Senate, let alone in the provincial legislatures involved.
<P>
	Bilateral or multilateral amendments are not subject to minimum 
and maximum time limits and do not require votes by a majority of 
the members of the legislative bodies involved. Otherwise they are 
subject to the same rules as the seven and fifty amendments and the 
Senate is limited to a suspensive veto.
<P>
	Thus even if Parliament were to pursue the motion and seek to 
amend the Constitution in accordance with it, it is doubtful we 
could secure the requisite consent of the National Assembly in 
Quebec. Furthermore there is also no guarantee other provinces 
would approve of these changes.
<P>
	The Ontario government of Premier Mike Harris could hardly be 
expected to weaken the province's influence in the upper chamber 
without getting something in return, being mindful of the defeat of 
former Premier David Peterson in 1990 after he agreed to give up 
some of Ontario's seats in order to keep the Meech Lake accord 
alive. We all remember that. I thought it was a generous gesture on 
the part of the premier but it was not popular in Ontario. Mr. 
Speaker, you would remember that; you have a seat in Ontario.
<P>
	Smaller provinces like Nova Scotia and New Brunswick which 
together represent 6 per cent of the population and hold 19 per cent 
of the Senate seats are hardly likely to be enthusiastic supporters of 
the motion put forward by the hon. member for 
Mission-Coquitlam. Therefore I think there is very little reason to 
believe that these provinces would consent to any changes unless 
they got something in exchange, like a stronger constitutional 
obligation for the federal government to make equalization 
payments. I only throw that out as one suggestion out of many 
possibilities.
<P>
	Furthermore we could not contemplate radical Senate reform 
without public participation. Various groups would argue that other 
constitutional issues are far more pressing than changes in the 
Senate and should take precedence over the Senate, things like 
entrenching specific rights of aboriginal peoples in the 
Constitution.
<P>
	Again, I draw attention to the failure of the 1992 Charlottetown 
accord. This accord contained provisions for an elected, equal and 
more effective Senate, all of the things that are in this motion. It 
was rejected in a federal referendum in nine provinces and two 
territories and in a provincial referendum in Quebec. A majority of 
Canadians in a majority of provinces voted no.
<P>
	Outside Quebec, Canadians rejected the accord by 54 per cent to 
45 per cent with 1 per cent casting spoiled ballots. Quebecers voted 
55 per cent no, 42 per cent yes. In the member for 
Mission-Coquitlam's own province of British Columbia the 
Charlottetown accord suffered its most resounding defeat where 
67.2 per cent voted no. Yet she trots into the House today and puts 
forward exactly the same provision that was in the Charlottetown 
accord.
<P>
	I thought her party trumpets how democratic it is all the time. 
The will of the people in her own province was 67 per cent against 
this proposal and what does she do? She trots in here and proposes 
the same thing. I have hit another nerve and this one is from 
Saskatchewan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not believe it is proper for a 
member to use deliberately inaccurate data when he makes-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I think we are getting into debate. I am sure 
the hon. member will have his turn in a little while to refute 
whatever one hon. member or another says. We always have the 
interpretation of figures which can go either way.
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	However, I caution all hon. members in using the term. I believe 
I stand to be corrected, but ``deliberately mislead'' is an 
unparliamentary term and I would hope all hon. members would 
shy away from it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do hope these needless 
interruptions will not be taken off my time. I am pressed to finish 
what I think is an accurate speech and I am looking forward to the 
hon. member making his own instead of interrupting by arguing.
<P>
	Again, I express my shock that the hon. member for 
Mission-Coquitlam would come forward with proposals very 
similar to what was in the Charlottetown accord after that accord 
was rejected out of hand by the electors of her riding, and even 
more shockingly was rejected by her party and opposed vigorously 
by her party while some of us had the good sense to support it.
<P>
	Despite the fact that the accord contained provisions for major 
Senate reform, including measures to provide for representation of 
aboriginal peoples and new powers to veto any House of Commons 
legislation that changed taxation policy in key areas of natural 
resources, this accord failed. I stress that.
<P>
	The Charlottetown negotiations demonstrated that agreement 
among first ministers, territorial and  aboriginal leaders was 
possible, but it was not arrived at easily. Although the Reform 
Party leader referred to the accord negotiated by 17 parties as the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15667"> 15667 </A></B>
<P>
Mulroney deal, it was in fact the result of a very complex process 
that required extensive accommodation and compromises.
<P>
	Writing in the Edmonton <I>Journal</I>, former Alberta Premier Don 
Getty said: ``The package was so difficult to get, I would say it was 
almost a miracle that we were able to put it together''. Yet here the 
Reform Party, having worked against it and having striven for its 
defeat, now is pulling chunks out of it and saying it supports this 
and that, let us do this and let us do that. It shows what a lack of 
sound policy thinking it has. It keeps going back to things that are 
really dead. The Reform Party should rethink this resolution.
<P>
	I urge the hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam to consult with 
her leader again, refer him to the quote I have read from the little 
green book, and ask him what he really thinks of this motion to see 
if he does not think that perhaps it is pie in the sky, unnecessary, 
and not a reasonable thing to put forward in Canada as we know it 
today, having gone through these two recent constitutional 
discussions at great length and at great pain to our country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a few notes to keep me on track, but after some of 
the unbelievable rhetoric I heard coming from the hon. member for 
Kingston and the Islands I feel like throwing it out and 
straightening the record on all the things I would probably make 
unparliamentary reference to if I were not under complete control.
<P>
	The one comment I will make is about how the hon. member said 
that former Premier Peterson of Ontario was thrown out of office 
because he agreed to reduce some of the seats for Ontario in the 
Charlottetown accord. I suggest he was thrown out of office 
because he was a Liberal. We will soon see that happening on the 
other side here as well.
<P>
	I will deal with other parts that he erroneously brought forward 
in the content of my comments today.
<P>
	The Senate is something about which I hear a lot of complaints. 
It is an ongoing complaint within my riding. I have a tremendous 
number of people who communicate with me in one form or 
another asking why the Senate is even there and calling for its 
abolition.
<P>
	One of the things I have suggested to them is that the Senate in 
its current form does not provide much of a benefit to Canadians. It 
is in essence a rubber stamp most assuredly for the balance of this 
term of government, now that the Liberals have functional control 
of it, and carrying on for as long as it takes the balance to shift 
again once we have managed to send the Liberals to the other side 
of the House, chasing after Mr. Peterson. There is no need for it to 
be a rubber stamp, but that is the way the system works currently. 
We are saying rather  than abolish it, change it into something that 
is far more democratic.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands, the Prime 
Minister, and many others who occasionally sound out on the other 
side of the House keep talking about the Charlottetown accord and 
how we rejected not the Charlottetown accord, but the triple E 
Senate. The Charlottetown accord was not about a triple E Senate. 
That was a little carrot put in there, which was kind of like putting a 
bad tasting pill in something sweet to try to attract us.
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party gave full credit to any part of the 
Charlottetown accord that was worthwhile. We said there were 
some good parts. At any place I went to address the Charlottetown 
accord, the first thing I commented on were the goods parts, not all 
the garbage that was in there. Believe me, there was plenty. Some 
of the parts were actually good.
<P>
	It is absolutely ludicrous that the Liberals, every time we try to 
bring up something that has some linkage to the old Charlottetown 
accord, say it was offered to us on a platter and we turned it down.
<P>
	The are three parts to a triple E Senate. First is the elected 
Senate. We could have that part now without any constitutional 
amendment. It takes absolutely no change. It takes the co-operation 
of the Prime Minister and his Liberal cronies to agree to do what 
the majority of Canadians would like to see.
<P>
	We have already seen it. We have seen the democratic election of 
Senator Stan Waters in Alberta. As other vacancies have occurred, 
we have called on the Prime Minister to allow that province to 
designate who it would like him to appoint by allowing it to hold a 
democratic election, as Alberta did, instead of appointing some 
Liberal hack he had some obligation to look after for one reason or 
another. The majority of Albertans said we want Stan Waters.
<P>
	Why not start this now? The reason is that the Liberals would not 
have any place to pay off all the people they have obligations to and 
to put future obligations on people who they place in the Senate.
<P>
	Many senators not only could get elected but would be willing to 
stand for election. It would give them the credibility they may be 
due but have lost because most people look on the Senate simply as 
being loaded up with friends and people who have special ties to 
the party in power, whatever that party might be.
<P>
	What does electing senators provide? It provides regional 
representation from people who do not owe their allegiance to their 
patron but instead can represent the people of the region they come 
from.
<P>
	The second part of a triple E Senate is equality, the equalness of 
the Senate. It calls for an equal number of  senators from each 
province. We live in a country that goes by the concept in 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15668"> 15668 </A></B>
<P>
government of representation by population, the ultimate definition 
of democracy which should not be changed.
<P>
	There are problems with almost every system and rep by pop has 
its problems, particularly in a country where 90 per cent of the 
population lives within 50 miles of the American border in a huge 
geographic area. Further, a large portion of them live in the central 
part of the country because that is where the original development 
started before moving westward. There is an imbalance in the 
distribution and the needs of the people in the different regions.
<P>
	What we need in the Senate is some kind of regional balance to 
provide control over the problems created by rep by pop. This 
might be a difficult concept for centralists but there is a growing 
number of regional concerns that the government and others do not 
address.
<P>
	The Quebec referendum is a direct result of what happens when 
these regional concerns are not addressed by Parliament. The 
number of senators does have to be large. Two people represent 
states in the United States that have population bases as large or 
larger than this entire country. They do it quite happily with two 
people. I do not hear complaints from California, from Texas or 
from New York that they have the same number of senators as 
Rhode Island. I refute what the previous member from the Bloc 
Quebecois had to say.
<P>
	Finally, we get to the third part, the effective part of triple E. The 
Senate must have sufficient powers to be able to provide a regional 
perspective and address regional problems created by legislation 
without being beholden to their patron.
<P>
	A majority of the House, as was referred to by the member for 
Kingston and the Islands, is not necessarily a majority. A majority 
from the Liberal Party is the word of the Prime Minister. We have 
seen that with several bills already where some members in the 
Liberal Party had the audacity to vote according to the direction of 
their constituents and were thrown out of their committees for it. 
That is not a majority. It is not democracy. That is autocratic rule. 
That is what a Senate has to be able to overcome. A triple E Senate 
gives them the tools and the power to do that.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	This does create a dilemma for members of the Liberal Party. I 
can understand that because they would lose this tremendous 
source of patronage appointments, a place to shove their friends 
and other people to whom they have obligations.
<P>
	There was a vacancy for the chair on the board of referees in my 
riding. I heard through very good sources that the former assistant 
campaign manager of the Liberal candidate was being appointed to 
that position. In  fact, he came to us and told us not to bother 
putting any names forward because he was getting it.
<P>
	I raised the matter in the House and eventually it became a big 
issue. I certainly was talking about patronage. The individual was 
interviewed by the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> and was asked whether it was a 
patronage appointment. When asked how he would respond to that, 
he said: ``What is wrong with patronage? How else are we going to 
get anyone to join our party?'' How else indeed.
<P>
	I am not suggesting that all senators or not good. There are some 
good people in the Senate, but that is more from good luck than 
good management. I am simply pointing out that the Senate does 
not do the job most Canadians need and want it to do. There is an 
opportunity for us to start now with that triple E part by having 
elected people going to the Senate.
<P>
	Let us start with an idea that does not need any constitutional 
change and then branch out from there. Before we know it, the 
place may even become fully democratic.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
private member's motion before us proposes changes to the powers 
of the Senate, the method of selecting senators and the number of 
senators by which the provinces are entitled to be represented in the 
Senate.
<P>
	Clearly what needs to be understood here is that the third party is 
asking that there be constitutional change. If there is one thing 
which is absolutely clear, it is that Canadians have said they do not 
want constitutional change now. They want to focus on priorities. 
They do not want us to focus on constitutional change. They clearly 
expect, and rightfully so, for us to focus on their priorities which 
are jobs and economic growth.
<P>
	The hon. member talks about regional problems, regional 
priorities and regional concerns. One thing we can be positive 
about is that all Canadians no matter where they live in Canada are 
concerned with jobs and economic growth. It is time to focus on 
exactly those.
<P>
	The thing I find so difficult about this type of motion is that 
members of the third party had an opportunity to support exactly 
what this motion is asking for in the Charlottetown accord but they 
chose not to. They had their opportunity but instead chose political 
opportunism ahead of principle.
<P>
	The Reform Party stated in Montreal on October 15 that it 
wanted to change federalism only through administrative 
agreements, not constitutional talks. Each of the 20 changes 
proposed by the Reform Party could be accomplished without 
comprehensive federal-provincial negotiations of the sort that led 
to the failed Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords.
<P>
	What we are seeing here is an absolute flip-flop. The 
introduction of this motion shows once again the  inconsistency of 
the Reform Party. It adopts policies based on which direction the 
wind is blowing at the time. Certainly the member must realize that 
her motion would require constitutional amendments. I ask: What 
will it be, constitutional amendments or Reform Party 
administrative agreements? The Reform Party must make up its 
mind. This is an incredibly inconsistent statement.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15669"> 15669 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, unlike the Reform Party, our government believes 
in working with Canadians to improve the effectiveness and 
responsiveness of our federal institutions. We have done many of 
those things already. We have taken a number of steps, for example 
introduced parliamentary reforms to allow MPs to better represent 
their constituents, overhauled the committee process to allow for 
greater input, and so on.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	I close by saying that Burt Brown of Alberta is the strongest 
proponent of a triple E Senate. Everyone in Alberta recognizes that 
clearly. He is being really responsible. Today he is not talking 
about a triple E Senate. If members know Burt Brown they will 
know that he ploughed a giant message in his fields with the words: 
``It is better together''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is conventional 
wisdom among the people who sit at my right and certainly those 
who sit at my extreme left, no pun intended, that the best thing to 
do with the Senate would be to do away with it and save the people 
$40 million annually.
<P>
	That could be done but it would be a very shortsighted move. We 
need a real Senate, not the old people's home that we have over 
there now, to protect the common people from the House of 
Commons or, to put it perhaps more succinctly, to protect the 
public from the PMO.
<P>
	Every meaningful federal union on earth, save ours, has an 
elected upper house to protect the rights of the regions. If we look 
at what has happened in Canada in the last five years, we see there 
have been two instances where the existence of a real Senate would 
have permanently blocked some very unsavoury parliamentary 
legislation. The first instance was the infamous GST which passed 
because there was a Senate that could be easily manipulated by the 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	The second one has already been alluded to by my colleague and 
that is Bill C-68, the people control bill. They call it the crime 
control bill but it is a masquerade. If we had a real Senate 
representing the regions that bill would be consigned to the darkest 
corner of hell where it belongs.
<P>
	In the last 50 years there has been no greater public outcry than 
there has been over that specific piece of legislation. We have the 
spectacle of the governments of four provinces and two territories 
lining up together with the protesting citizenry, demanding that the 
particular  bill be stopped. Yet, because the Prime Minister has the 
ability to manipulate the Senate, to stack it, nothing can be done. 
There will never be a real democratic system in the country that 
reflects the views of the regions or of individual citizens unless we 
have the opportunity to elect two Houses, and both Houses should 
have power.
<P>
	This legislation will almost certainly be proclaimed into law. 
The only hope we have now would be to get a Reform government 
to repeal it.
<P>
	I must confess that before I came to this place I was a bit of a 
Senate basher. I felt that the other place had no place. However I 
have attended some of the committee hearings that it holds and I 
must say that they compare very favourably with the ones we hold. 
The problem is that those committees represent an illegitimate 
body and therefore cannot make recommendations that have 
weight.
<P>
	Even if we cannot get triple E, surely we should be electing our 
senators. I do not know how many people are aware that in the 
United States of America, which has triple E, there was a period of 
more than a century when all its senators were appointed. They 
were appointed by the state governors. The elected Senate in the 
United States devolved from an act by the Oregon legislature when 
it demanded that its senators in that one state be elected. It grew 
from there and eventually they changed the constitution of the 
country to accommodate the new realities.
<P>
	Changes can be made. In the long term I agree with my colleague 
that we must have triple E. In the short term I would plead with the 
government to get off its high horse and start allowing the 
provinces to elect senators to be appointed subject to their election.
