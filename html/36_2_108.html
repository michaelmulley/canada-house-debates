<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>QUEEN'S OWN CAMERON HIGHLANDERS OF CANADA 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am honoured today to present petitions which were presented to 
a number of Manitoba MPs on April 20 at Minto Armouries in the 
regimental museum of the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders.  These 
signatures were gathered by the St. Andrew's Society of Winnipeg. 
A number of other Manitoba MPs over this day and the following 
few days may well be presenting similar petitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners ask parliament to reject the Department of 
National Defence plans to abolish the Queen's Own Cameron 
Highlanders of Canada or to amalgamate it with another militia 
regiment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They believe that Manitoba's only highland kilted regiment must 
be retained as an important symbol of the province's great 
Scottish heritage. The Camerons are extremely useful to all 
citizens of Manitoba.  Beside their excellent record in war and 
peace keeping missions, they protect Manitobans on the home front 
in events like the great floods of 1950 and 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also believe that a strong militia is the base on which 
capable national defence is built.  Therefore, any necessary cuts 
in government spending should be done in other ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might note that today is a particularly appropriate day to 
present such a petition.  This is the 56th anniversary of the 
invasion of Normandy, the anniversary of D-Day.  It was during 
the Normandy campaign that many Cameron Highlanders returned to 
Europe to seek the liberation of their comrades who had been 
captured in the Dieppe raid on August 19, 1942. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
too rise, as did the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona, to 
present a petition on behalf of the Queen's Own Cameron 
Highlanders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 42-page petition contains 2,684 signatures.  Again, as was 
most eloquently noted by the member for Winnipeg—Transcona, the 
Department of National Defence currently is looking at ways of 
rationalizing its defence budget.  We are saying that the militia 
regiment in particular is not one of those area in which the 
Department of National Defence should be looking.  I speak with 
some knowledge having a CFB in my constituency, as well as the 26 
Field Regiment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the bottom part of this petition, it does say quite 
succinctly that a strong militia is the base on which capable 
national defence is built.  Therefore, any necessary cuts in 
government spending should be done in other fashions. 
I support that and table the petition before the House.

in Canada of a bio-artificial kidney.  This brings the number of 
signatures to well over 10,000 on petitions which I have 
presented to the House on this subject.  This petition was 
started by Ken Sharp, who lives in my riding.

from end-stage kidney disease and that, although kidney dialysis 
and kidney transplants help and they are important life saving 
treatments, there are difficulties with providing sufficient 
dialysis service and difficulties in providing sufficient organs 
for transplantation.  Therefore, the petitioners call upon 
parliament to support research toward an alternative to kidney 
dialysis and kidney transplants, and that is the bio-artificial 
kidney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research is being conducted at various places in the United

at risk act, which is before the House at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners ask that the bill be strengthened and they make 
the following suggestions.  A legal listing of species should be 
done by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in 
Canada, COSEWIC.  Politicians should not make this decision. 
Habitat protection should be automatic.  When the provinces fail 
to provide protection for species at risk, the federal power to 
step in must be mandatory and not discretionary as outlined at 
the moment in Bill C-33.  Finally, they ask for a guarantee of 
available and adequate funding to support stewardship options, 
which of course are attempts to protect habitat for animals and 
plants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are really saying that they have looked at Bill 
C-33 and it is not adequate.  I mention in passing that our NDP

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK29">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House call for the 
establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into the 
mismanagement of grants and contributions in the Department of 
Human Resources Development, and into any attempts to control the 
disclosure of this mismanagement to the public. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, I am not entirely happy that this motion 
had to be brought forward today.  I would have hoped after all 
these weeks that the government would have been able to provide 
clear and satisfactory answers to the very difficult and 
troubling situation in the human resources department, the 
largest department of government.  The department handles huge 
amounts of public money, up to $60 billion a year.  It handles by 
far the most public money of any department.  It is a department 
which is more focused than almost any other on meeting the needs 
of Canadians in theory and in principle, but unfortunately not in 
deed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our motion today calls for the establishment of an independent 
inquiry into the mismanagement of grants and contributions by 
this department and also, unfortunately and sadly, attempts to 
control the disclosure of this mismanagement to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We first called for an independent inquiry on February 8 in a 
letter from the Leader of the Official Opposition to the Auditor 
General of Canada.  Since then there have been repeated calls 
from the opposition and the public for an independent inquiry, as 
very troubling discrepancies and lack of full disclosure 
continued to surface. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three reasons we believe an independent inquiry is 
necessary.  The first reason is that enormous public interests 
are at stake.  The grants and contributions program in HRDC 
spends over $3 billion a year.  That is $3 billion which is hard 
earned by Canadians and taken from their pockets by the 
government. That is $3 billion which could be spent on a variety 
of initiatives that are of importance to Canadians, including 
health care, but this money is not spent on those types of 
things.  That $3 billion really represents the tip of the iceberg 
because almost every other government department has grants and 
contributions spending totalling over $13 billion each and every 
year.  That is $13 billion which is not available to Canadians 
for other priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a small matter when it comes to the public interest. 
An independent inquiry is very necessary if the public interest 
is not being well served by the grants and contributions 
management and programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason we believe there needs to be an independent 
inquiry is to restore trust in parliament and in the institutions 
of government.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Liberal surveys are now showing that government 
mismanagement of public money is looming large in the public 
concern.  There has been a serious and troubling erosion of the 
public's trust and confidence in the way their money, their 
affairs and their interests are being managed and looked after by 
the government, and, by extension, all of us in the House of 
Commons who were elected to serve the public, to manage their 
affairs and to act in their best interests.  The public is 
clearly questioning, and rightly so, whether their interests are 
being protected, cared for and looked after.  They have a right 
to have their questions laid to rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third reason we believe an independent inquiry is needed is 
because there is a long and unfortunately growing list of 
fundamental unanswered questions and discrepancies without full 
disclosure of relevant information.  To be blunt, there is an 
information management strategy on the part of government to 
withhold, to cover and to keep full information and full 
disclosure about the situation not only from members of the 
House, but the public.  There have been many examples and 
instances of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could give a very full and comprehensive history of what has 
happened in HRDC.  Unfortunately, my time does not allow it. 
However, my colleagues and others in the opposition will be 
bringing forward many of those concerns today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the time I have, I would like to focus on the withholding of 
very basic information about the mismanagement of grants and 
contributions in HRDC and why that is so troubling.  I would like 
to emphasize that the audit which uncovered this terrible 
situation had the most damning rundown of statistics about the 
lack of controls and safeguards on the spending of public money 
in that department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To name two figures:  in 80% of the projects files there was no 
financial tracking of public money released into the hands of 
grant recipients; in 87% of the files there was no supervision of 
the projects.  Any auditor or any common sense person would tell 
us that when there is no oversight, no controls, no safeguards, 
no supervision of the way money is spent, the potential and the 
actual likelihood of fraud, abuse and misspending is very high. 
There have been many instances which have come to light, in spite 
of the choke hold the government has placed on access to 
information requests and other documents, to show that this is in 
fact what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This audit has not been a new phenomenon.  On June 14 the 
interim audit results were presented to the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Did the hon. member 
for Calgary—Nose Hill indicate that she was splitting her time? 
I do not recall.  If so, I need to give her a two minute warning.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This audit first came to light on June 14.  Although it was an 
interim result, it was obviously very explosive.  The deputy 
minister herself wrote to the minister some weeks later saying 
that since the interim audit results were released in June there 
had been very vigorous efforts to come up with some kind of a 
plan to deal with this.  That has been confirmed by the deputy 
minister herself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 14 the time bomb started ticking. By July 14, a month 
later, there was a proposed action plan.  On July 19 briefing 
notes were e-mailed to all HRDC managers.  On July 27 and 28 
there was a two day meeting of 40 top HRDC officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present minister was sworn in on August 3.  On August 9 she 
asked for a briefing but she said, and I commend her for this, 
“I do not want to know all about the nuts and bolts of this 
department.  I want to know what the hot issues are, what balls 
are in the air, what the key difficulties are”.  That was on 
August 9.  She claims in spite of that she knew nothing about 
this audit until November 17.  She waited for two further months 
before she breathed a word of this to the public and did so only 
two days after we put in an access request for this audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This circumstance alone demonstrates to members of parliament 
and to the public that there is a culture and attitude of 
cover-up, of hiding, of denying problems and of whitewashing that 
cannot be allowed to stand. I urge members of the House for the 
sake of the public and for the sake of the integrity of our 
system and our parliament to support this motion to establish an 
independent inquiry into this matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques,

and comment period because I would prefer to hear what the hon. 
member has to say.  I know that she has extensive experience on 
the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and the 
Status of Persons with Disabilities, on which I have also sat 
for a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find interesting in this whole situation is that, since 
the crisis first hit, there has been one piece of evidence after 
another of the need to get to the bottom of things. 
I am not saying that everything that has been done is deserving 
of criticism, but there is no doubt that we must get to the 
bottom of this, because the Canadian public has completely lost 
faith in the present and previous ministers and in the process 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member enlighten us a bit on what she thinks of the 
fact that, after engaging in a partisan spending operation, the 
government is now carrying out a cover-up operation 
designed—this is the only reason I can see—to get ready for the 
next election.  This strikes me as a very bad decision, given 
public opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member please elaborate on this? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of the very 
interesting circumstances is the unity of the four opposition 
parties in this whole matter.  This matter is not one in which 
partisanship has played a big role.  It is one in which 
reasonable, thoughtful and professional representatives of the 
people have grown increasingly uneasy, then alarmed, and then 
outraged at the non-answers in dealing with the HRDC grants and 
contributions audit file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on for at least an hour on the unanswered questions, 
the instances where the minister's story has changed, the times 
where undated documents have come forward out of thin air when 
the minister has been in a tight corner unable to explain some of 
the dealings with public money that took place under her watch.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One instance is the Modes Conili grant where three-quarters of a 
million dollars was given at the behest of a Liberal member. That 
Liberal member then got $7,000 for her election war chest. That 
three-quarters of a million dollars created not one new job.  It 
was simply given to a company which hired all the workers from 
another company.  It was the most transparent shift of workers 
from company <I>A</I> to company <I>B</I> greased with 
three-quarters of a million of our dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister was asked about it, she went through four 
stages.  She asked what we were complaining about, that people 
are working.  Then when it came out that no new jobs were 
created, that it was simply a shift of workers, she said, “I did 
not say that jobs were created.  I just said people had applied 
and they were working”.  Then it came out that this had been 
questioned and that an internal investigation had been done.  The 
minister then said, “Oh well, the investigation said that there 
was no problem with this”, but then she refused to release the 
documents of the investigation to the House. If the documents 
cleared the situation, why were the documents never tabled?  They 
were hidden.  They have been withheld to this day.  Then finally 
the minister said, “The RCMP have been called in.  Now there is 
going to be an investigation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is only one instance of the outrageous lack of transparency 
and credibility the minister has shown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my opinion only but I believe the best way to get to the 
bottom of this is by an all party committee of the House, the 
same number of members of parliament from each party, delegated 
to look into this matter with full authority to look at any and 
all documents they consider relevant.  I suggest that it be MPs 
because we are accountable to the people of Canada.  This is what 
we have been hired to do, to look after their interests. The same 
number from each party would mean that no party would dominate, 
partisanship would not carry the day.  It would be done right in 
the public eye because we are in the public eye.  The sooner we 
get on with that job, the better. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member who preceded me.  She 
laid the groundwork and foundation for the reason a public 
inquiry is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue involves virtually every Canadian.  It involves every 
member of parliament.  It is an indictment not only of the 
minister of HRDC, but the Prime Minister and every other member 
of the governing party in the House today. By reflection, there 
is an indication, almost a draining over to any politician which 
makes us look as though we are all like that.  I want to make it 
abundantly clear that we are not all like that. One of the 
reasons we want this inquiry is to be sure that the public 
understands clearly what it is the minister did not do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask ourselves why the inquiry is needed.  I would 
like to put it this way.  The minister was supposed to respond in 
a way that was courteous and helpful, to provide service to her 
clients and to give a clear accounting to the taxpayers for the 
money that she or her department dispensed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did she do?  She bent the rules and generally administered 
in a manner that was in no way accountable to the taxpayers. That 
means her work was pointless.  Her work was supposed to be 
accountable to the people and it was pointless. When people do 
pointless work, the production of whatever it is that is produced 
is pointless.  In the dictionary that is known as a boondoggle. 
That is what there is in this particular department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member indicated what the audit found on the first 
instance.  The auditor general then made a concluding statement. 
He observed that there had not been proper financial monitoring 
and there had not been an application of clear and transparent 
reporting to parliament.  Because of that the auditor general 
said on March 23, 2000: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Large amounts of public funds were spent without the appropriate 
controls, making it difficult to know whether the funds were used 
as intended, spent wisely and produced the desired results.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I cannot help but read into the record some of the 
examples of what has happened.  I have before me 28 examples.  We 
do not have time to go into each of them.  We will only go into 
three of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example is very interesting.  Harding Carpets in Brantford, 
Ontario received over $400,000 in job creation grants in 1997-98 
and went bankrupt in 1998.  Did this produce the desired result? 
Clearly not.  The jobs that were created, if any were created, 
were of very short duration and today the company is bankrupt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two other examples.  The first has to do with 80% of a 
$1.6 million job creation grant that is in support of a project 
to revitalize the riverfront in the Deputy Prime Minister's 
riding of Windsor West.  Actually 80% of that money is being 
spent on materials.  It is supposed to be a job creation 
contribution.  It is not for materials in the first instance, yet 
well over half, in fact 80% which is four-fifths, is being spent 
on materials.  It is mismanagement and misapplication of funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member referred to the MP for Ahuntsic in Montreal who 
received $7,000 in campaign contributions in 1997 from a clothing 
company called Modes Conili for which she had helped secure 
$719,850 in transitional jobs fund grants.  She gave it the grant 
and two months later she received a $7,000 contribution for her 
campaign.  We begin to wonder.  The hon. member pointed out that 
no new jobs were created.  In fact it was a transfer of existing 
jobs from an existing company into a new company that had just 
been created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are three examples of why we believe a public inquiry 
should take place.  It is so we all know what really happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a consequence, treasury board has come up with a new set of 
guidelines.  I said new guidelines but actually if we read the 
document, they are not new guidelines at all; they are a revision 
of existing guidelines.  I would like to read a couple of the 
headings and a few descriptions of what the revised guidelines 
say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be effective management practices. This means due 
diligence to ensure assistance is approved only for eligible 
recipients and that payment is made only once all the required 
terms and conditions have been met.  It shall be a results based 
management and what is the first word?  Robust.  A robust results 
based accountability framework must be provided when seeking 
treasury board approval of program terms and conditions including 
program objectives and expected results, performance indicators 
and milestones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spending shall be responsible which means increased 
transparency.  The assessment criteria used to assess recipient 
eligibility and entitlement must be determined in advance, 
communicated to the public and applied consistently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There shall be effective control.  What does this mean? 
According to treasury board it means a more rigorous review of 
the proposed terms and conditions of grant and contribution 
programs will be undertaken by treasury board secretariat prior 
to submission to treasury board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are beautifully revised guidelines.  Very similar 
guidelines already existed while the minister was running the 
department and she did not use those guidelines.  She bent those 
guidelines.  The question is will she bend these guidelines or 
will she observe them?  The issue is not whether they are good 
guidelines. These guidelines are good ones.  The issue is whether 
they are being observed and practised.  That becomes the issue. 
That is where the accountability has to be registered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize very clearly that some very serious 
questions have been raised on the performance of the minister. 
This has caused the treasury board to begin to react.  It is a 
reflection not only on the operations of HRDC but also on the 
operations of the treasury board and the Prime Minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the official opposition have to say when it presented 
its report and responded to the report of the committee?  It is 
very worth while to look at some of its 14 recommendations.  I 
certainly do not have time to go into all of them, but I do wish 
to deal with a couple of them that primarily concern political 
interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the committee reviewed all these grants and contributions 
it discovered that there had been direct and implied political 
interference in the granting of some of the contributions.  The 
official opposition has shown that the number of project 
approvals and the amounts approved rose sharply at election time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lo and behold, could it possibly be true that the number of 
contributions made to the various communities had something to do 
with an election?  They happened to go to ridings where the 
elected MPs were Liberals and part of the present government. 
Could it possibly be?  That is exactly what we discovered and 
that is what the committee discovered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have time to get into all the other things, but I 
should like to refer to a speech made just recently by the Prime 
Minister in Europe.  I will read a few sentences.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the challenges all countries must grapple with is ensuring 
that all children get a good start in life and that families are 
given the support they need for the healthy development of their 
children, so that they are ready to learn and to seize 
opportunity later in life.  Some argue that large, 
across-the-board tax cuts are sufficient.  The Government of 
Canada has chosen a different path.  While parents and families 
have the primary role in raising children, governments have a 
responsibility to ensure that the necessary supports are also in 
place. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to talk about the child benefit program.  The big 
point here is not economics.  There is a totally different issue 
at stake here:  the integrity of people, the character of 
individuals.  We need to develop character so that people live by 
principles which clearly differentiate between that which is 
right and that which is wrong.  What the minister has done 
reflects that it is not right to do the kinds of things he is 
doing.  Therefore I should like now to amend the motion that was 
just presented.  I would move: 
<A NAME="LINK32">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by adding after the word “public” 
the words “and that the Commission be required to lay before the 
House of Commons a final report no later than December 11, 
2000”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The amendment is in 
order.  Debate is on the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with some interest to what the member 
opposite was saying.  On behalf of the constituents of 
Waterloo—Wellington, and indeed other Canadians to whom I have 
talked over the course of this discussion, I wanted to say that 
whenever members opposite, and more to the point, the reformed 
alliance people, run out of steam on an issue such as this one, 
it seems to me that one of their last tricks is to call for a 
public inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they have done over the course of time on this very 
important debate is quite shameful. 
They have repeated the nonsense about a billion dollars missing 
and the business about a boondoggle, which is totally groundless, 
totally false, totally inaccurate and totally without base.  They 
have continued to repeat that mantra in the most egregious 
fashion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find objectionable is that they are not even big enough 
to admit that they were wrong.  What they try to do now is to 
spin it out.  The member for Calgary—Nose Hill, with her 15 
seconds of fame in the whole issue, wants to keep spinning it out 
and is in the process of doing a job on the whole grants and 
contributions business that is inconsistent with what the 
regions, the provinces and the communities of this great country 
want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask a question of the member opposite who just spoke. 
Why is it that in your usual extremist fashion, which is always 
consistent with the reformed alliance position, you cannot be big 
enough to admit that you were wrong and that you should apologize 
to the Canadian people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Order, please. 
Members know that it is not necessarily just the custom but is 
obligatory to address each other through the Chair.  It exists 
for a specific reason.  I think this question indicates the 
necessity of addressing each other through the Chair.  With that 
admonishment, we will go to the hon. member for Kelowna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe the evidence 
speaks for itself.  We have absolutely nothing to apologize for 
as far as the management style of members of this party are 
concerned.  The hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill has done her 
homework well.  She has been very thorough in her study and in 
her analysis of what has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite suggested that as a last trick we 
resorted to the request for a public inquiry.  As a matter of 
fact an independent inquiry was asked for as early as February 8, 
2000.  It is anything but a last minute affair.  The hon. member 
needs to know that what has happened here is that the minister 
thumbed her nose at parliament and said members of the House do 
not matter and that the people of Canada do not matter.  The real 
issue is that the hon. minister should have been given permission 
to resign her position and her portfolio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister in charge is actually protecting the Prime 
Minister.  A lot of it points to the Prime Minister because he is 
responsible for what his ministers are doing.  If his ministers 
are not doing what treasury board and the Prime Minister say the 
guidelines should be, and if he does not permit the minister to 
admit that she was wrong and will either change her ways or 
resign her portfolio, he is the one who is to blame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite should recognize that before he makes 
blatant statements on extremism he should look in the mirror and 
ask who is extreme.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
splitting my time with the member for Peterborough.  I am very 
happy to have the chance to take part in this debate because I 
would like to help set the record straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For almost five months now, the House has witnessed the same old 
story being trotted out almost on a daily basis by the 
opposition.  The government has been subjected to all kinds of 
hearsay and all kinds of claims.  I would like to ask the House 
to step back and take a look at the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us calls for an inquiry into grants and 
contributions at Human Resources Development Canada.  The first 
reality is that the issue of grants and contributions has already 
been subject to an inquiry, that is an examination by the House 
through its Standing Committee on Human Resources Development. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee has spent almost four months on this project, day 
after day, and just last Thursday tabled its report with its 
recommendations.  The government will respond to that report 
within the 150 days provided by the rules.  That is the first 
inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reality is that the issue continues to be thoroughly 
examined by the auditor general, an independent officer of 
parliament.  The auditor general has promised to report to 
parliament in the fall.  That is the second inquiry into this 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third reality is that it has been examined by treasury board 
and by independent private sector firms.  As a result, the 
President of the Treasury Board announced the implementation of a 
revised policy on grants and contributions, strengthening the 
management of public spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From three separate angles the public interest is being 
protected by parliamentarians, by the auditor general and by the 
officials of treasury board measuring all spending against their 
strengthened guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not have had this issue if not for the fact that the 
government is always looking for ways to do a better job.  That 
is why HRDC, like other departments, does internal audits looking 
for opportunities to improve what it does and how it does it. 
Last year one of those audits focused on the management of grants 
and contributions.  We all know what it said, but I will repeat 
it because the opposition seems to be incapable of remembering a 
few simple facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The audit found paperwork missing, not money but paperwork.  It 
found this fact to be far too common across the department. 
Paperwork matters, particularly when it relates to ensuring 
accountability for the proper spending of Canadians' money. The 
department appreciated this and put together a number of steps to 
respond.  When it took those steps to the minister, she said they 
were not strong enough and asked for a stronger response to 
ensure full accountability to Canadians.  The department 
understood the priorities the minister placed on the matter and 
brought forward a six point action plan that the minister 
announced on January 19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From one end of Canada to the other, HRDC staff began by 
reviewing the 461 files covered by the audit.  Then they reviewed 
17,000 active files and made sure they were all in line with the 
new guidelines of the six point plan.  The result of this file by 
file review was that out of $1.5 billion in projects, $6,500 is 
still left as overpayments to be recovered.  That is only a 
fraction of 1%.  The department did not just look at the projects 
already in place.  It put in place new conditions to make sure 
that every payment meets all the financial and administrative 
requirements before it goes out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HRDC also set about to train staff on the new guidelines and to 
make the new expectations clear.  That training has reached about 
3,000 employees across Canada.  There has been accountability for 
the action plan.  The minister has already released a progress 
report as she promised.  There is a special team in place to 
track performance.  The minister has already told the House on 
various occasions that the auditor general and others would carry 
out their own reviews. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department wanted to get the best advice on making the 
action plan a success, and that is why it worked with the auditor 
general, Price Waterhouse, the private sector blue ribbon 
committee, the Standards Advisory Board of the Comptroller 
General, and Deloitte & Touche.  The minister said the department 
would report to Canadians and to parliamentarians regularly. Even 
the most meanspirited critic would have to say that commitment 
has been met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has there ever been an issue in parliament where the information 
has been more open and transparent than this one?  Let us take 
access to information requests. In the year 1998-99 HRDC got 531 
access to information requests.  In 1999-2000 that jumped to 
1,073 or twice the volume of the previous year.  Fully half of 
those requests came in the last 10 weeks of the fiscal year.  It 
is not surprising that as a result HRDC released almost 115,000 
pages of documentation under access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A researcher in the office of the Leader of the Opposition told 
CPAC that the department had one of the best access to 
information offices in Ottawa. 
He is not the only one who believes that to be true.  The 
information commissioner has also cited HRDC as an example of a 
department that takes its access obligations seriously.  Those 
accolades make sense because this is the minister who put more 
than 10,000 pages of detail on specific grants and contribution 
projects onto the Internet.  All that transparency is a far cry 
from the histrionics and wailing that goes on among the 
opposition about information.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize, a substantial set of reviews of the work of HRDC 
on grants and contributions are already taking place.  HRDC is 
working hard to meet the avalanche of access requests.  Reporting 
to Canadians on the progress of the action plan is taking place 
on a regular basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that adds up to a clear and sincere commitment to give 
Canadians the facts about grants and contributions and a 
determined effort to get the management of these programs up to 
the level where it ought to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this just about paper?  Of course not.  It is about 
accountability.  It is also about continuing the effectiveness of 
some very special programs and services.  We believe grants and 
contributions are useful ways to put some taxpayers' money to 
work in partnerships; that is, to leverage it to get better 
results for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to stand up and defend programs that build 
partnerships with other governments, with community agencies and 
with many other groups in our society to get some important work 
done, work that Canadians want their government to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary does a 
manful job of trying to whitewash this situation.  I commend her 
for carrying out her duties so diligently.  Unfortunately, she is 
not able to cover many of the unanswered questions and concerns 
that have been raised on this whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the more troubling aspects of the grants and 
contributions mismanagement is that new information and instances 
of questionable administration and dealings in the department 
keep coming up day after day.  We do not even have to go back and 
revisit some of the issues that have not been resolved in past 
weeks because something new comes up each week.  Yesterday, a 
briefing of the minister came to light where the minister 
apparently asked her officials to brief her on hot issues.  We 
knew that the audit was a hot issue at the time yet the minister 
claimed that her officials did not bother to tell her about it 
and that was okay with her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A direct request from the minister was completely disrespected 
by the officials and the minister says “I asked for hot issues. 
This was a hot issue and they did not mention it, but that is 
appropriate.  I did not need to know.  My leadership was not 
important even though there was a ticking time bomb”.  That 
happened just yesterday.  I could go back on all the days where 
the most incredible, outrageous circumstances came to light that 
were completely unanswered by the government or the answer was 
absolutely ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the parliamentary secretary explain the fact that access 
to information requests to this department are now not given to 
the opposition within the 30 days required by law?  They are 
routinely— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I must interrupt the 
hon. member.  The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown:</B>  Mr. Speaker, starting with the end of 
the member's question first, one of the reasons that it is 
becoming almost impossible to get access to information requests 
out within 30 days is because of the avalanche of requests that 
are coming forward.  We do not know exactly where these are 
coming from, but from the tone of some of the requests one could 
guess that many of them are coming forward from the opposition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that?  Does the opposition want to look forward?  Does 
the opposition want to take advantage of the new accountability 
measures around spending on grants and contributions?  No.  The 
opposition is focused, as usual, backwards, looking back into the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really glad the member described what was bothering her 
which came out in the news yesterday.  It gives Canadians the 
opportunity to see what went on in the committee.  While members 
on the government side were trying to fix this particular 
situation so it would never happen again, the members of the 
opposition were acting like children in a schoolyard wondering 
who said what to whom and who was at what meeting.  It was like 
the gossip capital of the world.  It did no one any good as far 
as making sure that Canadian tax dollars are well spent and 
invested in Canadians, as they are supposed to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole thing about who did what to whom, on what day and 
what day a memo was sent is just so wasteful.  In a way it sort 
of dirties up the whole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been accused of whitewashing.  I am trying to state the 
facts as I know them in a clear way and keep my vision on the 
future as to how to make things work better for Canadians.  I am 
not obsessed with looking backwards.  If that is considered to be 
a whitewash, then so be it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians want to march toward hope. They want to know 
that their government members are working hard on their behalf to 
make sure things work out well with their tax dollars.  That is 
exactly what we are doing and we are being assisted by the 
auditor general.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to join in the debate this morning, although I have to 
say that I regret that I have to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the House of Commons will be spending a full day of 
activity considering a motion that there should be a full public 
inquiry into the grants and contributions matter at HRDC when 
only last week the largest standing committee in the House of 
Commons tabled a report in the House based on hearings begun in 
January. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it would be possible for the House to conduct 
more open and full public hearings for four or five months than 
has taken place on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responding, for example, to opposition requests, virtually every 
one of those public hearings, only in the sense, as are all our 
committees, that records were kept and published, but they were 
also televised and run on several occasions in real time on more 
than two channels, in every case run more than once following the 
closing of the House of Commons itself, and ran a full four or 
five months of public inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that the vast majority of witnesses who appeared 
before that committee, and given the time constraints we 
certainly met with many witnesses from various parts of the 
country, were there at the request of the opposition members of 
the committee.  All parties were able to submit lists.  We went 
through as many of those lists as was possible.  The majority of 
people were opposition witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to this public inquiry that we have just finished, I 
have to say that it attracted an enormous amount of public 
attention.  I cannot imagine a public inquiry that could have 
received more coverage on the front page of newspapers, on the 
editorial pages of newspapers, as the first issue in television 
and radio newscasts and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are debating whether there should be a full and 
independent inquiry on something which is very important, but to 
which parliament has already allocated an enormous amount of 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one way today's motion can be looked at, and people watching 
this debate can say “Oh yes, they are looking for a full and 
public inquiry into another of these great big government 
departments”.  By the way, I am one who is of the view that HRDC 
unfortunately, now we can tell after some years, is too large and 
too diverse.  However, this debate is not about that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This $1.3 billion worth of grants and contributions goes out to 
thousands of individuals and organizations who work in all our 
communities.  These are organizations that are devoted to 
literacy at the community level and to the full inclusion of 
disabled persons in our society.  These are organizations that 
are involved with the training and retraining of people in the 
workforce, young people, older workers, disabled people and so 
on.  These are groups that help to rehabilitate persons who have 
been released from prison and help get them back into the 
workforce.  These are the sorts of things we are actually 
debating today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not debating a full public inquiry into a very large 
government department.  That inquiry has just been completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Witness after witness in the full public hearings that we held 
warned us.  By the way, these were not simply social do-gooders 
or people like that.  They were people who understood the 
importance of the proper management of files and money.  Knowing 
needs of the organizations I have just tried to describe, they 
warned us about overcompensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The expression overcompensation kept recurring.  What they meant 
by that was that we should, by all means, get fully to the bottom 
of the serious mismanagement of those files, but that we should 
also put in place better systems for the future to ensure that 
the organizations, which, in partnership with other areas of 
funding support, depend on this type of funding, are not put at 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the large national organizations for rehabilitation which 
deals with the rights of disabled people told us that it was 
close to being bankrupt, not because it depended entirely on the 
federal purse but that the federal contributions that it received 
allowed it to go out and get matching funds elsewhere. The reason 
its funds are not flowing at this time is not that there is 
something wrong with its file, but that there is so much concern 
in HRDC about these inquiries, which have been going on for five 
months, that overcare is being taken and the funds are not 
flowing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these inquiries began in January and February, as soon as I 
possibly could I arranged for the full list of HRDC grants and 
contributions in my riding to be published in our main daily 
newspaper and in our main bi-weekly newspaper.  I have to say 
that once I did that, my phone stopped ringing on this issue. It 
was not that the people in my riding were not concerned about 
HRDC moneys being properly managed.  It was not that at all. 
They knew that we were engaging in a very full and public 
inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once those people saw which organizations we were dealing with, 
such as the Trent Valley Literacy Association, the Housing 
Resource Centre and the Emergency Preparedness Organization in 
Peterborough which watches out for future problems like the ice 
storm, they said to themselves that, yes, there was improper 
handling of these government files but that they would wait to 
see what the House of Commons would to do about it.  In the 
meantime, they knew that these were not the sorts of 
organizations that would rip off the taxpayers of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that while we go through what I believe is a 
wasted day of debate—and, yes, it is right that we look at 
federal departments all the time—that today's debate is about 
those organizations that deal with things such as literacy, 
apprenticeship, pre-apprenticeship, employment programs, 
entrepreneurial programs and things of that type. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out to hon. members that the full public inquiry 
completed last week tabled a report which I have here.  It 
contains 30 detailed recommendations dealing with what the 
department is doing, what the department should do with respect 
to grants and contributions and what Treasury Board is doing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to see that treasury board has already released new 
guidelines for across the federal system on grants and 
contributions and on what should be done.  The committee looks 
forward to the auditor general's report, another report which my 
colleague just mentioned, which will be coming out in a few 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee itself is committed to revisiting this issue.  We 
have recommendations which suggest that the system can be 
improved, that the tracking of grants can be more effectively 
carried out without slowing or reducing the flexibility at the 
grassroots where we are dealing with thousands of small 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We suggest the idea of an advisory committee in the ridings, 
which would be comprised of citizens who would deal with the 
larger grants, where the grants deal with the private sector.  We 
think that would help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have suggestions with respect to third party accountability. 
Remember, the federal government delivers these grants, in some 
cases with provincial governments and in some cases with not for 
profit organizations.  There are various partners.  Those 
partners have to be accountable, as well as the federal 
government, and we have recommendations for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are glad that HRDC has completed its review of the active 
files and will now proceed to deal with the closed files. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is about HRDC, yes, but much more significantly it is about 
human resources development in a real sense; how we develop the 
fantastic human resources of 30 million Canadians.  I oppose the 
idea of yet another review of this matter.  As the chair of the 
committee, along with my colleagues on the committee, I commit 
myself to following through on the report which the committee has 
tabled in the most thorough fashion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am somewhat surprised to hear the chair of 
the standing committee on human resources development intervene 
in this debate today when last week he was boasting about 
chairing the committee and remaining neutral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think by speaking today that he is proving the need for an 
independent public inquiry.  The member chairs the standing 
committee on human resources development.  Today he rises in the 
House and defends the position of the government.  I think he is 
in conflict with himself. 
I want him to know as well why I think an independent inquiry is 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not true that all the witnesses called, who were involved 
in the matter of the use of funds for partisan purposes, were 
rejected out of hand by the committee, by the majority, and not 
heard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he consider it relevant to leave Human Resources 
Development Canada employees in the very awkward situation of 
not being exonerated?  It was not the officials who misused 
public funds during the electoral period.  It was the MPs, the 
Liberal candidates, the ministers and the Prime Minister who 
initiated a system to use funds for partisan purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this situation not warrant an independent public inquiry so 
we may finally know just why the government is systematically 
hiding the situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member's words.  He said “This has to be the last 
inquiry.  It has to be settled here and we have to stop talking 
about it”.  That is not what the people are saying at home. 
They are saying that this whole issue must be studied in depth, 
because otherwise, the next election will be like the last, and 
elections will continue to be won with public money.  What does 
the hon. member say to that? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that the 
member opposite is a very devoted and hard-working member of our 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report I am referring to, and I would say this to anyone 
watching, is the report of the majority.  At the back of the 
report there are four different dissenting reports.  It is the 
importance of this report which encouraged me to stand today. 
The purpose is not to close down discussion, but to continue 
proper discussion to carry through with the committee process 
which we just finished.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our standing committee met for four or five months.  Its report, 
after all that time, would be washed aside with the calling for 
an independent review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could spend today debating whether there should be an 
independent review before the report has been fully digested by 
HRDC and before the House of Commons has seen what sort of response 
there is to it, but that would not be fair to the committee 
process and the work which I do as chair.  I do my best to be an 
independent chair.  I am not some sort of political eunuch.  I am 
here to defend the committee process.  I am not here to say that 
we will not talk about this issue any more, but that things are 
in progress.  The committee itself should revisit this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a waste of the time of the House today and it would be a 
waste of the resources of the House of Commons to conduct yet 
another independent inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the HRDC employees, we called as many witnesses 
as we could.  The vast majority were on the opposition lists.  If 
I might say, personally, I have great concern for the stress 
which frontline, devoted HRDC employees in our communities have 
already experienced during the public hearings.  That is one of 
the reasons I do not think we need another independent review. We 
should follow through fully with this process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak today on the motion 
presented by the hon. member of the Canadian Alliance.  I will 
repeat it so that people will be clear on what we are debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a call for the establishment of an independent 
commission of inquiry into the mismanagement of grants and 
contributions in the Department of Human Resources Development, 
and into any attempts to control the disclosure of this 
mismanagement to the public, with a report by December 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, before I continue, I would like to inform you that 
I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Frontenac—Mégantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we have a call today for an independent inquiry?  The 
Bloc Quebecois called for one back on March 21, 2000, and this 
motion was voted on in the House.  Since then, we have come to 
realize that this public and independent inquiry is still being 
called for, in both the interim report of the standing committee 
on HRD and in its final report.  The position remains unchanged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the opposition parties not satisfied with what has been 
done to date?  Because the government has systematically hidden 
behind the committee in order to avoid having to get to the 
bottom of the main issue, that is the use of funds for partisan 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conclusion of the departmental internal audit was that the 
Minister of Human Resources Development had totally lost control 
over all of her department's grants and contributions programs. 
There is talk of $1 billion in public funds over which the 
government could no longer give assurance that it had control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The administrative causes of this situation were sought out and 
certain conclusions were reached.  But there is another side to 
the analysis that was not done by the government, and that is to 
know why it is that, during this time of loss of control, the 
political machinery, the partisan machinery of government, knew 
how to take full advantage of the money available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were several instances. 
First of all, we realized that, during the 1997 election 
campaign, a whole series of grants had suddenly been handed out, 
particularly in ridings the government wanted to win in the 1997 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the campaign, 54% of the transitional job fund, a program 
that was supposed to extend over three years, was spent in 
Quebec.  In Bloc Quebecois ridings, the figure was 63%.  This 
means that ridings suddenly became very interesting because 
there was an opportunity to win them over in an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that should be looked into so that it does not 
happen again in future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the interim report, the Placeteco affair hit the news. 
It involved $1.2 million paid out by a bank in the absence of any 
invoices, and the government is still unable to produce invoices 
for us showing that payment was justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was the case of Conili Star.  The Bloc Quebecois 
brought this case to light and got to the bottom of it.  This 
forced the government to take action, because, left to its own 
devices, it would have done nothing in this case either.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also the case of the company that moved from the 
riding of Rosemont to the riding of Saint-Maurice, for no 
apparent reason.  The opposition parties had to conduct 
investigations, as though they were the police, to sort all this 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, more than a dozen cases are being investigated 
by the RCMP, following information that came out in the House or 
was revealed by other sources.  The government is still denying 
that it used funds for partisan purposes.  What is more, it is 
denying the right to get to the bottom of what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An election is in the offing. 
In a few months, we will have another election.  If we end up 
with the same situation, if the federal government, the party in 
power, uses public funds for partisan purposes, it will debase 
our country's democracy.  This strikes me as totally dangerous 
and unacceptable.  This is why is it is so important to get to 
the root of the issues on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two things need analyzing in this matter.  There is the 
disastrous period when the new Minister for International Trade 
was the Minister of Human Resources Development, when there was 
a total lack of control over the use of funds.  During that 
time, a lot of grants were handed out on the q.t. during the 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the arrival of the new minister, operation “camouflage” 
has been in effect to cover the previous situation and because 
the minister is trying to convince that she was the minister for 
several months without being responsible for anything, that when 
she came to the department no one informed her about the most 
important administrative activity in process, the internal 
audit, and that she did not learn of it until last November. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the present minister had really assumed her responsibilities, 
we would not be faced with the current situation.  We would be 
having an independent and public inquiry.  We could say “Things 
in the past were not right, certain behaviour was unacceptable, 
now we will correct the situation and return to the quality of 
our democratic life”.  In the end, this is the issue on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is important for us to have this independent 
inquiry. It is important for us to have it as soon as possible. 
Since the parliamentary majority on the human resources 
development committee systematically arranged things so that the 
witnesses involved, the buddies of the regime, were not heard, 
those who were really connected with the use of funds for 
partisan purposes, the entire matter must be investigated 
thoroughly.  That was not possible in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that, as long as there is no satisfactory 
appearance of justice, we must continue, as opposition parties, 
to call for a public inquiry.  It is important to point out that 
this is not a partisan approach by one of the parties, but all 
the opposition parties together who share the belief that an 
independent public inquiry is called for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some who have made different choices, some who would 
like to see job creation programs abolished, others who want to 
see them maintained.  They may hold widely divergent social 
views, but all have joined together, with the same concern for 
honesty and justice, in order to expose to public view whether 
public funds have been properly used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that today's motion is highly appropriate in this 
connection.  As long as we do not have the invoices from 
Placeteco, as long as we have not got to the bottom of other 
matters, as long as we do not have an accurate picture of the 
responsibility of the present minister, there is a large chunk 
of information missing.  The public must know what is being done 
with their tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one of parliament's responsibilities to be in a position 
to provide the answer to that question. 
An auditor general investigation is not the only way that this 
can be done, nor one by members of parliament.  There is one 
part of this that concerns the role of members; they must be 
asked to evaluate themselves, to reach a judgment on their own 
behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would there not be grounds for an independent public inquiry so 
that we may cast light on the role of members, and on whether or 
not they should continue to play that role?  As far as the 
parliamentary majority is concerned, it did not say much on this 
in the report.  There was much attention given to the 
administrative problem, but it went along with a systematic 
avoidance of the political problem.  As long as this matter has 
not been settled, we will have unfinished business on our hands, 
and this reflects badly on those who sit in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the issue of the quality of public finances.  There is 
the guarantee for voters that they have a government that can 
have opinions different from theirs.  That is not a problem; 
they are all prepared to accept that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find unacceptable is that the government is trying to 
pass the buck, as though everything has been resolved and now 
everything is back to normal.  It is normal that politicians are 
using public money for partisan purposes.  It is part of the 
system that the Prime Minister has set up and that he has used 
himself in the riding of Saint-Maurice to get himself elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we are federalists or sovereignists, left or right 
leaning, we do not have to put up with this kind of situation, 
because it basically undermines democracy.  It is unacceptable 
in a country such as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the Liberal members who considered the matter in 
the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and the 
Status of Persons with Disabilities, and others who saw the 
whole situation develop to ask themselves today, after several 
months have gone by:  Is this not a situation where we should 
make up our mind to hold an independent public inquiry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not benefit both the government and the opposition 
parties?  Would it not benefit all members of the House, all 
Quebecers and all Canadians to finally get to the bottom of this 
misuse of public money and especially this denial of democracy 
by the Liberals?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to what my colleague had to say.  I 
am concerned by his apparent disillusionment with the committee 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the opposition has a role to play.  I understand 
that government members, people like myself, have a role to play. 
I do have some faith in the standing committees, but I have my 
own views on how they might be strengthened.  When they have the 
benefit of the spotlight of the media and appear on television, I 
believe individual members of parliament and the committees can 
be very effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred the House to the report.  I am interested in some of 
the opposition recommendations in it.  What does the member think 
of recommendation No. 30 in the majority report? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, no, I am not denigrating the work 
of the committee, but I think it is incomplete.  In committee, 
we analyzed the administrative problem in depth, but failed to 
analyze the political aspect of it, the aspect that was hurting 
the government, the aspect that revealed the Liberals had used 
public funds for partisan purposes.  This is the aspect we 
failed to consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report contained valuable recommendations, such as “It is 
time this department was managed like all the others”.  The 
report said, among other things, that money should not be 
squandered at the end of the fiscal year simply because it would 
no longer be available in April or May.  This kind of 
recommendation seems important to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But for the root of the problem, which we explained in our 
minority report—even if I proposed the dismantling of the 
department—as I have always said, an independent and public 
inquiry would be necessary.  We continue the battle today, and 
the matter has been brought before the House, because the 
committee, with its government majority, has ignored the will of 
the people as expressed by the opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I want to get to the bottom of things.  We are 
talking about the integrity of all parliamentarians in this 
country.

where the chair of the committee intervened to prevent 
questioning of witnesses, particularly the minister and the

minutes each to ask questions so that no committee member could 
really get to the bottom of any issue.  I recall documents

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It is out of order to discuss committee matters in the House of 
Commons because committees are masters of their own affairs.  The 
reason for that is that it is impossible for someone like me, the 
chair of the committee, to debate the issue.  The member is out 
of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That may well be, 
but the member has the opportunity to put her question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that intervention was 
surprising from a member who spent his whole— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The standing orders prevent the discussion of committee business 
in the House of Commons.  I am not being awkward about this.  I 
would be glad to debate it if you would so rule, but my 
understanding is that I cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is for the hon. 
member for Calgary—Nose Hill to put a question to the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques.  In the

responsibilities back and forth.  This is not the first time and 
it will not be the last time.

intervention surprising— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The member should withdraw her comments about committee 
time.  I have sat on that committee for six years, along with my 
hon. colleague, and the opposition always had its fair share and 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I guess everyone has 
put their oar in the water and should feel that everything is 
even.  The hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill will please put 
her question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for 
Peterborough spent his entire intervention talking about the 
committee.  I am a little surprised that he would not want any 
questions mentioning the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall information being withheld that committee members had 
requested.  I recall very highly partisan reports coming from the 
Liberal majority.  I recall the last committee meeting where we 
were expected to ask questions on a document that was not even 
provided to committee members by the minister until after the 
committee commenced.  I recall the chairman of the committee 
cutting off— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry, but we 
are running out of time for this intervention.  I ask the hon. 
member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques 
to respond to the question. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, we will not debate the committee 
itself, but I recall in particular the minister's reaction when 
she left for a press conference in order to comment on our 
report, which had come out at 10 a.m.  At noon, she called a 
press conference, and all she could say was “I have not read the 
report”.  Two hours after it was released, and she had no 
comment on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this completely unacceptable, and the only explanation I 
can come up with is that either the minister is totally 
incompetent or this is a machiavellian exercise in camouflage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From all that I have seen of the government's operation to date, 
I would lean toward the second solution.  I think the government

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I agreed to run for a seat in this House, one of my friends

which asked people to rate the credibility of professionals and 
other workers.  Politicians were close behind used car salesmen 
as far as public credibility was concerned.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at what is going on in the House of Commons at the 
present time in connection with Human Resources Development 
Canada, it is easy to see why the credibility of elected 
representatives is dropping every day in the eyes of Quebecers 
and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois support the Canadian Alliance, of 
course, in calling for a wholly independent inquiry so as to 
restore politicians' lost credibility.  There is an 
unprecedented scandal going on within Human Resources 
Development Canada at the present time.  Unfortunately for the 
minister, who has held the portfolio since last fall, it is up 
to her to undo the damage done by her two predecessors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind hon. members of what happened to Douglas 
Young, who represented Acadie—Bathurst in New Brunswick.  He 
thumbed his nose at everybody.  He was the Minister of Human 
Resources Development.  He laughed right in the faces of the 
unemployed, those who were paying into employment insurance but 
could not even qualify.  The electorate of Acadie—Bathurst taught 
him a good lesson, such a good one that he barely got 25% of the 
vote in the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Papineau—Saint-Denis who succeeded him literally 
devastated the Department of Human Resources Development, and 
shamelessly moreover.  Scandals came out that had been hidden 
until then.  He asked the Prime Minister for a change of 
portfolio and now the poor minister who took over from him has 
to defend her predecessor constantly.  Again in this morning's 
<I>National Post</I>, we read that the minister must step down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance is calling for an independent inquiry, 
with a report to be tabled in the House on December 11, 2000. 
Right now, the Prime Minister is considering a fall election. 
He could use this to duck the issue, and hold an election before 
the results of this scandal are known to the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, I would like to remind the House of what is going 
on at HRDC.  Let us go back to a few months before the June 2, 
1997 election, when a Montrealer, Pierre Corbeil, was travelling 
all over the province visiting companies which had applied for 
transitional job funding.  On many occasions, before grants were 
approved, he went fishing for funds for the Liberal Party of 
Canada for the June 2 election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contributions he received from companies were not $100 or 
$200 amounts, but more on the order of $5,000, $10,000, $15,000, 
$20,000 or $25,000 in certain cases and, generally speaking, 
Pierre Corbeil demanded cash, not cheques.  It is therefore not 
always possible to determine what he did with it.  Did he tuck 
some away in his car?  Did it change hands on the way to the 
Liberal Party office? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no denying that such situations are sad.  It is for 
reasons such as these, the way in which Pierre Corbeil and the 
Liberal Party of Canada acted, that Canadians and Quebecers are 
increasingly losing faith in their elected officials.  The 
minister is responsible today for allowing money to continue 
flying out the window by refusing to let us get to the bottom of 
this and to put an end to all this wrongdoing once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am anxious to see what side the Liberals opposite will take 
this evening when they are asked to vote in favour of creating 
an independent commission of inquiry.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The scandals are not limited to Pierre Corbeil.  They also 
concern the riding of Saint-Maurice, the Prime Minister's riding. 
There was this little trust company, as in the case of the 
Minister of Finance and his ships in a tax haven, that bought a 
golf course from a paper company for $1.  Shortly afterwards, it 
sold an infinitesimal part of this golf course for $550,000. 
That is quite a figure for a bit of rough on a golf course.  So 
this $1 paid off handsomely, and only a fraction was sold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The person who bought the bit of rough for $550,000 received 
contracts from our federal government worth nothing less than 
$6.4 million in the following months. 
Members will understand that this $550,000 was very well 
invested by this client of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>René Fugère earned over $1 million as a lobbyist, even though he 
is not even registered.  He is a friend of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, public money was used to get Liberal candidates 
elected in the latest election.  This was the case, among 
others, in the Quebec riding of Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, when 
the candidate chosen was the former head of the CEQ, a friend of 
Colonel Gaddafi, who visited him regularly to discover the 
directives he wanted to impose on Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This member that the CEQ lost to the Liberal Party of Canada 
obtained for his riding—although he was not yet a MP, as hon. 
members will recall—$20 million for one riding alone, from the 
transitional job fund.  By far the majority of the recipients of 
these funds were very generous contributors to the Liberal Party 
of Canada.  That is why I say that public funds were used to buy 
Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of Saint-Maurice, the riding of the Prime Minister, 
got $7.3 million just for re-electing him.  Often these funds went 
to buddies, to party organizers, in the case of Placeteco 
particularly.  Placeteco received $1.2 million, of which 
$1,020,000 was used to pay off an increasingly dubious debt to 
the National Bank.  One job was created, with $1.2 million. 
There was misappropriation of funds in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no fewer than 13 RCMP investigations. 
We know how that will turn out.  You know the solicitor general 
better than I.  Thirteen RCMP investigations are currently under 
way, nearly all of them in the riding of Saint-Maurice.  That is 
what “job creation” means in that riding.  RCMP officers have to 
be imported in order to investigate misappropriation of funds 
and find out where the transitional job fund money went. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few minutes to refer to a few cases, such 
as the fact that unregistered lobbyist René Fugère got 
$1 million.  But since I see that my time is nearly up, I will 
say the following in closing: Please, Liberals, help us improve 
the credibility Ottawa politicians have with the electorate. 
That can start this evening with a vote to authorize an 
independent inquiry.

reads: “The government should divide HRDC into several more 
homogeneous and focused structures”— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  I was here 
when the member rose on a point of order to say that the House 
could not debate committee business.  This same member raised

this is totally irrelevant.

all the recommendations.  However, I fear I may confuse 
recommendation No. 30 with recommendation No. 31. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So that I do not get too muddled, I would like to point out to 
the chair of the human resources development committee that the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs visited my riding a week 
and a half ago.  I was very surprised to see, and I have to look 
into this more, that he was accompanied by the director general 
of Human Resources Development Canada in Thetford Mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are Human Resources Development Canada personnel being 
politicized to the point of serving as political organizers or 
advance men or confidants of the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs?  This is called using the public service for partisan 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are bleeding the coffers of Human Resources Development 
Canada in order to get re-elected and now you are going to 
require the representatives of the department in each of 
Canada's regions to accompany Liberal candidates.  This is a 
scandal.  And we wonder—

Frontenac—Mégantic.  He was going to present three or four cases, 
but unfortunately he ran out of time.

draw the House's attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien: </B>Mr. Speaker, in the riding of 
Saint-Maurice, many of the jobs created involve the RCMP, but 
these are temporary jobs for people who do not live in the 
riding; i.e. RCMP officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, Groupe Force in the riding of Saint-Maurice apparently 
obtained $1.5 million, and it is also under investigation. 
There is some extremely disgraceful misappropriation of money 
going on.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This case, as is very well known, involves a Liberal from Cape 
Breton, Nova Scotia, who received a contribution of $1.3 million 
for job creation, but things did not go very well.  No real jobs 
were created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Toronto area, the Community Alliance for Neighbourhood 
Development apparently obtained $100,000 fraudulently.  The 
figure may even be as high as $1.15 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elsewhere, in New Brunswick, Atlantic Furniture Manufacturing 
received $280,000 and not only did the plant not create any

<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to rise in the House today on behalf of the New 
Democratic Party as its spokesperson and critic for HRDC, to 
speak in support of the motion by the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been rather a perplexing and ironic debate.  The member 
for Peterborough has challenged other members that they should 
not be discussing the business of the committee and yet he 
himself raised recommendations from the HRDC committee.  I do not 
see how we can debate this issue and the motion without getting 
into the business of the committee and the recommendations that 
have come out of that committee. I hope we can get on with the 
debate and deal with some of the very important questions that 
are before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's motion is very important because the four opposition 
parties have been united in their focus on what has become the 
central question in the HRDC scandal. On June 1 the four 
opposition parties issued a joint statement which reads, “We 
have no confidence in the government's response to the scandal at 
HRDC.  Therefore today we reiterate our grave concerns and call 
for an independent public inquiry to investigate and report on 
the alleged partisan interference and wrongdoing in the awarding 
of HRDC grants and contributions.  It is crucial to restore 
public confidence and only an independent public inquiry can 
accomplish this”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that earlier today the chair of the committee, the 
hon. member for Peterborough, said that another public inquiry 
would be a waste of dollars. Another public inquiry implies that 
we have already had one.  Certainly there have been committee 
hearings. Certainly we have heard some witnesses.  But to 
characterize that as an independent public inquiry is doing a 
grave injustice to the whole idea of what an independent public 
inquiry is about and why we need to have one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been weeks of hearings, committee meetings and 
questions in the House.  Independent investigation work has been 
done by members in the opposition parties.  The minister released 
10,000 pages and volumes of information have come out.  Despite 
all that, Canadians are still no closer to understanding what 
happened in the department, how decisions were made and how it is 
that today we have ended up with a dozen or more investigations 
that possibly could lead to criminal charges if there is found to 
be wrongdoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have not received answers to some very basic questions 
that have been put in the House of Commons as well as in the 
committee, as well as by the media day after day since we 
returned to the House in February. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the opposition parties issued a joint statement. 
That is why the opposition parties, from day one, have called for 
an independent public inquiry.  That is why today this motion is 
before us again.  I believe it is actually the second opposition 
day motion on a public inquiry.  Members from the Bloc also put 
forward a motion a couple of months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It deserves some closer examination as to why the insistence or 
the pressure is still being kept up by those of us in opposition. 
Perhaps the government's line is that this is about playing 
politics.  I beg to differ.  This issue is about trying to 
restore confidence in public expenditures.  It is about trying to 
restore confidence in public decision making.  It is about trying 
to restore confidence in the way our parliament and the way our 
government work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to say at the outset that from the New Democratic 
Party's point of view we have always defended the purpose and 
intent of the kinds of programs now under investigation.  In 
terms of the principle of what those programs stand for as far as 
job creation in areas of high unemployment and training people to 
sustain the local economy are concerned, those are things that we 
in the New Democratic Party have always supported.  We do not 
take issue with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically we have been on record for many years since our 
inception as saying that there is a legitimate role for 
government to play in job creation, in youth training, in 
providing literacy programs and in all the things we have seen go 
on.  However the issue is the way those programs have been 
managed and the fact that we have mounting evidence that funds 
have been used for political partisan purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad to note that the people who have taken the flack, the 
people who end up paying the cost of this mismanagement and of 
the political partisan use of these funds, are the very people 
these funds and programs are designed to help.  That is the sad 
irony of what has taken place here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From our point of view in the New Democratic Party we want a 
public inquiry to get at the truth, to restore a sense of balance 
and to say it is important that we look at each of those 
investigations and get answers.  I was very interested to hear 
the exchange a few minutes earlier by my hon. colleague from the 
Bloc who was trying to put on record a few of the cases that have 
come up.  There are so many it is impossible to detail them in a 
debate such as this one.  We on the opposition side are all aware 
that we need a thorough examination of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the mandate and scope of the committee dominated by 
government members are completely inadequate and limited in 
ability to passively or even willingly take that job on.  We in 
the NDP want a public inquiry precisely to get at the truth but 
also to restore confidence in these programs.   I do not think 
that can be underestimated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members have commented on the point at one time or another 
that through the whole debate and the developments which have 
taken place the workers and staff people who actually deliver 
programs on the frontline in local HRDC offices have taken a 
beating.  It is not just as a result of what has unfolded since 
February.  They have taken a beating because they have suffered 
years and years of cutbacks in the public service, some 5,000 
people alone in the Human Resources Development Department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the undermining of the public sector workforce and 
the undermining of public services is a recipe that comes from 
the Liberal government.  It is something that is contributing now 
to the very low morale and sense that this department is simply 
falling apart.  It has lacked leadership.  It has lacked 
accountability.  It has lacked transparency.  It has also 
suffered from very low morale.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would blame the people working in that department for 
feeling thoroughly cynical and depressed about all these goings 
on.  They are still delivering the services yet have less and 
less resources to do so as a result of all the cutbacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP see a very serious matter that needs to be 
addressed by the government.  It must be taken up to restore 
confidence in this operation and the various things the 
department does. I am referring to increasing the staffing 
resources and recognizing that the people who deliver those 
programs do it with a sense of public interest, a sense of public 
mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow we have to separate the function of government in 
carrying out operations and programs from a political culture 
that is so pervasive that we heard time and time again in 
committee from various witnesses that the political atmosphere 
dictated everything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I think it is very important that we continue with this 
debate and continue to press for an independent public inquiry 
because there are critical questions that still must be 
addressed.  There are issues on which we do not yet have answers. 
For example, as recently as June 5, reports are surfacing 
suggesting that the minister knew, possibly in October 1999, 
about the internal audit that was done of the transitional jobs 
fund and that those programs being mismanaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are serious issues about when information was known and 
whether or not we are getting the full goods and the full answer 
on when it was that the minister or her staff were involved and 
had disclosure about the ongoing problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still have continuing evidence that the transitional jobs 
fund was used as a slush fund.  A 1998 independent review 
conducted by Ekos Research Associates suggested that transitional 
jobs fund grants were approved for political reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 1997 audit done by Consulting and Audit Canada, which examined 
25 transitional jobs fund grants in Quebec and Atlantic Canada, 
warned that the fund was “political”.  In particular, in the 
awarding of a $6 million grant to a tree planting project in New 
Brunswick, the firm reported: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pressures on staff to expedite the approval process have come 
from the political level and commitments have been made that HRDC 
staff must then follow. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pulling this information from public documents and from 
some reviews which were done in previous years.  This is now a 
matter of public record but the problem is they were never 
followed up.  The systemic problems within this department in 
terms of the politicization of the process and the political 
interference are questions that we have to get answers on and 
questions that have never been addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my office we received information about the way grants were 
disbursed in the Kenora office in northern Ontario.  There were 
allegations of political interference on the part of the current 
minister of Indian affairs who was previously the parliamentary 
secretary to HRDC.  People who worked in that office said that 
they were very concerned about the partisan nature of how these 
grants and contributions were awarded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the situation of Scotia Rainbow.  In February the 
member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton blew the whistle on the Scotia 
Rainbow allocation funds.  She questioned how a $750,000 grant 
approved to Scotia Rainbow, a company owned by a Liberal 
contributor, was increased in the same fiscal year to $2 million. 
More than that, as a local member of parliament she was never 
approached to give concurrence to the transitional jobs fund 
beyond the initial $750,000 in September 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton has now asked the 
auditor general to conduct a thorough review of Scotia Rainbow's 
applications and the grant from the transitional jobs fund. To 
add insult to injury, the organization went into receivership by 
defaulting on its obligations on a $10 million loan from the Bank 
of Montreal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our member from Bras d'Or has raised this issue continually in 
the House of Commons and has been absolutely stonewalled by 
various ministers in the government in trying to get some 
straightforward answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other critical questions need to be addressed so I will continue 
with my list.  Everybody has a list of questions they want to 
have answered.  One of the questions we have that pertains to my 
own riding and the riding of the member for Winnipeg Centre is: 
Why is it that some of these funds were supposedly improved in 
areas of high unemployment when the unemployment rate was 
actually lower than the criteria?  Why is it that for the 
minister's own riding funds were approved when its unemployment 
rate was lower than the criteria? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We suddenly heard about the existence of pockets.  The 
government explained this practice with fuzzy, warm rules that 
pockets of unemployment— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  A lot of money went into your 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  No.  One transitional jobs fund went 
into Vancouver East just before the election when it was held by 
a Liberal member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why were all members of the House not aware of this loophole? 
Where did this rule come from?  How was it applied across the 
country?  Why in some areas like Vancouver East did the riding 
qualify under the pocket rule just prior to an election but after 
the election apparently did not qualify any longer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did 49 of Canada's most profitable companies receive grants 
and contributions from HRDC, including all five of the big banks, 
Canadian Pacific, Loblaws, Shell Canada, Investors Group, Fairfax 
Financial, Bombardier, Power Corporation, Onex Corporation and 
Southam.  This is a who's who of corporate Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It strikes me as ironic that major profitable corporations are 
receiving grants and contributions apparently without question 
and sometimes without adequate paperwork or follow-up.  Why are 
we giving money to these hugely profitable corporations?  Why are 
these public funds not being invested in local communities where 
real job development is taking place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember a sock company, although I forget its name.  The guy 
wanted to create a world monopoly in socks and put other sock 
companies out of business.  Why did that company get a 
transitional jobs fund?  I do not know.  I can only guess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Maybe he made a donation to the 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  My colleague says “Maybe he made a 
donation to the Liberals”.  These are serious questions. In fact 
we in the NDP have called for a code of conduct.  This is 
something we have included in our minority report.  It is very 
important that there be transparency in the decision making 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not object to members of parliament being involved in a 
process by signing off on a particular grant or contribution.  A 
member of parliament should be involved.  The question is: Are 
the rules being applied fairly, consistently and without an 
overriding political culture?  That is where we have a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party have recommended to the 
government that the treasury board, in conjunction with the 
Auditor General of Canada, develop a code of conduct for all 
departments, not just HRDC, that award grants and contributions. 
We believe this code of conduct should incorporate transparency, 
disclosure, fairness and standard practices.  That is something 
Canadians could agree with.  Everyone in the House would agree 
that the same rules should apply for everybody.  The government 
side should not be favoured because it is using the funds for 
partisan purposes to bolster its re-election efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are genuine about wanting to invest in job creation, let 
us do it on an objective basis.  Let us do it on a basis that we 
can all live by.  Then Canadians could see where the funds are 
going, that they are being put to good use to create real jobs 
and not just a political slush fund.

reiterate our support and our ongoing call for an independent 
inquiry, which we have called for from day one.  We will continue 
to do that until there is accountability, until there are answers 
to the questions, some of which I gave today, many of which we 
have put in our report and many of which have been put at 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last matter I want to speak to is the future of the 
department.  The NDP, as well as Bloc members I think, agreed 
with the main report, with some reservations.  Because there has 
been such a spotlight on the department, one of the things which 
came to light is that this massive department, which is the 
largest federal department, needs to have a further review in 
terms of its ongoing mandate and structure.  I want to be very 
clear that we want to do that to restore the confidence in the 
programs that have been delivered and should be delivered.  We do 
not want to use the people who work there as scapegoats, nor do 
we want to use them as a further reason for cutbacks or massive 
layoffs.  For that reason we would support a further review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot escape what needs to be done in the House.  There must 
be an independent public inquiry to really get to the bottom of 
what happened in the department.  We will not rest until that 
happens.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am grateful to have the 
opportunity to ask a question of the member for Vancouver East, 
who is a hard working member of our committee.  However, first I 
wish to point out that my colleague must have sat at a different 
committee meeting than I.  She mentioned that she heard people 
repeatedly talking about interference in the grants and 
contributions process.  I would ask my colleague to table any 
evidence she has with respect to political interference, or 
interference of any kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate concerns having an independent public inquiry.  I 
believe that my colleague is late on the issue.  We had an 
inquiry and we heard witnesses from many walks of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague not recognize the honest work and effort of 
the auditor general and his department?  I do not believe we 
could get any person or department which would be more 
independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, in reply to my hon. 
colleague's question, when I mentioned the examples or evidence 
of political interference I was going by what I heard at 
committee.  I read to members of the House reports from outside 
consulting firms, which brought forward information from the 
people they interviewed during their reviews, and they said there 
was political interference and they were concerned about it. 
Those documents have already been tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly believe that there are lots of other instances that 
we do not yet know about.  I have an inkling about them, but we 
do not yet have the full evidence of what took place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member is saying let us table the documents and get that 
information, then that is another reason I would say yes, let us 
have an inquiry to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the auditor general, he has played a very good role. 
In fact, I was hugely concerned by what I heard at committee from 
the auditor general.  He made it quite clear to members that for 
years and years he has made recommendations about changing 
procedures on how these disbursements are made and following up 
on problems within the department.  Those recommendations were 
basically ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is recommending that there be rules that are 
enforceable.  How many more reports does the government have to 
get from the auditor general?  He said that he has made reports 
since 1974 on these kinds of issues.  Yes, we want enforceable 
rules.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the NDP member. She supports 
the idea of a public inquiry, as we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like get her views on what criteria would ensure that 
such an inquiry is truly seen as an independent inquiry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been so-called public inquiries in the past, but it 
was the government that appointed those in charge of these 
inquiries. How does the hon. member think that the members, the 
commissioners on the board of inquiry, should be appointed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, I greatly appreciate the idea of not only shedding light 
on this issue but, to avoid such scandals—and this is truly an 
unprecedented scandal at HRDC and in some ridings, including the 
Prime Minister's riding—the member's suggestion that a code of 
ethics, or something similar, be drafted. I wonder if the hon. 
member could elaborate on that. It is fine to diagnose a 
problem, but solutions must also be found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What, in her opinion, are the ethical solutions that should be 
proposed to correct the situation? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to thank 
the hon. member for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of what framework a public inquiry could take, there 
have been a couple of suggestions made already.  One suggestion 
was made by the Canadian Alliance.  The member for Calgary—Nose 
Hill suggested earlier that we could have an inquiry made up of 
equal numbers of members of parliament from each of the five 
parties, so there would not be any partisanship.  That is 
something which could be agreed to by all parties in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would think that another framework could be to have something 
completely outside the involvement of members.  That might 
involve someone from the judiciary, or a panel of civilians, or 
people who have a lot of credibility in the community, but again 
on the basis that there would be an all-party agreement.  As we 
know, it is very easy to appoint friends to such places and say 
it is independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a brief response in terms of the code of conduct.  What 
we have said in our report, and I would urge the member to look 
at the report, is that we believe a code of conduct should be 
developed by treasury board and should include a number of 
principles concerning the disbursement of grants and 
contributions:  that disbursements should be made in a way that 
is transparent, that there should be full disclosure, that there 
should be fairness, and most important, that there be a standard 
practice.  What we envisage is that this would be developed as a 
document which departments would be required to live by in terms 
of making decisions about awarding grants and contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is mutually exclusive to a member of 
parliament having some involvement in that.  One of the things 
that has been suggested by witnesses is that there could be 
advisory committees in local areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the departments to live by this kind of code so that we 
do not have this kind of scandal in the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
like the member, I too look forward to the next report of the 
auditor general.  It will be an important one.  He is conducting 
an inquiry into this very matter now, which is one of the reasons 
I will not support today's resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member for her comments on the recommendation in the 
majority report, to which she referred, concerning the breakup of 
the department.  The suggestion is that the statutory transfers, 
the Canada pension plan, the old age supplement, the disability 
pension and so on, that huge financial side of the department, be 
handled separately, that employment and labour be handled 
separately, and that there be a minister of state, a special 
overview department—which I think would involve many of the 
employees she is concerned about in HRDC—to deal with grants and 
contributions in these important social areas; not only in HRDC, 
but in health, justice and the other government departments where 
they exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the member thinks of that particular scenario and 
that recommendation in the majority report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, very briefly, I am a bit 
worried that the member has already in his own mind, perhaps in 
debate with other government members, gone down the road so far 
in terms of articulating how the restructuring of HRDC might take 
place.  I think that is something that has to be done in a very 
public way, with a lot of public debate.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we call for in our report is that there be an independent 
review of the restructuring of the department, which would 
include the public and private sectors, and which would include 
labour, because obviously the unions involved would be affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe very strongly that there have to be principles 
involved.  This must not be used as a cover for any privatization 
of services or contracting out.  This is about making a 
department more manageable and accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that there are some areas where a particular function of 
the department in terms of its statutory obligations could be in 
one area and then other areas dealing with social policy could be 
put under another department or secretary of state.  However, it 
seems to me that the real issue is, if the government is going to 
take that up, then there has to be a commitment that there will 
not be privatization or contracting out, and that the debate will 
be held in public and not behind closed doors.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my hon. colleague for her comments 
this morning.  She spoke about one of the TJF projects in my 
riding, Scotia Rainbow, for which I have not been able to get any 
answers.  God forbid me to say that maybe it could be because the 
owner of the business has a very close relative who is a sitting 
Liberal member of the Quebec legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really important is this.  We have heard the minister 
day after day saying “We found out there was a problem.  We 
recognized there was a problem.  We told Canadians there was a 
problem and now we have fixed it”.  Unfortunately, just in the 
last two weeks in my riding, I have been asked to concur in 
projects when the money was already spent in November. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member believe, if the government agrees to look 
at the department and look at an inquiry, that these initiatives 
could truly help Canadians in the way they should? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, I really appreciate the 
comments from my colleague because I know she has had the most 
difficult time in getting very basic information.  It is pretty 
outrageous that projects have been approved without her 
concurrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I would say that is why we in the NDP are calling for a 
code of conduct.  We want to have enforceable rules through 
treasury board.  We want there to be very clear rules about how 
these grants and contributions are made. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise today to support the motion that the 
House call for the establishment of an independent commission of 
inquiry into the mismanagement of grants and contributions in the 
Department of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be splitting my time with the hon. member from 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the PC Party are supportive of this motion.  The PC Party 
filed a dissenting report to the HRDC committee report.  The 
committee report did not ask for an independent public inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this juncture, with all the controversy over the HRDC 
debacle, Canadians have lost confidence in the Department of 
Human Resources Development.  It is time for an open and 
transparent process and inquiry to re-establish that trust 
between the department—in fact between the government and the 
Canadian public, who have clearly lost confidence in the ability 
of the department to manage this very important part of public 
policy in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the information commissioner, John Reid, said “Governments 
have no money of their own.  They are trustees for our money and 
trustees for the various programs and activities they undertake 
for us”.  Clearly, the government has not acted as an effective 
trustee of the public money, in this case HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole disclosure of the crisis within HRDC did not come 
about as a result of the government seeking greater transparency, 
openness and accountability.  It came about based on the minister 
being dragged, kicking and screaming, to disclosure by the House. 
In fact, the opposition has worked collectively and effectively 
to ensure that light was shone into the dark space of HRDC to 
ensure that Canadians were aware of the degree to which public 
trust between Canadians and their government, in terms of the 
management of public money, had been broken by the government.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been working assiduously to minimize the 
impact and degree to which the HRDC department was out of 
control.  Clearly it had not maintained an accountable system to 
manage these funds. Overall I see no reason why any member of the 
House, on the government side or on the opposition side, would 
have difficulty with a full and transparent public inquiry into 
the HRDC department's difficulties in managing public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, on looking at the history of HRDC and what we know now 
versus what we knew even a few years ago relative to employment 
support programs, there is some recognition that many of the 
programs and the types of involvement which were thought to be 
appropriate by individuals involved in public policy to develop 
and grow employment are less effective. On looking at these 
programs in hindsight, we have seen that the record of actually 
creating long term sustainable employment for Canadians by HRDC 
and many other direct government employment creation agencies has 
been littered with the corpses of failed programs and initiatives 
and poor investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Minister of Finance in a speech a few months ago said 
publicly that government should not pick winners or losers and 
should not make direct investments in business.  Far too often 
when the government gets involved in direct investments in 
individual businesses, the reasons behind those investments have 
little to do with economics or job creation. In many cases they 
are more about rewarding political friends or trying to help a 
minister or an individual member maintain his or her status in 
the riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard of significant investments that were made.  I 
believe there was $500,000 to Wal-Mart.  We have heard of HRDC 
money going to companies to effectively move them from one riding 
to another with no net gain in employment.  The focus of HRDC 
investment should be on investing in job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frequently when the political processes get involved there 
is a tendency and temptation for the political elites on the 
other side, particularly on the front benches, to interfere and 
to push money toward one cause or another that would directly 
benefit themselves and their colleagues in the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a consensus among people involved in public policy 
today that quite possibly the best way to develop and grow 
employment in Canada, particularly in terms of the new economy 
and the knowledge based industries, is not by pouring government 
money into specific businesses at the whim of the governing 
party.  Instead it is to reduce the tax burden for all Canadians 
by focusing on areas of the new economy and looking at the taxes 
that impede progress and productivity most significantly in the 
new economy.  They would be capital gains taxes and corporate 
taxes.  Also Canada's middle class must be readjusted and 
redefined through significant personal income tax reform.  Those 
are the types of efforts the government should be pursuing in 
developing policies to actually create jobs, employment and 
economic growth for Canada in the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs a creativity boost in addressing some of 
these issues.  Largely the government has coasted since 1993 on 
the policies of the previous government.  It has not addressed 
some of the very important issues in the context of the new 
economy and where we are today.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the government to look at the old style solutions 
which have not worked that effectively in the past, clearly are 
not working in the present and most certainly will not be 
successful in the future.  It should take some political risks, 
do the right thing and develop some vision.  It should have a 
vision implant or something like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were to look at these issues realistically, 
perhaps it would not be so defensive about protecting its slush 
funds. It could face the electorate with some interesting, 
innovative policies and defend them on their own merits and not 
base them on slush funds to buy people's votes outwardly with 
their own money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the motion.  We hope all members will speak in 
support of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There cannot be public policy change unless there first is 
enough transparency and openness to realize what we are indeed 
trying to fix.  The inquiry process would identify more clearly 
than has been identified previously the real problem within HRDC. 
It would shine a greater level of public light on this 
significant negative issue which has faced Canadians and 
embarrassed them for several months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue the government needs to address in the context of 
providing greater levels of economic opportunity to economically 
depressed areas is a re-engineering of Canada's equalization 
system.  Our current equalization system treats recipient 
provinces like single parents on social assistance who actually 
want to get a job and when they do get a job they end up making 
less money.  That is the single parent analogy. When recipient 
provinces of equalization pursue economic development activities 
that are focused on realistic, long term sustainable industries, 
they end up taking in less money and ultimately hurt themselves 
by pursuing more active and innovative economic approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be studying very seriously the issue of 
equalization.  It should work with the provinces to develop long 
term strategies where recipient provinces could use tax 
strategies and research and development strategies to become have 
provinces within a very short period of time.  Maybe that would 
achieve more than what has been achieved by equalization or HRDC 
in its current sense. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, one of the things that seems to be constantly overlooked 
in this debate about HRDC's problems is the fact that the 
minister did not have to release the 10,000 or so documents that 
revealed the management problems with HRDC.  The reality is that 
the current Access to Information Act in section 21 gives broad 
powers to the government to withhold audits, to withhold the kind 
of information that the minister did release.  In the one sense 
the minister deserves credit for having had the courage to 
release the documents that led to the kind of controversy that 
did ensue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a whole other segment that is also exempt from the 
Access to Information Act that I would suggest to the member 
opposite contains even worse examples of mismanagement, nepotism 
and problems.  That is the area of crown corporations. 
Currently, under the existing Access to Information Act, all 
crown corporations are exempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not agree that surely we should be looking to 
changes in the access act to bring crown corporations under the 
same scrutiny that is now available to HRDC? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his erudite and perspicacious interventions.  He is alone 
over there battling it out in a caucus that is not interested in 
greater levels of access to information and more accountability 
for parliament. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I credit him for slogging it out in the trenches over there 
surrounded by people who really are not interested in change and 
in improving the accountability of government and parliament.  He 
is a lone voice.  Perhaps he would be better suited over here 
working with like-minded people who are truly interested in 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His question about crown corporations and government agencies is 
an important one.  One of the disturbing trends is that more 
essential services of government are being provided by arm's 
length agencies.  In terms of accountability the arms are very 
long but in terms of direct political intervention when it is 
deemed necessary by the government, the arms are very short. 
There should be significant—

<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
motion before us, and upon which we will be called upon to vote 
this evening, is about whether or not we authorize the House of 
Commons to establish a commission to conduct an independent 
inquiry into the misappropriation of funds at Human Resources 
Development Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I see, all of the hon. members on this side of the 
floor are going to vote in favour of this motion.  It must be an 
embarrassment to the Liberal members to have to vote against a 
motion that is intended to get their fat out of the fire. 
According to this morning's papers, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development is in a hopeless mess from which there is 
no escape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance is offering this government a way out of 
this mess.  I wonder what the hon. member's intentions are in 
this connection and whether we could not help the Liberals out 
of the mess they are in by inviting them to support this motion 
for an independent inquiry. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am certain the intention 
behind the motion was to offer a lifeline to the government. It 
clearly needs some help in creating an exit strategy from this 
embarrassing issue that has paralyzed it for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not been paralyzed by HRDC. The government 
has been paralyzed since 1993 by its own inaction and lack of 
vision.  HRDC has focused the attention of Canadians on one 
specific issue.  I would argue that it really has not paralyzed 
the government because it is hard to paralyze a corpse.  The 
government has been acting like a corpse in terms of its 
inability to develop cohesive, coherent and visionary policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the hon. member probably shares with me a desire to 
help the government in any way we can by offering a lifeline like 
this motion so that the government can crawl out from underneath 
the weight of the debacle it has brought on itself. Unfortunately 
members opposite probably do not understand the importance of 
dealing with Canadians openly and transparently. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in these hallowed halls to 
take part in this debate over an issue that has preoccupied this 
place for many months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It comes about as a result of what came to light months ago. An 
internal audit that began in March revealed that there were 
serious issues of mismanagement of taxpayers' money as they 
pertained to grants and job creation schemes that were put 
forward by the government. The minister has made a concerted 
effort to distract, deflect and focus Canadians' attention 
elsewhere in her responses in the House and through the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is very much about public trust and responsible 
behaviour by government.  No one is suggesting that at the end of 
the day in this billion dollar boondoggle that the money is gone, 
that it has evaporated into thin blue air. The suggestion is that 
the money has been mismanaged, that there has not been a 
sufficient follow-up as to how the money was being spent. 
There certainly has not been a degree of accountability or 
forthrightness on the part of the government to take its 
responsibility for the administration of this department, whether 
that fell upon the previous minister, who has basically escaped 
responsibility unscathed, or upon the high level bureaucrats who 
were rewarded for their incompetence and placed in higher 
positions up the government ladder in the wake of what has 
perhaps been the biggest and most disturbing mismanagement of 
taxpayer money in recent history.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That certainly contributes to a growing trend of cynicism and, 
even worse, a growing trend, I would suggest, of apathy toward 
the functions and the legitimate efforts of parliament.  What 
reflects on government reflects on parliament as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion that has been brought forward is timely.  It allows 
us to perhaps delve into the matter in greater detail, to 
disclose and, as my friend from Kings—Hants put it, to shed 
greater light on what has taken place as to why there has been to 
a large extent a complete and utter focus on this issue when I 
think most Canadians would prefer that we were focusing our 
attention elsewhere, such as on the growing crisis in health 
care, on the high taxes that Canadians are currently labouring 
under, or on our low productivity that stems from some of these 
oppressive and extremely weighty tax schemes that currently 
exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a revelation today that came from the United States 
congress.  Congress is raising the envelope of immigrants, which 
will apply to Canada, to attract more Canadians, our best, our 
brightest, our most educated and our most motivated, to go to the 
United States and contribute to its economy by taking part in the 
growing IT industry where productivity is rewarded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we are suffering under a very repressive and 
regressive government that does not recognize some of these 
fundamental issues.  Unfortunately, because of the revelation 
that came about as a result of this audit, we in the opposition 
have been trying to bring about some degree of accountability and 
refocus the priorities of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning back to the motion, what came about, as is often the 
case when these issues come to light, was bad enough that we were 
made aware of what had taken place and the degree of 
mismanagement.  The audit indicated that there was insufficient 
follow-up.  It indicated that there was poor decision making at 
the front end, but equally that there was poor follow-up.  When 
evidence came to light suggesting that poor decisions may have 
been made as to where the money was spent, nothing was done. 
There was no investigation and no legitimate attempt made by the 
government or the human resources department to recover that 
money.  To suggest otherwise is complete folly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the wake of this revelation, when it came to light that this 
was taking place, what was the government's response?  That is 
something that I would like to focus our attention and Canadians' 
attention on for a moment.  What was the government's initial 
response? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, we have become accustomed to it.  The government's 
immediate and almost knee-jerk response was to deny that the 
problem was there.  When it could no longer do that, it tried to 
deflect and blame the opposition.  It tried to make the 
opposition somehow complicit in what was taking place.  It tried 
to point a finger and say to the member opposite “Well, thank 
you for that penetrating question but you got money in your 
riding too”, and somehow that makes it all right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In very basic terms, the reality is that the hon. member who may 
have asked the question did not have final decision making 
authority over where those contributions and grant programs were 
going to be set up.  That is what adds to undermining and further 
bringing down into the subterranean levels public confidence in 
government, in government programs and in parliament as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very unfortunate because we are at a pivotal time in our 
country's history.  We are at a point in time where we are 
starting to lag behind other countries, relative to other 
countries in the G-8 in their economic performance and relative 
to other countries in steps that they are making toward 
transparency, openness and direct accountability to the people 
who elect them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that score, I want to refer to something that has been 
referred to before in the House in the context of this debate.  I 
want to quote from <I>Hansard</I>, <I>House of Commons Debates</I>, 
June 12, 1991, wherein the hon. member for Saint-Maurice, the 
current Prime Minister when he was leader of the opposition, 
stated in the context of an issue of the day: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—I would like to tell the people of Canada that when we form the 
government, every minister in cabinet that I will be presiding 
over will have to take full responsibility for what is going on 
in his department.  If there is any bungling in the department, 
nobody will be singled out. The minister will have to take 
responsibility. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are just words that seem to evaporate into thin blue air. 
They have no significance and no relevance to the current Prime 
Minister's view of what has taken place on his watch.  He is not 
holding his ministers responsible.  It seems that he is prepared 
to let the ministers twist in the breeze and take the daily 
volley and barrage of criticism not only from members of the 
opposition but from the public at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very disturbing trend.  It reflects an attitude of 
arrogance and disconnect from the Canadian people.  The Prime 
Minister has given us ample reasons to believe that he does not 
care what the public thinks.   However he will care when he goes 
to the polls the next time because Canadians will have the final 
say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This incident, this long drawn out debacle over the 
mismanagement of money, is a sad indication of the government's 
arrogance and its attitude toward the public right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The context of the debate itself and the chronicling of what has 
taken place throughout this affair is well documented and has 
been referred to throughout.  Just like those comments that the 
Prime Minister made, we saw the government crow and preen itself 
over its red book promise to be transparent and open and that it 
would put in place an ethics counsellor.  Just like the red book, 
the faces of the Liberal government members are certainly red 
when faced with questions as to how they can let this type of 
thing happen and then not own up to the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister in her wisdom should have come before the House 
shortly after being made aware of the problem, although I do not 
think we will ever know when she was made aware of the problem as 
she refuses to answer the direct question.  She says that it was 
November 17.  However, there is every reason to believe that in 
the course of being briefed after taking over the new ministry 
she would have been told, certainly orally, that there was a huge 
problem coming and that this audit was going to disclose it.  She 
denies that and has married herself to the date of November 17, a 
date which I suggest is completely unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we cannot use the word hypocrisy in this place.  We are 
never allowed to use the word hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Having made the 
point, then it is a good idea not to use it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would say that the 
responses we are hearing are Clintonesque, Nixon-like. That may 
or may not be parliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is cynical repositioning when a government says one thing to 
get elected and then completely turns its back on what it has 
said.  We saw it with the GST.  It has been chronicled.  The sky 
would fall if we entered into a free trade agreement.  The Prime 
Minister took his pen and wrote zero when it came to helicopters. 
We know the words mean nothing after an election as far as the 
Liberal government is concerned.  That is unfortunate because it 
does add to the cynicism and the public's lack of confidence that 
we have seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The red book promises have dissipated.  The Liberals are 
preparing for a third volume, chapter and verse of what they will 
do now. Canadians can only shudder as to what that end result 
might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party supports this motion and encourage all 
members to do so.  We look forward to the retorts and I am sure 
the reasoned debate and response that we will be hearing from the 
government on this score.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as was reported in the media this morning, the 
government's solution to this bureaucratic bungling, this whole 
scandal that has plagued the House since last summer, seems to be 
following a recommendation to split this ministry into three, to 
in fact increase the size of government and to spend more money 
as opposed to going to the root of the problem and finding the 
cause. 
Some people have called it a rescue mission for the minister. It 
comes back to the Prime Minister's comments on accountability 
where he made a commitment in 1991 to hold ministers accountable, 
which clearly is not being done. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It now appears that the government is on a rescue mission for 
the minister.  It is going to spend more money and create two 
more ministries.  It has been suggested that this idea was put 
forward by the Prime Minister and advocated by some of his 
backbenchers who hope to get one of the new positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member make some comments with respect to what we read 
in media this morning about the creation of two new ministries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it appears that there 
really is no great plan.  It is as if there is a new revelation 
every day.  It appears that for a long time the government has 
been flying by the seat of its pants.  Had it perhaps in the 
early days of this scandal reacted in a forthright and open way 
and come to the House with clean hands, there may have been more 
sympathy for what it is trying to do now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dividing up the department when we know there is a huge problem 
is like dividing a big manure pile into three piles.  It is still 
a big problem.  It smells and it is rotten.  I do not think this 
is the answer at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is similar to the problem we saw with respect to the 
gathering of information on Canadians by this department and 
trying to keep it separate and solo, but we knew it leaked.  It 
is information that is being spread around and the problem is 
being spread around.  It is not being addressed in a significant 
way despite the assurances of the minister that everything is in 
hand and that Canadians should trust her and have faith in her. 
Sadly, that time has passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were dealing with a situation where the minister had come 
to the House and made full disclosure in the first instance, we 
might have had some faith, but the time has passed.  I have a 
great deal of confidence that there are good people within the 
human resources department who are trying to deal with this issue 
under very difficult circumstances.

<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in the present debate, what we are dealing with is an escape 
route for the Prime Minister and his government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the House leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party whether he might not agree to invite the 
Liberal Party, with the Prime Minister at its head, to call a 
general election for early autumn, the main theme of which would 
be Human Resources Development Canada and its minister, his 
little favourite, the daughter of the former leader of the 
Ontario Liberal Party. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sure the government 
of the day is in no great hurry to go to the Canadian people and 
seek a mandate based on its performance throughout the past 
number of months, in fact, the past seven years. I would suggest 
that in many ways it has betrayed the interests of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has given Canadians very little reason to believe 
in it or have confidence that it will do what it said it would 
do, let alone act in their best interests given the deception and 
deceit that was involved in the handling of this file.  What we 
truly need is some sort of public inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke with the auditor general this morning.  His office is 
embarking on the very difficult task of trying to sort out some 
of what has taken place and mull over the entrails of a program 
that was fatally flawed and administered in a very deficient and 
faulty fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people in the HRDC department who are being forced to 
deal with public scorn on behalf of the minister.  There is a 
political element to all this that has raised the ire and raised 
the stench, but it is not those in the department and those who 
are tasked with trying to fix this problem that we should be 
lashing out at.  We should be lashing out at the government and 
the administration for their lack of responsibility and the 
arrogance they have been displayed in a fashion that we have 
sadly become accustomed to.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I returned from committee a few moments ago and had the 
opportunity of hearing part of the speech of the hon. member, as 
well as the questions and comments, and I did note your 
intervention.  I am not raising a question of privilege at this 
point, Mr. Speaker, but I wonder if in fact the Chair might 
review the blues to determine whether there were expressions that 
the hon. member used that he should be asked to withdraw.  I 
heard the word deception used with respect to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Yes, of course, the 
Chair would be happy to do so. 
As a preliminary comment, I have been in the Chair for the 
debate today and have paid close attention, because we are from 
time to time on thin ice.  In my opinion, so far there has not 
been anything untoward or anything that has not already taken 
place here in many instances.  However, I think that the 
intervention of the deputy government whip is apropos, insofar as 
it is quite right to be able to cast doubt on the government, but 
not on individual human beings.  Because we are all of us here 
charged with a responsibility, and we are all human beings, it is 
our responsibility as legislators, not as individual human 
beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take the admonishment, and I am certain other members will 
take that to heart.  It is a good reality check. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I acknowledge that intervention.  I realize that in the 
heat of debate there are often times when words are chosen that 
perhaps might be inappropriate.  I do not mean to cast personal 
aspersions upon the minister herself.  It is her department, her 
actions and her handling of this file that are very much the 
subject we are discussing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shame on me if I have overstated the case, but I would suggest 
the threshold of indignation is on the part of government members 
when it comes to the nuances, the special choosing of words and 
the careful selection of words.  They must look in the mirror to 
see if they are not guilty of the same. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
at the outset 
I would like to say that I will be sharing my time with the 
honourable, the esteemed, the illuminating member for 
Saanich—Gulf Islands.  If hon. members think my speech is 
exciting, they ain't heard nothing yet.  Wait until he speaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the people who are watching, especially 
that sea of eager Liberals over there who have the power of 
government in their hands, what we are talking about today.  We 
are talking about accountability, openness, transparency—all of 
the things which the now Prime Minister promised in the election 
campaign of 1993, and probably re-promised in 1997, although I do 
not remember it explicitly at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 it was a promise of the Liberal Party that it would 
restore integrity to government.  It would cause people once 
again to have trust in public institutions.  It would have an 
ethics counsellor.  There would be all sorts of things.  The 
Liberal government, if nothing else, has an almost perfect record 
of inaction on its promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we have an ethics counsellor?  Oh, yes.  Is that ethics 
counsellor independent?  No.  That ethics counsellor reports to 
the Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister says “We have a little 
problem.  Please look into it for us”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot of respect for our present ethics counsellor.  I am 
sure he is watching this debate today because part of his 
responsibility is the ethics of government.  I have a lot of 
respect for him personally, but his hands are tied. 
He, unwittingly, with or without his consent, becomes part of the 
damage control team.  He is part of what it takes to make the 
government look as if it is doing the right things, when there is 
a mounting sea of evidence that it is not doing the right things.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two main themes that I think of when I approach this 
subject.  One is the whole concept of accountability.  I need to 
watch my words very carefully because we have this tradition in 
the House that none of us is capable of doing any wrong or saying 
any wrong or thinking any wrong, although we have no way of 
reading each other's minds, and for that I am frequently 
grateful.  We have this tradition, which really stifles debate, 
because we are all fallible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose this will come as a surprise to the House, and I think 
I am within the parliamentary rules, even though I am overtly 
criticizing a member of parliament in the House, but I am going 
to confess right here that once I made a mistake.  It was 
actually last week.  I told my friend who was nearby that this 
was really a blow to me because it was the end of May and usually 
I make my first mistake of the year sometime in October, so I 
will be under a lot of pressure for the rest of year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you know of course that I am being totally 
facetious.  How many of us do not make one, two or three errors a 
day, or maybe even an hour?  It is really quite unrealistic of us 
to tie up debate in this place and make it unparliamentary to 
even suggest that another member may have made a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that we want to do that in the good spirit of honest 
debate.  We want to do it in a congenial fashion, in the same way 
we correct each other in our families.  If my wife happens to be 
aware of when I make an error, she takes it upon herself to 
correct me.  Wives have a strange way of pretty well knowing 
everything that their husbands do that is done wrong.  I do not 
feel rejected by her when she suggests to me that I said 
something I should not have.  In fact, I take it as a positive 
and constructive criticism.  That is what we are trying to do 
here, within the confines of the language of the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old phrase that I remember.  I was a math-physics 
major when I was at university.  I always loved the sciences. 
This is really quite out of context for me, but I liked a bit of 
literature and history too in my youth.  I hope I have this 
phrase close to being right because I am speaking totally from 
memory.  I think it went something like this:  “Oh, what a 
tangled web we weave when first we practise to deceive”.  I do 
not remember who said that.  I am sure there are thousands of 
Canadians who are bemoaning my ignorance of important literature, 
but that was not my specialty.  However, I remember that.  I 
think that is part of the nub of this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a problem in HRDC, in the grants granting business, in 
terms of accountability and reporting.  Evidence shows that 
mistakes are being made.  What we have now is an inability to 
really say it as it is in the House because of the rules. 
Meanwhile, the minister and/or the upper echelon of the 
department are in full damage control.  They are doing everything 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I did not bring this with me, so I speak from memory.  I 
am sure someone will correct me if I am wrong.  If I remember 
correctly, our party issued an access to information request on 
January 17.  On January 19 the minister called a press 
conference.  With great fanfare, she made public the audit which 
was called for in our request for access to information. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT38"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT38"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1310

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequent to this we made mention of the fact that the minister 
did not disclose this audit, did not make it public until it was 
apparent that due to the ATI, the access to information request, 
it would become public anyway.  To minimize the damage, the 
Liberals said it would look better if it looked as if they had 
done it voluntarily, instead of being forced to do it by the 
official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals denied that it was our access to information 
request.  They said that they had released it before the request 
came in.  Again, I am speaking from memory, but it threw itself 
at me.  Being a person who is mathematically oriented, numbers 
throw themselves at me, and I remember seeing a copy of this memo 
that was circulated, and there it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In trying to cover this up, I do not think it was the minister 
who would have requested it of the upper management levels in the 
department.  I cannot believe it was the other way around.  I do 
not know where it came from, but there was obviously an attempt 
to cover this up.  Here we have a memo dated, say, January 18.  I 
think it was dated January 19.  It says “Your request for 
information was received January 20”.  One would have to be 
clairvoyant to speak on January 18 of January 19 as if it were in 
the past tense.  It is obviously a case where the Liberals tried 
to change the facts retroactively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the type of thing that an independent inquiry would lay 
to rest.  An independent inquiry, which is what the motion of the 
day calls for, would go into these details and find out who did 
what, when, and perhaps even a certain amount of why, and 
Canadians would be able to find the truth of the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will do my usual begging routine, which I do at the end of 
every speech.  We have a very important motion before the House. 
I appeal to all Liberals over there, those who have the power of 
government in their hands because of their slim majority, I 
appeal to all of them, from one end of the Chamber to the other, 
when the vote is called on the motion tonight, to stand and vote 
in favour of the motion; else Canadians will be saying again that 
if government members are against a public inquiry, then they 
really are trying to hide something and do not want it to be made 
public.  Voting against the motion would be ill-advised.  I 
appeal, I beg, I cajole members opposite to vote in favour of 
this motion.  They should show their independence from their 
whip. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to ask a question of the member for Elk 
Island, who has given us his thoughts on this subject and who is 
obviously very frustrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but focus on the solution to a problem.  I think 
it is important that we also recognize that when there are 
problems, there have to be solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most frustrating things for me is when I pick up the 
morning papers and I look at the government's solution to this 
issue.  The Prime Minister's solution seems to be focused on 
dividing this ministry into three.  That is the government's 
solution.  It is absolutely mind-boggling that the Prime Minister 
would have the gall to take his solution of splitting this 
ministry into three, send it off to his backbenchers to study 
at committee, and for them to put the solution forward in the 
hope that they might get one of the new posts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to get the member's comments on the government's solution 
to this problem by dividing this ministry into three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is interesting how the government, when faced with a problem, 
comes up with some sort of solution that can give the appearance 
of solving it without ever exposing any wrongdoing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has said over and over that his is a fine 
government that is totally free of scandal.  The fact is that 
under Mr. Mulroney as prime minister these ministers would have 
been gone.  This government does not even have the standards of 
the Mulroney Tories when it comes to ethics and accountability 
despite the promise in the 1993 election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to dividing this into three parts, a pie can be cut 
it into many pieces and each piece still has the same 
ingredients.  If the solution is to divide HRDC into three or 
more new departments, my question would immediately be:  What 
will be the changes in the components of those new departments? 
What will be the changes in the procedures for accountability? 
What will be the changes in transparency?  Will these new 
departments actually give out information more freely than the 
current department which does it only when we basically sit on 
it?  What will be the change?  If that change can be produced in 
three new departments individually, why can it not be changed in 
the department as it is now? 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask my colleague a 
simple question with respect to the grants and contributions in 
the Prime Minister's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague will know that the amount of grants in the Prime 
Minister's riding alone is greater than those grants given to 
Manitoba, greater than anything given to Saskatchewan and greater 
than anything given to Alberta.  In other words, one riding got 
more than any of those provinces.  Would my colleague like to 
comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to comment on 
that because it is a really sore point with me.  I wrote a column 
in our local newspapers recently in which I talked about health 
care.  I said that the problem would not be fixed nationally 
until we had a government in Ottawa that was more interested in 
buying MRI machines than in building a fountain in Shawinigan. 
That is exactly what I wrote in my column.  That is the essence 
of the situation.  Far too many, not all, of the grants and 
contributions are simply about politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak from memory and could be corrected, but I think recently 
the Prime Minister travelled to Cape Breton Island to make a big 
announcement about money the federal government was pouring into 
the area.  If it is not about politics why did the Prime Minister 
have to go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the same situation in my riding in terms of the 
infrastructure program. If the money was coming to my riding from 
taxpayers via the federal government, why do they not just get 
the cheque?  It was required that the neighbouring minister, one 
of the two Alberta Liberals, make a trip into my riding to 
deliver the cheque.  That is about politics.  That is what is 
wrong about it.  When these things are motivated by politics they 
get totally skewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember also in Prince Edward Island the person receiving the 
grant made a statement: “Mr. Prime Minister, you were here when 
we needed you and I can assure you at the next election we will 
be there for you”.  That is on the public record.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the Canadian Alliance 
supply day motion which calls for the establishment of an 
independent commission of inquiry into the operations of the 
Department of Human Resources Development.  This is all about 
accountability.  It is about holding ministers and the Government 
of Canada accountable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen this story on the front page of newspapers since 
last summer.  Canadian people are becoming increasingly 
frustrated.  That is becoming evidently clear.  They are 
absolutely beyond belief as to what has gone on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the stories about the various grants.  The Prime 
Minister's own riding receives more money in grants and 
contributions than any of the prairie provinces.  There has to be 
something wrong.  It is all about politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking on behalf of the residents of Saanich—Gulf 
Islands, but I think it goes much further than that and includes 
all Canadians.  For months and months and months the government's 
only answer has been to deny, deny, deny.  It absolutely refuses 
to accept that there is anything wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For days we sat in the House of Commons and listened to the 
Prime Minister tell Canadians that $149 or $650 were missing when 
$1 billion were unaccounted for.  It has cost, I would guess, 
hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, as the 
government tries to spin the issue and attach projects to the 
money that has gone askew. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We learned that something in the neighbourhood of 15% of all 
grant applications did not even have paperwork.  They could not 
even find to whom the cheques went.  They were in absolute panic 
mode trying to find solutions.  That is why there has to be an 
independent inquiry.  There needs to be answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read this morning's paper in which the government says that 
this issue is absolutely exploding out of control once again.  It 
just cannot seem to get control of this department.  What is the 
solution?  Its solution has been to deny, deny, deny.  Now it 
seems most interested in creating a soft landing for the current 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless the Prime Minister stood in the House in 1991 when 
he was leader of the opposition and said that ministers in his 
government would be held accountable if there is any boondoggle. 
There were to be no exceptions.  They would be held accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been following what has been going on in the House of 
Commons for the last 20 years.  I do not think there has been a 
prime minister, for as long as I can remember, who has ever 
defended the indefensible.  It is absolutely unbelievable. The 
Prime Minister will go to any length to protect his own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has he done now?  The Prime Minister has decided that the 
best way to try to cover all this up, and that is what is the 
motivation, is to split the department into three.  As one of my 
colleagues said in the House a few moments ago, if we take a pile 
of manure and split it into three we still have three piles that 
stink.  This stinks.  There is no other word for it.  It is 
absolutely rotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is arrogant.  It laughs.  It smirks.  It grins. 
It refuses to answer questions.  The minister has been asked 
questions in the House of Commons by every opposition party, by 
all four opposition parties.  The government laughs.  It does not 
take it seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the history of Canada, when governments start acting 
arrogant, refusing to answer questions and thinking they are 
above it all, there has been one consistent result.  The voters 
throw them out.  We watched it with the Tories in 1993 when one 
of the largest majority governments in the history of Canada was 
reduced to two seats.  Why?  It was because it believed it was 
sitting on a pedestal and did not have to answer to anyone, that 
it was completely unaccountable.  It became arrogant.  It forgot 
about the people who sent it here and whom it was representing. 
It did not take it seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in absolute disbelief that we have a department with 
billions of dollars in its annual budget and the stuff that goes 
on is incomprehensible. 
It is unbelievable how this can go on and the government comes up 
with a nice fancy little talk about having a six point plan.  Its 
six point plan seems to be deny, deny, deny.  That is about the 
only thing the government seems to come up.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat in the House of Commons yesterday during Oral Question 
Period.  When the minister was asked specifically if she knew 
prior to November 17, she refused to answer.  The arrogance is 
incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that we have an independent inquiry.  When four 
opposition parties of very diverse backgrounds agree 100% that 
this should happen so that Canadians can have some answers, it is 
time for it to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we know that government backbenchers will get their 
marching orders.  The Prime Minister will probably stand on a 
chair in the government lobby tonight at 5.15 p.m. or 5.30 p.m. 
after the bells have rung and wave his finger at every government 
backbencher and tell them they know how they have to vote if they 
want him to sign their nomination papers.  A great big club is 
held over their heads.  That is wrong.  It is absolutely 
undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure there are members on the opposite side who probably 
have a lot to offer, as do opposition members, to the governance 
of the country and the debates, but they have no voice.  They do 
not have a voice, Mr. Speaker.  You can look shocked, but you and 
I both know what really happens in this place.  That is what 
needs to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is about Human Resources Development Canada.  That 
is just the tip of the iceberg.  As many of my colleagues will 
say, it is rampant throughout other departments.  We can see it 
in Canadian Heritage in the grants that go out from there.  It is 
absolutely enough to make one's skin crawl, hanging dead rabbits 
in trees and many grants for other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about accountability and respect: accountability to the 
people who sent us here and respecting them.  Change needs to be 
brought to this institution.  There is no question that we are 
less than a year away from an election.  The Canadian people will 
judge the government on what it has not done.  It believes it is 
above everyone else.  We need to elect a government which can 
change that and will be accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be a member of parliament with the Canadian 
Alliance because I truly believe that we can offer the vision and 
change the country so desperately needs.  It will be interesting 
to listen to the Prime Minister's answers today on the latest 
revelations in the media that they want to take a pile of manure, 
split it into three and see if it still stinks.  I would suggest 
that anyone would be able to tell them that they have not gone to 
the root of problem and have not done anything about solving it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage every government member to rise above the Prime 
Minister's finger, do what is right, show that they actually have 
some guts and principles, and vote in favour of this motion, as 
they know it needs to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we go into 
questions and comments, I would note that the use of the term 
guts in referring to other members of parliament has time and 
time again been ruled unparliamentary.  I just bring that to the 
attention of all hon. members. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was interested in my colleague's 
remarks about the credibility of the House and members of the 
House and how the billion dollar boondoggle and the mess in HRDC 
have cheapened and diminished that credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned the need for all members of parliament 
to show the Canadian public that this is a serious issue and one 
which they are determined to deal with in a vigorous manner on 
behalf of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the hon. member has now been a member of parliament for 
a few years, I wonder if he would tell the House his own 
observations about the power and the influence that could be 
exerted by members of parliament on behalf of Canadians in a 
situation like this one if the majority on the government side 
would but choose to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with reference to your 
comment, I would quite happily change that to courage.  I 
apologize to all members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is quite right.  It gets down to the amount of 
influence we can have.  It does not seem to matter whether we are 
in committee, in the House of Commons or wherever we are.  I have 
been on committees and have spent countless hours with some 
members who are now ministers.  The former chairman of the 
fisheries committee is now the Minister of Veterans Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those committee reports sit on shelves and collect dust. I doubt 
if they are ever looked at unless the Prime Minister somehow gets 
his recommendations planted in those reports.  He does not want 
to be seen as the mouthpiece pushing them.  He wants someone else 
to do it, as we have seen in HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said this often before and it can be summarized in one 
sentence.  One of the biggest problems in this institution is 
that we go to the polls once every four years or thereabouts to 
democratically elect a dictator.  That is the democracy we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to change this institution so that there is 
accountability and respect, so that all members of the House can 
have meaningful input on the governance of the country.  We are 
democratically elected to represent our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some cases the government's own backbenchers have less input 
than the opposition MPs and we do not have very much.  The Prime 
Minister cannot stand in our lobby and wave his finger in our 
faces, telling us how to vote or he will not sign our nomination 
papers. He cannot do that, but he can sure do it on the other 
side.  We can see them walking out of the House after votes, 
sometimes almost in tears that they had to vote.  We have seen it 
time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This institution needs to be changed.  It is time to elect a 
government that will bring about meaningful change and show 
respect for Canadians who have sent us here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I commend the member for his remarks 
on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also listened to the Liberal members this morning who 
talked about how the money goes for such things as literacy and 
rehabilitation.  What we are talking about is the misuse of the 
money.  Money may be spent in the constituencies, as the minister 
has said.  Wherever we spend money we can create jobs but can 
those jobs be sustained.  The Liberals talk about the number of 
jobs that have been created but they have not necessarily been 
sustained. I regret to talk about constituents who have told me 
stories of their own employees receiving grants to go into 
competition with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we talk about this commission and going beyond that to the 
election, could the member respond by describing the benefits of 
this $1 billion as it may be usefully used or left in the 
taxpayers' pockets for them to invest it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize that I am 
sure some of the money has gone to legitimate purposes, but very 
little of it.  I do not know the exact numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have given one or two examples, that it has gone to 
some underprivileged people in our society, whom I agree should 
get government funding.  I absolutely support that 100%.  We are 
a caring and compassionate nation and it is an appropriate use of 
public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are opposed to is building fountains in the Prime 
Minister's riding, the unconscionable grants that are given 
sometimes under Canadian citizenship, the grants that go into 
building hotels in the Prime Minister's riding.  It is those 
types of grants across the country. 
That is what we are opposed to.  That is the irresponsible, 
unacceptable use of taxpayer dollars.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would favour the select few programs that they have brought 
up, maybe not under this program but under some other program 
that has accountability and is not a political slush fund. 
However it is the other hundreds of millions of dollars that are 
used for political patronage and to buy votes.  That is what we 
are so vehemently opposed to. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this has been a somewhat barren debate to date.  It reminds me of 
the last several months of questions to the minister in the 
House. I am reminded of an old fashioned phonograph needle stuck 
in its place on a turning disk; it is the same sound with the 
same absence of ideas and the absence of scope ideas. This is 
regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will note as I did in the debate on February 8 that the 
minister was still discussing Indian affairs and making changes 
in the federal enacting legislation which rendered, in my view, a 
much sounder constitutional measure, as late as August last year. 
She had not been in office very long. She faced a litany of 
complaints which might better have been addressed to previous 
ministers and previous governments. I will come back to that in a 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that the minister has made interim changes which I think 
are constructive and helpful and are a great credit to her staff 
for bringing them forward.  The accountability of managers is an 
important principle in business.  It should certainly be applied 
to government operations that are affected with the business 
interests where government competes in many ways and areas where 
private enterprise also operates.  Another change is disciplinary 
action, meaning personal accountability of managers where there 
is mismanagement, fraud or gross incompetence.  The creation of a 
special new audit group is another change.  The review of all 
active files is being done intensively with a checklist of 
contracts and requests for payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commented on the intellectual poverty of the contribution of 
the opposition to this debate. Let us go back into history.  What 
is the history of HRDC?  I listened with interest to the 
contributions made by the members of the Progressive Conservative 
Party.  Of course they created HRDC. The Lady Jane Grey of 
Canadian politics, the queen for six days—remember the hiccup 
between the Mulroney government and this government—Kim Campbell 
decided to give trendy new titles to new government ministries. 
There was a haphazard, hasty grouping and regrouping of 
departmental portfolios.  The department of human resources was 
created without any real thought of a rational structuring 
process for the new ministry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of record that the new government elected in 
October 1993 immediately considered restructuring HRDC.  However, 
it concluded correctly with the economy in the use of time, as we 
were trying to balance the budget after inheriting the $42.8 
billion deficit from the Mulroney government, that our priority 
was to get fiscal integrity back.  It was decided that it would 
not be a good expenditure of government time to attempt the 
restructuring at that stage. The moment has arrived where we must 
consider doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has been made of the majority report of the HRDC standing 
committee.  I thought they were interesting proposals.  I can see 
no Machiavellian plan here.  If my colleagues put forward 
proposals, I tend to say that they have a good idea or that it 
needs more thought. It should not be taken as government policy, 
but as an interesting idea which I hope the government will 
study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put the recommendations into the record.  The functions 
of the HRDC ministry grouped together somewhat unnaturally three 
different areas of policy, statutory transfers and entitlement 
which really is old age security, Canada pensions, labour, 
employment and employment insurance, and social development 
programs. 
It is elementary that special technical skills are required for 
each of these.  It is unusual to find a complement of the skills 
extending all across the department.  This is one of the things 
we have to examine in this situation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anybody approaching new government as we enter the 21st century 
would agree that we have stood still in terms of administrative 
law reforms and structuring for the last 40 years.  With the 
consent and engagement of all parties the main pre-emptive 
concern has been with issues of national integrity, the 
sovereignty issue, as in Quebec.  It has killed off the 
modernization that should have gone on with the administrative 
processes.  I reproach the opposition parties, including the Bloc 
which claims to be a reform party inside Quebec, with having no 
new ideas on governmental structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One very obvious issue is the breakup of the overly large 
departments.  It is a reality that this government and the 
Mulroney government let some key ministers handle what might be 
called four or five different portfolios.  It is too big a task. 
The McRuer commission in Ontario some years ago attempted to 
approach a solution to this problem.  The Hoover commission in 
the United States is a great model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply, we should be considering issues such as a uniform 
administrative procedure act applying to all government 
departments, but especially the spending departments or those 
with spending responsibilities and a conseil d'état special 
administrative law tribunal with jurisdiction over all such 
ministries.  There is also the principle which is well accepted 
in civil law of the personal liability of civil servants and 
managers where they engage in misconduct that could either be 
described as delictual in itself or gross negligence in the 
administration of their office. I would have thought these would 
be issues that an opposition party, particularly the Conservative 
Party, which was the mother of the human resources ministry in 
its present form, should have put forward to debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are available now.  I hope we have some debate in the 
forthcoming election campaign, whenever it is, on this issue. 
This generation of Canadians has a rendezvous once more with the 
constitution, not the constitution narrowly defined in sections 
91 and 92 or limited to the Quebec issue, but the fundamental 
modernization of the administering of processes and the study and 
perfecting of techniques for control of relationships of 
governmental authority with the citizen.  That is a target for 
reform.  That is a target or challenge which opposition parties 
could bring to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to raise the issues on the government side.  Put in 
this perspective, the majority report of the HRDC committee 
offers interesting suggestions but they are no more than that. 
The matter is open for debate, but we cannot postpone the 
decision any longer.

from time to time at Laval University in Quebec City, where I 
myself did my law.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a man concerned about respect for democracy, could he tell 
us, I would like to know, how democracy can be abused by a party 
in power—at the moment the Liberal Party, it could be another 
party at another time—which uses public funds collected from 
members of the public of all political stripes in order to put 
pressure or promote a single political viewpoint, in this case 
that of the Liberal Party of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I readily accept the challenge 
of the hon. member, who has a lot of technical training in this 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I said that French thinking in administrative law is 
way ahead of Anglo-Saxon thinking. I regret, for these reasons, 
that Quebec's quiet revolution has not yet led to the 
development of a modern system of administrative law that would 
apply not only to Quebec, but to all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a modern process for administrative law, for the 
monitoring of any government. This is why I pay attention to 
ideas in that area, to the concept of councils of state, 
patterned on the great model of Paris, created by Emperor 
Napoleon, a system in which public officials are accountable 
before the courts for their actions as members of the 
administration, for their wrongdoings and even for their 
negligence in administering the laws. 
We need Quebec's thinking—

<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too would like to draw on my 
colleague's expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his remarks he mentioned the personal liability for 
misconduct of people who serve the public trust. As he is aware, 
the Financial Administration Act and the treasury board 
guidelines were routinely flouted in the way public funds were 
managed by HRDC.  This was confirmed by memos from officials in 
the department and by the department's own talking points which 
say that the rules now have to start being honoured.  It was 
confirmed by the circumstances of a number of these grants where 
funds were held over past year end contrary to the Financial 
Administration Act, trust funds set up contrary to the Financial 
Administration Act, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 37 of the Financial Administration Act not only says 
that this is illegal, but section 80 sets out some pretty stiff 
penalties for individuals holding public office or serving in the 
public service who allow the law to be broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member think that the penalties in section 80 ought to 
be applied?  Would he also give us his opinion as to why no 
penalties or consequences have ever been applied so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member, as a 
very thoughtful graduate of law and a practitioner with some 
experience, knows that I cannot comment on individual cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think I could direct her attention, as I have tried 
to direct the attention of the House, to the need for a more 
comprehensive system of administrative law responsibility and the 
need therefore for an administrative procedure code.  It is not 
difficult to draft.  Many countries have it but it would involve 
our collection in comprehensive form of the rules and 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe we need, and this is one of the problems of the 
Anglo-Saxon common law world where we feel we do not need it, I 
do think we need a special administrative law tribunal.  The 
Conseil d'État is the model around the world.  I hope that the

of proposal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This latest motion is little more than a vain attempt by the 
opposition to try to keep the issue alive and in the press for a 
few more hours or days.  The old adage, if a story is repeated 
long enough and loud enough, maybe enough people will believe it. 
That has certainly been the tactic of the opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Day after day in question period they say the same things.  Day 
after day they repeat the same old questions:  Where is the 
billion dollars?  How come the minister will not resign because 
she has lost a billion dollars or more, and so on.  Over and over 
they ask where the billion dollars is that is missing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there are too many Canadians left who think the 
opposition really wants any answers to anything.  They are 
ignoring Abraham Lincoln's famous script “You can fool some of 
the people some of the time and all of the people some of the 
time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are very smart and astute people.  At some point the 
truth does comes through.  This latest ploy to call for an 
independent commission of inquiry is not about the real issues 
that play to Canadians, it is about nothing other than cheap 
politics. What the opposition does not tell people is that we 
already have an independent review going on right now by an 
officer of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Office of the Auditor General of Canada is on this case. It 
is working closely with the Department of Human Resources 
Development to address the issues.  Who does the auditor general 
report to?  He does not report to the minister or to the Prime 
Minister.  He reports directly to the House, to all of us in the 
House.  He reports to me and he reports to the opposition.  He is 
independent of government.  He is an independent officer of the 
House.  He says what he wants to say. He investigates what he 
wants to investigate.  He will report in the fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the auditor general sound the alarm?  Is there a clarion 
call for the immediate suspension of all government operations 
and the appointment of a 10 year long royal commission into 
everything?  Not at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what the auditor general's officials had to say about 
the new regime HRD has put in place to rectify the current 
situation.  They said that in their opinion the proposed approach 
represented a thorough plan for corrective action to address 
immediate control problems. They also said that some longer term 
actions were also included that would further strengthen the 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the words of the people charged with the 
responsibility of auditing government programs and reporting this 
audit to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that is not good enough for the opposition.  It wants 
somebody's head on a plate.  Solutions do not make headlines, 
only problems make the headlines.  As we and the minister have 
all acknowledged, it was not an insignificant problem.  In fact, 
it was the minister who brought this problem to the attention of 
the House.  It was the minister who stood in her place and said 
that books on grants and contributions needed to be fixed because 
an internal audit showed that the procedures were not followed 
properly, that complete records were not kept and that forms were 
not filled out in the entirety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the bottom line?  After all the sound and fury from 
opposition benches about billions of dollars gone missing and 
after the department reviewed an audited 17,000 additional files, 
what was the result?  The result was that $6,500 remained 
outstanding, not in money but in documentation for $6,500.  All 
the boondoggle that continues to be talked about was never a 
boondoggle to begin with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is particularly important is that the minister and the 
department, rather than responding to the great controversy over 
the way the records were kept with a kind of easy response, a 
kind of grants and contributions chill that would have seen 
hundreds of excellent and worthwhile projects go waiting for 
funds, took steps to rectify the situation which balanced the 
need for grant recipients and the need for proper accountability 
and financial controls.  In other words, they took the difficult 
plan.  They rolled up their sleeves and got down to business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the audit said that the paperwork was unacceptable, they 
set about to put it right and to get the right forms in the right 
places.  That was what this is all about.  Where the audit said 
information was missing, it was obtained.  Where approvals were 
not recorded or were carried out incorrectly, they were 
corrected.  Where further monitoring work was called for, it was 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let us remember again what the audit said.  The audit 
said that important paper was missing, not money.  In response to 
that, it went through one file at a time to ensure that 
everything was done exactly right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the repeated claims of the members opposite, that has 
not been the issue since day one.  The Canadian public was 
clearly misled.  If that is the role of the opposition, then at 
some point they owe an apology to the Canadian public, as well as 
to the minister.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister has said, the paperwork is central to the 
accountability of her public funds.  What is also central is 
the fact that these programs are there for a reason.  They are 
not just political window dressing, as many of the critics claim. 
These are programs that help people; programs that members on 
both sides of the House have long agreed are both necessary and 
worthwhile; programs that help people get and keep jobs; 
programs, for example, that have helped reduce the unemployment 
rate from 11% in 1993 to below 7% today; programs that have 
contributed to the fact that over two million jobs have been 
created since 1993; programs that focus on the needs of 
individuals in all regions of this country and create practical 
and results oriented ways to help them become productive and 
contributing members of society and the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members opposite can sneer at these support programs and how 
they are administered and they can try to turn Canadians to their 
real agenda, which is that government should abandon those in 
need and provide more tax concessions to those better off in our 
society.  I do not believe their plan will work.  I do not 
believe the majority of Canadians would agree with that narrow 
vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of Canadians believe in helping our fellow 
citizens when they are in need.  The vast majority of Canadians 
believe in a sane and levelheaded approach to how we provide that 
support.  I think the vast majority of Canadians will see this 
motion for what it is:  Just another attempt by the opposition to 
grab some headlines; just another attempt by the opposition to 
undermine a whole series of worthwhile programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope that the House will reflect the opinion of the 
majority of Canadians and reject this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to say something about the comments made earlier by 
some opposition members about those of us on the government side 
being whipped into supporting the motion.  I will not be 
supporting the opposition motion that is before us.  I sat on the 
HRDC committee and listened to all the allegations from the 
opposition.  I listened to the staff and the witnesses.  I will 
be voting against the motion because the work has been done and 
the corrections have been put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We will have five minutes for questions and 
comments, but I was just wondering if we might begin the 
statements now and then members will have a full five minutes for 
the questions and comments after that.

were apprehensive, some with zeal, but all had a prayer on our 
lips as we huddled in our assault crafts.  The sky was blanketed 
with allied aircraft and the great ships fired continuous salvos 
at the French coast.  It is a wonder how the enemy could have 
survived.  The noise was deafening.  The channel was very rough. 
A destroyer came close to us.  The waves from her bow were higher 
than our craft and she looked the height of the <I>Queen Mary</I> 
to me”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the soldiers were seasick and just wanted to get to 
shore, no matter what was waiting for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Finally we neared the beach, and then my assault craft hit a 
mine or was hit by a shell, I am not sure, but I was thrown into 
the air and then into the water, semi-conscious, weighted down 
with my grenades and bandolier.  I struggled free and then passed 
out.  I was picked up and was in hospital in England when I 
awoke.  I was one of the lucky ones”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, in 
1996 the Prime Minister gave the OK for up to 100 tonnes of MOX 
plutonium to be burned in Canadian CANDU reactors.  We will 
shortly be receiving a second shipment of this radioactive 
material from Russia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attitude of the government is deplorable, especially during 
Environment Week.  With no public consultation whatsoever on 
importing this dangerous substance, it is acting in an 
underhanded manner, to the detriment of both human and 
environmental health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Environmental Assessment Panel to Nuclear Waste Management 
and Disposal Concept indicates that the Minister of the 
Environment and the Minister of Natural Resources had promised a 
full environmental study, including a public investigation by an 
independent panel. So far, nothing has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing that close to 50% of the initial mass of MOX will remain 
in the form of radioactive waste, and that plutonium has a life 
of 24,000 years, this is enough to have the public shaking in its 
boots.

week the federally appointed arbitrator tasked with determining 
whether the severance and pension packages available to the Devco 
coal miners were equitable made his ruling public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Outhouse ruled that 246 more miners will be eligible for the 
early retirement package by stating that anyone with 25 years of 
experience in the coal mines would qualify.  This was in contrast 
to the federal government's position that only miners with a 
combination of 25 years experience and a minimum age of 50 would 
qualify.  This brings the benefits package in line with those 
offered to other crown corporations when they were privatized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arbitrator also ruled that medical benefits will be paid as 
long as employees receive severance payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arbitrator's ruling closely follows what the PC Party has 
been calling for to improve the Devco bill.  The PC party noted 
the need for improved medical provisions and for more inclusive 
severance packages.  The federal government ignored those ideas, 
but the arbitrator's ruling shows that the PC Party was once 
again on the right track.

minister, who was in charge of a huge department.  She would be 
responsible for billions but she would have no idea what was 
going on because those bureaucrats would keep her in the dark. 
Sinister officials would funnel millions into fountains, hotels 
and canoe museums, the crazier the better.  The minister could 
just sort of doodle happy faces on those boring old internal 
audits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister think this is a plot she might star in or 
should we just turn it over to Leslie Nielsen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  These comments are getting

think we are getting a little bit out of hand.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

accusations and no insults will change the facts in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is clear is that the department has taken the work of the 
internal audit very seriously.  We have provided that information 
to the Canadian public.  We have shown them how we are going to 
make improvements and we have actually shown them that we have 
made improvements. 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

that her top bureaucrats, officials and personal staff spent much 
of last fall in a frenzy trying to prepare for the fallout that 
was going to be coming forward because of this now famous audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Damage control plans were in full swing last August to prepare 
for the fallout but that did not phase the minister.  Between 
August and December she shovelled another $500 million out in 
programs, the very programs that bungled the first billion 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If everyone else around the minister knew the results and the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

top bureaucrats and the people in my department.  I just want to 
say to the House, and particularly to that member, that the 
members of the Department of Human Resources Development have 
been working around the clock, 24 hours a day, to improve the 
administration of grants and contributions because they agree 
with the government that those contributions make a difference in 
the lives of Canadians in every part of the country, including 
the hon. member's riding. 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

is such political interference from the top that they are not 
allowed to do their jobs.

million out in programs.   Do members know what those programs 
included?  They included programs that gave young people who were 
on the streets the opportunity to come into a place with a roof 
over their heads and to get some training and self-respect.  In 
this particular case, I am thinking of the Servants Anonymous 
Society in the city of Calgary where a young woman turned to me

she had a briefing from her officials on the hottest issues but 
that somehow they forgot to remind her of the hottest issue of 
all, the internal audit.  By October 20 everyone in the 
department, from the mailroom clerk on up, knew about the 
internal audit except for the minister who, like a mushroom, was 
kept in the dark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this is all very painful for the minister but I wonder if 
she could tell us what her bureaucrats told her to say about why 
she was out of the loop for those three disastrous months.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

and we will go over it once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than a year ago the department identified that it should do 
an internal audit on its grants and contributions.  Over the 
course of a period of time the audit was undertaken.  The audit 
was not even complete during the timeframe to which the hon. 
member has made reference, which was the summer.  The auditors 
were still in the field collecting information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said before, as a result of the preliminary findings 
the department took action, which is as it should be.  I can tell 
the House that the first time I was briefed on the internal audit 
was on November 17, and that was appropriate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I want the member to go directly to his 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, how can Canadians have 
any confidence in a minister who stands up and proudly proclaims

<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

really nothing but an insult.  I remember that it was that party 
in 1993 that said it was coming to the House of Commons to 
improve decorum.  Whatever happened to that?

contract without tender to provide communication services, after 
contributing $15,000 to the Liberal Party fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister tell us why Richard Mongeau received that

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government

its annual contribution of $7.2 million to the Tokamak project, 
in Varennes”. Incidentally, these criticisms were made in the

While our aircrews performed admirably, these very experienced

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

at hand.  We knew full well what the capabilities of the CF-18s 
were.  In fact they performed admirably. They were involved in 
over 600 missions.  They were asked by the U.S. general in charge

strengthened the management response.  It made sure that the 
internal audit was made public.  It helped write the six point 
plan that is supported by the auditor general and is now being 
implemented. And it made sure that 17,000 active files in my 
department were reviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have shown today is that it has never been about money

</I></B></P><P align=left>HRDC deputy minister Claire Morris acknowledged “intensive and

department undertook an internal audit.  The audit was not 
complete until late fall.  It was brought to me with the 
completion of the review as well as a management response on 
November 17. When I reviewed it I insisted on a stronger 
management response.  When that was completed, the whole thing 
was made public and now of course the rest is history.

departmental officials were in full spin mode over the billion

plan on how to release this damaging information.  Then the new

and December under her watch HRDC spent almost $500 million on 
grants and contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the minister continue to approve expenditures of nearly

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

clearly that no money was missing?  Indeed it continues to be 
spent wisely and widely across Canada to help the citizens of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr.

look back at the record.  We did and what we found was that from 
July to December, while the time bomb was still ticking away in 
her department, she denied that the problem even existed.  There 
were more grants and contributions funded out of that office in 
November than in any other month in 1999.  The minister has

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am glad I was able to be in the House to listen to the 
hon. member's earlier comments.  She talked about cheap politics. 
Cheap politics is the fact that there was more money spent in the 
Prime Minister's riding through grants and contributions than was 
spent in the province of Alberta, Saskatchewan or Manitoba. To 
me, that is cheap politics.  When they can build fountains in the 
Prime Minister's riding and then reach into a senior citizen's 
bank account to take money out of her account without her 
authority, that is cheap politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time when health care and education budgets were being 
cut, grants and contributions were going up.  How can the hon. 
member stand in the House and justify that kind of action by the 
government? 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Sgro (York West, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would 
remind the hon. member that one of the roles of HRDC is to get 
people off unemployment and back into the workforce, as well as 
to ensure that opportunities are there for the disabled, the 
handicapped and many other Canadians who look forward to a 
positive future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unemployment rate was reduced from 11% to 7% as a result of 
the work done through HRDC.  I think that is very important. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like the hon. 
member to respond to what we know.  We can go to any school of 
public administration at any university across the country and 
read the literature.  We know that this type of expenditure 
probably hurts more than it helps the Canadian economy.  Study 
after study it shows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the government continue in the face of the academic 
literature?  Is it because it knows there is a payoff 
politically?  Even though it is not efficacious to the economy, 
it may be helpful in the voters' eyes, and it could misspend the 
money and get away with it because in the short term it could buy 
votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Sgro:</B>  Madam Speaker, my opportunity to sit on 
the HRDC committee and hear from the various agencies the great 
things they did with the help of HRDC grants flies in the face of 
the comments of the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the intention of our government, the Government 
of Canada, and Canadian taxpayers is for people to be helped in 
society.  Cutting taxes is not supposed to be the primary goal 
for anybody; it is to provide good services to the people of the 
country.  That is exactly what we were doing with the HRDC 
grants.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, one of the things the member stated in her speech was 
that she thought we were just bringing up over and over again 
needless and unfounded accusations against the government, or 
something to that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out in the comments part of my statement 
that this was first raised by no less than the Auditor General of 
Canada.  He raised serious questions about mismanagement in the 
department.  All we are doing is following up on what he started 
and trying to get some accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to respond to a very simple question. Is 
she really convinced that there is nothing wrong in HRDC, or will 
she admit that there is and that it needs to be fixed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Sgro:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would point out as a 
member of the committee that the committee held many, many 
meetings and heard lots of witnesses.  We recognize that the 
recommendations in the report came from all of us; that we look 
at finding a way to make the department slightly smaller, 
modernizing the department and streamlining it.  It is a very big 
department and it deals with huge amounts of money.  All the 
recommendations in the report are there because we, the 
government, also wanted to see some change and some opportunities 
to stay on top of some of the issues.  Those are the 
recommendations that came out of the HRDC committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased today to have a chance to speak to 
this important motion.  To remind people of what the debate is 
about today, the opposition motion put forth by the Canadian 
Alliance reads in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House call for the establishment of an independent 
commission of inquiry into the mismanagement of grants and 
contributions in the Department of Human Resources Development— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who watched question period today would understand that 
the motion should definitely be accepted by all members of the 
House.  What we saw today was the minister responsible for HRDC 
avoiding direct questions from members of the opposition.  Then, 
after she could no longer avoid the questions, she avoided 
answering the questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An extremely important and direct question was put by several 
members.  The question was:  What is the authority that the 
minister used to allow her to take money out of a private 
citizen's bank account?  It was a very direct and straightforward 
question.  The minister never provided an answer to the question. 
The reason the minister did not provide an answer is because 
there is not a good answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must establish a private, independent commission of inquiry 
to look into issues such as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three reasons we should establish a commission of 
inquiry.  The first is to serve the public interest to ensure 
that what is best for the taxpaying public will be what happens 
in the future.  That would be the result of an inquiry which 
would look at all that is wrong, so much that is wrong, with the 
Department of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason is to restore public confidence, not only in 
parliament, but to restore public confidence in the Government of 
Canada generally.  What has happened in this department and what 
has happened in other departments has led Canadians to become 
even more cynical than before when it comes to trusting the way 
the government spends their hard earned tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third reason is to provide the Canadian public with answers 
for all of the unanswered questions that have come up as a result 
of issues being raised by opposition parties into what has gone 
on in that department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the reasons for which we clearly must establish an 
independent inquiry.  It should be obvious.  A government which 
really wants to be responsible to the people of this country, 
knowing the reality of what has gone on, should on its own 
volition, on its own initiative, call for such an inquiry to 
clear the air.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a government is under siege, like the Liberal government is 
on this issue, what possible reason could there be for not 
wanting to establish a public inquiry to clear the air?  I would 
argue that the only reason would be that it has even more that it 
wants to hide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extremely serious issue.  It is not going to go away. 
It has added to the cynicism of the general Canadian public 
toward government.  They feel they cannot trust government, and I 
understand why.  For the sake of trying to help re-establish some 
of that trust in government and in politicians generally, we need 
this inquiry.  That is not too much to ask.  That is what the 
Canadian public ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read some of the things that my constituents have said on 
this issue, but I first want to say that I will be splitting my 
time with the hon. member for Kootenay—Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote a constituent from Vermilion who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am, as many Canadians are, disgusted with the ongoing fiasco of 
our current government.  Minister Jane Stewart and Prime Minister 
Chrétien insist there is no fire on their burning ship.  No doubt 
they have cast their life boats out for themselves, but have no 
problem sending their bureaucrats off the plank to lighten the 
load. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want say that it is wrong to blame the people working in the 
civil service for what has happened here.  The fault lies with 
the government.   The minister of that department and the 
government are responsible for how the departments are run. This 
constituent has expressed concern that the government is not 
respecting that responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents are also pointing out that they are concerned 
that this minister and this government have tried to blame civil 
servants on several occasions for the problems in that 
department.  That is just not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituent goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only a swift independent look at each “donation” that HRDC 
distributed and the roles played by the HMS Squander crew will 
put closure and accountability to this fiasco.   It is sad though 
that we have to spend more taxpayer money to prove 
accountability.  I paid a lot of taxes this year and my family 
looks to each pay cheque to keep afloat and to build a future. 
It's time the government admitted fault, fixed the problem and 
helped to start building Canadian's future rather than sinking 
its own ship and letting the taxpayer clean up the mess. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is from one of my constituents who is responsible for 
supporting a family and who is fed up with the wasted spending 
and the lack of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents are saying that they are accountable for their 
families and that it is very difficult to just stay afloat due to 
high tax levels.  Wasted spending is a real concern to these 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another constituent from Lac La Biche sent me a copy of an 
e-mail he had sent to the Prime Minister.  The e-mail reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sir:  You have to get rid of this albatross running the Human 
Resources Department of your government...One (or is it three?) 
billion dollars, is a staggering amount of money.  She is 
obviously not up to the task of ensuring the taxpayers money is 
treated with the care and respect it deserves.   Public 
officials...must remember, tax money doesn't grown on trees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elected people have a very important responsibility, no, a trust 
to guard against wasteful squandering of what should be 
considered a precious resource.  I know there seems to be a 
shortage of common sense these days, but do we have to keep 
reminding you to maintain some restraint and accountability in 
your fiscal dealings? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was sent to the Prime Minister from someone who is 
absolutely tired of the way tax money is being squandered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another one of my constituents from Ryley, Alberta says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There appears to be between one to three billion dollars that was 
doled out to grant recipients without proper administration or 
following accepted accounting practices...The general public 
needs to have faith that the government agencies spend our tax 
dollars wisely and prudently.   This controversy will only lower 
our perception of the federal government's ability.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Leon, I am very concerned about the billions of dollars that 
has gone missing while under Jane Stewart's keep.  I just don't 
understand this system that seems to think—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must interrupt the 
hon. member.  The hon. member knows very well that we do not 
refer to members of parliament by their names.  Even if you are 
citing a letter, you must editorialize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Madam Speaker, it just slipped my 
mind.  Of course, I was talking about the Minister of Human 
Resources Development.  I was reading from a letter I received 
from a constituent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituent goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just don't understand this system that seems to think that it 
is okay to have a billion dollars that just goes missing...I am a 
mature woman who has been trying to get a degree...and I have had 
to borrow money under the guise of earning a university degree to 
have some income so that I can raise my 4 children.  Maybe (the 
Minister of Human Resources Development) should try living on 
less than $12,000 a year.  She would soon learn how to keep track 
of every penny.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a letter from a mother of four who is trying to raise

Human Resources Development and the government squander money.

hard-earned tax dollars are being spent in such an irresponsible

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
listening always attentively to the comments and speeches 
opposite, I could not help but notice that as the member read the 
letter, the writer of the letter has come to believe that somehow 
a billion dollars has gone missing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was curious about whether or not the member himself believes 
that a billion dollars has gone missing, because I do not think 
that is factual.  It may actually be the case of the adage, that 
if something that is not factual is repeated often enough, 
perhaps with the use of that rhetoric, people may be convinced 
that what is not factual may be the truth.  It is regrettable 
when that type of rhetoric and exaggeration goes on but I suppose 
that is part of the political rhetoric of this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the member who just spoke and who just read 
that statement into the record as though it were factual.  Maybe 
the hon. member is not prepared to answer the question, but does 
he believe that a billion dollars has gone missing or does he 
just want people to believe it because he says it might be so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Madam Speaker, I was of course 
reading from correspondence sent by my constituents.  Some of 
them did point out that they felt there had been no proper 
accounting for the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Roughly $13 billion a year are given out in grants and 
contributions.  Has a billion dollars gone missing?  I cannot 
answer that because there has not been proper accounting.  So 
many things have been done improperly that in fact we do not know 
what has really happened with the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Asking me to account for what certainly the member himself 
cannot account for, because there has been improper safekeeping 
of taxpayer money, is an odd thing to ask.  I think the member 
ought to ask the Minister of Human Resources Development, the 
minister responsible for this department, and the ministers 
responsible for the other departments that make up this $13 
billion in spending. Hopefully, they will eventually arrive at 
the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This independent public inquiry, a commission, would certainly 
go a long way to at least answering the questions with regard to 
the human resources department.  Those are the answers we are 
looking for and those are the types of questions to which 
Canadians want answers.

Addington, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is probably too much to 
ask my hon. colleague, but I do wish that members on all sides of 
the House would take the time to respond to their 
constituents and to put some of the facts out:  the fact that 
there is not a billion dollar boondoggle; and, the fact that 
there is not $1 billion missing.  However, they take all their 
facts from their national tabloid which is under some other name 
on the news stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That same party and those same members talk about political 
interference.  My question is, how can my colleagues stand in 
their places and say that there is political interference when 
more than 50% of the funds from grants and contributions went to 
opposition ridings? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think the hon. 
member knows that the money was spent leading up to elections in 
constituencies where the Liberal Party felt it had a legitimate 
chance to win.  Many of them it did not win, and as a result 
these ridings are represented by opposition members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would suggest that it is improper to use taxpayer 
money to fund that type of election campaigning before an 
election is officially called.  Part of the problem is that too 
much of this money has been allocated for political reasons 
rather than for the purpose of benefiting the whole country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the members opposite getting really excited.  They should 
be because this issue and their complete disregard for proper 
accountability could lead them to lose the next election.  I hope 
it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can help their own cause by supporting the motion for a 
public inquiry to look into the issue with regard to HRDC.  Let 
us get some of the answers to the questions and then we will all 
know what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now it is factual that billions of dollars have been spent 
in a way for which there has been no proper accounting.  I and 
the general public want those answers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would again just like to briefly read the motion 
before the House that we are presently debating.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House call for the establishment of an independent 
commission of inquiry into the mismanagement of grants and 
contributions in the Department of Human Resources Development, 
and into any attempts to control the disclosure of this 
mismanagement to the public. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, you may recall an unfortunate incident that I was 
a part of in the House, where I ended up using an unparliamentary 
word to describe the assertions of the minister.  I commit that I 
will not use that unparliamentary word again.  It does not change 
the fact that indeed the minister's statements were factually 
inaccurate and incorrect.  It is what has driven me to request 
the time to be able to speak to the House about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into the specific situation with respect to my own 
constituency, I would like to say that in taking a look at this 
entire issue, it has been quite revealing.  If we were to take a 
look back in time, we would discover that the starting point of 
this entire debacle, at least the debacle of the minister 
constantly doing cover-ups and constantly attempting to deflect 
responsibility for her culpability in this issue, all started 
when the Canadian Alliance asked for an access to information to 
her department with respect to an inquiry on an audit that had 
been conducted in her department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, by some strange magic, the people of Canada were asked to 
believe that the day following our request for that audit 
information, the minister suddenly discovered that it was just 
about time that she revealed that information to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of us found it rather un-credible that she would attempt to 
have Canadians believe that when we became aware of the audit and 
we asked for the audit, that the very next day, by some strange 
magical coincidence, that she was going to reveal the audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right from the very beginning, right from that point forward, we 
have had the minister doing a constant deflection of 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a Conservative member of the Chamber earlier today 
quoting the Prime Minister, who, at the time when he was the 
opposition leader in 1991, said that every one of his ministers 
would be accountable to the House, accountable to him and 
ultimately accountable to the people of Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's words that he gave Canadians in 1991 ring 
absolutely hollow.  They are an absolute mockery of even the 
intent of the words he uttered in 1991.  It is absolutely 
shameful that the Prime Minister would allow his government to 
have reached a point where the HRDC minister is constantly trying 
to deflect responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole parliamentary system of Canada is based upon the 
parliamentary system of Westminster.  It is based upon 
accountability and responsibility of the ministers of the 
government and the minister is constantly trying to deflect 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even today, as she was questioned about the fact that clearly 
there was an interim audit, going back to June the officials in 
her department at the time that she took over the department were 
fully aware of the implications of this audit, the implications 
that her department had fundamentally lost control of $1 billion 
in spending.  She would have us believe in spite of the fact that 
when she was advised of all the so-called hot issues in August 
1999, when her officials had in hand an interim audit, that those 
officials chose to keep her in the dark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She can play with words until she is blue in the face.  She can 
stand up and perhaps factually tell us that she was not 
officially informed until November 17.  But those words do not 
mean anything because it is not feasible, it is not possible, it 
is not credible that her officials would have kept her in the 
dark from August through September into October and until 
November when she was finally told. As has been pointed out by my 
colleagues in questions in the House, during that period of time 
she had a chequebook out of which she wrote almost half a billion 
dollars of Canadians' money to various projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any responsible, reasonable Canadian looking at the way in which 
the minister is constantly trying to duck, weave, dodge and get 
around the facts as they are presented would see that it is not 
credible.  The minister is not accepting her responsibility and 
not accepting her authority over her department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I became as upset and exercised about this issue as I 
did, and the reason I went to the extent of having the Speaker 
remove me from the House for using unparliamentary language, was 
that when the minister stood up in the Chamber, she did so as 
part of her process of deflection, as part of her way of getting 
around the responsibility that is only hers to have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said that I personally had been constantly in touch with her 
office in a way that would promote these grants and funding to my 
constituents.  In fact, I have a very competent staff who advised 
me and made me fully aware that indeed members of parliament 
should not be doing that, because if members of parliament do 
that, they give up the arm's length basis of being able to hold 
the government accountable for the funds that it is in the 
process of disbursing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What basically happened was that we were approached by a 
business in my community which had put in for a grant. I believe 
it was in the neighbourhood of half a million dollars.  It was 
for retooling an operation.  When it got to a particular point in 
the process, no matter what those people did, they could not get 
any information back from the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Doing the job that any good MP should do, my office contacted 
HRDC on my behalf, and I take full responsibility for that, and 
said that this business was having this difficulty and would they 
please converse with these people and inform them of exactly what 
is going on.  A second time it was the same thing. 
It lurched a little forward from that point.  Again that business 
came to us saying it could not get any information out of the 
department and would we give it a hand.  In this instance we just 
left a message on the voice mail saying, “Would you please 
contact these people and let them know what is going on.  Are the 
forms filled out correctly and we understand that they have been 
approved.  What is happening?”

</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the treasury board came to my constituency.  I 
recall saying to her when she was in Cranbrook, “Madam Minister, 
the frustration for this company is that we keep on hearing that 
indeed leases have been approved.  There are other capital 
expenditures that will be happening.  I am not advocating that 
they be approved or not, but we are told that they are approved. 
Please simply inform this company what in the world is going 
on”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the position I took.  That is the reason when the 
minister said I had been advocating, pushing, shoving or doing 
whatever it was that she said I was doing, I was so incensed 
because I had stayed within what I considered to be a very 
important boundary. Indeed the auditor general substantiates the 
position that I and my office have taken.  I quote from an 
article: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Desautels said he feels MPs should not be involved in 
approving job creation grants to companies and groups in their 
own ridings, as they currently do under the transitional jobs 
fund and Canada jobs fund programs, because their participation 
blurs the lines of public accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“If members of parliament are involved in the decision making 
process for [job creation grants], that blurs the line and makes 
it hard for them to play their oversight role of government”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the official opposition, we are holding the minister 
accountable.  We are trying to get the facts from the minister, 
not the facts as constructed in the precise wording she is giving 
the House, but the facts as to her responsibility and the fact 
that she is not taking responsibility.  That is clearly why every 
member of the House must vote in favour of our motion this 
evening, that the House call for the establishment of an 
independent commission of inquiry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Fredericton, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have a simple question for the hon. member.  If members on the 
government side make an inquiry on behalf of a constituent in 
exactly the same manner that the hon. member suggested, because 
those members throw around language about approvals and so on 
quite freely, the fact is that no member on this side approves 
these programs.  We are asked our opinion or we make inquiries 
just like the hon. member suggests that he made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I can make such an inquiry and the member should be 
aware of that. Were that particular organization successful in 
whatever application it may be, and God forbid, were that 
organization to make a donation to my campaign, completely 
unrelated to this, as happens all the time, that would be a 
subject of considerable angst for hon. members opposite.  I have 
heard it in the House all the time. It is unfair to the companies 
and so on.  If the hon. member made an inquiry on behalf of a 
company in his constituency and it happened that the company made 
a donation to his campaign, would there be anything wrong with 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is very clear that I 
was making an inquiry as to process.  I was inquiring as to where 
it was in the process.  I requested that they report back to my 
constituent because my constituency did not understand and could 
not get the information.  That is the job of a member of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member is talking about by contrast is a totally 
different issue.  He is making an inquiry as an advocate for that 
business.  That is the difference.  The surprising coincidence of 
the level of contributions that occurred after those grants and 
funds were given by the government to the firm in the 
constituency of one of the members who happens to be in the House 
today is what raises eyebrows.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very simple difference. I do not understand why the 
member and the minister do not understand.  There is a total 
difference between inquiring as to process and inquiring as an 
advocate for the company.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, my hon. colleague said that every member must vote 
for this motion.  I note that the Liberal member for 
Broadview—Greenwood is concerned that the power of the Prime 
Minister's office has turned members into voting machines.  In 
the ridings they are nothing but patronage machines.  The member 
for Waterloo—Wellington said that MPs should roll up their 
sleeves and go to work and do whatever they can to effect change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to comment on what he thinks the 
chances are of those people living up to those kinds of 
commitments.  Is it just all talk, talk, talk? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Madam Speaker, the whole issue of 
discipline on the part of the government is fairly chafing for 
many of the members on the back bench.  The vote tonight will be 
yet another indication of just how much restraint and chafing 
there is.  This is a worthy motion that clearly should have the 
approval of the House considering the gross mismanagement and the 
dodging and weaving the minister has done over this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister must be held accountable.  If the Prime Minister 
will not hold the minister accountable, then maybe the House 
could.  However, as my colleague has pointed out, the Prime 
Minister has such restraints on the Liberal members in the House 
that realistically, I do not see any way that the motion will go 
forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the 
member for Fredericton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel compelled to speak to this very misguided motion.  It 
talks about attempts to control the disclosure of the 
mismanagement to the public.  I want to make clear to the House 
and certainly to the Canadian people that my approach in this 
whole affair has been to be fully transparent and open and to 
disclose to the Canadian public the issues that are within and 
about my department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House that it was on November 17 when 
I was briefed on the results of an internal audit which looked at 
all the programs and our grants and contributions and found that 
there was significant improvement needed in the management of our 
grants and contributions.  I received the initial results; I 
received the results of the internal audit and the initial 
management response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon receiving that, I identified that I took this very 
seriously.  I told the department that I wanted a stronger 
management response and I also indicated to them that we would be 
making the results of this internal audit public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me it is extraordinarily important that the government 
respect the people of Canada and that we let them know when we 
have problems.  Certainly we let them know when times are good 
but we also let them know when we have problems.  At the same 
time we would indicate to the Canadian public how we would fix 
the problem and when we would do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January the work of the department was completed. The 
management response was fully reviewed and that is when we 
presented it.  We made it public.  The government made it public. 
This is very difficult for members of the Canadian Alliance to 
appreciate and to accept.  From their point of view government 
should be managed behind closed doors.  They think we should 
sweep things under the carpet.  Clearly that is what they have 
been indicating over the course of questioning in these last 
months.  From our point of view, that is not the appropriate way. 
That is why for me it was terribly important to make this 
information public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all we have done to disclose the information 
associated with this.  To me, one of the best places to be 
questioned by parliamentarians, those who are here elected on 
behalf of Canadians, is at the standing committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Christmas I have been to the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development three times.  Once was to talk about issues 
of disabilities and our support for Canadians who are disabled. I 
recognize my colleague who will speak after me for the work he 
has done in that regard.  The work of the government builds on 
his study and his recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went two other times to talk specifically and only about 
grants and contributions.  Members from all parties, including 
members from the government side, had the freedom to ask me 
anything they wanted about grants and contributions.  I gave them 
two complete opportunities to do that.  To my way of thinking, 
that is about being transparent, about being open and about 
disclosing information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at some of the things that the standing committee 
members asked for, we see another example of how open and 
forthcoming we have been on this side with regard to this issue. 
Members talked about grants and contributions specifically. 
Certain members, not on this side but on that side of the House, 
talked about grants and contributions being found only in Liberal 
ridings.  That is so false that nothing could be further from the 
truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee asked to see where the grants and contributions 
had been made.  Out of respect for the committee, out of respect 
for Canadians and out of respect for disclosure, transparency and 
openness, my department prepared over 10,000 pages of information 
that itemized line by line by line where the grants and 
contributions were made.  We invest those moneys in support of 
Canadians with disabilities, Canadians who are learning to read 
and want to improve their literacy skills, and young Canadians 
who have not been able to find employment and want to find their 
way so they can contribute to this great country.  If hon. 
members took the time to look at that paper they would see that 
grants and contributions are found not only in Liberal ridings 
but in ridings held by members of every political stripe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the opposition, those who present the motion today, 
continue to talk in the House about grants and contributions as 
something to be found only in Liberal ridings.  The 10,000 pages 
of information we provided prove categorically that they are 
wrong. Have they stood and apologized?  Have they disclosed their 
true motive, which was not to improve the system of grants and 
contributions but to undermine it?  No, they have not. Instead 
they present misguided motions like the one we have in the House 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at other ways that I have insisted on being open to 
the Canadian public.  We worked with the auditor general on our 
six point plan.  He gave advice on its efficacy and will make a 
report to the House in the fall on our grants and contributions. 
I note that there will be a review by an independent third party, 
an officer of the House.  We already have that piece of the 
motion covered.  In that six point plan we agreed that we would 
present to the Canadian people on a quarterly basis the results 
of our work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was fortunate enough to make a presentation on the first 
quarterly report to the standing committee.  What was in that 
report?  It was an explanation of the work of the department over 
the last few months focused totally on improving the 
administration of grants and contributions.  It included a 
fulsome review of 17,000 active files across the country.  What 
did that review find?  It found that we had to improve our 
paperwork in those files.  That is being done because they are 
active files. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It did not find, as that party opposite continues to indicate, 
that money was missing.  It confirmed what we had said from the 
very beginning.  This is not about money being lost.  We know 
where the money is.  It is in those grants and contributions 
itemized in the 10,000 pages we presented to the House of 
Commons.  It is out in communities working to ensure that 
Canadians have the opportunity to participate in our increasingly 
fast and effective economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my report to the standing committee I made it clear that we 
had reviewed these files and that we were on a go-forward basis 
in implementing our six point plan to ensure that the 
administration is strong. 
What I clearly indicated again, because I have done it so many 
times before, was that $1 billion were not missing.  In fact out 
of 17,000 active files we identified $6,500 that have not been 
paid and that we will continue to try to obtain.

opposite asked questions in the House month after month.  Let us 
not forget that.  My heavens, I am in the House virtually every 
day answering their questions, talking about the information that 
they want.  Yet, no matter how often they question, the facts 
remain the facts.  It was this side of the House that undertook 
the internal audit.  It was this side of the House that made it 
public, disclosed the results of that audit to the Canadian 
public.  It was this side of the House that implemented an action 
plan to ameliorate the difficulties in the department because on 
this side of the House we believe absolutely that the grants and 
contributions in which we invest are vital to the people of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What becomes clear in the questions from the opposite side is 
that this is not about improving the system.  It is about getting 
rid of all grants and contributions.  Members on that side of the 
House are not interested.  Nor do they believe that the 
Government of Canada has a role to play in helping Canadians. If 
there is anything I want to make clear in this speech today, it 
is that they are wrong to suggest we are not forthcoming in 
disclosing the information Canadians want to have.  They are 
wrong to suggest that grants and contributions are a waste of 
money, because they touch the lives of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will stand here and defend against the simple minded, 
mob-like, nasty mentality of the members of that party opposite 
who are doing nothing but trying to undermine the institutions of 
Canada and undervalue the Canadian values of generosity, sharing, 
tolerance and diversity.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, first I would like to ask for 
unanimous consent of the House to extend the time for the 
minister to answer questions on this important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there agreement in 
the House to extend the time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>   No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, it somehow does not 
surprise me that the Liberals want to limit the minister's 
exposure here.  The minister has just talked at some length about 
the fact that she has made all this disclosure.  Just in the 
short time I had, and I could not make a comprehensive list, 
there are five things the minister has not disclosed.  I might 
think of more as I am speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 10,000 pages simply said that <I>x</I> number of dollars went 
to <I>x</I> company in <I>x</I> riding.  It does not disclose what 
the dollars were intended to fund.  It does not disclose whether 
the intended results for the expenditure of that money were 
obtained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister hid the Deloitte & Touche criticism of her six 
point plan.  Scores of access requests have been unlawfully 
delayed by her department, a department by the way that has over 
20,000 employees but somehow cannot find the bodies to deliver 
the documents that are requested by law within 30 days to the 
opposition and other members of the public.  In fact, the 
information commissioner told the committee that delay was 
actually deliberate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no disclosure of the audit itself until the opposition 
put in an access request for it.  There was no disclosure of the 
progress report of the six point plan to the committee until 
after the committee proceedings started.  Then the minister said 
we had lots of time to ask her questions.  We had not laid eyes 
on the report, but we were supposed to ask her searching 
questions about it.  She had time to give it to the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has not disclosed the investigation into the Conili grant 
that she said cleared the member for Ahuntsic and the department 
of any wrongdoing in this grant that did not create jobs, but she 
will not give us that report.  She censored six pages of an 
Arthur Andersen audit of a grant that criticized her department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has a whole history of non-disclosure of important 
information, and these are only samples of what I am able to 
bring out in a short period of time.  How can the minister have 
the nerve to stand in the House and pretend to Canadians that she 
is being honest and open when her record indicates otherwise?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Oh my goodness, Madam Speaker, where 
do I want to start?  Let us go back to the myth that it was the 
Reform Party which forced our hand through access to information. 
Categorically that is wrong.  I say again:  I made this internal 
audit public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about the 10,000 pages and about the 
itemization of grants and contributions.  I wonder if the hon. 
member has taken the time to go to her local office and ask them 
about those individual projects, or maybe even to visit them and 
see the impact and the difference they make in the lives of 
Canadians.  Somehow I doubt it when I read her comments in the 
press.  She just ignores that as if this money is not about 
people at all.  That is one of the most insulting things about 
the approach from that side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are basically telling Canadians who have been the 
beneficiaries of these grants and contributions that they are a 
waste.  There is nothing that could be further from the truth. On 
this side of the House we believe in ensuring that every Canadian 
counts and that every Canadian has the opportunity to participate 
in this great country through grants and contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me look at some of the other things the member talked about. 
She talked about access to information.  Let me quote from the 
special report to parliament of the Information Commissioner of 
Canada tabled last month.  Here is what he said about the 
Department of Human Resources Development Canada: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the review period every access request received by HRDC 
was answered within 30 days—no extensions were claimed.  This 
show of respect for the rights of Canadians to timely responses 
represents an outstanding feat of good leadership, good 
management and hard work.  Kudos to HRDC are well deserved and 
unreservedly given by this Commissioner. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out that we have been inundated by access requests, 
given the grants and contributions question.  We remain firmly 
committed and are working with the information commissioner to 
ensure that those requests are met because, as I pointed out, we 
are in this to ensure that we are disclosing information and that 
we are being transparent and open with the Canadian people. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
again seek the unanimous consent of the House to ask the Minister 
of Human Resources Development, who is responsible for this 
department, which has been in a state of crisis for several 
months now, to deign to give us five more minutes so that we can 
perform our duty as representatives of the public in this 
parliament. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there agreement to 
extend the period provided for questions of the minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Fredericton, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to join in this debate as it gives me an opportunity to 
add my support to those who recognize that there is absolutely 
nothing to be gained from an independent, politically motivated 
commission of inquiry as proposed by the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been over this ground before.  The opposition is a one 
trick pony on this file.  We tell opposition members about the 
benefits that individual Canadians derive from HRDC programs, and 
they call for an inquiry.  We tell them about how important HRDC 
programs are to strengthening the social fabric of the nation, 
something of which I am sure they know little, and they call for 
an inquiry.  We read to them the letters and comments from 
Canadians from every part of Canada who support the government's 
approach to human resources development, and they call for an 
inquiry.  Now we give them an opposition day to discuss the 
nation's business, and they call for an inquiry.  That is the 
only line that party has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rest of us have moved on.  Those of us on the government 
side have gone past inquiring.  We are working on this issue.  We 
have already agreed that problems were identified with the 
administration of HRDC grants and contributions.  We have 
accepted that.  We have already agreed that corrective action 
needed to be taken to address the problem.  We are moving forward 
with the kinds of action that are needed to do just that. In 
fact, the government is taking this issue extremely seriously, as 
can be seen in the six point plan announced by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development in the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quickly remind the House what the minister committed to 
do.  The minister committed to ensure that the payments meet 
financial and program requirements; to check and correct the 
program files; to equip and support the staff, who are working 
tirelessly I might add; to ensure accountability; to get the best 
advice available; and to report on progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a comprehensive, responsible plan.  It is a plan of 
action that has been endorsed by the auditor general, who is only 
quoted from the other side with criticism, but remember the quote 
“This action plan is a very thorough plan for corrective 
action”.  “A very thorough plan for corrective action” is what 
the auditor general said.  That should be good enough to move 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real question should be:  What is being done to carry out 
this plan?   We do not need an inquiry to answer that.  We need 
to look at what is being done to address the deficiencies that 
have been identified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to know that they can continue to depend on these 
programs and they want their accounts to be properly 
administered.  That is why the appearance of the minister before 
the standing committee was so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister used the occasion to bring committee members up to 
date on the progress being made in the implementation of that 
well received plan.  During her appearance she tabled a report. 
It provided a wealth of important information for those who are 
genuinely concerned about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the report confirms that all documentation for HRDC 
active grants and contributions is now in order.  The minister 
pointed out that close to 17,000 active files were reviewed in 
addition to those audited.  The total contract value was just 
over $1.5 billion.  Of that $1.5 billion, a total of $6,500 was 
owed to the Government of Canada.  That is $6,500 out of $1.5 
billion researched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work to clean up and review these files has been 
extraordinary.  Many public servants have been working night and 
day, turning in a lot of extra effort for which they deserve our 
thanks.  They have been going through file after file.  I would 
point out that is because those dedicated public servants believe 
in programs around literacy and disability and young Canadians 
getting into the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the information in the past was not adequate.  The 
government learned from that.  We know that proper paperwork is 
central to the accountability of public funds.  We have moved 
decisively to deal with these deficiencies in manners that are 
earning the praise of the auditor general.  That is not all.  The 
department is also making progress on other elements of the plan. 
For example, it is better equipping and supporting the staff who 
administer the programs.  The minister has already called for 
more training of the staff at HRDC, and since January more than 
3,000 program and finance employees have received training.  A 
training strategy has been developed to ensure that all 
appropriate staff receive mandatory training on the delivery of 
grants and contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department has also improved its organizational 
accountability by restructuring so that it can better accommodate 
the challenge of balancing national standards with regional 
program delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Human Resources Investment Branch has been split in two. 
One branch is responsible for nationally delivered programs, and 
the second branch is responsible for those that are delivered 
regionally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Departmental officials continue to draw on expert advice from the 
auditor general, as well as others, as required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On every one of these aspects of the plan significant progress 
is being made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department is also being open and transparent in reporting 
on its work.  The minister has stood in the House and answered 
questions for months.  She has appeared before the standing 
committee.  She has tabled a full report on the progress to date. 
In addition, she has undertaken to respond to all legitimate 
requests for information from members of parliament, so much so 
that when the information commissioner appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights he gave her an A+. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privacy commissioner, to some extent on the other side, 
also told her that she was doing an extraordinarily good job on 
that side of the equation.  It is not an easy balance to find.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were 10,000 pages of project information tabled before the 
standing committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that the best interests of all Canadians 
are served when we strike an appropriate balance between clear 
accountability to taxpayers and getting results for Canadians. 
Indeed, this will always be a fundamental challenge of good 
governance.  Obviously there have been weaknesses in the 
department, but they have been identified.  We have established a 
plan to correct them and we are working to implement that plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am concerned, the process is working.  I fail to see 
how a politically motivated inquiry such as that proposed by the 
opposition could add anything useful to this process at this 
stage and I will not be supporting it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, from what my colleague says, a 
person would think Human Resources Development Canada was a model 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the 10,000 sheets of paper we are supposed to have been 
sent, we asked for an invoice from Placeteco justifying the 
spending of $1.2 million.  The minister herself came to the 
committee to tell us everything is fine in the active files. But 
she said nothing about the inactive ones where it is not. We have 
asked repeatedly for records on Conili Star and Placeteco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell you why the Liberal majority does not want to change 
the rules of the game.  In the next election, they will be able 
to take advantage of the same system they did the last time. That 
is the only reason they are refusing to hold an independent 
public inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know full well that some of the funds were used for 
partisan purposes, particularly in the time of the predecessor of 
the present minister, who is now Minister for International 
Trade.  He systematically put the funding program at the service 
of the Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the main responsibility for the poor image of the job 
creation projects not lie with the present Minister of Human 
Resources Development, who is herself in the process of taking 
away all credibility from programs which could be credible 
undertakings?  Her behaviour is stripping them of all 
credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to ask the hon. member, who sat on the standing HRD 
committee, what he thinks of the attitude of a minister who, two 
hours after the release of a report, calls a scrum just to 
announce “I haven't read the report.  I am not familiar with the 
recommendation for dismantling”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is here, and the hon. member is here.  Might we 
have his opinion on the dismantling of the department?  He signed 
the report.  What are his thoughts on the minister's response? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I welcome the reference 
to my high regard for the minister because, ultimately, as a 
partisan, he may not recognize my being less than biased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the comments of the information commissioner or the 
privacy commissioner, and the comments that have been made by 
those people who are in the business of keeping an eye on the 
government, and the fact that the minister scores so high on both 
fronts, is worthy of comment and I appreciate the opportunity to 
repeat it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great regard for the member who asked the question.  One 
of the reasons I have that regard is because I know he is 
effective in his riding in getting things for his constituency. 
Are the programs that are represented by this department not so 
important as to be tainted, perhaps not by this member but by 
others, by what is obviously a politically motivated assault on 
the kinds of programs that members across the way simply do not 
believe in?  It is that simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that is not the case with the member across the way.  I 
believe he supports these programs.  We sat on the committee 
together for a long time.  We have made great progress, 
particularly since this minister became the minister responsible 
for this department, and the member knows that.  The report that 
was written by the committee was an important report.  The member 
has been talking about the kinds of things which are in that 
report for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize when progress is made, and progress 
has been made.  I would ask the member if he does not fear that 
by being party to this politically motivated assault may have the 
effect of jeopardizing programs which I know have been very 
generous to him.  I would want him to think about that.

it is unfortunate that not all opposition parties could put a 
question to the minister, but I will put a question to the hon. 
member who just spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the real issues that needs to be addressed is to ensure 
that there is a code of conduct within all departments for the 
disbursement of grants and contributions to provide an assurance 
to Canadians that there is not partisan decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member support something like that, to ensure 
that there is fairness, transparency and consistency of practice 
in the decision making process for grants and contributions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott:</B>  Madam Speaker, absolutely I would 
support it because it exists now.  The problem with members 
opposite is that when I call it is political interference, but 
when members opposite call they are making an inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not fair.  We are elected by the people of Canada to 
represent the interests of our constituents, the same as members 
opposite, and we have every bit as much right to make those calls 
of inquiry that have been supported on the other side.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Calgary 
West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to rise to address this issue, calling for an 
independent inquiry into human resources development.  It would 
be an understatement to say that the minister's handling of HRD 
has been a disaster.  That does not come close to describing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After having heard the member for Fredericton speak, I am not 
surprised it has been the disaster it has been.  I just heard him 
compliment a member from the Bloc, saying—and this would be a 
high Liberal compliment I guess—that he is very effective at 
getting things for his riding.  Government is Santa Claus to the 
Liberals.  It is this endless pit of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder that they have made this great contribution to 
driving our debt to its present height of $577 billion.  It is 
not surprising at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about what actually happened.  The whole modus 
operandi of the member who just spoke, the minister and the 
Liberal government has been to cover up this issue, and then when 
they get exposed they downplay it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me run through what has happened.  We heard the minister in 
the House today trying to justify how it was that months after 
her own officials knew about the disaster at HRD she was merrily 
writing cheques to the tune of half a billion dollars on a 
program that was so fundamentally broken that the internal audit 
had shown that about a billion dollars had been issued without 
proper accounting, in some cases without records indicating what 
the money was to be used for and without grant applications.  It 
was a nightmare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between the time when this was first exposed by the interim 
audit and officials in the government knew about it, and three 
months later when the minister acknowledged that she knew about 
it, and even after she knew about it, she continued to write 
cheques, even though there were no controls in place.  The money 
poured out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we mentioned today in question period, the most money poured 
out in the month of November, the month that she allegedly knew 
about this for the first time.  There was $165 million which 
poured out in that month and there were no proper controls.  It 
is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we raised these things, of course the government said that 
it had been transparent.  I want to hit that on the head right 
now.  The truth is that the government had no intention of 
releasing anything until such time as the official opposition, 
the Canadian Alliance, at that time the Reform Party, submitted 
an access to information request on January 17.  Lo and behold, 
on January 19 the government called a hasty news conference to 
say there were problems in human resources development.  It said 
that there had been an audit and there were problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what we asked for in our access request, a copy 
of any internal audits.  Amazingly, this turned up two days 
later.  The government was trying to do damage control.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said she had been transparent all along.  Why was 
it that she got the full briefing on November 17 but nothing was 
released until January 19 if she wanted to be completely 
transparent?  Why did it take those two intervening months?  I do 
not understand that if she was completely transparent. We have 
documents that show that the spin doctors in the minister's 
department were saying that nothing should be released until such 
time as someone thought to ask for the information through an 
access to information request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When she says that she is fully transparent, that is only true 
in one sense.  The sense is that we can see right through her 
when she says that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is the minister was not transparent.  She is still not 
transparent.  The member for Calgary—Nose Hill, the official 
opposition critic for human resources development, did an 
outstanding job of providing case after case after case to show 
that the minister is anything but transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeking all kinds of information that is completely 
relevant to this $1 billion mismanagement, this boondoggle, that 
the Liberals will not release. It was a misrepresentation both by 
the member for Fredericton and the minister when they said that 
all the access to information requests were being processed. Then 
they got up and read something from the privacy commissioner 
saying that everything has been done on time.  That was before 
the audit was released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since then all of our access to information requests get 
submitted and it takes longer and longer to get information back. 
I am sure that the strategy is to put it off at least until the 
summer, to try to get to the summer so the Liberals can get this 
issue off the front burner and on to the back burner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disingenuous, insincere talk that we get from the 
government about how transparent it is.  The opposite is the 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 20 police investigations.  I heard the minister say 
that this was about $6,500.  If that is not the most ridiculous 
laughable statement that I have heard in this place today, I do 
not know what is.  The truth is that there are now 20 police 
investigations probing what has gone on in HRD.  That tells us a 
little bit about how serious this situation is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four investigations in the Prime Minister's riding 
alone.  There are all kinds of accusations about money being used 
improperly and there are many questions about the Prime 
Minister's office skipping normal procedures to ensure that money 
went to people he favoured. It is unbelievable.  The Liberals 
have somehow brushed this off:  it is only $1 billion with which 
all this mismanagement is occurring so why be concerned? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the Liberals move into downplay mode.  Now that the 
cover-up has been exposed, they want to downplay it.  They say it 
is ancient history, that was before and they are looking to the 
future.  In truth, if the government is to be the least bit 
responsible, people have to be held accountable for this type of 
incompetence on one hand and blatant political pork-barrelling on 
the other hand.  If there is to be any sense of justice in this 
place, then people who have made major mistakes have an 
obligation to own up to them and to be punished for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the private sector people do not escape these things.  I 
would argue that in situations like this people would go to jail. 
And here we have that kind of unbelievable negligence with the 
public's tax dollars to the tune of $1 billion.  It is 
unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has long passed for the government to accept that there 
were major, major problems in this department, but it continues 
to stonewall.  The Liberals want to look forward.  The most 
interesting example of that was when the Prime Minister was in 
Germany the other day.  He said that he wanted the upcoming 
election to be about ideologies. It was obvious by what was not 
said, that he did not want to talk about the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals talk about the record, they will have to talk 
about probably one of the worst scandals in terms of government 
misspending that we have ever seen under their watch. 
There are 20 police investigations and $1 billion has been poured 
out the door plus another $500 million in the months since August 
and in some cases there is absolutely no accounting for it.  This 
is unbelievable.

Their party does not seem to stand for anything except trying to 
get elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have seen in HRDC is a perfect example of the situation 
when we talk about the administration process. The transitional 
jobs fund is a clear attempt by the Liberals to lever themselves 
back into power by pouring money into certain key ridings hoping 
that the public will be bought off by political pork-barrelling. 
It is to the point where the HRD committee itself has recommended 
that the department be broken up without fully saying that it is 
the result of this boondoggle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must have an independent inquiry.  What we have seen so far 
is stonewalling from the government.  The Canadian public 
deserves some answers.

Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Mississauga South, International Trade. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, my colleague has done a lot today to open people's eyes 
with regard to the type of swindle that is going on particularly 
in places like Shawinigan. I would like to ask him about some 
businesses that I know get funding out of HRDC and whether or not 
he thinks that is appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to shop at Wal-Mart. It gets a lot of my money and I 
know it gets a lot of other people's money too.  That company 
makes enough money from Canadians by what they voluntarily choose 
to buy.  I do not think it is fair that Wal-Mart gets subsidies 
from HRDC but that is exactly what is going on.  It is not just 
Wal-Mart because the list goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding alone the list includes Shoppers Drug Mart, another 
profitable company that is getting HRDC funds, taxpayer money. 
There are private accounting firms in my riding that have access 
to these government funds.  Canada Safeway is another profitable 
company that has access to HRDC funds. These big companies are 
getting access to HRDC funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians who may not be making much money are paying taxes so 
that the government can subsidize these private corporations. 
What does the hon. member think of Canadian taxpayer dollars 
subsidizing private companies with HRDC funds as the Liberals are 
doing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, I share my colleague's 
concern about what is happening with these funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that in Canada today the Liberal government 
takes $7 billion a year in income tax from people making less 
than $20,000 a year. Then it turns around and funnels that money 
through HRDC and puts it back into funding friends of the Liberal 
Party and members of the Liberal government.  In some cases the 
money goes to huge corporations.  That is fundamentally wrong.  I 
cannot believe members on that side of the House would stand for 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada today under the Liberal government, taxpayers pay 
income tax after they have earned $7,031. That money goes to the 
finance minister and then over to the human resources development 
minister who in turn sends it to companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud my friend for pointing out that there are people in 
his riding who are getting this money. I applaud him for exposing 
this.  It is quite unlike the member for Fredericton who thinks 
that government is Santa Claus and the purpose of government is 
to distribute goodies.  That is not the purpose of government.

keep the peace to ensure that we have criminal courts and decent 
defence for our country.  Those are the things the government 
should do.  It should not try to micromanage the economy.  I 
cannot believe that at the beginning of the 21st century the 
government still thinks the role of government is to try to pick 
winners in the economy, when all of history shows it simply 
cannot be done.

colleague can ramble on for the whole day, but the agenda of that 
political party is to get rid of government support for people in 
high unemployment areas. I want him to stand and tell 30,000 
Canadians who are in high unemployment areas that he wants to 
cancel programs and assistance that are provided to the private 
sector to create jobs.  I want him to tell the 15,000 Canadians 
with disabilities who have benefited from these programs that he 
wants to cancel them.  I want him to tell the over 300,000—

interrupt the hon. member so the hon. member for Medicine Hat can 
respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, there is the difference 
in the vision.  The Liberals want to hand out grants.  We want to 
get people jobs, opportunity and a future.  That is the big 
difference between the Canadian Alliance and the Liberal Party. 
The Liberals seem to think the only way they can help people is 
to cut a cheque. Shame on them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, for the folks back home I want to make sure they clearly 
understand what we are talking about.  We are talking about human 
resources development and the massive boondoggle that the whole 
department is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the opposition parties have requested an independent inquiry 
into the ongoings at HRDC.  I would like to add that the first 
committee I sat on when I was elected to the House of Commons 
barely three years ago was human resources development. 
Oftentimes I sat there with my jaw to the floor when I recognized 
exactly where taxpayers' funds were going in that $57 billion 
monster.  I came to this job thinking there were problems in 
government, but when I sat on the HRDC committee I got a bigger 
shock than I was expecting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been 20 different investigations with regard to what 
has been going on with HRDC.  The worst part of it is that it is 
thickest among the benches of the cabinet ministers.  There are 
four investigations in the Prime Minister's riding alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a system right now whereby things are being rubber 
stamped for the Prime Minister and other cabinet ministers' 
ridings or in ridings where the Liberals think they have the 
possibility of losing a seat.  Right before elections and during 
elections they are pumping untold sums of money into those 
ridings so they can salvage them.  They are doing it with 
taxpayer dollars.  They are trying to buy votes. It is the most 
blatant abuse we could possibly imagine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the opposition parties have been calling for an 
investigation into this blatant vote buying by the Liberals with 
taxpayer dollars.  They should be ashamed of themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance put out a dissenting opinion with regard 
to HRDC and the grants and contributions on Thursday, June 1.  It 
was pointed out that there has been a lack of transparency with 
regard to the HRDC fiasco and the Liberal boondoggle and waste. 
There has been insistence that there be an audit and that it be 
made public.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and her officials wanted to wait.  They said that 
the audit would be made public.  That is what they told us.  That 
is what the minister said.  She said that it would be a public 
audit and that everyone would have a look at it.  However, when 
the audit was done did they make it public?  Did the minister 
make it public even though that is what she promised to do?  No. 
She broke her promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, the minister waited until an access for information 
request had to pry it from her fingers.  That is exactly what the 
minister did.  She was trying to cover up the audit, even though 
she said that it would be a public audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gets worse.  An opposition MP finally received a copy of the 
audit dated October 5, 1999.  When he got a copy of the audit he 
was asked to destroy it.  Can we believe it?  He was asked to 
destroy a copy of the audit and to accept a copy that was dated 
later in January 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me trace the chain of events one more time.  The minister 
said the audit would be made public, but when the audit was 
finally done she and her officials sat on it.  Only because of 
access to information was that audit finally released.  When the 
audit was finally released, the opposition members who got copies 
of it through access to information were told that they should 
destroy them and not use them.  They were asked if they would be 
willing to accept one that was done later.  If that is not a 
blatant cover-up, I do not know what is.  That is what the 
Liberals are up to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on.  I wish the story ended there but it does not.  When 
members of parliament asked for details of HRDC grants by riding 
we were told they did not exist.  The minister stood in her place 
in the House and said day after day that we as members of 
parliament could not get riding by riding breakdowns with regard 
to HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were asking simple questions in the House with regard to what 
was happening in our individual ridings.  We were told that we 
would have to go through access to information.  That was it, 
that was the way we had to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister well knows that many times with access to 
information it means that money out of our budgets has to be 
spent, just because we were asking for a riding by riding 
analysis which the minister refused to provide even though she 
could.  Or, we were told to put something on the 45 day order 
paper process rather than receive information directly from the 
minister.  That is type of stuff we have been putting up with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a very clear cover-up of evidence of 
mismanagement with regard to HRDC, but there is more yet.  It 
goes on.  An employee of HRDC in New Brunswick received a phone 
call from Ottawa and was told that if there was anything missing 
in the HRDC files she was to review them, fill them out and 
backdate them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister knew that there were problems with the files.  She 
was denying it, standing day after day in the House of Commons 
and saying that there were no problems.  However, she had the 
gumption, the public relations savvy, to phone the offices across 
the country, namely one in New Brunswick.  She knew there were 
things missing from the files.  We were asking questions about 
it.  They knew there were things missing from the files.  What 
did they do?  They looked to cover it up.  Once again it was 
another case of cover-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These employees were ordered to review them, fill them out and 
backdate the files.  In a sense they were told to misrepresent 
and go ahead and alter the documents so that the real public 
record would not be known.  That is what the Liberals were up to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on beyond that because there was a very blatant 
contradiction.  The minister stood in the House of Commons on 
December 16 and said “No moneys flowed until the appropriate 
approvals were in place”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It sounds so noble for the minister to say that no moneys flowed 
until the appropriate approvals were in place.  How does that 
statement fit with the statement “there was anything missing in 
these files, review them, fill them out and backdate them?” That 
clearly indicates a contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and her officials knew that there were things 
missing.  They knew that those forms were not filled out.  They 
knew that indeed those things would be backdated and that they 
were ordering their employees to do so.  However the minister had 
the gall to stand in the House and say that no moneys flowed 
until the appropriate approvals were in place.  How could the 
appropriate approvals be in place when she was ordering her 
officials to backdate the files, fill them out and review them? 
That is a pretty obvious abuse.  I would say that is a pretty 
clear contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have a contradiction between what the minister is saying 
and what her employees are being ordered to do, it means that one 
person is telling the truth and the other person is telling 
something else.  That is exactly what that means.  It is 
something other than the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would side with the employee rather than with the minister in 
this case.  We have $22 billion spent as grants and contributions 
in HRDC, a disingenuous communication strategy on the part of the 
government, and an absolute absence of controls and 
documentation.  This reminds me of what happened with regard to 
APEC.  We heard a member over there ballyhoo much about that, but 
he knows all too well there was a cover-up in that regard. He 
paid a price.  He lost his job for that.  He is no longer a 
cabinet minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not only APEC.  It was also Somalia.  The government did 
a cover-up with that when it got a little too close.  That is 
exactly what it is doing with this.  It knows it has problems and 
it does not want to admit that it is misusing taxpayer funds to 
buy votes with HRDC money.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, my 
colleague stood to attack government programs in areas of high 
unemployment.  He stood to attack the government for assisting 
people with disabilities.  He stood to attack the government for 
assisting first nations people.  He stood to attack the 
government for trying to assist over 300,000 young Canadians 
across the country who benefit from government services and 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the rumbling that has taken place from my colleagues on the 
other side has nothing to do with the issue at hand.  It has to 
do with the mere fact that they wanted to shut down government 
operations when it comes to the government trying to assist those 
who are in need.  They wanted to shut down the programs, and they 
are on the record as saying that over and over.  The bottom line 
is there is a philosophical difference between what we stand for 
and what they stand for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons is the best public inquiry in the country. 
It is right here where for over eight months they had the floor 
of the House of Commons to make their case day after day after 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no case.  They have nothing to show.  Of all these 
allegations that $1 billion were missing, there were in fact six 
overpayments totalling $3,229 in the 16,971 projects that were 
reviewed and of this amount $803 have been recovered to date.  We 
are talking about approximately $2,500 being missing.  Frankly my 
colleagues should be ashamed of themselves for standing on the 
floor of the House of Commons to request a public inquiry into 
something that has already been in the public domain for eight 
months and more.  Now they want to spend $20 million as we have 
spent on other inquiries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day the conclusion is fairly clear that no one 
has benefited from these programs except the people who need it 
the most, the disabled, young Canadians and people who are 
unemployed in different parts of the country.  The bottom line is 
that these guys do not want to see the government functioning. 
They do not want to see the government assisting people who are 
in need.

across the way has asked who is needy.  That is basically the 
nature of the question.  I would like to make a list of some of 
the people who have received HRDC funding.  I would like the 
taxpayers to determine whether or not this is list of needy 
individuals.  That is the question the Liberals have posed.  Are 
these people needy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is Wal-Mart needy of taxpayer subsidy?  Is Canada Safeway needy 
of taxpayer subsidy?  Is Shoppers Drug Mart needy of taxpayer 
subsidy?  How about private accounting firms?  Do they deserve 
hard earned tax dollars?  What about the 20 police investigations 
that have gone on?  Surely 20 police investigations with HRDC 
would indicate the police have questions about whether or not 
HRDC fund recipients were needy as the Liberal member likes to 
ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were fountains in Shawinigan needy?  Taxpayer funding of golf 
courses, is that what the Liberals call needy?  How about hotels 
in the Prime Minister's riding of Shawinigan, ones where the 
funds went to foreigners and lined the pockets of businessmen in 
Belgium, people who had track records and histories of doing 
improper things with funds?  Is that needy?  Is it needy when a 
businessman who has a bad track record with funds was getting 
taxpayer subsidy?  Is that the Liberal definition of needy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it needy to go ahead and set up a database that can raid the 
bank accounts of the elderly?  Is that what the government calls 
needy, taking somebody who is retired, going into the person's 
bank account and stripping it dry by taking out thousands of 
dollars?  Is that needy?  Does the government need the thousands 
of dollars in an elderly person's bank account?  Does it really 
need them?

for this opportunity to speak to the motion by the hon. member 
for Calgary—Nose Hill regarding the administration of grants and 
contributions programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member would like to see a commission of inquiry into 
the grants and contributions in Human Resources Development 
Canada.  I do not really understand her reasons, because we know 
today, after what we have heard, that she does not really have 
any.  This is just a political game which began in the House in 
October. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general is looking into the administration of grants 
and contributions programs. The Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities 
is also looking into the grants and contributions programs.  The 
department itself has called upon the best expertise available 
from outside, independent resources to look into these programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that this investigation is finding, and will find, is the 
truth—the truth that has already been laid out in detail by the 
department and by the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
i.e. the truth that was told by the minister when she first 
disclosed the results of the internal audit which was 
commissioned by her own department and which she herself chose to 
make public, as she has already stated in the House on more than 
one occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has appeared three times before the standing 
committee and, each time, she has answered all questions. During 
Oral Question Period in the House, she has answered the same 
questions.  This has been going on since October. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth that this motion chooses to ignore is that the 
file-by-file review of 17,000 grants and contributions projects 
across Canada and the review of all the audited files, having a 
total dollar value of $1,581,000, revealed an outstanding debt to 
the government of $6,500.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a point of repeating this, because I think it is 
important.  The opposition's criticism over HRDC's grants and 
contributions programs has an air of absurdity that is expressed 
by that figure—$6,500.  When all is said and done, once again, 
the amount outstanding is $6,500, and not $1 billion, as members 
of the Canadian Alliance have always maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the original audit found, and as the minister openly stated, 
documentation was clearly inadequate.  And this was pointed out 
by everyone in the House.  The department moved to devise and 
implement a corrective action plan.  The department is working 
with the auditor general on these corrective measures.  The 
department has consulted and continues to seek expert input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week, we received the committee's report and 
recommendations.  The minister has said that she will examine the 
recommendations and give her response to the committee's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill really believe she 
can justify to her constituents the burden of an independent 
inquiry in addition to the already considerable resources of the 
auditor general, the treasury board, independent expertise and 
the Department of Human Resources Development itself?  How much 
more expertise is required to shed light on truth that is already 
known to the House and to all members? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I want to talk about my riding because I think it is 
important.  Innuendos and all sorts of things have been said in 
the House about my riding and I would like to tell the Canadian 
public what my riding is all about and what a member of 
parliament does in his or her riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member of parliament visits non-governmental agencies, small 
and medium size businesses and speaks with the people who run 
those businesses.  The member looks at the needs of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who do not know, my riding of Ahuntsic has the largest 
textile manufacturing sector in Montreal.  That used to be where 
most of the textile and most of the clothing manufacturing 
businesses were situated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the free trade agreement a lot of these companies had 
to look for funding to do research and buy high tech equipment. 
These same businesses went out to financial institutions in the 
private sector and looked for funding so they could become 
competitive and able to participate in exports and in other 
developments within their sector.  These companies spoke to me 
about their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Canada jobs fund was created it responded to the needs 
of 15 manufacturers in my riding.  They received over $1 million 
under the jobs fund.  What did these companies do with that money 
which the opposition says has been lost because they did not 
create jobs?  In my riding of Ahuntsic 488 jobs were created 
through this fund, jobs that would not have existed if the fund 
did not exist.  The private sector was able to give those 
manufacturers and businesses part of their financing, but not all 
of it.  The rest came from government grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those companies created jobs, but they did more than that.  One 
company developed a fabric for bathing suits that is considered 
to be the best in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a small basement in one section of my riding, a 
manufacturer now distributes his product all over the world. With 
the money he received he bought high tech equipment worth 
$500,000 in order for him to be competitive and sell his Canadian 
products overseas.  This is what these business people did with 
the money that was given to them with the grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat for the Canadian public that 50% of the financing came 
from financial institutions in the private sector for each one of 
these files.  I am convinced that those 488 jobs which were 
created in Ahuntsic would not have existed if it were not for the 
fact that they received grants from HRD. 
Those people would have been unemployed at the present time, and 
those manufacturers would not have been able to compete or to 
export Canadian products overseas.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget something that the opposition members continue 
to neglect.  Whenever a member of parliament is elected, he or 
she is elected to represent the needs of constituents.  Those 
were some of the needs in my riding, but there were other needs 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under HRD there are non-governmental agencies in my riding that 
work with the handicapped.  Recently the minister and I had an 
opportunity to visit one of the projects that does recycling. 
That project, by the way, recycles all of the paper in all of the 
schools in Montreal.  What did this project accomplish?  Eight 
young people, many of whom were illiterate and had no skills, 
were trained in recycling paper so that later on they would be 
able to find jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of those young people, about 90% are now employed.  Because of 
contributions made through HRD young people find jobs, 
handicapped people manage to work, and during the summer students 
are able to work because of a job creation program for students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to be able to support those projects in my 
riding, to continue to work with the business community, to work 
with the non-governmental organizations and to be able to provide 
them with the assistance they need to help ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I want to put on the record is something that the 
member for Medicine Hat continues to say.  Of course, he is only 
one of a number of members on the Reform side who keep alluding 
to votes being bought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take great offence to that.  I do not think the Canadian 
public can be bought.  No one on this side of the House believes 
the Canadian public can be bought.  I believe the Canadian public 
is intelligent enough to make a decision and elect the best 
member to represent them in this House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to say that the constituents of Ahuntsic and the 
constituents of Saint-Denis elected me to represent their 
interests.  I take great objection to the fact that members on 
the other side seem to feel that when one is a good member of 
parliament, one is buying votes.  The fact is that those 
constituents and those businesses decide in the end who they will 
support as their member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to put on the record that I find it very abusive of 
the right of privilege that we enjoy in the House for members 
opposite to make innuendoes and accusations about members of 
parliament.  The member for Medicine Hat was asked outside the 
House about certain allegations and innuendoes he made about me 
inside the House.  I quote an article that appeared in the 
Montreal <I>Gazette</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But Solberg admitted his party had no evidence that Bakopanos or 
any of her supporters had demanded the donation in exchange for 
her support for the grant. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite use their cloak of immunity in the House all 
the time.  When they are put on record outside the House they 
withdraw those allegations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I thank the Canadian public for actually knowing 
that in this place there are members of parliament who work very, 
very hard to ensure that their constituents do get grants that 
lead to creating jobs in their ridings and lead to allowing the 
unemployed, the handicapped and other constituents to be 
productive members of Canadian society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the member for Ahuntsic.  I think that, had she 
had a few more minutes, she might have convinced me of what she 
was saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, she fools no one here.  Even the Liberals on the 
other side of the House do not agree on the figures.  Earlier, 
the member for Ottawa Centre said on this subject that there had 
been a minor fraud or that there was an imbalance of $2,500. The 
hon. member just said it was $6,500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member, who values the work of the member, 
and I am well aware of that, if she is comfortable with the 20 
criminal investigations currently being conducted by the RCMP. 
How is it that these investigations are not in the ridings of the 
members of the opposition, but are nearly all concentrated in the 
ridings of the members of the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that they must represent their electors and must 
give them satisfaction, but, when they do so out of the 
employment fund solely for the benefit of their constituents and 
to the detriment of the population as a whole, which has 
contributed to the fund and which never benefits from it because 
it did not vote for this gang, where do their morals lie in this 
case?  This is my question for the hon. member.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Just before the

impersonal in their nature. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are several 
subquestions to the hon. member's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to tell him that the role of a member of 
parliament is to represent everyone. We simply cannot represent 
only a specific group among our fellow citizens, as the member 
said at the end of his speech. I represent everyone in my riding, 
those who voted for me and those who did not. This is the first 
thing I wanted to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I believe that everyone on this side of the House thinks 
like me. What is happening now—and I think the minister already 
said it—is that the RCMP is conducting investigations. We 
welcomed these investigations. After all, we are the ones who 
asked for them. The minister asked for these investigations. We 
welcome them, precisely because we want to make sure that the 
truth will come out. Again, out of all the files reviewed, less 
than 1% are problematic. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we understand that the hon. member who just spoke 
got quite likely up to 10% of her war chest from a company 
centred in her riding.  What we are wondering is how that helps 
the hon. member's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is she so terribly necessary to the solution of problems in her 
riding that it is better to take money from the poor and give it 
to the wealthy to ensure that the wealthy have jobs in this 
country?  Or, is there some other motive that she can ascribe to 
it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely one would not believe that her motives were so pure that 
accepting money from a company that had received a big donation 
from the federal government by way of the fund, meant to shovel 
money into ridings for the purpose of buying votes, would benefit 
her riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe I have 
already answered that question, but I will repeat exactly what I 
said earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Medicine Hat, who first raised that question in 
the House, was asked outside the House about it.  I will read 
exactly what was written in the article: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But Solberg admitted his party had no evidence that Bakopanos or 
any of her supporters had demanded the donation in exchange for 
her support for the grant. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what a member of parliament does.  Members of 
parliament do their jobs and when election time comes, if any 
constituent or company, under Elections Canada, wants to give a 
donation, those donations are audited by Elections Canada, not by 
the member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elections Canada declared that I was duly elected as a member of 
parliament to represent Ahuntsic.  Again it was non-partisan. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the official opposition's motion calls for an 
independent commission of inquiry into grants and contributions 
in the Department of Human Resources Development Canada.  Even 
before a rebuttal opportunity had been given to the government 
side, the same official opposition amended its own motion to add 
“that the commission be required to lay before the House of 
Commons a final report no later than December 11, 2000”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the official opposition, the Canadian Alliance, amend 
its own main motion as though its own two members of parliament 
did not communicate with each other before the main motion was 
tabled?  Was there gimmickry behind it?  I leave the answer to 
Canadians listening to this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One other opposition member in the New Democratic Party claims 
that all opposition parties are united behind the amended motion 
on the basis that “outside authorities should investigate HRDC 
mismanagement”, as stated in a written dissenting opinion to the 
final report of the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, entitled 
“Seeking a Balance”, which was issued this past June 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The HRDC committee, over the last four months, did precisely 
that.  It investigated this issue in full. 
Is the opposition party trying to discount the months of hard 
work, time and money that was put into the committee? Are we now 
hearing that the committee's work, in which all opposition 
parties participated fully, was an exercise in futility simply 
because the allegations and assumptions were not for the most 
part substantiated by the witnesses who appeared before the 
committee? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT84"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT84"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1700

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the witnesses were recommended by the opposition 
parties. To my recollection not one witness, whether individually 
or as a group, called for an additional public inquiry.  Only the 
opposition did.  Witness after witness testified before the 
committee that we on that committee should ensure a balance when 
addressing the administrative and management problems identified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his caution against overreacting to the 1999 internal audit, 
the Auditor General of Canada told the committee, “It would not 
make sense for necessary changes to lead to excessive tightening 
of the system and unnecessary red tape. HRDC has a varied set of 
programs to deliver.  A balance will need to be established to 
meet the demands of recipients, ensure adequate controls, assess 
risk, and deliver results for taxpayers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the opposition seems bent not only on not heeding this 
advice from an independent officer of parliament, but also on 
detracting from or paralyzing the work of the department for 
purely partisan purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The diagnosis of mismanagement was arrived at by the internal 
audit, ordered and released on its own by the department itself. 
The department promptly acknowledged the audit's findings of 
fact.  These are serious administrative issues but not money 
lost.  Thereafter it issued the overall management response. The 
auditors themselves acknowledged that the management response 
“comprehensively addresses these issues”.  The opposition 
believed the report of the internal audit but would not believe 
it later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me add that the minister of HRDC, in her appearance just 
before the committee concluded its work, once again acknowledged 
the management problems that were identified in the audit and 
presented the up to date response of the department based on a 
six point action plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not recall any difficulty on the part of the opposition 
as to the adequacy of the department's response to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have seen today is a department which has admitted its 
mistakes of whatever size as compared to the total benefits of 
the grants and contributions and the total value of the program 
to Canadians.  It has taken the necessary steps to correct the 
mistakes and prevent their recurrence in the future. This is 
boldness.  This is humility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, members of the opposition have not acknowledged 
they have made a mistake in their grandiose assumption of the 
gravity of the problem.  Worse, they have offered no specific 
constructive approach.  If this is allowed to continue, it is a 
sad commentary on our parliamentary system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the opposition members would only imagine a seemingly 
grievous malady, they fail to consider the whole patient.  Have 
we heard them speak of the value and importance of the HRDC 
grants and contributions?  Have they said they are about 
supporting Canadians in their aspirations for economic prosperity 
and social equality?   Have they said that there is a definite 
role for the Government of Canada in the lives of the citizens of 
our nation by helping people train and retrain, giving equal 
opportunities to those with disabilities and those burdened with 
the absence of literary skills, and creating job experience for 
youth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the very purpose of HRDC.  The very essence of its being 
is to advance the dignity of every individual citizen so that 
collectively they can make our nation stronger an enduring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of any inquiry or investigation is to identify the 
problem and to suggest solutions.   The problems have already 
been identified.  The extent is 16,971 grants and contributions 
files with a total value of $1.581 billion examined and $6,500 in 
outstanding debt to be reclaimed by the department. 
That is less than a mini-fraction of the total and not $1 billion 
as alleged by the opposition.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The six point plan of action has been implemented and a progress 
report satisfactory to the committee has been presented by the 
minister.  I quote from the final report of the standing 
committee, “The committee commends HRDC for developing and 
commencing the implementation of its six point plan of action”. 
Time will not allow me to detail the six point plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are these six steps not good enough for members of the 
opposition?  From the lips of the Auditor General of Canada, the 
committee heard, “This action plan is a very thorough plan for 
corrective action to address the immediate control problems that 
were identified.  Some longer term actions are also included that 
further strengthen the approach”.  The auditor general 
continued, “As we conduct our own audit in HRDC, we intend to 
assess the department's progress in implementing the plan”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only will the auditor general audit the department's 
progress with respect to its action plan, but his audit will 
include a value for money component.  I remind the House, in 
particular the so-called united opposition, that the Auditor 
General of Canada is an independent officer of parliament who 
conducts an external, unbiased, non-partisan audit and reports 
directly to parliament.  May I remind all opposition parties, who 
may have already forgotten the testimony of the auditor general 
before the standing committee on March 23, barely 10 weeks ago, 
that his office intends to report on the results of his audit 
this coming October. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For faith in his work, the Government of Canada has annually 
budgeted for the auditor general's office as called for in our 
law. Are the opposition parties united as well in wanting to 
duplicate the work of the auditor general and thereby spend 
additional taxpayers' money?  Are they united as well in 
undermining his forthcoming report and in professing lack of 
faith in his office? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no need for the motion before us nor for the amendment 
to the motion.  What is needed is vision, not blindness on the 
part of the opposition, and we can anticipate a stronger and 
greater Canada.  What is needed is a dose of humility, not 
arrogance, and we can anticipate progress and greatness. There is 
strength in humility on the part of the government. There is only 
weakness in arrogance on the part of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge the House and appeal to the conscience of this 
institution for the sake of our citizens and country to defeat 
the amended motion before us.  Then we shall have done our duty 
to Canadians as their loyal servants. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I get really offended when people such as the hon. 
member who just spoke talk about people who are handicapped being 
the beneficiaries of this program or other things.  They use it 
like people in wars who use women and children as human shields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That program that is run by HRDC is rightly being criticized. It 
is right that we call for an independent investigation. For 
members opposite to say it benefits women, it benefits children, 
it benefits the poor, it benefits the handicapped, so we cannot 
possibly ask the government even a question about it is 
completely offensive.  I would like the hon. member, the 
minister, the parliamentary secretary, the chair of the committee 
and all Liberals to understand that when they run a program that 
spends billions of Canadian taxpayers' dollars it is subject to 
scrutiny.  If they deny it, the Canadian public will have the 
last word on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member was not 
listening at all to my debate.  The scrutiny had been done not 
once but more than once. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I heard the member speaking about handicapped Canadians, I 
was reminded of ignorance of knowledge.  We no longer in this 
century call people handicapped Canadians.  We call them 
Canadians with disabilities.  They are not handicapped.  This is 
the member's type of knowledge. When this happens I feel sad.  It 
is a sad commentary for our parliamentary system.

make sure I clearly understand the member for, I believe, 
Winnipeg North Centre. He says that through its grants, Human 
Resources Development Canada has helped the needy, people with 
disabilities and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were the people at Placeteco handicapped? Were those who 
received $720,000 to change the name of their sewing business 
people with disabilities? Will the fountain in Shawinigan benefit 
people with disabilities? Were those who moved their business 
from the riding of Rosemont to the riding of Shawinigan people 
with disabilities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that the member, who, I believe, is a doctor, may 
have his own definition of people with disabilities, but in this 
case, was not the biggest handicap of these people the fact that 
they were well-known Liberals? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member from the 
Canadian Alliance used terminology and I corrected him.  He 
indicated to me his apologies.  He has a member of his family 
with a disability.  I apologize for being very straightforward in 
wanting to correct the terminology.  I did it in the context of 
recent times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member of the Bloc addressed me as the member for Winnipeg 
North Centre.  Again, I will make a correction.  I am the member 
for Winnipeg North—St. Paul.  It is a minor correction but it 
has to be corrected.  If we are careless in what we say, we can 
be careless in many things.  The Latin saying is, falsus in unus, 
falsus in omnibus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now to the point of the question.  Have we always helped all 
Canadians with disabilities and all Canadians who need help?  I 
guarantee that we have tried at all times to help all Canadians 
with disabilities and those who need help.  Whether we have 
succeeded 100% of the time, humility dictates that we cannot 
claim that.  There is still a challenge for this government and 
that we shall continue to address.

dishonest for the members to come here and pretend that they are 
concerned about the paperwork administration.  They go on about 
boondoggles instead of specifically talking about what these 
programs do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, are they not a bit intellectually challenged themselves 
when they do things like deny students jobs in the riding of 
Calgary West and do not approve funds for student jobs?  They 
have internal fights among themselves.  The local Conservative

the member opposite in not allowing young people in our ridings 
to get the very jobs they need to get that start in the world.

<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased this evening to have the opportunity to call on the 
Minister for International Trade to take action on the market 
access to Canadian wines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been proactive on export issues.  We work one on one 
with Canadian businesses through team Canada trade missions.  We 
actively participate in world trade issues and we provide 
financial and other support for businesses.  The results have 
been positive with a record $410 billion trade surplus last year. 
Not only was that a record but it was an 11.3% increase over the 
year before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we have had overall success with exports we have not 
experienced the same success with wine exports.  We have serious 
market access problems with trade imbalances.  At a time when 
Canadian wines are winning international awards and being enjoyed 
by wine lovers the world over, we have some serious export 
shortfalls.  Let me be more specific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 Canada imported more than $565 million worth of wine 
from Europe.  At the same time Canada's exports to the European 
market were just over $400,000. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1955"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT106"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT106"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1955
<A HREF="#LINKT107"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are allowing a huge amount of EU wines into Canada.  In fact 
the LCBO in Ontario is the world's largest export market for 
French wines.  Unfortunately we are not getting equal access to 
their markets.  We have a huge trade imbalance of over one 
million to one.  That is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at another example.  In 1992 the GATT panel ruled 
against the United States on its anti-importation barriers for 
wine.  The panel said that the U.S. discriminated against imports 
at both the federal and state levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today most of these barriers still exist.  A recent report from 
foreign affairs and international trade says that there are new 
trade distorting measures affecting Canadian exports that have 
been added by American states since the GATT panel ruling of 
eight years ago, all of this while Canada remains the largest 
export market for American wine.  This is not a record we can 
take pride in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when exports are high, our trade surplus is larger 
than ever.  Canadian wineries are making excellent products.  We 
have been unable to break into two of the most important markets, 
the United States and the EU. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is about helping businesses to succeed.  It is about 
providing Canadian entrepreneurs, farmers and business people 
with the best possible chance for success, and that means access 
to markets, increased exports and jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's wine industry is a growing, thriving success.  Canadian 
wineries have outdone themselves in creating excellent products 
in a very short amount of time.  Our industry is new but it is 
excelling.  This growth has happened without the huge 
subsidization which occurs in Europe and even in the United 
States.  Now we need to give our wine industry the chance to grow 
and export around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year a vintner's enterprise study was completed on 
the wine industry in Niagara called “Jazzin' in the Vineyard”. 
I would like to summarize my remarks with a quote from that 
study.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the wine industry is to become internationally competitive, it 
needs a level playing field in which to participate. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that sums it up nicely.  I urge the Minister for 
International Trade to give this issue his full attention and 
make it a number one priority. 
<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of wine 
producers of Ontario I thank the member for his tough stands on 
the issue.  He always lets us know the views of his constituents, 
in particular wine producers in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian wine producers are making world class wines, as the 
member would know.  We are exporting many of these wines to the 
United States and Europe.  They are very important markets for 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to market access to the European Union, let me 
assure the hon. member that this is a priority of the Government 
of Canada.  We are making every effort to obtain improved access 
to European markets for Canadian wines, including ice wines from 
his region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am fully aware of the frustration which exists in the industry 
and at the provincial level about the significant imbalance of 
market access.  We are making every effort to address this 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade raised this issue directly 
with many ministers of trade in the European Union and will 
continue to do so.  At the departmental level over the past few 
months we have been discussing both wine and spirits issues with 
the European commission to determine the possibility of reaching 
a bilateral agreement that would be beneficial to these 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials addressed such subjects as how both sides make wine 
and improving the protection of geographical indications.  The 
latest meeting in March showed that there were significant 
differences between our two jurisdictions on the issue.  We 
remain optimistic that agreements can be reached if we focus our 
efforts on a limited, realistic agenda.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to consult with the industry and provinces in 
an effort to develop possible ways to bridge the existing 
differences between the two sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian wines, I might add, are doing well in the United 
States.  Exports have grown to $2.7 million in 1999, an increase 
of some 200% over the last two years.  The Americans are waking 
up to the great wines we have here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wine, beer and spirit sector tends to be more regulated than 
most others and is marked by a myriad of rules and regulations 
governing the trade, sale and distribution of these products. 
Some of these rules and regulations fall within the scope of 
Canada's trade agreements, others do not.  For example, some 
states have technical and labelling requirements.  These are 
often beyond the reach of trade agreements as they apply equally 
to in state and out of state as well as imported wines.  As well, 
it is normal for subnational jurisdictions, provinces or states, 
to create local regulations on access and handling, typically 
relenting to revenue protection and social responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the hon. member by recognizing the hard work of 
the hon. member on behalf of the wine industry.  I assure him, on 
behalf of the Government of Canada, that we take this issue very 
seriously and we will continue to fight on behalf of these 
producers.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CAPE BRETON DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION DIVESTITURE 
AUTHORIZATION AND DISSOLUTION ACT

<A NAME="LINK272">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK273"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-11, an act to authorize the divestiture of the assets 
of, and to dissolve, the Cape Breton Development Corporation, to 
amend the Cape Breton Development Corporation Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, be read the third time 
and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to have the opportunity to 
open the third reading debate on Bill C-11 pertaining to the Cape 
Breton Development Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this debate has proceeded over the last number of days and 
indeed over the last number of months, I have been monitoring it 
very carefully through all of its stages. Much has been said 
sometimes with a great deal of passion and no doubt that will 
continue tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I very much respect the deep convictions of all of those who 
have taken part in this discussion.  At the same time I hope that 
our final debate this evening can steer clear of personal attacks 
or unwarranted invectives.  While we may differ with each other 
honestly and sincerely on the most appropriate course for public 
policy to take, I hope we can all agree at least that each member 
in this House, in the government or in the opposition, is trying 
to do the very best possible job her or she can in dealing with 
what everybody agrees is a very difficult problem for the people 
of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I seek is not to criticize or vilify any other member 
because he or she happens to disagree with my approach.  Instead 
I am focused and the government is focused on meaningful 
solutions that are as good and as effective as they can be in the 
reality of the circumstances that we all have to face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said before the Standing Committee on Natural 
Resources and Government Operations and also in this House, the 
key elements of the government's approach to Devco and the 
circumstances in Cape Breton are really threefold. First is the 
successful sale of Devco's assets to be able to maintain a viable 
coal operation and the associated jobs on a sound footing in the 
private sector. 
Second is a fair and reasonable human resources adjustment 
package to assist those who cannot remain in the coal sector. 
Third is new economic development initiatives which are community 
based and contribute new dimensions to the Cape Breton economy 
and way of life.

<A HREF="#LINKT107"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that latter point, in January 1999 the government announced 
as part of its overall package of proposals with respect to Devco 
a $68 million fund to invest in long term sustainable growth in 
Cape Breton's future.  The province of Nova Scotia later added 
another $12 million to that amount to make a total of $80 million 
available for these future investments to build the Cape Breton 
economy.  Consultations on how to invest this funding were 
recently completed.  A strategy for the delivery of the 
appropriate funds is now under development and it should be in 
place very shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make reference to the report of the consultative 
panel who went to work on this issue to hear firsthand from the 
people of Cape Breton what their hopes and aspirations would be 
for the use of that funding for the future. The consultative 
panel was chaired by Mr. Michael Kelly and included six other 
very distinguished people who have very deep roots in Cape Breton 
and a keen understanding of the circumstances in that important 
part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report which they have produced and which was released a 
short time ago is a very interesting description of the 
circumstances on Cape Breton.  More than that, more than looking 
backward, the report offers a breath of fresh air, a new look 
toward the future at what could be if certain circumstances come 
about and if the $68 million from the Government of Canada and 
the $12 million from the Government of Nova Scotia are properly 
invested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report is a summary of discussion themes that were brought 
forward through presentations and written submissions during the 
consultation process on economic renewal.  Sessions were held 
throughout Cape Breton Island in November and December 1999.  In 
total, 214 presentations were made and 210 written submissions 
were received.  Hundreds of Cape Bretoners from all walks of life 
attended meetings from New Waterford, Glace Bay, Sydney, Sydney 
Mines, Baddeck, Port Hawkesbury, Petite-de-Grat, Chéticamp and 
Ingonish.  They contributed ideas and suggestions on how to grow 
a new economy for the island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report is a result of all of that consultation.  It 
emphasizes the importance of taking advantage of the growth 
potential of certain key sectors, facilitating the impact of 
established industries, enriching Cape Breton Island's investment 
climate, fostering trade to grow wealth and the opportunities 
associated with exciting decisions on new government services and 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For any members who are sincerely interested in this crucial 
issue of revitalizing and changing the direction of Cape Breton's 
economy, I would certainly recommend a very close reading of that 
report from the consultative panel.  The panel members did their 
job well. On behalf of the Government of Canada I want to thank 
them for the enormous effort they made to make sure that the 
voices of Cape Bretoners were heard in this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consistent with the work of the panel and the thrust of its 
report, we have already begun to invest.  Some $7 million has 
been allocated to a new EDS customer service centre in Sydney, 
Nova Scotia.  This undertaking has the potential to generate up 
to 900 new jobs on Cape Breton Island within a five year period. 
As the member for Sydney—Victoria and many others have noted 
publicly, this will be helpful in building a better future and 
there will be more to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the workforce adjustment package, the basic 
proposal worth $111 million was originally announced in January 
1999.  In full compliance with all existing collective 
agreements, that original package provided a combination of early 
retirement incentives and severance and training payments and was 
predicated on certain practical assumptions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2010"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT109"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT109"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2010
<A HREF="#LINKT110"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT108"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those assumptions was the continuation of coal mining 
operations in the Phalen mine on Cape Breton through all of 1999 
and most of 2000.  As we all know, that assumption did not come 
to fruition.  In fact for the most compelling of geological and 
safety reasons, Phalen had to close about a year sooner than had 
been expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year with the announcement that Phalen would have to close 
prematurely, we immediately indicated that parts of the original 
human resources package would need to be re-evaluated to take 
into account this unexpected change in circumstances.  That 
evaluation was under way when in January of this year the union 
leadership at Devco renewed its request for a formal joint 
planning committee process to resolve all outstanding human 
resources issues under the full terms and conditions of the 
Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process under the Canada Labour Code involved several 
defined steps which were meticulously followed as the unions had 
requested.  This included the selection of Mr. Bruce Outhouse, an 
eminent arbitrator who was well qualified and fully acceptable to 
all sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the House know, the joint planning committee 
process was taken through to its final stages with the binding 
arbitration decision published on June 2.  The decision has 
expanded the eligibility for the early retirement incentive 
program and has provided medical benefits for those who receive a 
severance and training package, as well as a number of other 
features. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devco indicates that in addition to the previous 340 miners, an 
additional 249 employees will now be eligible for an early 
retirement incentive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and Devco will address the financial implications 
of the decision of the arbitrator.  These are considerable, in 
the range of about $50 million, in addition to the $111 million 
that was announced in January 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now turn to the sales process.  As I have said in the 
House before, Bill C-11 relates to the sales process.  It is very 
straightforward and its purpose is simple.  It satisfies the 
necessary legal requirements to authorize the sale of Devco's 
assets including those requirements that are contained in the 
Financial Administration Act as passed by the Parliament of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1999 Devco hired BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. as its financial 
adviser to manage the sales process.  Last August the first task 
for Nesbitt Burns was to review the sales process at public 
meetings in Cape Breton with community and stakeholder groups and 
to obtain their input. Beginning in October 1999 Nesbitt Burns 
contacted 60 prospective purchasers. In December, Devco on the 
advice of Nesbitt Burns identified a short list of prospective 
purchasers who were invited then to submit definitive proposals. 
Such proposals were received by the Devco board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devco is now at the stage of evaluating and clarifying one of 
the proposals with a view to finalizing the broad terms and 
conditions of a potential sales agreement, perhaps as early as 
later this month.  Negotiations concerning a final detailed 
purchase and sale agreement would then follow.  A final deal is 
subject to both Devco board and Government of Canada approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prospects for transferring the assets of Devco to the 
private sector and for maintaining coal mining jobs in a viable 
private sector commercial operation for the future are very real. 
It is important that we move forward with this opportunity. That 
is what this legislation is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was first introduced in the House on October 27, 1999. 
Second reading debate took place last fall and this spring. 
Over 25 members have spoken to the bill during House and 
committee proceedings. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2015"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT110"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2015

<A HREF="#LINKT109"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our strong conviction that passage of the bill and the 
establishment of a commercial operation is the very best way to 
try to ensure that coal mining will continue to provide jobs and 
contribute in the long term to the economy of Cape Breton.  This 
is an important step in reshaping and revitalizing Cape Breton's 
future prospects and it needs to be kept in the context that I 
have described.  It is not a sale all on its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there is the $68 million economic development fund 
provided by the Government of Canada to which the province of 
Nova Scotia has added a further $12 million.  Through that 
funding and through the regular funding of the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation and 
Human Resources Development Canada, our government will continue 
to work with Cape Bretoners on a wide variety of fronts to 
diversify their economy beyond the coal sector, which we hope to 
preserve through the private sector transaction that this 
legislation is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, in addition to the sale, in addition to the economic 
development initiatives, in the short term a solution has also 
been found to the contentious and difficult human resources 
issues.  That was done through the independent work of a 
distinguished arbitrator who was approved in advance by the 
unions, and in fact put into place at the unions' request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite how difficult and contentious the issues surrounding 
Devco have been and continue to be, I hope that we can all now 
turn our attention to using all available resources, all 
available talent and brain power, all available commitment and 
dedication to maximize Cape Breton's future potential to turn the 
corner toward something that can be much better in the future, to 
do the very best we humanly can to ease the burden and to smooth 
the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank all members of the House, whether they agree 
with the government or not on this issue.  I believe very 
sincerely that they have approached this issue in a conscientious 
way, in a passionate way, and I thank them for their 
contributions to the debate as it has unfolded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would particularly like to acknowledge the very good work that 
the committee chair, the member for Eglinton—Lawrence, has done 
and all of the members of the committee.  I would also like to 
acknowledge the very good work of the member for 
Algoma—Manitoulin, who is my parliamentary secretary and who has 
assiduously worked every step of the way on this important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to acknowledge and thank members of the 
opposition, particularly the members of the New Democratic Party 
who represent the area most affected by this legislation.  Again, 
while we may be on opposite sides in some of the debates, I hope 
at the bottom line we share a common desire to try very hard to 
do the right thing to improve the quality of life of the people 
of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would like to ask for the unanimous consent of the 
House to have the opportunity to question the minister on such an 
important piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for Bras 
d'Or—Cape Breton has asked for unanimous consent to provide for 
a period of questions.  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>   No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK274"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise once again to speak to Bill C-11.  I listened 
with great interest to the minister's speech.  My mother used to 
coin a phrase that I thought was very applicable in this 
instance.  While the minister's speech was very conciliatory and 
praised everyone involved, my mother used to say that actions 
speak louder than words.  In this case I think that is most 
applicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue was brought before the House in October 1999.  I 
first spoke at second reading on the bill in early November 1999. 
The whole thing sat gathering dust until very recently.  Then it 
came forward again, we finished second reading and it went to 
committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a fairly substantial list of witnesses at committee 
who had interests in this bill and the issues around it.  Some of 
those witnesses were given less than 24 hours to appear before 
the committee.  They had to rearrange family affairs, job 
schedules and all of those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were brought in, four or five witnesses at a time who were 
not truly connected in their issues.  They sat down to 
participate in what was termed a round table discussion at 
committee, which did not give either the witnesses an adequate 
opportunity to present their case or opposition members an 
opportunity to question them at any length to get to the bottom 
of the issues they were bringing forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, my colleagues on the committee introduced two 
amendments to the legislation.  I believe the NDP introduced 
about five amendments.  None of the amendments introduced by 
either party would have substantively changed the bill.  I 
support the concept of privatization.  It is a good idea and it 
should have been done sooner.  However, there were ways to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the government really been looking for some co-operation on 
the bill, it could have accepted every one of the amendments 
introduced by my party and the NDP.  My amendments, hopefully, 
would have brought some clarity and accountability to this deal 
after it was done, respecting commercial confidentiality, but 
having the auditor general a year from the date of the sale 
examine the whole sale and its terms and conditions and report 
back to the House.  Certainly the NDP had some good amendments in 
the interests of the miners and the workers involved that would 
have protected their interests by guaranteeing certain membership 
on the Devco board and the pensioners' adjustment board and all 
of those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been a marvellous sign of good faith for the 
government to simply accept those amendments and it would have 
been a good strategy in my opinion.  If the government had 
accepted those NDP amendments, which were not substantive, then I 
do not see how either my party or the NDP could have continued to 
oppose the bill, but I may be being too optimistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that there is some kind of agenda going on here. 
In committee when I asked the minister if at some point Canadians 
could see the terms and conditions of the sale so as to 
understand the terms for whoever buys Devco, the minister himself 
said that he would have no problem with that.  Then one of his 
officials whispered in his ear.  I have no idea what he 
whispered, but certainly very quickly the minister said that 
perhaps the parties to the sale would not accept that clarity or 
accountability.  That is a real shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the conciliatory speech of the minister I do not want to 
be mean-spirited, but one has only to look at the history of the 
government and how it has operated in the time since I have been 
here.  I refer to some of the activities around grants and 
contributions in Human Resources Development Canada.  I simply do 
not trust the government to act in the best interests of Cape 
Bretoners or Canadians.  I demand accountability and clarity to 
assure that those things are met because I do not believe that 
they will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in Cape Breton I heard rumours from miners, the 
unions and prospective buyers. 
The story I heard was that the government intends to sell the 
assets of Devco to an American company which is already importing 
South American coal to Cape Breton.  That bothers me.

<A HREF="#LINKT111"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have coal miners in Cape Breton.  We have an industry that 
has been operating in Cape Breton for some 300 years.  We have 
some of the best mining expertise in the world in Cape Breton. 
We have a guaranteed market for the coal which is mined, and we 
have all kinds of coal to be mined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Canadian government to abandon those coal miners and 
that industry in Cape Breton in favour of giving it to an 
American company to bring American or South American coal to Cape 
Breton is wrong.  I cannot help but think it is very wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that it perhaps has something to do with a former 
environment minister who stood in the House and said that the 
coal industry was an environmentally dirty industry and that her 
government intended to phase out coal mining in Canada.  I cannot 
help but think that is part of the agenda.  I do not know how 
else one might explain the absolute refusal of Nesbitt Burns, in 
co-operation with the chairman of the board of Devco, who 
reviewed the bids which were coming in, to accept or consider 
Canadian bids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with two groups when I was in Cape Breton, both of whom 
submitted bids for Devco, both of whom told me that Nesbitt Burns 
had phoned them, had refused to give them anything in writing 
that they could pass on to myself, to members of the NDP or 
others, and told them that their bids would not be accepted for 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming into the committee process, I asked that one of those 
private sector Nova Scotia bidders be allowed to come to 
committee to tell the story.  The spokesman for that group was 
not even phoned and asked to come before the committee to present 
the story.  I think that is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the other group which also had a local bid in for the 
assets of Devco just happens to have a lawsuit against the 
Government of Canada for reneging on its commitment to the 
company in conjunction with Donkin Mine.  Again, I do not see how 
the government could possibly sell Donkin Mine, which is part of 
Devco's package of assets.  How could it sell when the whole 
thing is tied up in litigation before the courts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that could be done.  Certainly if I was part of 
that group I would very quickly get an injunction to stop the 
sale before it took place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all kinds of issues.  There are issues of 
mismanagement, on which the parliamentary secretary would not 
allow questions in committee.  I think there is a long history of 
mismanagement around the operation of Devco and there continues 
to be today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a miner or a mining engineer, but when I accessed the 
yearly financial statements of the corporation I could see for 
myself, and certainly others in Cape Breton pointed out to me, 
that for some time there has been a management regime in place 
that appears to be bent on putting Devco out of business and 
putting Devco's financial statements in the red.  There was a 
deliberate attempt to wind down Devco through mismanagement and 
lack of capital investment, lack of maintenance, and all of those 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were not allowed to discuss those issues by the government, 
through the parliamentary secretary.  The parliamentary secretary 
is a person I have come to have a lot of respect for over the 
years in which I have sat on the natural resources committee.  I 
think that he has bent over backward to be fair on many occasions 
when he was chairman of the committee and I have a lot of respect 
for him.  I can understand what was going on in committee and 
around this bill, but that does not make me any less disappointed 
about what took place. 
We were repeatedly told that the committee was a legislative 
committee dealing with a bill and that we were only allowed to 
deal with issues arising out of the bill, not the issues that are 
connected to the sale of Devco but are not actually part of the 
bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the witnesses appeared before the committee, after short 
notice, they were asked to sit down three, four and five at a 
time and told that they had 10 minutes between them to present 
their case.  In some instances we had a minute or less to ask 
them questions.  I do not think that we were able to adequately 
explore any of the issues around the sale of Devco and the 
implications for the people of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that there was a Canadian solution.  I know there 
was but the government for whatever reason did not seem prepared 
to look at that.  I think it would have been humane and the right 
thing to do if the government had done something to offset the 
impact to the miners.  That goes right back to 30 years ago when 
Devco was put in place.  It was partly an effort to offset the 
human resources liability of the Dominion Steel and Coal Company 
that went bankrupt and had left miners without pensions, 
severance pay and all those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the government's responsibility, rightly so then as it is 
now, to wind down Devco.  However, because of the commitment in 
the Devco bill that the government made to the people of Cape 
Breton, it would have been only right for the government to 
accept the human resource liability and offset it in whatever way 
it could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact section 17 of the old act says that the corporation 
shall adopt all reasonable measures to reduce to the fullest 
extent possible any economic hardship or unemployment that may 
result from the closing of any coal mine operated by the 
corporation. The government of the day committed to doing that 
and that obligation is certainly upon this government to fulfil 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of Bill C-11 is to eliminate that clause.  If some time in 
the next months ahead we discover that the government sold the 
assets of Devco to an American company that closed the coal mines 
in Cape Breton, the government would be in breach of its own 
commitment, in fact in breach of the legislation that is in place 
today until this bill comes into force and that particular clause 
is eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand why the government wants to remove that clause. 
It certainly would be liable if it did not.  However, there were 
ways.  The government has gone a long way through the injection 
of the money that the minister talked about for the economy of 
Cape Breton and the diversification of that economy. Those things 
could and should be done but that liability cannot be tied to the 
new owners of Devco.  The liability of the miners, the families 
and the environmental liability of the Dominion Steel and Coal 
Company was what for so many years made Devco unprofitable.  That 
was where Devco lost money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard members in the House, certainly the NDP members 
and others, say again and again that the coal mining operation of 
Devco was a profitable operation.  It was mining coal at a price, 
when sold to the market that they had, where it was making money. 
It was the liability that the government had saddled Devco with 
so many years ago that made it unprofitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government intends to saddle the new owners with that 
liability I do not visualize anyone buying Devco.  We will never 
know because it will be under the terms and conditions of sale. 
We cannot see the government insisting that the new owners of of 
Devco take on the responsibility for the human resources 
liability, such as the union contracts, the union liabilities and 
all the things that go with it, plus the huge environmental 
liability that exists there today.  The minister did not talk 
about who would be responsible for the environmental liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was down there. The liability cost of decommissioning the two 
mines, the coal wash plant and all the rest of it, not to mention 
the mess at the Sydney tar ponds and the slag pile from the 
Sydney Steel mills, is huge. 
There is no question in my mind that the people of Canada will be 
stuck with that cost.  No company, either local, American or 
foreign, will buy Devco if it has to accept that liability.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we will be stuck with that liability anyway, why would the 
government not accept both the human resource liability and the 
environmental liability?  It could then consider the local bids 
from the key people of Nova Scotia and Cape Breton who are 
willing to operate not only the Prince mine but the Donkin mine 
and perhaps even the Phalen mine.  They could operate them 
locally, employ local people, sell the coal to Nova Scotia Power 
and use the international pier to feed extra coal into the export 
market.  Cape Bretoners were willing to do that and this 
government would not even have a look at or accept their bids. 
That was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that basis, there is no way that I can recommend to my party 
that we support the bill.  It is not because we do not agree that 
coal mining in Cape Breton could not operate profitably under the 
private sector, and should operate under the private sector, but 
simply because of the way this deal is being handled, the secrecy 
surrounding it and the refusal of the government to tell the 
House and Canadians that it has at least made a commitment to the 
terms and conditions of sale and that whoever buys the assets of 
Devco has to operate the mine for a particular length of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply cannot support the bill and will recommend to my party 
that we vote against it, as I have at every other stage.  I 
believe there is a viable coal mining industry in Cape Breton. 
There is a Canadian solution available that will put Cape 
Bretoners to work.  The government has been negligent in not 
considering the Canadian solution, and that is a shame.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have just 
finished the report stage of Bill C-11. We have just voted on the 
various motions introduced by the New Democratic Party, and of 
course the people behind those motions were the hon. members for 
Sydney<B>—</B>Victoria and for Bras-d'Or<B>—</B>Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments were given overall support by the Bloc 
Quebecois because they addressed certain elements affecting 
employees and former employees and their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois agree with the principle of 
privatization even if, on occasion, the positions are not always 
readily obvious. On the one hand, we are told it is not 
profitable and that they want to sell it, and on the other that 
it could be privatized profitably, because the local people could 
operate it.  This is a pretty unclear situation, and a number of 
questions need to be asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, we know that the future of the coal industry is 
not clear.  From the strictly environmental point of view, we 
know what results it can have.  From the operational point of 
view, more and more people are trying to use alternative 
energies.  There are questions to be asked about the coal 
industry per se. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the minister tells us it is not cost-effective. Moreover the 
president of the Cape Breton Economic Development Corporation 
came before the committee to also tell us it was not 
cost-effective. So the question needs to be asked. If it is not 
cost-effective, if the government was not able to make it 
cost-effective when it was in charge, how can it manage to be so 
as a private enterprise?  What is hidden behind all this?  Is the 
government putting Devco up for sale merely to get rid of its 
responsibility?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing struck me in this matter.  Since the government got 
involved in the Cape Breton Development Corporation in 1967, some 
$2.5 billion has been spent, in money for the coal division or 
the industrial development division or for investments already 
made or about to be made in economic development.  This is a lot 
of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government got involved in 1967 and committed itself to 
spending this $2.5 billion, imagine the regional and economic 
development this sum could have provided had it not all been 
invested in coal alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general terms, the Bloc Quebecois supports privatization, but 
also supports employee protection.  We support almost all the 
amendments proposed, especially those of the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois opposes all positions taken by the federal 
government, which meddles in areas of provincial responsibility. 
Clause 5 of the bill provides that, even if the federal 
government disposes of Devco assets, it remains responsible for 
all work related matters, including the CSST, labour standards 
and labour relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for this reason primarily that we cannot support the bill. 
Another reason is the government's refusal to support the NDP 
amendments.  And we can see in this whole matter the government's 
inability to provide solid regional development for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will therefore vote against Bill C-11.

<P><A NAME="LINK276"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to speak to the bill at third reading, as I have risen to 
speak to it when it was introduced, as I have spoken to it in 
committee, as I have spoken to it at second reading and as I 
voted tonight on the amendments put forward by our party and by 
the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the minister's words this evening.  He approached 
the debate with a respectful tone.  I think I should tell him 
that I know this has been a difficult process for him.  It has 
not been an easy battle for any of us who have had to fight it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some things however that need to be said and some 
items that need to be clarified with respect to the minister's 
statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, he did come to Cape Breton in January 1999.  Prior to his 
arrival, I wrote to him, the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton 
wrote to him, and the provincial MLA for Cape Breton—The Lakes 
and the current MLA for Cape Breton Centre, Frank Corbett, wrote 
a joint letter on, I think, December 31 outlining that we 
understood that the government was moving in a direction.  There 
had been rumours of that and documents that subsequently 
indicated that this plan had been in place for some time.   We 
wrote indicating we understood the complexity of this.  I 
remember the letter because we said that the pension plans in 
particular had to be looked at carefully because the current 
formula would not be fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government announced a package in January.  I will not go 
through the history.  I have spoken to this bill many times.  I 
have spoken to it passionately, as the minister has acknowledged. 
However, the package that was announced in January was never 
changed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2045"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT116"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT116"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2045

<A HREF="#LINKT115"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister indicated that in January of this year the unions 
requested a joint planning committee.  Indeed there was an 
illegal strike.  The miners went into the mine and held up 
production.  There was a question as to whether or not Nova 
Scotia Power would be able to provide continued power to Nova 
Scotians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only then did the government agree to the process that resulted 
in binding arbitration.  That arbitrator's award subsequently 
said that the miners and the employees of the Cape Breton 
Development Corporation were shortchanged with the government's 
offer.  They were entitled to more money and a different package. 
I think it is important to clarify that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are unanswered questions.  This is unfinished business. 
The member from the Canadian Alliance referred to the question of 
the Donkin mine.  Whether or not that mine will be subject to a 
sale remains unclear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard today from people in my community and from miners who 
have lined up outside the general mining building requesting 
their severance package.  They were told that they would not be 
eligible for a severance package because they would be in the 
workforce when the new owner took possession of the assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton and I attended the meeting 
with Nesbitt Burns held in the community and said that the men 
had been told they would get either a pension or a severance 
package or employment.  We asked how they could guarantee 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still unfinished business.  These men do not know if 
they qualify for a severance package, simply by virtue of the 
fact that they work for the corporation, or whether they have to 
hope there will be a job with the new company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other issues need explanation.  In the middle of the provincial 
election campaign the Prime Minister of the country wrote to a 
woman in Glace Bay, Edna Budden, in a letter that she made 
public.  This was in July and he said that she should not worry, 
that the government would review the package.  He was confident 
that it would be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That letter needs to be explained.  It needs to be explained by 
the Prime Minister.  It needs to be explained as to why it was 
sent and why the government only improved the package when it was 
forced to by an arbitrator.  Those are unfinished pieces of 
business, which I suppose will be the job of historians to 
explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel tonight a bit the way I used to feel when I practised 
family law.  Spouses would come to see me after a long marriage 
and say that they did not know what happened but the other 
parties were not interested any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A covenant was made in the Chamber 33 years ago, almost to the 
day, in June 1967.  The then Liberal government made a covenant 
with the people of Nova Scotia and the people of Cape Breton, in 
particular through the Cape Breton Development Corporation, 
recognizing that the economy of Cape Breton had to be 
diversified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not just my words.  Let me read from an editorial in 
my community's newspaper this morning.  It is entitled “The 
covenant is nearly at an end”.  It talks about Bill C-11 and 
whether or not it will get through the Senate.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the Senate, that chamber of second sober thought, is perhaps 
the best place to debate the passing of the historic relationship 
between Ottawa and Cape Breton that has flowed in large part from 
the 1967 Devco act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arbitrator referred to the act and the historic covenant in 
his report.  He quoted Jean-Luc Pepin.  Ironically he quoted the 
New Democratic Party MP at that time for York South and a 
Conservative member.  It is surprising that the Conservative 
Party voted in favour of this bill.  Senator Bob Muir, who at 
that time was a member of parliament representing the mining 
community, and the New Democrats wanted the government to ensure 
employment for miners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of the day said that it did not have to ensure 
that because of section 17 of the Devco act, which has already 
been referred to.  I have referred to that section on numerous 
occasions and I do not want to use up my time saying what I have 
already said. 
It said that all reasonable measures to reduce as far as possible 
any unemployment or economic hardship that could be expected to 
result would be taken by the government.

<A HREF="#LINKT116"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 33 years one of the parties to the accord, as in a 
marriage, came in and said it is tired of the covenant.  They 
have been together through some tough times and some good times. 
Certainly the people of Cape Breton have supported the Liberals 
throughout those 33 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 or thereabouts the government began having second 
thoughts about the covenant.  In 1999 it served notice.  Like a 
divorce paper, the notice was delivered.  The parties went to 
court through the arbitrator and an award was made.  I have no 
question that the covenant will be broken tomorrow night when the 
House passes the bill and it goes to the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those kinds of breakups are always hard because both parties 
have invested.  The people of Cape Breton have invested heavily 
with faith in their government.  The government has invested 
heavily in Cape Breton.  I do not diminish that.  Like the spouse 
who is tired, the government has said it is time for them to go 
their separate ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the people of Cape Breton are like the spouses 
that end up impoverished.  They are the ones who end up without 
the house.  The kids are gone.  There is not money in the bank 
account.  They are told to get by the best way they can. There is 
a $68 million alimony payment over five years to replace the $300 
million in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used to advise those spouses that they did have to get on, 
that there was no point in bitterness or that at the end of the 
day they would waste more time than they had already wasted.  I 
refer to the same editorial where it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 17, which will be expunged from the amended act, sets out 
obligations to the workforce and the general economy in the event 
of coal industry downsizing or the closure— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those words sound almost anachronistic in today's more Darwinian 
economic and political climate.  Perhaps the words have become 
little more than empty marks on paper, but their official eraser 
from the law of the land should at least provide an occasion to 
pause and consider where Cape Breton goes from here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent many hours on the floor of the House condemning the 
government for what it has done, but the editorial is right.  We 
have to look at where we go.  We are a tough people.  We are 
proud people.  We are people who will rise from this.  We are a 
people who will move on.  We are a people who will accept the 
challenge.  I will offer to the government tonight some 
suggestions.  I hope it listens because it challenged us from 
time to time to say what it should do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister referred to the report tabled by the economic 
panel.  The one thing I was waiting to hear, which nearly every 
group that presented before the panel talked about, was 
decentralization.  We now accept that we are in a crisis. The 
government has walked away.  I suggest the first thing the 
government should do is look at decentralizing some of the very 
wealthy departments that exist in this very wealthy city and move 
them to areas of high unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a motion in the House to that effect.  The Standing 
Committee on Fisheries and Oceans has said that the department 
should be moved out of Ottawa to either coast.  In an area of 50% 
unemployment it is time for the government to act on that 
recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things the government could do.  The Department 
of Citizenship and Immigration is currently in Cape Breton.  It 
provides some spinoff economy.  As has been referred to earlier, 
there is also a need for remediation work.  The mines have to be 
remediated.  That is a legal obligation on the part of the Cape 
Breton Development Corporation.  The miners who are out of work 
or who will not qualify for pensions or benefits ought to be 
provided with an opportunity to remediate those mines. 
That will provide some lasting employment for those individuals 
and some training in that regard.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been mentioned that we have the Tar Ponds site.  There is 
no better place in the country for a centre of environmental 
excellence than the island of Cape Breton.  We are a beautiful 
island but we have environmental problems.  I would ask the 
government to invest, if it is serious about its commitment, in 
the island of Cape Breton to create a centre of environmental 
excellence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other companies are looking at investing and growing the 
technology.  Let us be clear that we have to clean up the 
environment or we simply will not have a world.  There are sites 
around the world that need remediation.  Cape Bretoners are hard 
workers.  With the right training we could develop a technology 
that we could export around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short term these would be most welcome announcements from 
the government:  that it plans to decentralize, that it plans to 
set up a centre of environmental excellence and that is plans to 
remediate the mining sites.  Indeed it has to remediate the 
Sydney Tar Ponds.  All of these create jobs.  All of these create 
knowledge.  All of these create some wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is in my riding the Canadian Coast Guard College.  It is a 
fact that there is currently in the law a requirement that 
everyone who ships oil on the ocean has to employ individuals who 
are trained in ocean cleanup.  There may be one centre in the 
country where we can train people in that regard.  The Canadian 
Coast Guard College on the ocean is a perfect place for the 
government to begin training individuals in ocean cleanup, in oil 
spills.  That too could become a centre of environmental 
remediation for teaching individuals in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cape Breton has a history of being an energy centre.  I note 
that the Minister of Finance provided money in the budget this 
year for clean coal research and clean coal development.  We have 
the miners.  We have the coal.  We have a history of providing 
energy.  The government should invest and ensure that clean coal 
technology is developed in Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cape Breton can also be a centre of sustainable energy 
development.  In Europe, Denmark and Alberta wind power is seen 
as the energy source of the future.  There are no greater winds 
than those that come off the north Atlantic.  We could provide 
sustainable energy, not just for Nova Scotia but for much of the 
eastern seaboard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clean coal technology, wind power and environmental excellence 
would all provide opportunities.  I have been asked to tour these 
plants.  I am told that wind powered generator plants are like 
airplane manufacturing companies.  There is all kinds of work for 
electricians, for the skills people in Cape Breton have developed 
working in the mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke to the Minister of Natural Resources personally the 
other day.  I commend him for finally appointing an arbitrator to 
help determine the dispute between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia 
in terms of who shares in the Laurentian offshore.  There is a 
real opportunity, if we seize it and if the government assists 
us, to make a petroleum industry in Cape Breton.  We should be 
the supply base for any kind of offshore development.  The skills 
of the workforce of the Cape Breton Development Corporation would 
be best suited to do that kind of work.  It is dangerous work we 
know, but we are up to the task.  It requires training but we are 
intelligent.  The sooner we can develop the Laurentian Basin, the 
sooner we can see some economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister mentioned high tech and the call centre.  With the 
greatest respect, I was happy to see the announcement and I 
welcomed it but those 900 jobs would be considered in any other 
part of the country secondary income jobs. 
In terms of high tech, if what we can expect are call centre 
jobs, it is simply not enough.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the opportunity to develop tourism.  This is my concern 
with section 17.  Tourism has been touted as the windfall for 
Cape Breton Island.  Yet it has been reported to me that ECBC, 
the economic development agency that the minister now says will 
take over what was once the role of Devco, has decided to go back 
to the basics of assisting manufacturing.  It has cut the budget 
which assists tourism in Cape Breton considerably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some concerns. Tourism is an area that we can develop 
but we cannot develop it without infrastructure money.  There is 
no point in inviting people to Cape Breton if the roads they 
drive on around the Cabot Trail are full of potholes.  There is 
no point in inviting people to come to Cape Breton if we do not 
have museums and cultural centres for them to visit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I presented the government with a wonderful proposal from the 
aboriginal community in Cape Breton to create a centre of Mi'kmaq 
studies and history and culture.  It would be built on the 
waterfront and would provide an opportunity to attract tourists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our cultural industry is second to none.  We could develop what 
Silver Donald Cameron, a well-known writer from Cape Breton, 
calls Banff east.  It would be my hope that some day that could 
grow to where we would refer to Banff as Cape Breton west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have produced some of the country's best writers in 
literature. Alister MacLeod has two books on the best seller 
list. He is considered a master craftsman.  Out of Cape Breton 
have come some wonderful writers.  Ann-Marie MacDonald's book has 
been quoted.  There are many.   Bryden MacDonald and Audrey 
Butler have been nominated for the Governor General's Award. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are opportunities for Cape Breton.  I will work very hard 
and I know the people of Cape Breton will work very hard to see 
an economic future for ourselves, for our children and for our 
grandchildren. We will do that with some mistrust of government. 
We will do that, although we are prepared to work with 
government, with some bruising.  We will do that with some 
mistrust because a covenant has been broken. When it was broken 
we were left, in the vernacular, with the short end of the stick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are tough enough to rise to the challenge. We will rise to 
it.  We will build an economic future, but the Government of 
Canada should be very reluctant the next time it reaches out to 
look for support from us, because we have given.  We have given 
in two world wars, we have given in depressions, we have given to 
charities, we have given every time the nation has asked.  We 
have given.  Today we find the nation through the Government of 
Canada telling us it is time to separate. It is a sad day but we 
will get on with it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to speak to Bill C-11, the Cape Breton Development Corporation 
divestiture authorization and dissolution act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government announced in January last year that it was going 
to sell the assets of Cape Breton Development Corporation which 
is more commonly referred to as Devco. The government stated that 
this decision was necessary for economic and financial reasons. 
Devco has not had a prosperous financial history having survived 
in some cases only due to subsidization provided by the federal 
government, subsidies that have culminated in more than $1.5 
billion being spent in Cape Breton Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sounds like a lot of money and I would certainly agree that 
it is.  What that figure does not tell us is the peripheral 
effect that this money provided to the people of Nova Scotia and 
in particular to the island of Cape Breton.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At committee we heard from the mayor of the Cape Breton Regional 
Municipality, David Muise, and he put some of the figures into 
perspective for us.  For instance, the federal government set 
aside $68 million for economic development when it announced the 
privatization of Devco.  However, according to Mr. Muise the 
region will be losing $65 million in purchasing power and a loss 
of $1.5 million paid in lieu of taxes by the corporation.  When 
we put that in perspective, the $68 million is not quite the 
figure it sounds like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other groups also told us about the hardship that the closure of 
the coal mines will have on the workers and their families.  The 
Phalen mine was closed earlier than anticipated and no 
information is being released about the potential buyer for the 
Prince mine, but the federal government has optimistically said 
that there will be employment for 500 people.  That leaves more 
than 1,100 people without jobs.  Many of the witnesses before the 
committee questioned whether even those 500 jobs would be 
available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go back to what the mayor had to say at committee.  He 
told us that his municipality is 2,600 square kilometres with a 
population of 117,000 at the last census, but it was losing young 
people at a rate of 1,000 per year.  One thousand young people 
are leaving the municipality of Cape Breton per year because they 
do not see a future for them on the island of Cape Breton. The 
official unemployment rate is 20%, but the reality of that number 
is really much higher, some say as high as 40% and the poverty 
rate is 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic reality facing the miners in Cape Breton is bleak. 
This was reinforced by presentations from groups such as United 
Families and Northside Future.  It was also the reason I put 
forward amendments at committee to try and secure better pension 
packages for the miners and improve medical benefits for miners 
and families.  Benefits are needed by miners who suffer from 
black lung disease, a condition that results from years spent 
underground breathing in coal dust.  Neither of these amendments 
were successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should make it clear that the Progressive Conservative Party 
supports the removal of the federal government from the coal 
mining industry in Cape Breton.  At the end of the day the 
federal government should not be operating the coal mines in Cape 
Breton.  The past history of the crown corporation clearly shows 
that the mines did not operate efficiently under government 
authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government must assume its share of the blame for 
the failure of the crown corporation to fulfil its objectives. 
With all of the money that has been provided by the federal 
government for diversification in the region, there has been 
little success and far too much political interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the crown corporation was established in 1967 it was 
clearly intended to help the region move away from its dependence 
on the coal industry.  From the presentations that we heard at 
committee, it is clear that there is still a strong reliance on 
the coal mining industry for employment.  It is also clear that 
the government has only paid lip service to helping coal miners 
without any real propulsion to effect change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The denial of all the amendments at committee and again at 
report stage, some of which would really have improved this 
legislation and demonstrated a commitment by the federal 
government to help the people of Cape Breton, clearly showed that 
this was a political process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time one needs to be an optimist and believe the 
federal government when it says it will try to secure the best 
deal possible in the sale of Devco's assets and in helping some 
miners retain employment. It is easy to see why there is 
skepticism on the part of the miners, but they also know that 
there is more coal producing potential in Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prince mine can produce one million tonnes of coal and there is 
a much greater potential in the Donkin mine if and when it is 
ever developed.  The contract to supply coal to Nova Scotia Power 
will be a major factor in enticing a buyer while the coal 
handling pier and other properties of the corporation will be 
strong selling points and valuable assets to potential buyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is opportunity for development of the Donkin mine and 
remedial work cleaning up some of the mine sites.  The work ethic 
of the miners shows that the possibility exists for coal mine 
development, but coal mine development will not be the sole 
economic driver of the future of Cape Breton or Cape Bretoners.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is very little information about potential buyers.  The 
only thing known is that local bidders have not been included in 
the final process.  Some of the best minds and entrepreneurs in 
the coal industry are not being included and given an opportunity 
to bid on the assets of Devco corporation. Instead it appears 
foregone that there will be a foreign owner operating the coal 
mines of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to discuss the amendments that were presented.  A number 
of positive amendments were put forward, ones that would have 
provided Cape Bretoners with a stronger voice and greater say in 
how the mining industry will operate in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put forward amendments to try to enhance the medical benefits 
for miners who have contracted black lung disease as a result of 
years spent mining coal underground.  I also tried to improve the 
pension package, to extend it to miners with 20 years of service 
rather than 25 years and a total of 75 points as the government 
has intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of the amendments put forward were accepted.  The 
government members of the committee voted against every amendment 
without regard for the improvements they could have provided to 
this legislation.  Amendments at report stage were also denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the federally appointed arbitrator made his ruling 
public.  Bruce Outhouse had been tasked with determining an 
equitable severance package and pension plan for the Devco 
miners. In his decision miners with 25 years of service 
regardless of age would receive early retirement packages.  While 
he refused to accommodate miners with 20 years of experience, his 
decision will provide packages to an additional 246 miners and 
will add another $40 million to the overall package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Outhouse declined to provide the same offer to miners with 
20 years of experience on the basis that it would be too costly, 
requiring an additional $79 million.  We continue to disagree 
with this aspect of his decision, but both parties went to 
binding arbitration in good faith and certainly we have to stick 
by the ruling that was brought down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His ruling regarding health benefits also added support to 
changes that the PC Party has been trying to advance.  Again the 
arbitrator ruled that medical benefits be paid to employees for 
the length of time they receive severance payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The medical problems confronting miners mainly result from years 
spent working underground and inhaling coal dust.  It is only 
appropriate that medical benefits continue to allow these miners 
some security; otherwise health plans would likely be unavailable 
to them since it is difficult for anyone suffering from such 
ailments to successfully qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A comment by Mr. Outhouse summarizes the difference between the 
way the government has handled this legislation and the sale of 
Devco's assets and the views of the PC Party. In defending his 
decision to provide early retirement benefits to all miners with 
25 years of experience, Mr. Outhouse stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a substantial sum by any standard.  However, I am 
convinced that anything less would fail to adequately reflect the 
long service of these employees and the difficult future which 
lies ahead of them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is exactly the point.  The federal government has 
introduced the legislation that we are discussing here today to 
provide for the dissolution and devolution of Devco's assets. It 
has failed to take into consideration the lives of the people who 
are directly impacted by this decision.  Rather than listen to 
the people of Cape Breton or to amendments put forward to improve 
the legislation, the government was signalling that it does not 
care how the people of Cape Breton cope with the loss of 1,100 
jobs and how this will impact on the miners, their families and 
their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party recognizes that the federal government's role in 
Devco has been extended beyond the point where it is financially 
feasible to subsidize the coal operations of Devco.  However, the 
government could have decided on its own that it would provide a 
retirement package equal to those offered to other crown 
corporations when they were privatized. By failing to do so the 
government has lost credibility and demonstrated once again that 
it does not understand ordinary working Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention the fact that committee and government 
parliamentarians were lobbied by many people from Cape Breton 
Island.  Members from Cape Breton worked tirelessly on behalf of 
their constituents, as well as most of the critics for the 
natural resources portfolio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to meet a number of people, all of whom 
were here for the right reasons.  They were all working for the 
betterment of Cape Bretoners.  There are two people I would like 
to point out and make note of tonight.  They are Edna Budden and 
Bev Brown of United Families.  Although we did not always agree 
on every issue, they spoke from their heart and they worked 
tirelessly on behalf of Devco miners and Cape Bretoners, with no 
gain for themselves. 
<P><A NAME="LINK278"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my hon. colleague from the 
Progressive Conservative Party for his wonderful remarks, but I 
have to ask him this question, with all due respect.  I listened 
to him talk tonight about how he and his party recognized the 
implications, both social and economic, that Bill C-11 would have 
for miners, their families and their communities, and how he 
rightly threw bouquets to those delegations from Cape Breton who 
came here and worked tirelessly on behalf of their families. 
Could the hon. member maybe explain to me, my colleagues and all 
those miners and their families who are watching tonight at home 
why he and his party tonight at report stage voted with the 
government on Bill C-11?  Could he explain that, please? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Quite easily, Mr. Speaker.  It is very 
simple. The days of Devco have gone by.  Cape Bretoners, Nova Scotians 
and Canadians cannot afford a crown corporation to mine coal at a 
loss any longer.  It has to stop somewhere.  It is stopping here. 
The government has made the right decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not agree with how it has implemented the decision.  I do 
not agree with a number of things about it.  We have tried to 
improve it and not just simply to provoke the government trying 
to get our name in the paper over it.  We have tried to make 
legitimate improvements to this legislation.  We have worked 
tirelessly to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, when the sun is going down, there will be 
miners at work mining coal in Cape Breton.  Prince Mine will 
continue to operate.  Phalen Mine, I suspect, will be reopened in 
the upper collieries.  There is still potential in Donkin, but 
there is no potential there if the federal government continues 
on that mine.  There is no support from Canadians and the federal 
government cannot do it.  It is time to move it on to private 
enterprise.  It is time to dissolve and divest ourselves of our 
interest in Devco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite simply, there other alternatives for Cape Breton Island. 
If we put the same money into Cape Breton Island that we put into 
the Devco mines, we would have a lot more than 500 or 600 people 
working there in the months to come. 
<P><A NAME="LINK279"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, may I first say that I stand tonight not only on behalf 
of Cape Bretoners, but as a Cape Bretoner and a member of the 
community with a very heavy heart with respect to Bill C-11 and 
the implications it will have for my community, my constituents 
and a lot of my friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were allowed, and I know I am not, I would say it is 
unfortunate there are no government members here tonight. 
However, I know I am not allowed to say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member, who 
is a very polished parliamentarian, knows full well that she 
cannot bring in the back door that which she cannot bring in the 
front door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  I apologize, Mr. Speaker.  As I 
said, I knew I could not say that and I apologize for that slip 
of the tongue and the fact that it did come out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a bit of time, because the situation 
warrants it, to give a little history lesson about what some 
people in Cape Breton Island and, quite frankly, I myself believe 
was the beginning of what got us to where we are at today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a phenomenal document called “Beyond 2000:  Whose Idea 
was it Anyway?”  It is amazing the information we can find when 
we sift through our files.  This morning I was reading this and 
it is important that we make note of it and make sure it is 
on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 15, 1994 a local newspaper, the <I>Mail-Star</I>, 
reported that Nova Scotia Power would pick up the tab for the 
Nova Scotia provincial government and Nova Scotia's corporate 
elite to attend a two day conference at the Digby Pines resort. 
The purpose was to allow the business community and political 
leaders to devise methods to kickstart Nova Scotia's economy. 
This was referred to as the Digby dialogue and was just weeks 
prior to Nova Scotia Power's attempt to break Devco's coal 
contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly enough, there are a few names of attendees at that 
meeting that I think some of us would recognize:  Joseph P. 
Shannon, president of Seaboard Transport, Paul Sobie, Gerry 
Godsoe, Stewart McKelvy of Stirling Scales, Irving Schwartz, Ken 
Rowe, Derek Oland, Ivan Duvar, John Bragg, Irene 
d'Entremont, Karen Cramm, Graham Dennis, Tom Hall, Dr. 
Elizabeth Parr-Johnston, Bernie Boudreau, John Savage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that my hon. colleague from the Canadian 
Alliance is shaking his head.  Obviously he recognizes some of 
those names.  The date is what is really important.  We should 
remember October 15, 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly enough, on December 19, 1994, George Cather, who 
at that time was the chairman of the board of directors of Devco, 
had a meeting with the president of the United Mine Workers to 
talk about a dinner meeting that he had had with a gentleman by 
the name of Louis Comeau, president of Nova Scotia Power.  Mr. 
Cather made reference to the fact that Nova Scotia Power was 
going to take the necessary steps to terminate Devco's contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time staff reporter Judy Maddren of the Halifax 
<I>Chronicle-Herald</I> reported on the shareholders list of Nova Scotia 
Power as prepared at that time by Montreal Trust.  She reported 
that everyone from New York bankers to pumpkin king Howard Dill 
was on the list, which she said read like a who's who of the 
corporate establishment:  prominent Nova Scotia families, the 
Sobies, Ivan Duvar, Graham Dennis, Louis Comeau, Judge David 
Chipman, Lloyd Crouse.  She remarked that there was an 
obvious similarity between the Nova Scotia Power shareholders 
list and the Digby Pines guest list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The significance of the similarity was enhanced by Roger Taylor, 
business editor of the <I>Chronicle-Herald</I>, in an article 
titled “Corporate Power Concentrated in Nova Scotia”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time Mr. Taylor suggested that if there was a chart 
showing the directors of major Nova Scotian companies, many at 
that time would have said it looked like a family tree.  I do not 
think they would have been wrong.  Mr. Taylor reported on the 
list of Maritime Tel & Tel directors revealed:  Joseph P. 
Shannon, Paul Sobie, Donald Sobie, Derek Oland, John Bragg, Dr. 
Elizabeth Parr-Johnston.  Mr. Taylor reported that a chart would 
show the directors and companies were interlinked.  In fact, as 
if it were a family tree, he said it would concern any genetics 
expert.  He posed the question “Does the concentration of 
corporate power in the hands of a few pay off for the rest of 
us?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I thought it was important to talk about how history 
has evolved with respect to the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation is because in the notice of the annual Nova Scotia 
Power general meeting released on February 12, 1993, the 
following people were among those proposed for nomination as 
directors: Louis R. Comeau, Sir Graham Day, Paul Sobie, Kenneth 
Rowe, Derek Oland and Rosemary Scanlan of New York.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This announcement came just five months after Nova Scotia Power 
excluded Devco from the Digby pines dialogue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, we are talking about a history lesson.  Remember the 
date I first began with with respect to the corporate elite in 
Nova Scotia and the famous Digby pines dialogue. In a letter to 
the Minister of Natural Resources dated April 4, 1995 the Prime 
Minister stated, “The goal of the government is to make Devco 
commercially viable with the view to privatize it in the longer 
term”. In a cabinet decision on December 19, 1995 the former 
Minister of Natural Resources, the current Minister of Justice, 
was asked to return to cabinet with a privatization plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the time frame' there was the Digby dialogue in 
October 1994.  A number of situations evolved from that time. 
There is a cabinet document commissioned by the government to 
privatize Devco. For me and my constituents, this is the issue. 
The issue has never been whether or not the government has or has 
not the right to get out of the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people in Cape Breton Island would say what happened to 
Cape Breton Development Corporation has been the fault of the 
chairman of the board.  I think the chairman of the board did a 
phenomenal job. I think the chairman of the board did exactly 
what the government wanted him to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also interesting that there were two individuals at Devco 
when Nova Scotia Power began the challenge to change its 
contract.  It was very interesting that following the 1993 
federal election an individual by the name of Dave Dingwall moved 
into cabinet.  Following that, the two individuals within Cape 
Breton Development Corporation who were ready, willing and able 
to challenge Nova Scotia Power on its coal contract left the 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Cape Breton <I>Post</I> on July 5, 1995 the 
former Minister of Natural Resources appointed Joseph P. Shannon 
as chairman and acting president.  Mr. Shannon replaced outgoing 
president Ernie Boutilier and Mr. George Cather.  Some would say 
they were the two main obstacles to the attempt by Nova Scotia 
Power to break the Devco contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It comes back to the original title of the document. Whose idea 
was this anyway?  The facts speak clearly for themselves. That 
has always been the issue.  It was not whether or not the 
government can get out of this industry.  We know it can if it 
wants to.  We have seen what it can do.  But the point of the 
matter is that this decision was made by the government in 
conjunction with the business elite at Nova Scotia Power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we were debating tonight, and when we finished the votes, I 
had a phone call from a miner's wife.  She was in tears.  She 
asked why did the government not just tell them the truth five 
years ago when it made this decision.  Why did the government not 
just come to Cape Breton and tell them, “We are getting out of 
the industry, but having said that, we want to work with the 
community.  We want to work with the union leadership to ensure 
the employees are treated fairly and to ensure that communities 
are treated fairly”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything we have seen in terms of research has shown that five 
years would have dealt with 90% of the workforce.  How could it 
have done that?  It could have done it by introducing bridging 
programs, by taking the younger miners and training them for new 
industries like the offshore off the coast of Cape Breton Island. 
Today we could be standing in the House dealing with Bill C-11 
and be concerned about only possibly 100 miners.  Nobody would 
have a problem in giving pensions to the employees who were left. 
Did the government do that?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw the minister throw out the olive branch to ask for 
assistance from this side of the House.  It begs the question 
what kind of assistance have Cape Bretoners had from that side of 
the House.  When the minister talks about joining together to 
allow Cape Breton to turn around, my response to the minister is 
that is why I am here.  My colleague from Sydney—Victoria and I 
were put here to turn Cape Breton around.  I have no doubt that 
Cape Bretoners will do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cape Bretoners have always been able to pick themselves up when 
they have fallen.  We have seen it time and time again.  What we 
see is an island that has been cut off at its knees by its own 
government or its so-called government.  People in Cape Breton 
would clearly say that it is not their government because their 
government would not do things like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I honestly have to say that I get sick to my stomach when I hear 
about the human resource development package of $111 million and 
the new additional money.  When I questioned the minister at 
committee, I specifically asked how much of that $111 million was 
new money?  After a few minutes and his having to talk to one of 
the seven aides with him, the minister said 25% was new money. We 
are not talking about the government giving $111 million because 
it is getting out of the industry and it is a good deal. A large 
portion of that money was because of the collective agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the government given?  In its own document it is clear 
that it cost Canadians a large amount of money.  It clearly shows 
the cost of its decision not only to the federal government but 
to the provincial government.  It even breaks it down to the tune 
of $171 million.  That was in 1995 dollars.  We are to assume 
that is a much larger figure now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to my original comment.  The Liberal government had 
five years to sit down, consult, negotiate and talk with the 
communities.  Did it do that?  No.  It continued incrementally 
ensuring that the corporation would not be viable.  That was one 
of the key things it legally had to do in order to abdicate from 
the industry.  The only way it could abdicate from the industry, 
as the legislation clearly says, was if the corporation was not 
viable. 
There are some people in Cape Breton who would say the government 
knew that so it had to set out a plan.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have stated a number of times in the House, as has the 
member for Sydney—Victoria, I have lived on Cape Breton Island 
all my life.  My father worked for 38 years with the Cape Breton 
Development Corporation.  I could tell stories about the misuse 
of money and the buying of equipment to lay in coal yards in 
Phalen and Lingan.  I could talk about selling off locomotives 
without tender and buying equipment from a company called Wayjax. 
The speculation is that it was only second rate equipment from 
broken down mines in the U.K.  That is what happened to this 
corporation because the government had to make sure it did not 
work.  Unfortunately it was successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stood in the House in 1998 and I asked the Prime Minister 
whether or not a document existed.  Quite frankly we would 
probably still hear the minister say that it is not a real 
document, that it is not a cabinet document.  It is scary and 
should be scary to any Canadian citizen that the government has 
not deterred from one section of this document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not frightful that the government can set a plan, 
knowingly and willingly recognize the serious socioeconomic 
implications, and sit back and say, when that is what it is 
doing, that the member is paranoid and there she goes again with 
that document.  I challenge any member of the government, 
including the Prime Minister, to take the chain of events we have 
reached now with Devco and show me where there is a difference. 
There is no difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I carry a heavy heart.  The government has been part 
and parcel of what we will see happen to Cape Breton for a little 
while until people regroup.  We will regroup.  We always have and 
we always will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Sydney—Victoria said, we will do it but 
not with a trusting relationship with the government.  I say 
“the government” because it is not our government.  We will 
survive.  This will go down in the history books.  Some day I 
will sit down with my son who is now 20 month old and have to 
explain to him why governments do that to their own.  Perhaps by 
that time some of these government members will have an answer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK280"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I know it is late but I just have one question to ask.  The 
member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton and I have discussed this 
document in the past.  I remember the document she is referring 
to.  I remember the first time I saw it in her office when she 
showed it to me.  I was incredulous.  As the member said, I 
thought it could not really be a document from 1995.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as she has said, when we measure the way in which the 
government has put forward the plan from its announcement a year 
ago, in 1999, it has followed almost in parallel lines.  As 
incredulous as I was, as the time goes by the concerns expressed 
by the member gain more and more credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one point that she did not mention, and I just ask her 
to clarify for us here tonight.  It seems to me that in 1995 
surely the members of parliament who represented Cape Breton, 
because it not myself nor the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, 
would have been aware of this and would have made it known to the 
people they represent.  I wonder if she could very simply and 
very quickly indicate for us what party represented the entire 
island of Cape Breton in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as my hon. colleague 
said, no, he and I unfortunately were not representing Cape 
Breton Island at the time.  If I remember correctly, Cape Breton 
had three members of parliament.  I have mentioned one of them in 
the House and I have heard government members refer to this 
individual.  He was probably one of the most powerful individuals 
in the Liberal cabinet at that time.  His name was David 
Dingwall. Another member of parliament for our region was a man 
by the name of Russell MacLellan who then went on to be premier. 
We also had a Liberal member by the name of Francis LeBlanc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer my hon. colleague's questions as to whether those 
members told their constituents or talked to their constituents, 
frankly, after at a meeting at UCCB between the unions and Mr. 
Dave Dingwall, I do not think it would be safe to say that they 
talked.  There was clearly a dialogue because it went down as a 
quote in history where Mr. Dingwall made the statement “There is 
no bag of money”.  When we look back in history, the reason that 
statement was made was because he was aware of the plan.  He knew 
what was coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that we had three members of the Liberal Party, the 
governing party at the time, representing the island and it was 
not until Cape Bretoners voted for New Democrats and we came to 
Ottawa that we finally got to the bottom of what the government's 
intentions were for Cape Breton.
