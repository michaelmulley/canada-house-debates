<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YOUNGOFFENDERSACT">YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston)</B> moved that Bill 
C-217, an act to amend the Young Offenders Act, the 
Contraventions Act and the Criminal Code in consequence 
thereof, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is with profound regret that I lead off 
the debate on changes to the Young Offenders Act today. Press 
reports indicate that a 16-year old man, Marwan Harb, was 
murdered yesterday in Hull, just blocks away from the 
Parliament Buildings.
<P>
	The person allegedly responsible for that death apparently is a 
young offender and according to press reports the victim, 
Marwan Harb, is the second cousin of one of our colleagues, the 
member for Ottawa Centre.
<P>
	We do not need this latest incident to remind us of the 
necessity for changes to the Young Offenders Act, which is in 
desperate need for reform. Just a few weeks ago there was 
another senseless killing, again committed by a young offender. 
Nicholas Battersby met his death as a result of a drive-by 
shooting in Ottawa. These murders, these incidents, are 
happening right across the country.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	My colleague from Kent who has been instrumental in calling 
for changes to the Young Offenders Act will be speaking about a 
particularly vicious murder in his community.
<P>
	In the province of Alberta a woman trying to protect her 
children was stabbed to death, again by a young offender.
<P>
	A six-year-old in British Columbia was raped and murdered 
by a young offender who had a number of convictions for 
molesting young children. The public did not know because the 
Young Offenders Act has a total ban on the publication of 
details.
<P>
	The beat goes on and on. While these incidents are taking 
place, while these murders, rapes, robberies and assaults are 
taking place, we in Parliament are sitting on our hands. We did 
not need these incidents to tell us that the Young Offenders Act 
is in desperate need of reform.
<P>
	We have been back for six months and there still is not any 
concrete action. This is the first bill before Parliament to 
address the Young Offenders Act, which is just one small 
component of the criminal justice system, one small component 
of a system that simply does not work, a system that is 
unbalanced, a system that cares more about suspects and 
criminals, a system that is more concerned about those who 
perpetrate crimes than those who are victims of crime in the 
country.
<P>
	One thing was made perfectly clear by my constituents in the 
riding of York South-Weston, and I am sure by all Canadians, 
and that is that the criminal justice system is in desperate need of 
reform.
<P>
	Canadians want leadership. They want changes not only to the 
Young Offenders Act but to other pieces of federal legislation, 
including the Criminal Code, the parole laws, the bail laws, the 
prostitution laws. We cannot simply sit back and say what a 
wonderful country we live in, look at how safe our country is. 
Let us look to the United States as an example of what it is really 
like to be bad as far as criminal activity is concerned.
<P>
	This debate is timely. At the conclusion of the debate this 
morning I will be seeking the unanimous consent of the House to 
have this matter referred to the justice committee so that the 
justice committee can begin work. I will be listening very 
carefully to the person or persons in the House who will deny 
unanimous consent to send this matter to committee, and that 
person or those MPs who deny unanimous consent will have to 
explain their reasons why they want to continue to sit on their 
hands.
<P>
	I have to say as well that I am not at all happy with the 
government's agenda with regard to changes to the Young 
Offenders Act. The government's agenda is on a slow boat to 
China when we ought to have changes here in the House 
immediately.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have great respect and 
confidence in the Minister of Justice with regard to his genuine 
commitment to changes to the criminal justice system in 
Canada, but unfortunately his agenda calls for simply the 
introduction of a bill in June and he is not expecting passage of 
the bill 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3734"> 3734 </A></B>
<P>
until later this year or sometime next year. That is just not good 
enough.
<P>
	I would submit that it would be totally and completely and 
absolutely irresponsible for members of all sides of this House 
to rise for the summer holidays, to go back to our homes, 
families and cottages without passing changes to the Young 
Offenders Act. That would be an abdication of our responsibility 
as legislators. It would be an abdication of the mandate and the 
trust given to us by the people of Canada six short months ago.
<P>
	I would urge the minister, I would urge the government, I 
would urge all members in the House to expedite changes. We do 
not need another year or two of study. I was a member of the 
justice committee for eight years. When I was first elected to the 
House in September 1984 the Young Offenders Act was only a 
few months old and it was clear then that the Young Offenders 
Act would not work. I have been calling for changes for the last 
10 years.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	Here we are 10 years later and just a few weeks ago the 10th 
anniversary of the Young Offenders Act was celebrated. The 
Young Offenders Act replaced the old juvenile delinquents act. 
Back then the bleeding hearts claimed that the juvenile 
delinquents act was not working and they needed a more 
balanced system.
<P>
	We have now a piece of federal legislation that is totally 
unbalanced. It is a piece of legislation that shoves aside the 
public interest and shoves aside security for the public. Instead 
it protects and invites young people to break the law, to embark 
upon a lifetime of criminality.
<P>
	The bill which I have before Parliament today addresses three 
of the fundamental changes necessary to the Young Offenders 
Act. I will speak about those changes in a few moments.
<P>
	First, I want to talk about the existing law, the Young 
Offenders Act, section 3, which contains eight statements of 
policy indicating the philosophy behind the Young Offenders 
Act. I want to summarize the philosophy and explain why in my 
view that while the intention was there, the 10 years of practice 
that we have had have clearly established that the principles 
have gone haywire.
<P>
	The first principle is that young persons are said not to be as 
accountable for their acts as are adults but even so they must 
bear responsibility for their contraventions-motherhood and 
apple pie.
<P>
	Second, society must be afforded protection from illegal 
behaviour although it does have a responsibility to take 
measures to prevent criminal conduct by youth. That was the 
second principle, but experience has shown that the protection 
of society does not even appear to register in the consideration 
of those involved in the system, particularly judges who have to 
bear some of the responsibility for some of the outrageous 
sentences that are handed down today.
<P>
	The third statement recognizes the need for supervision, 
discipline and control of young offenders, but also that they 
have special needs and require guidance and assistance. We will 
not find any dispute about the need for special guidance and 
assistance for young people. We all recognize that there is a need 
for a system that will deal with young offenders. We do not want 
to treat 12 and 13 year olds, genuine children, like adults. We do 
not want to throw them in the slammer, send them down to 
Kingston to serve a life sentence or to serve lengthy prison 
terms. There has to be a balanced system. We all recognize that.
<P>
	However, when we look at the experience today we recognize 
that the system is doing a disservice to the public and to young 
people because it is telling young people today that they have to 
carry knives. One cannot help but wonder that if there were a 
different psychology out there with our young people today the 
young person who was murdered in Hull yesterday would be 
alive today. Why was it necessary for the person who committed 
the murder to be carrying a knife? It is not uncommon for young 
people today to carry knives and loaded guns to school every 
morning. That is the atmosphere that our young people are faced 
with today. They carry guns and knives and other deadly 
weapons not simply to do harm to other people but for 
protection.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, when you and I were in high school, public 
school and university if there was a score to settle you used your 
fists. You would go out back and have a fist fight, a little wrestle 
and you would settle your scores. Today scores are settled with 
deadly force. Scores are settled with knives and bullets and 
guns. People are killed and maimed right across the country as a 
result of this unfortunate and tragic situation that our young 
people are faced with today.
<P>
	The philosophy also says, the fourth consideration, that the 
taking of measures other than judicial proceedings should be 
considered where not inconsistent with the protection of society.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	The fifth statement recognizes the legal and constitutional 
rights of youth. Therein lies one of the major problems with the 
Young Offenders Act. On the one hand it says we should treat 
young offenders as children. On the other hand it says we should 
afford them all the rights and privileges afforded other criminals 
under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	That is fine and dandy, but then young people recognize that 
they have the right to a lawyer; let's go get legal aid. They have 
the right to all the protection that adults have, such as the right to 
remain silent and all the other rights. Young people recognize 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3735"> 3735 </A></B>
<P>
that those rights exist and they are using them as protection from 
criminal responsibility.
<P>
	The sixth principle is that a young person has the right-and 
this is a real kicker-to the least possible interference with 
freedom as is consistent with public safety. It is built right into 
the Young Offenders Act. It says we cannot interfere with their 
freedom.
<P>
	Seventh, young offenders have the right to be informed of 
their rights and freedoms in any situation where those rights and 
freedoms may be infringed.
<P>
	Finally, parents are said to have a responsibility for the care 
and supervision of their children, and children are to be removed 
from parents only in compelling circumstances.
<P>
	That is the philosophy behind the Young Offenders Act. Some 
of it is apple pie and motherhood, but the rest of it unfortunately 
has led to a system that is a contributing factor to the decay of 
the moral fibre and the integrity of our youth.
<P>
	I want to make one thing perfectly clear. I am not calling for 
sending young children to jail and throwing away the keys, or 
whipping them and hanging them. What I am calling for is a 
more balanced approach. The significant majority of young 
people are law-abiding citizens. They do not need a law to tell 
them the difference between right and wrong. We are dealing 
with the exceptions, the small percentage of young hoods, young 
incorrigibles in our society, who are using the law in order to 
further their criminality.
<P>
	We need a balanced system. Somehow the principles outlined 
in the Young Offenders Act have not been translated into action 
and the pendulum has swung in favour of the rights and 
protection of the youth. Public security has become a secondary 
consideration at best and all too often has been neglected 
entirely.
<P>
	My bill addresses three specific areas. First, I would change 
the age limits provided in the Young Offenders Act. Today a 
young offender, a child, these people who are in need of 
protection and caring guidance, is defined as a young person 
between the ages of 12 and 17. We have the situation of a 
17-year-old, one day shy of his or her 18th birthday, old enough 
to drive, old enough to enter into contracts in some jurisdictions, 
yet treated as a child and defined as a child.
<P>
	Statistics show that half of the youth court case load involves 
16 and 17 year olds. My bill would treat 16 and 17 year olds as 
adults. They would be charged and prosecuted in adult court, 
and in my submission that would act as a very serious deterrent 
to other 16 and 17 year olds from breaking the law.
<P>
	As well my bill would lower the age limit to the age of 10. 
Some people are suggesting that there should not be any lower 
end to the definition of a young offender. We all know of the case 
in Great Britain, for example, where two 10-year-olds were 
convicted of murder. In Canada children under the age of 12 are 
used by adults to commit criminal offences. Second, some of 
them are committing in their own right serious offences. By 
lowering the age limit it allows the police to bring these  
children into the system so they can be dealt with and treated 
properly.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	My bill would define children as those young people between 
the ages of 12 and 15. Sixteen and seventeen year olds know the 
difference between right and wrong, understand the nature and 
consequences of their acts and therefore, in my view, ought to be 
prosecuted in adult court. As members know, age is always a 
mitigating circumstance at sentencing in adult court.
<P>
	The second aspect of my bill-it is something that the 
minister has already indicated he supports-is the increase in 
the maximum penalty for first degree murder from five to ten 
years. I applaud the minister for confirming his position in that 
regard not too long ago. Just a few years ago the maximum 
penalty was three years for first degree murder.
<P>
	We had the situation in Scarborough, for example, where a 
young offender committed a triple murder, first degree murder, 
and served three years. He then was released. Now the sentence 
has been bumped up to five years but in my respectful 
submission it ought to be ten years for first degree murder.
<P>
	The third aspect of my bill would allow for the publication of 
the details and the identity of a young offender after the second 
serious conviction. Right now there is a blanket prohibition on 
the publication of details.
<P>
	The case in British Columbia-there are dozens of other 
similar cases-underlined the need for the public, the 
neighbours, the school system to know of some of the serious 
offences. The young person had been convicted of molesting 
young children. If the public knew, if the police knew, if 
neighbours knew, they could have taken the necessary 
precautions. He murdered and raped a six-year old child.
<P>
	My bill would allow the young offender two chances. Once 
they have committed two serious offences, then the public 
would be entitled to know the details and the identity of the 
young offender. I submit that would serve as a deterrent for 
young offenders.
<P>
	Let me end where I began. The system is in desperate need of 
repair. We have to move with dispatch. For those people who 
suggest this concern is a knee-jerk reaction to the murder in 
Hull or the murder here in Ottawa or the dozens of other murders 
and rapes and violent assaults, let me tell members that they are 
sadly mistaken. Their heads are in the sand and it is time that 
they woke up and smelled the coffee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3736"> 3736 </A></B>
<P>
	This is not something that happened overnight. It is a concern. 
The problem has been here for the last 10 years. I would urge my 
colleagues to expedite changing passages in the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	I would ask that at the conclusion of this debate at 12 noon 
today we have the unanimous consent of the House to refer the 
bill and its subject matter to the justice committee so that we can 
begin immediate deliberations with regard to this component of 
the criminal justice system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B>Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to speak to the bill 
introduced by the hon. member for York South-Weston, a trial 
balloon being launched by the Liberal government on the issue 
of young offenders.
<P>
	Since the opening of the 35th Parliament, the Department of 
Justice has been discussing amendments to the Young Offenders 
Act. For reasons known to the department, it seems this was one 
of its priorities.
<P>
	Furthermore, in the famous red book people have been talking 
about since October 25, the Liberal party proposed to reform the 
Young Offenders Act, to offer real rehabilitation while cracking 
down on young criminals.
<P>
	Since I assume no one is against real rehabilitation, today the 
Liberal government is testing the temper and sensibilities of 
voters on the issue of cracking down on young criminals. 
Considering the bill the hon. member has introduced, I 
understand why he sits on the extreme right of the Prime 
Minister.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, this shift to the right on the young offenders 
issue is based on a skewed equation of violence and young 
people. To the average citizen, youth is equated with violence 
and adolescence is synonymous with delinquency. However, 
nothing could be further from the truth.
<P>
	In Quebec, since 1979, all crimes committed by young people 
have decreased substantially, by nearly 8 per cent across Quebec 
and by 34 per cent in the Montreal area. Was the government, or 
should I say, was the hon. member aware of these figures before 
he introduced the kind of bill we have before us today?
<P>
	We cannot go on being alarmist to this degree, because it 
gives a false picture of reality and we end up with bills like this 
one which I consider to be very alarming indeed.
<P>
	It is all well and good to ask for zero tolerance, but should this 
necessarily mean lowering the age limit of offenders covered by 
the youth courts, should this mean more severe sentencing and 
releasing the names of repeat young offenders? This 
interpretation of zero tolerance is tantamount to telling all 
young offenders: get in there and stay there. That is the easy way 
out.
<P>
	That is a fifties petit bourgeois attitude. The emphasis should 
not be on the sentencing aspect as much as on assistance, 
guidance and reintegration of the young offender.
<P>
	Obviously, I am against the simplistic bill before the House 
today. If this proposal would help the government save money, a 
government that is flat broke, perhaps we could discuss it and 
consider the benefits from that angle. However, by increasing 
sentences and lowering the age at which one is considered to be 
young offender, we are merely filling up our prisons faster and 
adding to the number of unproductive young people who will be 
a burden on society for the rest of their lives.
<P>
	Current public pressure for a stricter Young Offenders Act is 
understandable, especially in western Canada. Sensational cases 
reported in the media add to the skewed perception of the 
problem. However, reaching directly with amendments like 
these reflects some confusion about, and represents a major 
departure from, the objectives pursued by the Young Offenders 
Act passed in 1984, in other words, deterrence, rehabilitation 
and the protection of society.
<P>
	In Quebec, we understand the main principles behind the 
protection of youth and society. When dealing with young 
offenders, we rely on rehabilitation and reintegration. As much 
as possible, we avoid criminalizing cases involving young 
offenders.
<P>
	The Quebec Department of Health and Social Services and the 
Youth Protection Branch take care of young offenders and assist 
them. The results have been astonishing. In Quebec, we invest in 
rehabilitation because we believe in it. Statistics are extremely 
revealing in that respect. According to a very sound study 
conducted in Quebec between 1968 and 1983, it takes society 
less than five years to recoup the money it invests to rehabilitate 
young murderers and turn them into productive young adults 
who work, pay taxes and spend money, all of which keep the 
economy going.
<P>
	In western Canada, they are understandably intolerant 
because they do not invest in their youth as we do. It is not one of 
their concerns. They do not seem to have the resources; they do 
not take care of young offenders who are left to fend for 
themselves. They just lock them up in a different part of the 
prison than the adults.
<P>
	Our assessment of this bill illustrates how distinct a society 
Quebec is. You know, it is not only our language and culture 
which make us different from the rest of Canada, but also our 
beliefs, concerns and philosophy. We just do not see things the 
same way and the bill before us this morning is a case in point.
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not mention that the goal aimed at by 
the amendments proposed in this bill could be achieved through 
a stricter enforcement of the present Young Offenders Act. It 
appears that, in his bill, the Liberal member is seeking to make 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3737"> 3737 </A></B>
<P>
young offenders accountable and responsible for their illegal 
actions so that they can be tried in a regular court.
<P>
	In our justice system, teenagers charged with indictable 
offences are seldom tried in adult court, even though the April 
1992 amendments make it easier.
<P>
	Being doubly concerned with the rehabilitation of the young 
offender and the protection of society, lawyers and judges are 
not surprisingly very reluctant, one to ask for a trial in adult 
court, and the other to order it.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	In Quebec, according to the information I have, transfer to an 
adult court is requested in no more than 5 per cent of all cases.
<P>
	This reluctance is easily explained: If a young offender is 
found guilty in adult court he will receive a very stiff sentence, 
offering very little opportunity for rehabilitation. Moreover, he 
will be eligible for parole only after five or ten years, depending 
on whether the crime was first or second degree murder.
<P>
	Why force the hand of the courts if, for legal and social 
reasons, they do not do it? Even though they can try some young 
offenders as adults, accountable and responsible for their 
actions, they rarely choose to do it. If the hon. member wishes to 
help society, he should instead introduce a bill to make the 
public more aware that a program offering help in a responsible 
manner affords better protection than a punitive measure, which 
is effective only as long as it is in force.
<P>
	More than that, he should support a complete transfer of 
jurisdiction to the provinces, with the necessary budget. This 
way each province could deal with its young offenders as it 
chooses.
<P>
	The deterrent effect sought by imposing longer sentences is 
not supported by the information available. In fact, the reverse 
in true according to <I>Crime and Delinquency</I> which, in its 
January issue, published the results of a study carried out in 
several American States proving that.
<P>
	Like his government, the hon. member misses the target 
completely with this bill. If the Criminal Code needed 
amendments, it would be to force rehabilitation and reentry into 
the community for young offenders, but this is outside the 
jurisdiction of this House.
<P>
	Society should be more tolerant and its objective should not 
be to make all young persons conform with what their 
environment, their family, their school and society itself expect 
of them, but to make them able to become independent, with the 
minimum of limitations, and to make their reentry a success.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rex Crawford (Kent):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to 
rise today to speak in complete, full and total support of Bill 
C-217, an act to amend the Young Offenders Act, the 
Contraventions Act and the Criminal Code in consequence 
thereof. It was placed before the House by my colleague, the 
hon. member for York South-Weston. I congratulate him for 
the bill and for  his distinguished efforts at drawing much 
needed attention to the issue of young offenders.
<P>
	When I was first elected to the House of Commons one of my 
goals was to strengthen the Young Offenders Act. Recent events 
in my riding only give me greater resolve and strength to push 
for tougher sentences.
<P>
	As many in the House may be aware the city of Chatham, 
Ontario, population 43,000, is still reeling from the brutal 
murder last week of seven-year old Daniel Miller. He was in the 
wrong place at the wrong time. A local teenage gang member 
has been charged with first degree murder in the beating death.
<P>
	My heart goes out to the Miller family. They lost a son before 
the prime of his life, before he had a future. The slaying has 
sparked angry demonstrations and a series of petitions calling 
for action to prevent more violence.
<P>
	A railroad bridge near where the boy's body was found was 
covered with graffiti by a group called Criminally Minded 
Corporations or CMC. A young concerned citizen painted the 
bridge on the weekend to erase the gutter language. The CMC is 
the best organized of six youth gangs in Chatham and boasts 
over 100 members. Many gang members wear army boots with 
symbolically coloured shoelaces.
<P>
	In addition, this totally random act of murder is seemingly 
just one more example of the crumbling decline of our society, 
morals and family values. The day after, a 17-year-old was 
charged with assault causing bodily harm to a security guard 
who was watching over the abandoned yard where the murder 
took place.
<P>
	Where does it end? Local parents and other citizens are 
calling for vigilante justice. They do not trust our current system 
of justice, that it lets off criminals with a slap on the wrist while 
the victims are left in limbo for the rest of their lives.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	One resident, Jason Gale, who moved to Chatham recently 
with his two young daughters, mother and grandmother said 
this: ``They are terrorizing people. I think if the people of 
Chatham started fighting back, if a few of these gang members 
got beaten up pretty bad or had something happen to them, I 
think a lot of it would stop''. Is that where our society is today?
<P>
	I appeal for calm and level heads to prevail in my riding. We 
must improve the justice system so that criminals are punished 
for their crimes. Bill C-217 is an important step in the right 
direction.
<P>
	Several years ago the former Conservative government 
introduced some tougher sentences. For instance the maximum 
sentence for murder was increased to five years from three. I 
said at that time when the bill was introduced, and I will repeat it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3738"> 3738 </A></B>
<P>
today, that the current Young Offenders Act is too soft. It is a 
joke.
<P>
	I have presented over 25,000 names on petitions collected by 
Roy Asselstine Jr. and his parents calling for a reinforcement of 
the act. I am told by lawyers and police that if some young 
people are involved with the Young Offenders Act it is a badge 
of honour. It is a measure of distinction. That is what they are 
saying on the streets. No ivory tower mentality of Parliament 
Hill is going to change that reality. It is a reality not just in 
Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver but also in many smaller cities 
such as Chatham.
<P>
	Bill C-217 will augment the debate. As my friend from York 
South-Weston pointed out, his bill is endorsed by the Canadian 
Police Association and Victims of Violence and is co-sponsored 
by 17 members of Parliament.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is threefold. First, the young offender 
would now be between the ages of 10 and 15. As a result 16 and 
17 year olds would be held responsible for their criminal acts 
and prosecuted in adult court. Second, the maximum penalty for 
first and second degree murder would be increased to 10 years 
from the current 5 years. Third, after a second conviction the 
young offender's name could be published.
<P>
	These are reasonable improvements to the current Young 
Offenders Act which is not an effective deterrent and does not 
allow correctional officials a sufficient opportunity to 
rehabilitate young people. Bill C-217 goes a long way toward 
balancing the needs of the public as well as our youth.
<P>
	Yes, we must work to prevent crime, to give hope to young 
people that their futures can be meaningful, that their lives can 
make a difference in this world of ours. Rehabilitation must be a 
vital component of any new law.
<P>
	I am pleased to offer my backing to the bill. I urge hon. 
members to send it to the justice committee where it can receive 
more in-depth study.
<P>
	In closing I have an article from the Chatham paper. The 
headline reads: ``Family of teen beaten up by gang moves out of 
Maple City''. These are the Asselstines whose son was beaten up 
by the gang CMC and hospitalized. On his release from hospital 
he and his parents went around the Chatham area getting 
signatures on a petition. They have been harassed ever since and 
have moved with no forwarding address. This is not what we 
want in our society today.
<P>
	It is on their behalf and that of young Daniel Miller that I 
stand in the House in support of Bill C-217.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to basically support the bill as 
amendments to the Young Offenders Act are so very long 
overdue.
<P>
	The issue certainly was up front during the election. There 
was always someone who was sure to bring it up at a local town 
hall meeting during the campaign.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	Consequently, in view of such wide concern about problems 
with the act from right across Canada, it was with dismay we 
found listening from this side of the House that the government 
did not even give a mention of the Young Offenders Act in the 
throne speech. After subsequently pressing the government on 
that sorely misplaced priority, we have now had a number of 
promises from the justice minister that the government is 
moving on a series of amendments.
<P>
	However, the timing of the long awaited government bill at 
last count is that it is to be introduced sometime in June. Based 
on the shifting sands of time of this government, one wonders if 
there will ever be a government bill amending the Young 
Offenders Act tabled before the House adjourns for the summer.
<P>
	I am sure therefore it is with a backdrop of frustration that the 
member has introduced his own private member's bill. I have 
heard that the substantive part of it does not have the support of 
the government. From our observation, this is most 
disconcerting.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act has a title. This bill seeks to make 
the act live up to its name. The YOA should deal with young 
offenders, not youthful adults. I would certainly like to see more 
comprehensive adjustments to the act, however as far as this bill 
goes, we on this side are prepared to support it.
<P>
	Specifically the bill is threefold. It lowers the age limits that 
define who is a young person for the operation of the act. It also 
allows the publication of the name of a young offender who has 
been convicted of an indictable offence on two previous 
occasions. This is a weak effort of improvement but certainly is 
a move in the right direction.
<P>
	The bill also increases the maximum penalty for first and 
second degree murder to 10 years. This last point has been 
hinted at by the justice minister. However the bill at least leaves 
the other measures alone whereas the justice minister plans to 
give on one hand yet take away with the other by limiting the 
transfer provisions of the act.
<P>
	My sympathies go out to the member that he is part of a group 
which is so out of touch with Canadians that he has to bring 
forward his own bill. Although the bill has timid half measures it 
still does not get the support of the cabinet.
<P>
	I have been around at the operational level with young 
offenders since the days of working with the juvenile delin-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3739"> 3739 </A></B>
<P>
quents act. I recall all too well the federal-provincial  
conferences and negotiations for 10 years leading up to the 
passage of the YOA in the dying days of a previous Liberal 
government.
<P>
	Canadians were assured in bold terms how the YOA struck the 
right balance. I also recall strong voices at the time, even in the 
House, of how the YOA sent the wrong message to the 
community and especially to young offenders.
<P>
	We have now lived with the Young Offenders Act for about 10 
years. It has been amended three times in response to 
community concern. It is the single piece of criminal legislation 
that is most vilified by the public. We have had 10 years of 
implementation. One would think over that period some 
semblance of accommodation would have resulted. However the 
opposite is true.
<P>
	The verdict is in from the empirical evidence of operation in 
the field. The Young Offenders Act is fundamentally flawed 
because it arises from false assumptions of human nature and as 
we know best, top down attitude that the community really does 
not know what is good for it.
<P>
	Reformers on this side have been calling for some time for a 
fundamental review because the community demands it. The 
murder rate has doubled since the death penalty was last used in 
1962. Violent crime in general has increased even more. The 
basic point is that crime rates in general are too high.
<P>
	We know who the offenders are. We need to protect the 
community and give more recognition to victims. We have 
considerable resources available for offenders. We should do 
more to provide opportunities for making self-reformation 
available for offenders. However the Young Offenders Act is 
way off track in respect of victims of youth crime.
<P>
	In my riding the biggest outcry for the Young Offenders Act 
reform comes from high school students. They are all too well 
aware of what the street sentiment is about what happens to one 
of their own when they seriously offend against another student. 
Many students, especially females in high schools, are afraid. 
There is an atmosphere out there that nothing happens to young 
offenders. There are no real consequences. Law-abiding 
students have no confidence in the justice system.
<P>
	Youth are in a period of learning where they resist limits. 
They kick against authority and watch how the community 
responds. The Young Offenders Act does the young no favours 
by sending the wrong message about violating the rights of 
others. The Young Offenders Act sends the wrong message to 
the community.
<P>
	We check the newspaper today. Again we see that 16-year old 
Marwan Harb of Dompierre Street was pronounced dead at the 
hospital after being stabbed in the back. A 15-year old boy who 
was arrested two hours after the stabbing will be charged with 
murder.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	A group of teens was walking through a park. Following an 
argument one of the boys punched Harb's girlfriend in the face. 
When Harb tried to defend her a fight broke out and he was 
stabbed in the back. It was a fight between a bunch of kids. It was 
not like a gang war. It was not racial. The victim and the accused 
knew each other through school. Upon being noticed the kids ran 
away, leaving Harb lying on the ground. Incidents like this that 
are repeated across Canada demonstrate that we need to address 
youth violence.
<P>
	We have an atmosphere where youths carry weapons. There is 
little community consensus that we are accountable to an 
atmosphere of law and order and, if violated, offenders will be 
held to account. In some aspects we see youths behaving as if all 
law and order has broken down and they are living with the 
attitude of anarchy, every person for themselves; protect 
yourself because for no one else will.
<P>
	The inter-relationship between law, its application and social 
order is complex. Yet in its simplest form,Canadians from 
across the country have indicated that the Young Offenders Act 
does not strike the right balance of deterrence to the individual, 
deterrence to others, victims' rights and opportunities to reform.
<P>
	I recently drafted my own private member's bill that was 
rejected by the system as Bill C-217 was already in the hopper, 
working its way through. My bill was seen as being too similar. 
Unfortunately the bill is not votable but I commend the member 
for sending a message to his colleagues. I hope they wake up and 
get going with fundamental changes.
<P>
	Reform Party members will have a lot to say in the future 
about a constructive alternative to the Young Offenders Act. We 
have been listening to the community. Our platform comes from 
the bottom up. The Reform Party national task force on law and 
order specified substantive changes to the Young Offenders Act 
and we will be bringing those forward.
<P>
	Now is the time to support the voice of reason and practical 
reality. The Young Offenders Act needs changing. The bill 
although too modest in substance certainly goes in the right 
direction. Voices of this tone must be supported. The bill must 
not only be supported by like-minded individuals but must be 
supported in the name of young people right across the country. 
The misguided premise of the Young Offenders Act will 
eventually be fixed. Perhaps it will take a Reform Party 
government to do it.
<P>
	In the meantime Her Majesty's loyal constructive alternative 
from this side of the House will support any voice of reason and 
balance to deal with the measures the community wants. Let us 
change the Young Offenders Act now and send a more realistic 
message to offenders and potential offenders that someone's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3740"> 3740 </A></B>
<P>
rights end where someone else's nose begins. Offending needs 
to be denounced.
<P>
	We need a young offender law that is realistic in our culture, 
that balances the needs and the rights of the offender and the 
offended. The community must have confidence again in the 
justice system. That is why I support the inherent message of the 
bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to say a few words on the bill this morning. I 
congratulate the hon. member for York South-Weston on 
bringing the issue forward. It is one that has been very much on 
the minds of all members of Parliament and certainly on the 
minds of the general public. There are some very succinct parts 
of the young offenders legislation that should be given a very 
serious look and review.
<P>
	This issue is like any other major issue that arises and 
becomes a public concern. There are serious events that occur 
that bring the issue forward in the media. People feel that 
nothing is working. Something is working. Something is not. 
The something that is not working should be reviewed and 
repaired.
<P>
	All legislation has to be changed from time to time to meet the 
trends and the changes that take place in society. However there 
is one thing I disagree with. As a former educator I hear some 
people saying that young offenders do not understand the 
implications of what they are doing. I can say, having taught 
many teenagers in my earlier days before coming to this 
institution, they understand what they are doing. No one needs 
to throw that argument out. It will not work.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	The other sad part of this argument is the fact that some 
people automatically think that these people come from poor 
homes, no training and so on in the home. There are areas where 
this occurs. There are other cases where people are looked after 
in the home and they still go astray because peer pressure is very 
strong on them to join gangs and go in the wrong direction.
<P>
	I spoke many times in the last Parliament on young offenders 
because we had a serious case in my constituency in the village 
of Barry's Bay. I think one of the major problems is that the plea 
bargaining that goes on in the courts is simply not justifiable and 
cannot be supported. I am glad to know that the justice 
committee at the direction of the government is making a 
serious review of this legislation and will probably be into it 
before June or, if not, during the month of June. I congratulate it 
on that.
<P>
	The plea bargaining that goes on in our courts today has to be 
changed if we are going to change the Young Offenders Act and 
other legislation dealing with the criminal element. There is no 
way that we can allow lawyers to go on bargaining away the laws 
of the country. The laws of the country are put in the records of 
Parliament, put in legislation to be carried out. That is the intent 
of the legislators who pass them.
<P>
	I am absolutely opposed to handing it over to a group of 
lawyers and the court and the crown and saying: ``You drop this, 
I will take that''. In the end you have a situation similar to one 
that was brought to my attention recently by the hon. member 
for Victoria-Haliburton. A person goes into a store with a 
sawed-off shotgun, holds up the store, gets away, is finally 
caught and brought into court. When he is sentenced he gets four 
months and he will probably be out in two and a half months. 
They used to get 10, 12 and 15 years for armed robbery.
<P>
	That is not justice in the eyes of the public and the punishment 
certainly does not fit the crime. These are things that have to be 
changed.
<P>
	We cannot have people committing crimes in this country and 
walking away laughing at the law. That is indeed what is going 
on. We cannot have people going down the streets and shooting a 
top-notch graduate student on a sidewalk in Ottawa, Toronto or 
anywhere else, destroying good lives.
<P>
	The system has to be seriously reviewed, not just reviewed 
and looked at and talked about and so on. I wish the justice 
committee well as it does this later. I thank the hon. member for 
York South-Weston for bringing the issue before the House and 
giving us a chance to discuss it. I know he is very serious about 
having the bill adopted for further study and brought before the 
justice committee.
<P>
	The bottom line here, and I do not like using that term because 
it is usually used in an unsophisticated manner, or the real 
essence of law is that legislators pass laws hopefully to be 
obeyed, hopefully to be administered, hopefully not to allow a 
loophole where the law can be bargained away for those who 
want to get the case over with and win cases for people who 
should not be on the streets. When someone does get out on the 
street early and commits another crime, up goes another big 
sympathy wave saying: ``Oh, this person shouldn't be out on the 
street''.
<P>
	He should not have been out on the street. The law has to be 
administered. Some of it is already on the books so that when a 
person is in prison he or she should not be out of incarceration 
until they have had medical treatment and are deemed by 
medical authorities to be capable of running their own lives, 
leading a decent life out on the streets and byways.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	If there is anything that we are going to have to improve along 
with this legislation, it is to make sure that the treatment, 
medical care and the advising are in place to bring these young 
people back into a productive way of life.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3741"> 3741 </A></B>
<P>
	There are some who have come under the Young Offenders 
Act who are now very productive in society. We have to 
recognize that side, too. It is not a one-sided picture. We can 
only try to perfect it if we try to correct the things that are not 
working in it today.
<P>
	I want to review briefly the things that I have touched on. 
There is the medical treatment of these people, ensuring that the 
plea bargaining system is changed so that it is going to back up 
the law that we put on the books, the publishing of names of 
young offenders as indicated in the hon. member's private 
members' bill this morning and the fact that these young people 
do know what they are doing.
<P>
	Let us go at this in a very constructive way and correct what is 
working to complement that which is working today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I stand today 
to support Bill C-217. I support it in principle as has been 
explained by another member of my party. There are some 
aspects on which we would like to see some fine tuning.
<P>
	Any move in this direction is a move that will work in favour 
of our most valuable asset in Canada, our young people. Our 
young people are the ones who are the most disadvantaged by 
the current Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	I agree with the member for York South-Weston totally that 
the bill should have been votable. It really shows something 
wrong with the system when we can have a votable bill on 
whether hockey should be Canada's national sport but for 
something like this that works directly against the young people, 
the greatest asset of Canada, we are not going to vote on it. I find 
that really outstanding.
<P>
	Young people come to me quite frequently. They say: ``As a 
high school student my biggest problem is that I recognize that I 
am under a cloud''. I suspect that for many members and their 
constituents, when they see young people on a bus or gathered 
somewhere they assume the worst because there are some bad 
apples.
<P>
	We must make changes to the Young Offenders Act not only 
for property values or violence but primarily to support 
Canada's greatest asset, our young people. Many of those young 
people are involved in things like science fairs. They are very 
exciting events to attend. I commend them to all members and to 
the public.
<P>
	Many of them belong to school clubs and organizations. They 
belong to sports teams. Many are involved in cadets, scouts or 
guides. Many belong to churches, young people's groups or 
counsel at summer camp as counsellors. They are involved in 
marching bands, 4-H clubs, forestry camps, computer clubs, 
sports clubs and camps. Those who are actively involved are the 
people who are the most disadvantaged by this law.
<P>
	We as adults have to get our priorities straight. Let us protect 
our greatest asset. Many of our young people are involved in 
summer work. Often we think of summer work as kind of a make 
work kind of a thing. As members know, without the inclusion in 
the work force of our young people, many of the things that get 
cleaned up in the summertime would not get cleaned up. They 
help with tourist and recreation facilities. They act as 
information for business.
<P>
	I say that parents have to be involved in education of the 
young people. They have to be involved in guidance of the 
young people. They have to be involved-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
apologize to the hon. member for interrupting his speech but the 
rules require that the debate end in about a minute's time.
<P>
	I understand that a good number of members would like to 
take part in this debate. The Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice has stood. He would like to speak. I am sure 
the hon. member would like to conclude his remarks so I would 
seek the unanimous consent of the House to extend the debate on 
this most important subject matter for an additional hour until 
one o'clock.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There does not appear to be unanimous 
consent. I believe the hon. member had a second point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, can you indicate who denied 
unanimous consent? I did not hear anything from this end.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member, if he had been sitting 
here, certainly would have heard something.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> It is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, considering the 
comparative importance of the next bill we are supposed to 
debate to the people of Canada. However those who denied 
unanimous consent will have to account to their constituents and 
to the people of Canada why they think that an hour's debate on 
the Young Offenders Act is too much.
<P>
	In view of the importance of the legislation, I would seek the 
unanimous consent of the House to adopt the bill at second 
reading, in principle, and to refer the bill to the justice 
committee for further consideration.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3742"> 3742 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Once again I must advise members that 
there is no unanimous consent on this side.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> I rise on a further point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
The separatists will have to explain to the rest of Canada why 
they do not want to debate or even discuss the bill.
<P>
	I will try once again. Rather than adopting the bill at second 
reading I would ask that the subject matter of the Young 
Offenders Act, not the bill before Parliament, be referred to the 
committee so that all members will have an opportunity to 
discuss the subject matter at committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to refer the 
subject matter of the bill to committee?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Again there is no unanimous consent.
<P>
	The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 96(1), 
this item is dropped from the Order Paper.

ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from April 29 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-22, an act respecting certain agreements concerning 
the redevelopment and operation of terminals 1 and 2 at Lester 
B. Pearson International Airport, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee; of the amendment; and of the 
amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
government is blatantly guilty of applying a double standard. 
This very same government, which not so long ago attacked the 
least fortunate in our society, is now getting ready to protect and 
compensate persons with no redeeming value whatsoever, other 
than the fact that they helped fill the coffers of the two major 
federal political parties.
<P>
	This is the same government that, less than one month ago, 
announced restrictions to unemployment insurance entitlement, 
thereby propelling more workers into the ranks of social 
assistance recipients.
<P>
	Unlike the unemployed, lobbyists and heads of corporations 
with close ties to political parties need not be concerned about 
incurring losses. There is certainly no question of them losing 
their benefits, remuneration or compensation. Their interests 
are well protected since they are directly tied to party finances.
<P>
	The dealings surrounding the privatization of terminals 1 and 
2 at Pearson airport are a striking example of how Canadian 
governments unfortunately resort all too often to playing 
politics. Many of those who have already spoken in this debate 
have recounted in detail the saga of this deal. Therefore I will 
not go over the same ground again.
<P>
	My purpose in speaking today is to emphasize the odious 
nature of this affair and the offensive attitude of the two 
governments who have been successively involved in it.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Take for instance the way the privatization bids were 
solicited. A 90-day bidding period is highly unusual for such a 
major contract. Did anyone in the federal administration 
protest? Certainly not! It was better kept in the family.
<P>
	With the result that we know: Paxport and Claridge 
Corporation were the only bidders. The Nixon report had a great 
deal to say on the subject. While the quote may be a tad long, it is 
well worth reading and rereading:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The RFP [request for proposals] having as it did only a single stage and 
requiring proponents to engage in project definition as well as proposal 
submission and, all within a 90 day time frame, created, in my view, an 
enormous advantage to a proponent that had previously submitted a proposal 
for privatizing and developing T1 and T2. Other management and construction 
firms not having been involved in the manoeuvering preceding the RFP had no 
chance to come up to speed and submit a bid in the short time permitted.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The winner, as we know, was Paxport, in spite of the fact it 
was grappling with financial difficulties. Which leads to the 
next question that has to be raised again: How could the 
government let a contract of that magnitude to a company 
without checking its financial statements? Can anyone imagine 
even for a moment that an unemployed citizen would be granted 
a subsidy, a loan or a contract, to start up a small business 
without having to prove profitability?
<P>
	The answer is obvious. Never, ever, could such a thing 
happen. Principles like the need to manage public funds soundly 
would be argued. Always the same double standard! If you are 
rich and close to those in power, the usual conditions just do not 
apply to you, or barely.
<P>
	Another unknown in this matter is the role played by lobbyists 
in obtaining these contracts. We know that the Lobbyists 
Registration Act was passed by the Conservative government in 
1988 and came into effect in September 1989. It is interesting to 
stop and look briefly at the basic principles underlying this 
legislation. There were three principles.
<P>
	First, accessibility, meaning that the public has the right to 
express its opinion and have unrestricted access to government; 
second, transparency, that is to say that activities involving 
governments should be clear and open; and third, simplicity, 
which means the administration of the registration system must 
be simple.  To that end, lobbyists must register with the registrar 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3743"> 3743 </A></B>
<P>
in one of the categories established by law. In theory, nothing 
could be simpler.
<P>
	Assuming I am a lobbyist, I register with the registrar and 
thereafter, anybody refering to the register will know that I am 
working as a lobbyist. Depending on the category I am 
registered under, information concerning my activities will be 
more or less elaborate. Many problems with the application of 
the law have been identified, but the gist of it remains valid.
<P>
	Let us move on to the role of lobbyists involved in the Pearson 
Airport case and the treatment provided for in the act. We will 
focus on three major players, namely Donald Matthews, Hugh 
Riopelle and Patrick MacAdam. Mr. Matthews is president of 
the Matthews group, which has a 40 per cent controlling interest 
in Paxport. As you know, Mr. Matthews presided over Brian 
Mulroney's leadership campaign in 1983. In addition, as a 
former president of the Conservative Party, he ran fund-raising 
campaigns for that party.
<P>
	Mr. Riopelle was chief of staff to former Tory Prime Minister 
Joe Clark and was later to be appointed to lead the transition 
team of ex-Prime Minister Kim Campbell. Mr. Riopelle was 
hired as lobbyist by Paxport's president at the time, Ray 
Hession.
<P>
	The third lobbyist is Mr. MacAdam, a friend of Mr. Mulroney 
and of the Conservative Party. These three men have one thing in 
common: they never registered as lobbyists.
<P>
	Should the law not apply equally to everybody? It does not 
seem to apply to Tory lobbyists. What about Liberal lobbyists? 
It is an open question. We think it would be appropriate to look 
more closely at the lobbying firms involved in the Pearson 
Airport deal. Here are some of them. Working on behalf of 
Paxport is the Government Business Consulting Group Inc., 
whose CEO is J.A. Fred Doucet. Surprise, surprise! Mr. Doucet 
was Mr. Mulroney's chief of staff and senior adviser on Kim 
Campbell's campaign. It is a small world.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	John Legate is president of J.S.L. Consulting Services 
Limited. Coincidentally, he was hired as lobbyist by Paxport's 
president when he had access to the Tory Cabinet through the 
minister then responsible for Toronto, Michael Wilson. As you 
recall, the airport is located in that city.
<P>
	Last but not least, Atlantic Research Canada Inc. whose 
president at the beginning of the privatization affair was Ray 
Hession, who was also president of Paxport. Mr. Hession was 
Deputy Minister at Supply and Services under the Liberal 
government of Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Once the contract was 
awarded to Paxport, he resigned as president to be replaced by 
Don Matthews' son.
<P>
	At Claridge Properties, Earnscliffe Strategy Group Inc., one 
of the lobbyists, is represented by William J. Fox, a former 
political attaché and personal friend of Brian Mulroney.
<P>
	At Near Consultants and Associates Limited, we find Harry 
Near, who is also involved in the Earnscliffe Group. Mr. Near 
has long been active in the Conservative Party.
<P>
	There is no need to continue this litany of names and 
companies, the conclusion is clear and obvious: they were all 
related to one another and to the two federal parties which have 
succeeded each other in office.
<P>
	Other questions arise. Who exactly do these people and these 
companies represent? Who are the directors of the various 
companies involved? We must clear that up. These people have 
had great influence with political decision-makers, so much so 
that the former government violated an important parliamentary 
principle according to which a government at the end of its term 
makes no decision that could endanger the decision-making 
power of a future government.
<P>
	They were so influential that on April 13, 1994, the Liberal 
government tabled Bill C-22 which is being debated today. This 
legislation would allow the government to pay corporations, 
especially the T1 T2 Limited Partnership, large amounts for 
cancelling the contract. Their influence is such that this 
government is asking us to ratify another transaction from 
which corporations tied to the two traditional parties will 
benefit. Their influence is such that this government is asking us 
to forget all the transactions between the corporations and the 
Department of Transport were in flagrant violation of the 
government policies in effect. Their influence is such that the 
government is asking us to forget these policies intended to 
encourage marketing the airports and their contribution to 
economic development and to make them aware of local 
concerns and interests.
<P>
	We want to know whose economy was to be developed. We 
want to know what local concerns and interests were served by 
these agreements. We want to know who benefited: the 
taxpayers, local communities or corporations.
<P>
	These questions indicate how openly the government 
conducts its affairs and how easily the public can access 
information on this. Remember that these principles are affected 
by the law and that lobbyists must respect them.
<P>
	The picture we have just painted shows us a group of 
influential people, well connected with ties to the political 
parties, who can bend government decisions to their financial 
advantage.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3744"> 3744 </A></B>
<P>
	We have many questions and very few answers. We all know 
that you must first have your questions answered before you can 
make a decision.
<P>
	The taxpayers of Canada and Quebec need light to be shed on 
this issue, an intense, bright light. That is why the Bloc 
Quebecois demands setting up a royal commission of inquiry on 
this matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to participate in the debate on Bill C-22.
<P>
	I wanted to go over the sequence of key events surrounding 
the drafting of the privatization contract, but since there are so 
many details, manoeuvres and shady dealings in this 
transaction, and since some colleagues have already looked at 
these events, I will instead put the emphasis on a few aspects of 
this project which involve the alleged transparency of this 
government in this whole issue.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	This government paints a glowing picture of the consulting 
process to get Canadians' opinion, but in fact all these so-called 
consultation exercises are nothing but a mirage, because when 
this pretence of transparency puts the government on the 
defensive, it quickly states that it was elected to make decisions 
and that it is doing just that. However, by acting like a bunch of 
know-it-alls, as Liberal Premier Daniel Johnson said, this 
government will lead us directly to social chaos. Canadians will 
not be fooled.
<P>
	What distinguishes this government from the previous 
Conservative government? Nothing, except maybe the colour of 
its program. It is a centralizing government, a government 
which does not hesitate to maintain duplication and 
overlappings; a government which continues to violate areas of 
provincial jurisdictions by unilaterally occupying the whole 
field. Where is the transparency? Can you not see a pattern 
between the recent squabbles between Ottawa and Quebec City 
regarding manpower training, the youth corps program, federal 
subsidies for education, social programs reform, drug patents, 
the telephone industry and cable TV? All these issues 
demonstrate the centralizing actions of Ottawa. Where is the 
transparency?
<P>
	As regards Bill C-22, again I will refer to what Greg Weston, 
a journalist with the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>, wrote in his column on 
March 9. Mr. Weston wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Grits have managed the remarkable feat of turning a highly suspicious 
and secretive Tory deal into a highly suspicious and secretive Liberal 
cancellation process-a secret inquiry, followed by the current secret 
compensation negotiations, which may ultimately lead to a huge government 
cheque with a secret invoice.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This sums it up quite well. It seems obvious to me that section 
10(1) opens the door to arbitrary measures and that the power 
given to the minister to decide on the payment of a 
compensation is a discretionary power which this government 
should not use if it really wants to govern with a degree of 
transparency and credibility. Indeed, this Liberal government is 
not immune to patronage, as you can see when you take a quick 
look at  those closely or remotely involved in this scandal. This 
is why we ask that a commission of public inquiry be set up.
<P>
	The circumstances around the hasty signing of the contract for 
the redevelopment of Pearson Airport are very disturbing, but 
what is even more disturbing is the attitude of this government, 
which was also in a hurry to designate a former Liberal minister, 
Mr. Bob Nixon, to conduct a private investigation.
<P>
	In the awarding of this contract, what was the role of Senator 
Leo Kolber, former member of the board of directors of Claridge 
Properties Inc., a group that has close links with the Liberal 
Party of Canada, and of Herb Metcalfe, a Liberal lobbyist with 
the Capital Hill group, who represented Claridge Properties and 
was a former organizer for the present Prime Minister? What 
was the role of Ramsey Withers, a Liberal lobbyist whose ties 
with the present Prime Minister are known and who was Deputy 
Minister of Transport during the bidding process on Terminal 3 
at Pearson Airport?
<P>
	What was the role of Ray Hession, former Deputy Minister of 
Industry and senior official with Supply and Services, the 
department awarding the contracts? Mr. Hession was president 
of Paxport Inc. and hired a battery of lobbyists, including Bill 
Neville, closely linked to Mr. Mulroney, Mr. Clark and Mrs. 
Campbell; Mr. Hugh Riopelle, former PR man and 
representative for Air Canada, who had access to Mr. Don 
Mazankowski, a leading figure in the Mulroney cabinet; Mr. 
John Legate, a friend of Michael Wilson, and so forth. What a 
mess.
<P>
	Was an agreement reached by the present Prime Minister and 
Mr. Charles Bronfman, owner of Claridge Properties and 
principal partner in the Pearson Development Corporation, at 
that notorious $1,000 a plate dinner among friends during the 
election campaign? Only investigators without links to current 
and past governments would be able to force the people involved 
come clean, not a timid in-house inquiry, held privately, without 
any judicial powers.
<P>
	Mr. Nixon himself observed that the role of lobbyists in this 
deal went beyond permissible norms. A time frame of 90 days 
for bidding proposals is unusually short. I may recall that this 
was a very long term contract-57 years-and a very complex 
one, which was to prevent several groups from submitting a 
valid proposal. Of course, Claridge and Paxport, already 
involved in the management of the airport, were able to submit 
tenders which, by the way, were the only ones accepted. A single 
corporation was to control all three terminals, despite the fact 
that the government of the time claimed that one of the criteria 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3745"> 3745 </A></B>
<P>
in the privatization of terminals 1 and 2 was competition. We 
can see now that a monopoly was in the cards.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	As you can see, Mr. Speaker, the list of irregularities is very 
long, and this is why we are requesting a public inquiry, an 
inquiry that the Liberals stubbornly refuse. The present Liberal 
government, claiming openness, wants to cancel the deal. But it 
keeps a discretionary power, in section 10, to compensate, «if 
the Minister considers it appropriate», certain friends of the 
party or contributors who may have been implicated in this 
scandal. As the leader of the opposition was saying, ``this 
particular case is overrun by lobbyists. It is full of people 
wheeling and dealing in the corridors of power with the two big 
parties-''
<P>
	At the present time, Mr. Bob Wright, a good friend of our 
Prime Minister, is negotiating strenuously and in private too, in 
order to determine the amount of compensation to be given to 
strangers.
<P>
	In fact, we are shown only the tip of the iceberg and we are 
asked, a bit too lightly, to forget the rest in order to save money.
<P>
	The Liberal member for York South-Weston was saying in 
this House, on Tuesday, that compensations to the Pearson 
Development Corporation could reach almost $200 million.
<P>
	Mr. Bronfman and the conglomerate he heads, friends of the 
Liberal Party, have already submitted claims for $30 to $35 
million for non-refundable expenses. That's on top of tax 
deductions they will be able to claim from Revenue Canada, 
thus hitting the taxpayer once again.
<P>
	The hon. member for Thunder Bay was saying in this House:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To be exclusive in looking at compensation for out-of-pocket expenses for 
Pearson Development Corporation alone is not the right thing to do. We should 
take in the whole gamut of all those who spent considerable time and expense in 
developing proposals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	And this, in spite of the fact that these people knew exactly 
what they were doing since the present Prime Minister had 
announced that he would cancel the contract.
<P>
	The facts revealed by a royal commission would allow the 
government to pass laws to prevent such blatant patronage to 
happen again. I am asking you: What would be cheaper, holding 
a public inquiry, not a review and private negotiations, or paying 
financial compensation to individuals who finance Canadian 
political parties?
<P>
	We could talk about political party financing now, but we will 
do that later. The member for Thunder Bay-Nipigon claims 
that a royal commission would be too expensive and a waste of 
time to learn something we already know. Our colleagues 
opposite may know more about this contract than we do.
<P>
	As Mr. Nixon himself said in his report:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Failure to make public the full identity of the participants in this agreement and 
other salient terms of the contract inevitably raises public suspicion. Where the 
Government of Canada proposes to privatize a public asset, in my opinion, 
transparency should be the order of the day.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	And Mr. Nixon added:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My review has left me with but one conclusion. To leave in place an inadequate 
contract, arrived at with such a flawed process and under the shadow of possible 
political manipulation, is unacceptable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	After such a statement, it cannot be justified to compensate 
people or companies who tried to take advantage of such flaws.
<P>
	Can we put a price on government's transparency and 
credibility? Is it a waste of time to try to maintain such 
democratic values?
<P>
	With this in mind, we call for a public inquiry and for the 
government to get right to the bottom of these sad events.
<P>
	We vigorously denounce this attempt and this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be 
sorry indeed if I did not take this opportunity to speak on this bill 
which shows the true face of the members opposite. As you may 
recall, during the election campaign, the Prime Minister 
promised to cancel this deal and to make the political process 
more transparent. Most likely he was swept up in the media 
frenzy in the dying days of the campaign and got a little carried 
away.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	His friends, those same friends who shell out $1,000 a plate 
for the opportunity to gain his ear, were quick to remind him: 
``Careful, we incurred expenses in connection with this deal''. 
Today, we have a more complete picture and these individuals 
will receive compensation. This bill is to be passed here in 
Parliament, and rather quickly. Fortunately, some of us are 
keeping our eyes open and are criticizing the government's 
actions loud and clear.
<P>
	The aim of the bill is twofold. First, it would cancel the deal 
which is full of irregularities. This is a positive development. 
Second, however, it would provide compensation, again by way 
of a closed process, to certain parties. This is far less positive.
<P>
	From the very moment it came to power, this government 
made transparency one of its major objectives. It has also made 
a number of decisions, such as cancelling the helicopter contract 
and the Pearson airport deal and launching the infrastructure 
program. Three decisions, and then almost nothing, with the 
exception of a budget, and a bad budget at that. Since then, it has 
simply gone about its day to day business. The government 
seemed to have scored well on these three issues, but now, there 
is some question about its performance on the airport deal. It is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3746"> 3746 </A></B>
<P>
highly doubtful that the government should be given a passing 
grade in this case.
<P>
	It bothers me to hear so much talk about transparency. It has 
become such a major issue that I would not be surprised to see 
Liberal members walking around with bottles of Mr. Clean. Yet, 
when time comes to practice what they preach, all is forgotten. 
All of a sudden, members stop talking. There is no real desire to 
shed light on this issue, to examine the root of the problem and 
to avoid a recurrence in the future. No, now that they are in 
power, they must not let the public in on their plans for the 
future.
<P>
	This is terrible. If we look at the whole privatization process 
and at the companies involved, that is Paxport and Claridge, and 
if we look at who is behind these companies-and I will not 
bother to give you a complete rundown since my colleagues 
have already done that-the whole spectacle is rather sordid 
indeed. All these people with very close ties to the federal 
government used their influence, going as far as having people 
shifted around, to make sure they achieved their ends.
<P>
	Many of these people are still alive and not too far removed 
from the system, still today. How can this government be trusted 
when many of the people involved are their friends and are still 
around, and when they refuse to institute an inquiry which 
would publicly condemn these people who can be linked to their 
political party?
<P>
	That is not a possible course of action; it would be far too 
dangerous. Mr. Nixon, in the very short time he was given to 
investigate the matter, attempted to shed some light on this, 
enough anyway to tell us that this contract should indeed be 
cancelled. This was obvious just from reading a few good 
articles published in the dying days of the election campaign and 
around the main events. We knew then that something was 
wrong with the announcement of a contract to privatize the 
airport.
<P>
	During the election campaign, it had been held out that only 
friends of the Convervative government were involved and the 
previous government was to be condemned, on this score. Now, 
we find out -but it had been discovered earlier- that plenty of 
Liberals are also involved. As the financial stakes rise, the 
political convictions of these people shrink. They will team up 
with anybody, whatever the cost.
<P>
	The bill before us today contains a most interesting provision. 
It will allow those who are to be compensated to be targeted very 
specifically, ensuring that only friends get compensated. That is 
even better. What a great political tool.
<P>
	This is the sort of attitude that deeply disheartens the public. 
It generated tremendous cynicism for politicians, for the 
administration of public funds. Here we have the perfect 
occasion to shed light on a major matter where certain people 
have used their influence, where lobbying has been too intensive 
and too influential in particular. Yet, we have to wait. What for? 
I wonder.
<P>
	There are a number of quotes from the famous red book that I 
would like to bring up, because this government had told us it 
was going to control the activities of lobbyists when it would 
come to power. Apparently some things take much longer than 
others, but I will quote this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We will develop a Code of Conduct for Public Officials to guide Cabinet 
ministers, members of Parliament, senators, political staff, and public servants in 
their dealings with lobbyists.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We will appoint an independent Ethics Counsellor to advise both public 
officials and lobbyists in the application of the Code of Conduct. The Ethics 
Counsellor will be appointed after consultation with the leaders of all parties in 
the House of Commons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	At that time, they were probably far from thinking that the 
Leader of the Official Opposition would be a member of the 
Bloc Quebecois. They may find this a bit unsettling. But they 
had good intentions. Now that they are in office, it is a different 
matter. They were in opposition for a long time. They had 
enough time to get ready. A party in opposition since 1984 
would have had the time to put a lot of things on the table. People 
would appreciate it. Instead, they are trying to scare lobbyists 
into being very nice to the current government. The coffers must 
be filling up quickly. We should avoid this legislation at all costs 
or take the time to ensure it will have as little effect as possible.
<P>
	What is most appalling in the bill before us is clause 9 and 
especially clause 10. Clause 9 states that there will be no 
compensation for the parties involved. In short, the main 
purpose of Clauses 1 through 8 is to ensure that the government 
will not be sued. Clause 9 bars any compensation-perhaps the 
government hopes that people will get discouraged after reading 
it. Clause 10 provides for ``the approval of the governor in 
council'' so the minister may allow some compensation but not 
for lobbyists' fees. It is the least that can be done as these fees 
are already tax deductible. If they had to be compensated in 
some other way besides, it need have cost the government 
nothing. These people see paying lobbyists as an investment, so 
they have to pay the price somewhere.
<P>
	We are not at all reassured by knowing that the Cabinet will 
have the power to do that in secrecy. To pay how much 
compensation? Who knows? Who will know? Will we know one 
day? That remains to be seen. For the sake of openness, this 
should be elucidated. In addition, if compensation is to be paid, 
people should have access to this information much more easily. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3747"> 3747 </A></B>
<P>
At least some parliamentarians should be able to deal with it. 
But no, openness will come later.
<P>
	Before concluding-my colleague wants me to go quickly-I 
would not want to overlook one of the real sources of the present 
problem, namely the financing of political parties. I exclude our 
party because we are subject to much stricter constraints. But 
when you are financed by people who have very big corporate 
interests, when you agree to be financed by these corporations 
and it is even one of your biggest sources of funding, you are 
subject to that pressure. People who back political parties have 
some control.
<P>
	Personally, I much prefer to have a base of party members 
making small donations and exercising that power instead of 
business people who make large donations and try to get very 
close to the government with those gifts. I think that is a 
constraint from which the government should free itself. If it is 
serious when it talks about openness, it has a model right at 
hand. Quebec already has legislation which, although it may not 
be totally perfect, is much better than what we have here and it 
could be used as a basis. But no, they refuse to look at it. Why? 
Because now that they are in power, they want to benefit from it. 
They have nine lean years to make up for now. They want to 
make a little hay. Perhaps later they will think of doing 
something to please the public, but nothing substantial. In 
conclusion, if there is one thing I would want to give Canadians 
before leaving the federal system, it is a law on political party 
financing that would make elected representatives much closer 
to the people in a much more open system-a real reform, this 
time.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-22, 
the subject of today's debate, is a rather particular piece of 
legislation. This bill deals with agreements arising out of the 
request for proposals for the terminal redevelopment project at 
Lester B. Pearson Airport, and the negotiations concerning that 
project.
<P>
	The bill states that these agreements have not come into force 
and have no legal effect. Moreover, it provides that no action or 
other proceeding may be instituted against Her Majesty in 
relation to these agreements.
<P>
	This is an extremely serious piece of legislation. The previous 
government concluded a contract with some corporations, and 
this government is trying to renege on that deal by pretending 
that it never took place.
<P>
	Why is that? Later on I will show how the process was flawed 
in a number of ways and that indeed the government should not 
go ahead with this contract.
<P>
	The bill also authorizes the minister, with the approval of the 
governor in council, to enter into agreements to provide for the 
payment of amounts in connection with the coming into force of 
that act. This second part seems to be a convenient provision to 
ensure that parties which may have been prejudiced can be 
adequately compensated following the cancellation of the 
contract.
<P>
	However, while it may seem appropriate to do so, the wording 
of the provision makes you wonder, and so do some connections 
which can be made between various events. I will attempt to 
show that, because of these events which may leave public 
opinion with a bitter taste, it is important to look more 
thoroughly at what went on before the agreements were 
negotiated and concluded, as well as to what is going on now.
<P>
	To put the legislation in its proper context, clause 3 provides 
that the agreements which have been concluded:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>- are hereby declared not to have come into force and to have no legal effect.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Moreover, clause 4 says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>4. For greater certainty, all undertakings, obligations, liabilities, estates, 
rights, titles and interests arising out of the agreements are hereby declared not to 
have come into existence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As for clause 9, it provides that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>9. No one is entitled to any compensation from Her Majesty in connection with 
the coming into force of this Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So far so good. However, everything is spoiled by clause 10 
which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>10.(1) If the Minister considers it appropriate to do so, -if he considers it 
appropriate- -Minister may, with the approval of the Governor in Council, 
enter into agreements on behalf of Her Majesty to provide for the payment of 
such amounts as the Minister considers appropriate in connection with the 
coming into force of this Act, subject to the terms and conditions that the 
Minister considers appropriate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I certainly do not question the good judgment of the minister 
or the governor in council. However, I would like to refer to a 
few excerpts from Mr. Robert Nixon's report, who was 
appointed last October 28 by the current Prime Minister to look 
into this transaction. Mr. Nixon's report was submitted a month 
later, on November 29. What does this report tell us? To quote 
Mr. Nixon:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Prior to the conclusion of the legal agreement the Leader of the Opposition 
(now the Prime Minister) indicated clearly that parties proceeding to conclude 
this transaction did so at their own risk and that a new government would not 
hesitate to pass legislation to block the privatization of Terminals 1 and 2 if the 
transaction was not in the public interest.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Nixon's report goes on to say: ``On October, 7, 1993, the 
chief negotiator for the Government of Canada received his 
written direction indicating that it was the explicit instruction of 
the Prime Minister that the transaction be concluded on that very 
same day. On October 7, 1993, therefore, the legal agreement to 
privatize and redevelop terminals 1 and 2 was made''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3748"> 3748 </A></B>
<P>
	It was a very substantial agreement. In fact, when we talk 
about terminals 1 and 2, we are talking about a major air 
transportation hub in this country. To quote the Nixon report:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>According to a 1987 Transport Canada study, Pearson has a $4 billion direct 
economic impact on the economy of the province of Ontario and was directly and 
indirectly responsible for over 56,000 Ontario jobs. It is by any estimation more 
than the sum of its parts or the total of its assets and liabilities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is a contract which has an enormous impact on a region's 
economy, by letting private interests manage an air terminal of 
that size, while for many years, airports near nonheal have been 
under-used. In Central Canada we have created a powerful 
magnet for air traffic that can draw traffic away from the 
country's other major airports, especially those near Montreal.
<P>
	And how many years would this contract be in effect? I am 
still quoting Mr. Nixon: ``Terminal 3 will be privately leased 
and operated for''-I was going to say at least 25 years, but no, 
Mr. Speaker-`` a further 57 years''. Not only our own 
generation and the next, but our children's children would have 
suffered as a result of this agreement. There would be fewer 
objections if the usual procedures had been followed. Again, I 
quote from Mr. Nixon's report: ``The RFP having as it did only a 
single stage''- specifications with a single stage are not only 
unusual, Mr. Speaker, but also extremely disturbing-``and 
requiring proponents to engage in project definition as well as 
proposal submission and, all within a 90 day time frame''.
<P>
	I used to be in business, and I received government calls for 
tenders, and believe me, it is quite a job to read all the 
specifications. There are pages and pages of the stuff, and you 
have to read them carefully. And then, preparing a bid is also a 
complex undertaking. The primary concern is, of course, to 
make a bid that will not bankrupt the company. The price should 
be right, but you still have to make a profit, because if you do not 
make a profit, you cannot deliver. So the first thing is to make a 
bid at the right price and be able to make a profit.
<P>
	Second, you have to make sure that your bid will be 
competitive with those of the other parties who are bidding, so 
the price has to be fine tuned to give you a good chance to get 
your bid accepted and win the contract.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	You see, Mr. Speaker, when you know that there are only 90 
days for something that complex, you can assume that there will 
not be much competition and, consequently, the price is 
probably not the best the public could have had. I quote Mr. 
Nixon again: ``In summary, it is my opinion that the process to 
privatize and redevelop Terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson fell far 
short of maximizing the public interest''.
<P>
	All that happened under the Conservative government. 
Having the Liberal government cancel the deal is a good thing. 
However, the clause I was mentioning a moment ago, which will 
allow the minister to consider compensation when appropriate, 
is more troublesome, particularly knowing that major actors in 
this Pearson deal have connections with the Liberal Party.
<P>
	We could mention Claridge Properties, a company belonging 
to Mr. Bronfman; we could mention Mr. Colbert, from Claridge, 
who gave a dinner for Mr. Bronfman and the Prime Minister at a 
$1000 a plate. I am not questioning the honesty of members and 
ministers of the Liberal Party, what I am saying is that there is an 
appearance of conflict and the only way to shed light on this 
affair and dispel any doubt in the eyes of the people of Canada 
and Quebec, is to have the public inquiry that the Bloc 
Quebecois and I are requesting.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, this whole 
deal smacks of political manoeuvring and, as the Leader of the 
Official Opposition said, only a royal commission will get to the 
bottom of it once and for all.
<P>
	People in Canada, and especially in Metropolitan Toronto, 
have the right to know the truth and to be assured that there will 
be no undue compensation for these contracts which seemed to 
favour the friends-friends in the broader sense of the word-of 
the parties which succeeded each other at the helm of the 
country.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, if the Official Opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, 
is asking for a royal commission, it is not to delay the work 
which is to take place at both airports because-let me tell 
you- Metropolitan Montreal knows only too well the 
devastating effects of uncertainty about airport development.
<P>
	Allow me to highlight the devastating effects of the 
development of what became the two Montreal airports. I will 
stress how important it will be for Transport Canada and then for 
the Toronto Airport Authority to take over and redevelop 
Toronto airport because, otherwise, any future expansion at 
other airports, including Montreal, will be seriously limited.
<P>
	But, let me remind the House that when it comes to airports, 
long term forecasting is very dicey. In the mid-sixties, the 
federal government decided to build a second airport in 
Montreal, Mirabel airport.
<P>
	In 1967, it was projected that, by 1985, passenger traffic 
would be 14 million. In reality, things turned out quite 
differently.
<P>
	In 1985, passenger traffic in both Dorval and Mirabel was 
only 7 million, half of what was originally expected.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	We know how important an adequate airport infrastructure is 
for the development of a region. Why? Because it is the entrance 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3749"> 3749 </A></B>
<P>
point for investors and the  departure point of human and 
material resources going abroad. It is a considerable economic 
lever.
<P>
	My colleague mentioned the 1987 Transport Canada study on 
Pearson airport which states that the direct economic impact of 
the airport on the province is in the order of $4 billion-that was 
in 1987-and that Pearson accounts directly or indirectly for 
56,000 jobs. On the other hand, when adding both direct and 
indirect jobs and induced ones, the total number in Montreal is 
48,500. Economic development involving airports stems from 
the carriage not only of cargo but also of passengers.
<P>
	I would like to point out that Toronto had a narrow escape 
when the federal government decided Toronto also should have 
two airports at a respectable distance from one another. The 
second one was to be located in Pickering, but the people of 
Pickering protested and managed to convince the authorities not 
to develop this second location, but to develop a second terminal 
at Pearson instead-a third one was added later on, as we 
know-on a site easier to integrate.
<P>
	Toronto had a narrow escape, but Montreal was not so lucky. 
In spite of all our protestations-and as we know, farming was 
precluded for many years on some of the best arable land in the 
region-two separate airports were built in Montreal, airports 
that together, did not achieve together the results that had been 
projected for just one previously. The federal government paid 
no attention to the wishes of the people or the airlines. It must be 
noted however that had rapid, direct service been provided 
between the two airports, things might have turned out 
differently. In 1975, a high-speed link had been announced; it 
was to cost $400 million, but the project never got off the 
ground.
<P>
	For any number of reasons, the airport in Toronto flourished 
and today, it is on the way to becoming a hub airport, ``hub'' 
being, as I understand, shoptalk for a traffic exchange point, a 
place that both companies and passengers are interested in.
<P>
	Because Montreal's two airports are poorly connected, from 
1969 to 1983, the gap between Montreal and Toronto increased 
from 27 per cent to 116 per cent in terms of passenger carriage. 
That is very substantial. The adverse effects of inefficiency in 
Montreal impacted not only the development of the airport, but 
also economic development. Worse yet, the federal government 
delayed handing over to the municipalities, the community, in 
Montreal the management of their airport. It is imperative that 
in Toronto, the municipalities, the community, rapidly assume 
the management of the airports.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Just think that provided sufficient investments were made by 
the federal government both in Toronto and in Montreal, we 
could have two hubs: one in Toronto, with its own potential, and 
one in Montreal, as a point of entry for the Eastern part of the 
country.
<P>
	I therefore conclude that we are calling for a royal 
commission of inquiry not because we want to slow things 
down-because we are all aware of the effects of uncertainty on 
economic development-but because we believe it is absolutely 
imperative that the manoeuvring surrounding the development 
of both terminals, as well as that of the third one, be dissolved, 
reversed and the only way this can be done, in our view, is not by 
striking a deal behind closed doors, but through a royal 
commission of inquiry.

	The House resumed from April 25 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-16, an act to approve, give effect to and declare valid 
an agreement between Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada 
and the Dene of Colville Lake, Déline, Fort Good Hope and Fort 
Norman and the Metis of Fort Good Hope, Fort Norman and 
Norman Wells, as represented by the Sahtu Tribal Council, and 
to make related amendments to another act, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> When the debate last ended, the hon. 
member for Cariboo-Chilcotin had six minutes remaining for 
debate. I do not think the hon. member is here. Accordingly the 
Chair will recognize the hon. member for Skeena on debate.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak 
in opposition to Bill C-16, otherwise known as the Sahtu Dene 
and Metis comprehensive land claim agreement. Before I begin 
debating the terms of the agreement, I want to make an 
observation about the big media establishment in the country 
that I think badly needs to be said.
<P>
	The debate on Bill C-16 began on Monday last week, April 
25, with members on this side of the House speaking openly and 
honestly about their concerns with the agreement. This marks a 
precedent, the first time the old style tradition of the old line 
political parties not debating such issues publicly being broken.
<P>
	This is because Reformers believe that we must not be afraid 
to talk honestly about native self-government and land claims. 
We cannot expect to achieve workable solutions to the 
challenges we face as a nation unless we engage in such debate.
<P>
	Following the debate on Monday, I eagerly scanned the 
newspapers and watched television news broadcasts to see how 
the media treated this issue. Do you know what I discovered, Mr. 
Speaker? The press totally ignored the issue. I could not find any 
coverage on Bill C-16 anywhere.
<P>
	Admittedly many bills pass through the House that are not 
very interesting or newsworthy, but this is surely not the case 
with Bill C-16 which will convey benefits of an enormous piece 
of land 50 times the size of Prince Edward Island, almost 
one-third the size of British Columbia, to less than 1,800 
aboriginals for all time.
<P>
	One would think that with all the remaining land claims yet 
outstanding the press would be somewhat interested in what is 
going on here. I know the people in my riding are and I am sure 
the people in British Columbia and all of Canada are. How is that 
an MP's expense account or the theatrics of question period can 
remain front page news for days and yet when we see an  issue of 
such profound importance to all Canadians, aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal alike, being debated the media is asleep at the 
switch?
<P>
	I have concluded that it is either indifference born out of 
laziness or a tacit agreement not to provide serious coverage on 
issues which challenge the Liberal left agenda that has been 
wholeheartedly adopted and supported by a bunch of the big 
media in the country.
<P>
	Having said that, I would like to discuss the elements of the 
bill which I cannot support. As has already been pointed by 
many of my Reform colleagues, the Sahtu Dene and Metis 
agreement constitutes a massive conveyance of land and 
benefits to a group of less than 1,800 people, half of them 
children.
<P>
	There is not likely to be much protest coming from 
non-aboriginals in the land claim area because there are so few 
of them. Yet the land in question is important to all Canadians. It 
has the potential to generate an enormous amount of wealth, 
jobs and tax revenue in the future. That potential will be 
seriously affected by this agreement.
<P>
	One cannot help but be struck with the magnitude of the land 
transfer. Over 42 square kilometres for every adult will be 
conveyed fee simple. The vast majority of Canadians meanwhile 
own only their own property, the property that their house is on, 
and spend most of their working lives paying off mortgages so 
that hopefully they can own their land fee simple in their 
retirement years.
<P>
	According to Statistics Canada's 1991 census, 21.5 million 
adults live in Canada today. If each one of these adult Canadians 
were to be granted 42 square kilometres of land by the 
government one would require a land mass of approximately one 
billion square kilometres to meet that conveyance.
<P>
	Given that the actual total land mass of Canada is just over 
nine million square kilometres one would need therefore an area 
more than 100 times the size of Canada's total land mass to meet 
that obligation.
<P>
	In a world which continues to experience significant 
population growth and where population density in many 
countries is measured in hundreds of human beings per each 
square kilometre it is impossible to reconcile this massive land 
grant.
<P>
	I ask aboriginal people to consider this very carefully. 
Canada's population continues to grow. We continue to accept 
immigrants and refugees from all over the world to come and 
make their home here. While we may disagree with the current 
immigration levels, all Canadians and all members of the House 
embrace this. Immigration provides benefits not only for the 
newcomers to Canada but to the people already living here, 
much like the European migration to North America brought 
benefits to this land and to its original aboriginal inhabitants 
many years ago.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3751"> 3751 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	Admittedly colonization created much hardship and injustice 
for native Indians of the day as well and we recognize that as an 
inescapable part of our history. When I consider the land aspect 
of this agreement, I must conclude that at best it is 18th century 
thinking at a time when we are approaching the end of the 20th 
century.
<P>
	In addition to the outright transfer of over 40,000 square 
kilometres of land fee simple, the federal government will pay 
out approximately $130 million over the next 15 years to the 
Sahtu Tribal Council. This equates to more than $130,000 for 
each adult covered under the agreement.
<P>
	Again, to put this into perspective, if every adult Canadian 
was given the same amount of money, the government would 
need more than $3 trillion in the bank to write out the cheques. 
Three trillion dollars is more than four times Canada's total debt 
of $700 billion which includes federal, provincial and municipal 
government debt.
<P>
	Furthermore, even after such a massive transfer of land and 
cash nothing in the agreement affects the ability of the Sahtu 
Dene and Metis to receive existing and future benefits under 
aboriginal programs. In discussions with my constituents on the 
land claims question, I hear a diverse range of opinions on how 
to resolve the issue.
<P>
	The one consistent theme running through all of this is 
finality. People want assurance that the resolution of the land 
claims will entail a systematic reduction and phasing out of 
taxpayer funded aboriginal programs delivered by the 
government. This agreement does not achieve this.
<P>
	I would now like to talk about the beneficiaries of the $130 
million to be paid out to the Sahtu Tribal Council. Only some 
$3,500 will be given to individuals as one-time grants. Virtually 
all the benefits conferred on the Sahtu Dene and Metis under this 
agreement will be controlled by Indian leaders rather than 
distributed to individuals.
<P>
	All governments, including this one, are notoriously bad 
managers of wealth and resources. I do not believe a majority of 
Canadians have any doubts about that whatsoever. If I were a 
rank and file Sahtu Dene or Metis, I would far prefer that I 
received a direct personal benefit rather than having money and 
land given over to the control of a tribal council.
<P>
	I receive entreaties on an ongoing basis from native people 
living on reserves within my riding telling me of the injustices 
they receive at the hands of their leaders. They tell me of 
nepotism where band jobs and other perks go to relatives and 
friends of native leaders while others are shut out.
<P>
	This is typically the way government functions. Look at the 
federal government's behaviour, if members need any 
convincing. It is for these reasons that I believe in the value and 
dignity of the individual over the collective regardless of what 
collective we are talking about. I am a strong advocate for 
settlements government to individual rather than government to 
government.
<P>
	Incidentally I believe the reason a majority of natives voted 
against the Charlottetown accord is that the rank and file 
individuals living in aboriginal communities recognize that 
self-government was not necessarily in their interest but rather 
the narrow interests of the Indian leaders. They know that power 
consolidated into the hands of a few people is rarely a good 
thing. It has not been good for Canada in the case of our federal 
governments or the provincial governments. At a time when our 
national institutions are struggling to become more populous, to 
break down the barriers of arrogant, political elitism, natives in 
Canada are not interested in going in the other direction.
<P>
	Therefore before I can support any legislation for 
self-government or land claim resolutions, I want to see the 
affected aboriginal people have an opportunity to decide by 
referendum whether they want self-government, and in the 
resolution of land claims, whether they want money and land 
turned over to themselves as individuals or to the band leaders.
<P>
	My deepest concern over the bill is the precedent being set for 
future land claim negotiations. The Sahtu Dene and Metis 
agreement along with the Nunavut and other agreements entered 
into recently up north are no doubt being carefully studied by 
aboriginals in the rest of Canada, particularly in British 
Columbia.
<P>
	There are now 38 land claims registered in B.C. with more to 
follow. The first B.C. land claim to be accepted by the federal 
government for negotiation is the Nisga'a claim which is within 
my riding of Skeena. Negotiations have been under way for 
some time behind closed doors and therefore in a forum where 
my constituents have no information as to what is on the table in 
terms of land and resources. When my constituents express their 
deep concern about being shut out of the process, they are patted 
condescendingly on the head and told by government officials 
not to worry, that their best interests are being looked out for. 
These are largely the same government officials who patted us 
on the head and told us that the Charlottetown accord was good 
for us and we should vote for it.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	We can therefore understand why people in my riding are very 
doubtful that their interests are being protected. The Sahtu Dene 
and Metis agreement will only serve to heighten their concerns.
<P>
	If the people of Canada had not been given an opportunity to 
vote on the Charlottetown accord in a referendum we would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3752"> 3752 </A></B>
<P>
have had it imposed on us even  though a majority of Canadians 
and almost 70 per cent of British Columbians found it 
unacceptable.
<P>
	It is imperative that the people in Skeena receive an 
opportunity to vote on a proposed land claims settlement within 
the riding to ensure that the settlement agreement is not imposed 
from the top down. In saying that, let me reassure Indian people 
who may be listening that Canadians are very fair minded and I 
am sure that any just and equitable settlement proposed will be 
supported.
<P>
	I would like to read from a letter I have recently sent to the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development which 
encapsulates the concerns of my constituents with respect to 
land claims:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Minister:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As we are both aware, negotiations between the Nisga'a people of North West 
British Columbia, the Federal Government and the Province of B.C. are ongoing 
and have been for some time in an attempt to resolve the outstanding Nisga'a land 
claim.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The land claimed by the Nisga'a falls within my constituency of Skeena and 
consequently is of great concern to all people living in the riding. I have received 
numerous phone calls, letters, and personal entreaties from constituents who are 
fearful of what a land claim resolution might mean for them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Given that the foundation of our economy in Skeena rests squarely on 
resource industries, fishing, forestry, and mining, and understanding that these 
resources are inextricably linked to the land base, this same land which is being 
claimed by natives, it is easy to see why people are concerned.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>These ongoing land claim negotiations are taking place behind closed doors, 
out of the public eye, and this heightens concern, worry, and uncertainty.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I wrote to you earlier this spring on behalf of Andy Burton, Mayor of Stewart, 
asking that you allow a representative of this community to be appointed to the 
negotiating team. This request was denied.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My purpose in writing today is to request detailed, specific information 
which may help to re-assure my constituents.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. What is the timetable for settlement of the Nisga'a land claim?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>2. When do you expect to have an agreement in principle signed?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>3. Will every Nisga'a have the right, as an individual to vote to accept or reject the 
agreement?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>4. Will members of the Nisga'a band have the option of receiving benefits conferred 
under the agreement on a personal basis, that is, directly from the Government rather 
than to the Band Council on his/her behalf?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>5. Will non-Natives in the Land Claim area have the right, as individuals, to vote to 
accept or reject the agreement?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>6. Has your department assessed potential socio-economic impacts of a land claim 
settlement on surrounding non-Native communities? If so, could you provide these 
to me and if not will you commit to do so before signing any agreement?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>7. Have you considered the potential cumulative effect that over 40 land claims 
could have on the B.C. economy?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>8. Considering that the Nisga'a land claim is the First claim in B.C. to be 
negotiated and will set the floor and not the ceiling for benefits and land 
conveyance, will you commit to a detailed study of the above mentioned 
potential cumulative effect?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>9. Have you considered the tax base generated by the resource industries in the 
claim area which provides direct benefits to all Canadians, and how this base 
may be affected by land claim settlements?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>10. Do you intend to provide fair compensation to non-Nisga'a people who 
are economically injured or displaced as the result of land claim settlements? If 
so, can you provide details of your policy on compensation? I am not just 
referring to fishermen, forestry workers or miners, but also the thousands of 
retail, commercial, and service jobs that exist because of these industries.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>11. Will regulations in place to protect and enhance renewable resources apply 
to resources conveyed to the Nisga'a people?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Will the Nisga'a people be entitled to ship unprocessed round logs for export? 
If so, what percentage of their timber is subject to this practice?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Minister, these are serious questions which my constituents need and 
deserve answers to and I trust that you will respond in a forthright and detailed 
manner to each one.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	What I am getting at with this letter is the fact that the land 
claim issue is not just about aboriginal people. It is about all of 
us and how we will continue to function as a society both 
economically and politically. At the end of the day we all want 
and need essentially the same things regardless of our linguistic, 
cultural or ethnic backgrounds. We want an opportunity to live 
and work in a free country and within an economy that provides 
decent food, shelter, clothing and education for our children and 
allows us to enjoy the benefits of modern technology to enhance 
our lifestyles.
<P>
	The Sahtu Dene and Metis land claim agreement is not an 
agreement which considers the long term interests of all 
Canadians, including the aboriginal peoples involved. It serves 
to heighten the deep concern my constituents have with the 
process of land claim resolutions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to participate in a debate that is 
historic and I believe precedent setting.
<P>
	First, it is my belief the Liberals will pass Bill C-16 using 
their majority regardless of what it might mean to future 
generations of Canadians.
<P>
	Second, my colleagues and I want to register our opposition. 
We believe that Bill C-16 will not create a better Canada for the 
Sahtu Dene and Metis or for other Canadians. It does not provide 
for future harmonious relationships among Canadians. My 
purpose this afternoon is to show why I believe this agreement 
will not achieve what it was designed to achieve.
<P>
	The agreement will have difficulty meeting its first objective. 
The first objective states ``to provide for the certainty of rights 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3753"> 3753 </A></B>
<P>
to ownership and use of land and resources''. It is clear that the 
intent of this objective is to provide certainty regarding the right 
of ownership to  Sahtu Dene and Metis, called participants in the 
text of the agreement. Let us examine these rights.
<P>
	It is for a very small group comprising 153 Metis, 829 Dene 
and 773 children for a total of 1,755 persons, slightly less than 
2,000. More persons can be added to the Sahtu community in the 
future if the individuals are residents of the settlement area, 
have aboriginal ancestry and are accepted by a Sahtu community 
at any time in the future.
<P>
	Acceptance is not defined in the agreement except that it 
requires a sponsor who is a participant and following that is 
approved by a process to be determined by the participants in the 
Sahtu community concerned.
<P>
	What are some of the implications here? The agreement, 
based on the above, relates to a known group of people today. 
There is no clear definition of who will be affected in the future, 
except we know it could be any person who is sponsored by a 
process as yet unknown, determined by the community and 
solely by the community involved, so that those kinds of people 
will participate in the future from the benefits of this agreement. 
Thus it is possible that the beneficiaries of this agreement may 
be quite different from those with whom the agreement was 
reached in the first place.
<P>
	The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
suggests that new participants will be few and therefore do not 
be concerned. Perhaps, but consider growing wealth and 
growing power as a result of the exploration and development of 
natural resources, gems, the need for water and the access to it. 
In such a case is it not reasonable to expect that more and more 
people would want to become participants? The pressure would 
be on to become participants in a Sahtu community.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us examine some of the details of the land ownership that 
is being talked about. There are three kinds of ownership.
<P>
	There is the ownership of the settlement area which covers 
280,000 square kilometres which is the equivalent of 108,200 
square miles or 108,200 sections of land. That is 54 sections per 
participant if you use 2,000 as the number for easy figuring. 
That represents slightly less than one-third of the province of 
B.C. as my hon. colleague has just mentioned. It contains Great 
Bear Lake, Horton Lake, Colville Lake and a major section of 
the Mackenzie River valley.
<P>
	The second kind of land ownership is the outright fee simple 
title to 41,437 square kilometres which is equivalent to 16,000 
square miles or about eight sections of land per participant. To 
put that into acres, it is 5,120 acres.
<P>
	Then there is the third kind of land ownership and that is 
municipal land. There are two kinds of municipal land: land 
which is within municipal boundaries and that which is outside 
municipal boundaries.
<P>
	What is significant about all of this? The land outside 
municipal boundaries must be held by one or more Sahtu 
organizations. I really want to underline the phrase ``shall not be 
conveyed to a person'', but the other part is that land inside a 
municipal boundary may be conveyed to a person. What are the 
implications of this?
<P>
	Sahtu land may not be mortgaged or given as security. Sahtu 
lands when conveyed to a person are no longer Sahtu lands. 
What is the observation then? Since municipal Sahtu lands may 
be conveyed to individuals and upon so doing cease to be Sahtu 
lands, they can now be mortgaged and given as security.
<P>
	It does not require a great leap of logic to recognize that over 
time what are described as Sahtu lands within municipal 
boundaries may indeed be owned by persons who are not Sahtu. 
Preposterous, you say. All we need to do is look at what is 
happening and what has happened in other parts of Canada.
<P>
	At this moment certain financial institutions in Canada have 
agreed with a certain Indian band to issue mortgages on 
residential development on reservation lands. If it has happened 
once, chances are it can happen again. Indeed chances are that it 
will happen again. That is particularly true if huge profits appear 
likely.
<P>
	A further example consists of the problems surrounding 
certificates of ownership. These are certificates of ownership of 
Indian reservation land by natives on those reserves having such 
provisions.
<P>
	In years past it is my understanding that has not been the 
Indian way. No individual shall own reservation land, yet it 
happened. They said: ``But it is not selfish in the way the land is 
transferred''. It is my observation that it is clearly known these 
transfers are fraught with delays, inaccuracies and transfers 
from one person to another. In some cases they have even been 
proven to be fraudulent. Will it happen here? I do not know and 
neither does this government. However the provision to allow it 
to happen is there. Therefore the stated objective to provide 
certainty and clarity of rights to ownership and use of land 
resources is anything but providing certainty of ownership by 
Sahtu Dene and Metis.
<P>
	Let us look a little closer at the municipal boundaries. Section 
23.2.1 delineates the boundaries of municipal lands. The 
agreement provides that these boundaries may be changed. The 
provisions are particularly relevant. They state in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Where there is any change to the extent or location of Sahtu municipal lands 
pursuant to this agreement, schedules XV and XVI shall be amended to reflect 
this change and such changes-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I quote and directly underline:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3754"> 3754 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-shall not be considered to be an amendment to the agreement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Schedules XV and XVI describe the Sahtu municipal lands, 
schedule XV the surveyed lands and schedule XVI the 
unsurveyed municipal lands.
<P>
	This list of municipal lands includes Déline, Fort Norman, 
Norman Wells, Colville Lake and Fort Good Hope. These names 
are significant to anyone associated with oil and gas and natural 
resources exploration.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	It is my contention that not nearly adequate attention has been 
given to the possible future development in this region of 
Canada, particularly in reference to the implications of the 
provisions found in this agreement on such future developments 
in the region.
<P>
	I believe that while the agreement clarifies some matters, it 
confuses others.
<P>
	This agreement also is entrenched in the Constitution. The 
agreement states very clearly: ``This treaty, which when given 
effect by Parliament in settlement legislation''-and that would 
be Bill C-16-``will be recognized as a land claims agreement 
under the Constitution Act, 1982''.
<P>
	That means once this agreement has been given effect it can 
only be amended by resorting to the appropriate part of the 
amending formula set out in the Constitution Act, 1982. There 
are six different ways of amending the Constitution. It brings 
into question which amending formula would apply. According 
to one constitutional expert:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When the amending formula was designed, no thought was given to devising 
a formula for amending a constitutionalized land claim agreement between an 
Indian band and the federal Government of Canada. Section 43 of the amending 
formula comes closest in that it deals with a constitutional change that affects 
only one province. In those circumstances an amendment is brought about by 
resolutions of the Parliament of Canada and the legislature of the particular 
province involved. But this provision does not really fit either because the Sahtu 
Dene and Metis collectively is simply not a province. Nor do the territories 
qualify as provinces for the purposes of the amending formula.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The result of all this may well be that resort might have to be made to section 
41 which is described as the general amending formula. If a given amendment 
does not come within the more specific parts of the amending formula-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I suggest that is probably the case here.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-then section 41 is the only amending formula that would be available in 
this case. The congruity of that would be that section 41 not only requires a 
resolution of Parliament but also a resolution of at least seven provincial 
legislatures. This is inappropriate in the circumstances because the provinces 
are of course not involved or directly affected by this land claim agreement. 
Nonetheless, proper constitutional amendment permits no shortcuts or 
extemporaneous solutions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Some may observe that the agreement is not the Constitution. 
It only provides for constitutional protection. If constitutional 
protection is to mean anything at all then it requires that 
amendments to this  agreement be governed by the appropriate 
provisions of the Constitution.
<P>
	Even if we could find ways around the kinds of things we have 
talked about until now, there remains the question of whether 
there is judicial support for such claims in the first place.
<P>
	Chief Justice Allan McEachern in the Gitksan case rejected 
such claims and went on to say that a summary of Canadian case 
law was conclusively against the plaintiff's claims for 
sovereignty of ownership. Is it right for the government to 
proceed, indeed to accelerate land claim settlements of this kind 
when the latest word from the courts is that there is no legal 
basis for such claims?
<P>
	With an area as large as 50 times the size of Prince Edward 
Island, which is a province, surely it is almost as if a new 
province was being created. The Constitution provides that the 
establishment of new provinces requires the approval of all 
existing provinces as well as Parliament. This requirement is 
being bypassed by Bill C-16.
<P>
	To establish a region that is to be governed under a new set of 
laws and to convey to a defined group of Canadians known as 
Sahtu Dene and Metis outright fee simple ownership of 41,000 
square kilometres of land is to de facto establish a geographic 
and political region of Canada that in many respects is like 
establishing a new province. In my opinion any and all 
provisions of the Constitution Act, 1982, that apply to the 
creation of new provinces should apply in this case also.
<P>
	Some may argue that I am opposed to any settlement or 
agreement with the Sahtu Dene and Metis regarding land. That 
would be folly in the extreme and a deliberate misinterpretation 
of my remarks. It is necessary for all Canadians to be fair 
minded. That includes recognizing grievances put forward by 
people such as the Sahtu Dene and Metis and to provide for their 
redress.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	I support that. My contention is that Bill C-16 does not meet 
its own objectives to clarify and provide for the certainty of land 
ownership, needlessly complicates administration, costs too 
much and makes any future amendments a matter of 
constitutional amendment.
<P>
	There is a final question. Will this agreement provide for 
greater Canadian unity and help clarify how Canadians want to 
government themselves? To answer that question requires 
answers to three prior questions. First, will giving land and 
money provide for the harmonious relationships between 
members of the Sahtu Dene and Metis communities? The answer 
is no.
<P>
	Second, will the settlement of land claims bring about 
recognition, understanding and acceptance of the respective 
values, social morals, religious beliefs and decision making 
processes 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3755"> 3755 </A></B>
<P>
either among participants or between participants and other 
Canadians? Again the answer is no.
<P>
	Third, will creating another bureaucracy of boards, either 
above or below or within the bureaucracy that currently exists 
for the administration of the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development make governing this land more 
effective? Again the answer is no.
<P>
	Since in my opinion the answers to these questions are all 
negative, how can we justify completing the agreement by 
passing Bill C-16? I submit what this Parliament should be 
doing is building a stronger, more united and more globally 
competitive Canada. I submit to the House and to all Canadians 
that passage of Bill C-16 will drive wedges between Canadians 
by creating political power fiefdoms that are economically 
inefficient, perhaps even unsound and administrative 
nightmares.
<P>
	Passage of the bill creates an environment of competing 
powers that will feed selfish interests to the exclusion of the 
interests of others. It will create competition where 
co-operation should exist. Just think of our interprovincial trade 
barriers that exist in Canada today. Finally, it will make Canada 
increasingly non-competitive in the global marketplace.
<P>
	In conclusion, we need to settle and redress grievances of 
native Canadians. We must agree that the agreement that is the 
subject of Bill C-16 will not do those things.
<P>
	I ask all members of the House to defeat Bill C-16 and find an 
agreement that will redress and solve the grievances that exist 
between us and the Sahtu Dene and Metis people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased today to address the House in relation to 
Bill C-16. This agreement was signed on September 6, 1993 and 
tabled in the House on March 10, 1994.
<P>
	I know the Sahtu Dene and Metis overwhelmingly supported 
the bill in a ratification vote. It appears that they are more than 
satisfied with this settlement. However I believe we would be 
negligent, as parties in the past have been, if we did not address 
some of the problems contained within Bill C-16.
<P>
	Certainly my colleagues and I in the Reform Party are willing 
to obtain concepts of aboriginal self-determination, but only in 
situations in which aboriginals will clearly come to a position of 
self-sufficiency within the Canadian society. Unfortunately Bill 
C-16 does not address this situation.
<P>
	Bill C-16 in fact calls for more bureaucracy, huge settlement 
moneys, continued DIAND programs and extensive future 
negotiations on self-government. The bureaucracy which will 
be spawned by Bill C-16 is in a word overwhelming.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	There will be seven new boards, panels and councils 
established to manage the resources of 2,200 people. These new 
entities will have representatives from the Sahtu Dene, the 
Metis and the government itself.
<P>
	One wonders why aboriginal representatives could not be 
incorporated into existing DIAND boards which manage the 
resources in the settlement area. The agreement, Bill C-16, 
appears to propagate bureaucracy in so far as it overlaps existing 
regulatory boards and threatens to turn a very small population 
into a community of regulatory bureaucrats.
<P>
	The potential for bureaucratic havoc in this new regime 
appears to be very serious, and this is something we want to 
address. We must take the resource management arrangements 
in this settlement as something that will set a benchmark for 
future and existing management agreements in other areas.
<P>
	As all members can appreciate the resources governed by 
these boards will traverse a wide area. Accordingly matters 
concerning wildlife or water would affect a number of distinct 
settlement areas all sharing in these resources and all having 
their own regulatory regime, a formula for bureaucratic havoc.
<P>
	Moreover, the various regions may have different attitudes as 
to how to deal with a particular problem. Certainly that they 
have exclusive rights over the resources in their area, claims of 
mismanagement arising from governments or neighbouring 
bands may be difficult to establish and address.
<P>
	In short, there is a huge potential for an interbureaucratic 
tangle among the various boards in the various settlement areas. 
The government's position with respect to the decisions of these 
boards is very unclear and may contribute to the bureaucratic 
bog already created under the agreement.
<P>
	The new boards, the territorial government and the federal 
government will all have input into the process of resource 
management. The new bureaucracy in Bill C-16 will be 
responsible to, and I quote the minister, ``as the context 
requires''. This could be a minister of the Government of 
Canada or a minister of the Government of the Northwest 
Territories.
<P>
	Aboriginal boards, ministries of the Northwest Territories and 
ministries of the Government of Canada will all grapple with 
and decide on such issues as transport, the environment and 
natural resources. Moreover, bureaucracies within settlement 
areas and bureaucracies within various levels of government 
will all vie for the ability to regulate in their respective fields.
<P>
	The net effect of this bureaucratic web is increased cost, 
increased confusion and increased time to enact any necessary 
measures. Further, we must consider the potential harmful 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3756"> 3756 </A></B>
<P>
effects of all this regulation and consultation, the effect it may 
have on future economic development in the country.
<P>
	Under Bill C-16 companies that may wish to develop 
subservice resources would have to consult with this 
bureaucracy, would have to consult with the Sahtu tribal council 
on such matters as environmental impact and Sahtu employment 
opportunities. I would suggest that this new extensive 
bureaucratic structure that is bound to be set up, is destined to be 
set up under Bill C-16, and the processes established in this 
agreement may discourage many firms from investing in that 
region.
<P>
	In all we create an enormous bureaucracy with a small 
economic base to support it. This bureaucracy and the control 
that goes with it are far from this government's notion of 
self-government. Despite the large settlement area, despite 
compensation to the tune of $130 million, despite regulatory 
authority, and despite royalties derived from gas and oil 
production the Liberals are committed still to the establishment 
of self-government for the Sahtu as stated in appendix B of this 
agreement.
<P>
	An inability to define the term inherent self-government 
seems to in no way deter the government from undertaking 
negotiations to implement it.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	This voluminous, complicated, expensive agreement is 
simply the introduction to a more voluminous, more complex, 
more expensive round of negotiations on self-government. I 
believe it is our duty to question what type of structure this new 
level of government will take, what will be its duties and 
powers.
<P>
	Is self-government even appropriate for a population of 
2,200, of whom some 982 are adults? Does the federal 
government recognize the time and cost involved in separate 
self-government negotiations with every native band in Canada 
as it is committed to? Will the government continue to deny the 
reality of the situation as it has in not believing that a definition 
of self-government is necessary before negotiations start to take 
place?
<P>
	The government has no definition of aboriginal 
self-government and yet is prepared to embark on this journey 
without a map. The government will not be able to sweep this 
one under the rug. Provisions in this agreement and future 
self-government negotiations will hit Canadians where they 
will feel it the most: in their pocketbooks.
<P>
	Since 1990 the budget of the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development has increased approximately $400 
million a year, the largest increase of any of the ministerial 
budgets. In 1994-95 DIAND will spend some $5 billion, of 
which 68 per cent or $3.38 billion are grants and contributions to 
band and tribal councils, a process which the Auditor General 
himself criticized in 1991 as faulty since the department could 
not ascertain whether the funds were used for the purposes 
intended or managed with due regard to the economy, to 
efficiency and to effectiveness.
<P>
	Despite this agreement, despite Bill C-16, it is clear that the 
Sahtu Dene and the Metis will continue to have access to every 
DIAND program that is currently offered. This is in addition to 
the settlement terms of this agreement.
<P>
	This agreement and the parameters for negotiations on 
self-government do not address the spiralling inefficient 
expenditures of DIAND. The government does not address the 
issue of financial self-sufficiency for the Sahtu. As it now 
appears future self-government negotiations will do very little 
to assist aboriginals out from under their continuing dependency 
on DIAND.
<P>
	By not addressing the issue of self-sufficiency it seems to me 
that self-government will simply represent a different 
instrument for the dispersal of government funds to aboriginals. 
I would suggest the taxpayer can no longer afford DIAND's 
huge and inefficient expenditures and I would suggest that 
aboriginals as well no longer wish to live in the dependency of a 
federal department.
<P>
	Bill C-16 does not deal clearly with this issue. The bottom 
line is that this agreement creates more bureaucracy and thereby 
more expenditures for DIAND. Furthermore, since this 
settlement does not concern itself with aboriginal 
self-sufficiency and since the beneficiaries of this agreement 
are entitled to all benefits continuing derived from DIAND's 
programs, agreements such as this will simply push this country 
further into debt.
<P>
	I believe it is time to settle all land claims as quickly and as 
fairly as possible. However, with consideration as to the current 
financial state of Canada I believe that these claims, every 
claim, must be settled with an eye to removing aboriginal 
dependency on government funding. I would apply the same 
criteria to any negotiations surrounding self-government. 
Otherwise DIAND simply will become a larger sinkhole for 
government funds.
<P>
	We do not need agreements such as this one guaranteeing 
government funding well into the future. We need a strategy that 
will break the cycle of dependency. That is what the Canadian 
people want. That is what the aboriginal people want. I look 
forward to the day when aboriginals stand as economic equals 
with all other Canadians. Unfortunately agreements which 
create more bureaucracy and more expenditures will only 
exacerbate the dependency that these aboriginals have on the 
federal government.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	This settlement is just one such agreement and I therefore 
must opposite it.

<P>
	[Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is obvious listening to the hon. member that he really does 
not support any aboriginal self-determination and does not 
really understand the nature of what the Sahtu Dene and Metis 
are trying to do through this agreement.
<P>
	For the last couple of hundred years the aboriginal people in 
those land claims have been at the receiving end of the 
generosity of a different group of people who did not have the 
understanding that they were dealing with a totally different 
culture when they were dealing with aboriginal people in the 
country.
<P>
	It is obvious from his remarks that this hon. member does not 
understand nor does he want to understand what the aboriginal 
people want.
<P>
	It is all very fine to say: ``Well, it would be very nice for the 
aboriginal people in that area to have economic 
self-sufficiency''. It is years of being under a system like the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development that 
has created that so-called dependency which we would not 
necessarily have to be dealing with today if so-called well 
meaning bureaucrats had decided that these people were much 
better off making their own decisions and the bureaucrats 
implementing those decisions for those aboriginal people.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member this question. Has he ever 
met with the Sahtu Dene and Metis and has he discussed at 
length the concerns of the Sahtu Dene and Metis? Has he 
discussed at length the concept of self-government with the 
Sahtu Dene and Metis? What is his understanding of the inherent 
right of self-government as we understand it? If he is that much 
in support of economic self-sufficiency, does he agree that the 
aboriginal people's inherent right of self government should be 
recognized? If so, how would he see that recognition through the 
House of Commons?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, in reply to the hon. member 
opposite, unfortunately what I have just heard is the standard 
answer when someone dares to criticize aboriginal programs. 
That standard answer is: ``You simply don't understand the 
aboriginal people''.
<P>
	I live in an area of British Columbia where there are many 
aboriginal people. I have talked extensively with many of them 
and I have listened to their concerns. The one concern they have 
is they want to break this dependency on the federal 
government. They want to be able to provide for their own 
self-sufficiency.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	This is a good direction to go but Bill C-16, as I stated earlier, 
does not break the dependency. It only provides an obligation 
for continued dependency on the federal government.
<P>
	I believe that any agreement the federal government enters 
into with aboriginal people respecting settlements or land 
claims must lead to an ending of continued  federal government 
funding. The aboriginal people must be permitted to enter into 
an economic base for themselves that will create 
self-sufficiency.
<P>
	The member opposite asked about my definition of inherent 
right to self-government. My understanding is inherent right to 
self-government means that it always existed and is answerable 
to no other authority. I consider every inhabitant of the country a 
Canadian. We have a federal government, provincial 
governments and municipal governments. My vision of 
self-government for the aboriginal people is that they get to a 
position where they are Canadians within the existing federal, 
provincial and municipal laws.
<P>
	I do not support new governments being established within 
my country that would operate outside the established laws to 
which every other Canadian is obligated.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are still about two or three 
minutes left in questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member does not 
understand. I did not ask a standard question. That may be what 
he thinks if he gets a question from somebody who is not of that 
culture. I asked those questions from the intimate knowledge of 
what I am talking about. That is why I asked the questions, not 
because I read it in some magazine or some newspaper. I asked 
them from the point of view that I know what I am talking about. 
That is precisely why I asked those questions.
<P>
	As far as self-government is concerned I do not think the hon. 
member has an understanding of the aboriginal people who want 
to have the opportunity to exercise that inherent right of 
self-government.
<P>
	I would also ask the member how many aboriginal people and 
from what particular area in British Columbia area are saying to 
him that they have great concerns and, if so, would he be 
prepared to say that this particular group opposes those things 
that we are attempting to do as a government? I find it very hard 
to believe that a large group of aboriginal people would be 
saying that whatever we are trying to do is contrary to the wishes 
of the aboriginal people in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I said in my earlier statement that 
the response that we do not understand the aboriginal people or 
their concerns is a standard response when someone dares to 
criticize any form of agreement or any form of structure that is 
proposed within the aboriginal and federal government 
negotiations.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member is right. Perhaps I do not understand 
or possess the intimate knowledge of the aboriginal people that 
he may have. That is probably quite natural, seeing that I am not 
an aboriginal person. What I do understand is this. The 
government and even the aboriginal people themselves have no 
clear definition of what the outcome of aboriginal 
self-government would be.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="3758"> 3758 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	We have asked that question in British Columbia. It has been 
asked in almost every province. It has been asked in the House. I 
asked it of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development and he had no answer to that question. That is the 
gist of what this is all about today. This agreement will provide 
for an immediate settlement of sorts but still opens the door for 
further extensive, complex negotiations of aboriginal 
self-government. There is no clear map. There is no clear 
direction. There is no clear agenda for where these negotiations 
will go or what they will end up with.
<P>
	That is like starting a journey in a totally unknown territory 
and hoping you get to where you are going.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I see that two 
o'clock will arrive before I will have finished so I will continue 
until you shut me down.
<P>
	I want to thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to 
participate in the debate on Bill C-16. As do many of my 
colleagues, I have a particular interest in the proposed 
legislation. During my career I have had opportunity to work 
directly with native people as a labour foreman on a 
hydroelectric project in the territories, as an ombudsman for the 
Alberta region of the department of Indian affairs under Harold 
Cardinal and as a business consultant.
<P>
	I have seen the problems of these people firsthand and 
therefore I speak from experience if not empathy for the plight 
of these people.
<P>
	The Dogrib Indians of the territories I found to be some of the 
hardest working and capable individuals I have ever worked 
with. They were more than willing to work under adverse 
conditions of weather and isolation when the jobs were 
available. However the opportunity to work is not always there 
and when this occurs these willing and capable people are 
unemployed.
<P>
	I was appointed ombudsman by Harold Cardinal who was 
regional director general for the department of Indian affairs in 
Alberta. Mr. Cardinal was a prominent aboriginal leader in 
Canada and president of the Alberta Indian Association for a 
number of years.
<P>
	In this position I dealt with many of the concerns and 
complaints of the Indian people. As a consultant I have received 
many complaints from band members across western Canada 
accusing their band council leaders of corruption and expending 
funds improperly. Seldom if ever did the department of Indian 
affairs look into these complaints.
<P>
	Therefore, like many Canadians I want to see Canada's 
aboriginal peoples given the opportunity to become 
economically and politically independent. I want to see their 
dependency on the taxpayer ended. If an agreement provides 
these ingredients it should be supported. If not it should not be 
supported.
<P>
	This agreement fails to meet these requirements and therefore 
I cannot give Bill C-16 my support. The Sahtu  land settlement 
area covers 280,000 square kilometres with a population of 
approximately 1,700 people. I am prepared to support this part 
of the agreement, although extremely generous, because it is 
clear that these people must have a land base from which they 
can draw resources in order to become economically 
independent and self-reliant.
<P>
	When we compare this to the land base of P.E.I. and Nova 
Scotia which have much larger populations, it is evident that the 
land base requirement for self-reliance is adequately provided 
for in the Sahtu nation in this agreement. In addition, this 
agreement provides not only for subsurface resource rights but 
for royalties on resources presently developed within the 
Mackenzie River valley.
<P>
	These aspects of the agreement are essential for future 
economic self-reliance of the Sahtu nation. I submit that a 
strong, economically self-reliant Sahtu nation will be a benefit 
to all Canadians. This agreement also provides for a transfer of 
funds from the Canadian taxpayer amounting to-

disturbing. Measurements of the atmosphere above Toronto 
shows the ozone layer was 7 per cent to 9 per cent thinner in 
April than it should be. Approximately the same situation was 
reported for Montreal and Vancouver. The ozone layer filters 
ultraviolet rays from the sun, as we know. These rays can cause 
skin cancer, cataracts and possibly immune system damage.
<P>
	The layer has been eroded by chlorine from 
chlorofluorocarbons used in air conditioners, refrigerators and 
some electronic and plastic industries. With 3 per cent less

Quebecois will not protect cultural minorities in an independent 
Quebec. The party's vice-president, Bernard Landry, confirmed 
on the weekend that his party rejects the idea of 
multiculturalism and wants minorities to integrate into 
Quebec's melting pot.
<P>
	In a speech before the council of citizens of Haitian descent, 
the PQ's vice-president also stressed that Quebec's public and 
common culture is that of Quebecers. It is obvious that the Parti 
Quebecois has no desire to honour its commitment to the various 
minorities in Quebec society.
<P>
	Now we just have to find out whether or not the Bloc 
Quebecois agrees with Mr. Landry's comments. If the BQ agrees 
with him, it should say so; if not, it should denounce him!

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the first 
free elections in South Africa were held last week, allowing 
millions of blacks to vote for the first time in their lives. After so 
many years of apartheid and repression, this striking victory of 
democracy shows the courage and determination of those who 
fought for equality for all South Africans.
<P>
	By clearly rejecting the political parties calling for violence 
and vengeance, South African voters turned the page on a dark 
chapter in their history to embrace a democratic and peaceful 
future. This rejection of violence brings hope to all Africans.
<P>
	On behalf of all members of this House, I congratulate the 
newly elected representatives of South Africa on their victory

	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I often

aspects of the UI system because they do not understand the

<P>
	Most complaints are about restrictions on training or the 
taking of temporary jobs that beneficiaries felt would have 
improved their chances of finding more permanent work.
<P>
	Anyone who insures a home or a car receives a written policy 
which lists entitlements, deductions and restrictions. A lot of 
misunderstandings and frustration could be avoided for workers 
if a similar document was available which listed entitlements 
and deductions for the UI system.
<P>
	I urge the minister to produce a printed insurance policy for 
UI which could be posted in places of work or supplied to 
workers when they begin paying UI premiums. This could lead 
in time to a range of UI policies being available at different 
premium levels which would better meet workers' needs and 
would introduce some flexibility into the UI system.

Minister of Fisheries and Oceans announced measures that will 
return over 500 frozen licences to groundfish fishermen who 
have demonstrated a long-term attachment to the industry. Over 
200 of these restored licences belonged to fishermen in the 
province of Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	This whole sorry mess was the result of an arbitrary decision 
by the previous ``no-Tory-us'' government. Sad to say it is only 
one of such messes in the fishery that we have inherited.
<P>
	I want to commend the minister, not only for correcting this 
injustice but also for the establishment of a consultative process 
which in this case involved 11 different fishing organizations.
<P>
	Even though it is a very difficult period in the Atlantic fishery, 
this type of co-operation between the minister and the 
stakeholders in the industry will go a long way toward 
alleviating pain and anguish while the industry is being 
restructured.
<P>
	This new spirit of co-operation and negotiation bodes well 
both for redefining the concept of professional fishermen and 
for establishing the framework of the fishery of the future.
<P>
	In conjunction with the sentiments expressed by the P.E.I. 
Fisherman's Association, I once again commend the minister 
for his work in resolving this situation.

	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Restigouche-Chaleur):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to point out to the House that we are celebrating 
National Forest Week this week.
<P>
	Forests are our greatest natural resource and contribute more 
than anything else to our balance of trade. From coast to coast, 
the forest industry provides some 800,000 jobs, directly and 
indirectly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our forest industries provide the economic foundation of 
some 350 Canadian cities and towns. The people who live in 
these forest dependent communities know the value of forests, 
the vital role they play in their lives and the critical need to 
ensure that our forests remain healthy and flourish into the 
future so that future generations will enjoy the same benefits in 
terms of employment, recreation, and a healthy environment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	Canada is an exception among forested countries because 
over 90 per cent of our forests are majority-owned by the 
people. The forests belong to us. It is up to us to take care of 
them.

	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
Wednesday, the Prime Minister mocked the Bloc Quebecois's 
proposal to go ahead with building a high speed train between 
Quebec City and Windsor. According to the Prime Minister, it 
would be hard for a high speed train to have to stop at the border 
of a sovereign Quebec.
<P>
	Perhaps the Prime Minister has never taken the Amtrak train 
between New York and Montreal. If he had, he would have 
realized that the train does not stop at the Canada-U.S. border. 
For the Prime Minister's information, planes do not stop at the 
borders of sovereign countries either. In fact, the Bloc 
Quebecois does not see why it would not be the same for a 
high-speed train between Quebec and Ontario.
<P>
	If some people wanted to build walls around a sovereign 
Quebec, it would certainly not be Quebecers themselves. 
Quebecers seem to be more aware than the Prime Minister that 
the future development of nations depends on openness to the 
world. Let us stop this demagogy and discuss rationally the real

before its second birthday, the body completely overrun by 
infection. There is no vaccine, no cure for this virus and babies 
can get it in the most tragic way: from their mothers.

have been diagnosed with AIDS in Canada. Sixty-three of them 
have already died.
<P>
	In Quebec one out of 80 pregnant women has AIDS. Experts 
agree that the only way to curtail the rise in pediatric AIDS is to 
prevent transmission of the disease to women.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am ready to deliver my decision on two 
questions of privilege which were brought up on Thursday. The 
reason I am giving my decision now before the start of Question 
Period is that it could impact on Question Period itself.
<P>
	I will add whatever time it takes for me to read my decision to 
the end of Question Period today.
<P>
	As I said, I am now ready to render my decision concerning 
the question of privilege raised by the hon. Minister of Foreign 
Affairs on Thursday, April 28 following Question Period. I will 
also respond to the point of order raised by the hon. member for 
Roberval at the same time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The minister has indicated that his privileges were breached 
when, in the preamble to certain questions, statements were 
made that he was unwilling to answer some questions that had 
been addressed to him. Such comments could give a poor 
impression of his work as a minister and a member.
<P>
	We must always bear in mind the basic principles that govern 
Question Period. These principles have been eloquently 
summarized in the past by Speakers Jerome and Bosley, and the 
highlights of their statements can be found in citations 409 and 
410 of the 6th edition of Beauchesne.
<P>
	One of these principles is that the Opposition is free to ask 
questions of any minister but only if these questions fall within 
the administrative responsibility of the government. However, 
according to citation 410, paragraph 16, in the 6th edition of 
Beauchesne:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ministers may be questioned only in relation to current portfolios.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to remind this House of the remarks of Speaker 
Lamoureux on this subject on October 16, 1968, which were 
reported at page 133 of the House of Commons <I>Journals</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-a minister may be asked questions relating to a department for which he has 
ministerial responsibility or acting ministerial responsibility, but a minister 
cannot be asked, nor can he answer questions in another capacity, such as being 
responsible for a province, or part of a province or, again, as spokesman for a 
racial or religious group.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These remarks, which were referred to by Speaker Bosley in 
his statement of February 24, 1986, today apply more than ever 
and should be followed as strictly as possible by the members 
when addressing questions to a minister. As the members will 
recall, during Question Period on Thursday I had to redirect 
certain questions to the ministers who were responsible for 
them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is also why I found the question of the hon. member for 
Portneuf unacceptable. Furthermore, on rereading the <I>Debates</I>, 
I must acknowledge that the questions and comments by the hon. 
member for Roberval to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
those by the hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie to the 
Minister of Finance were not only incorrect, but totally 
unacceptable acording to our rules.
<P>
	The Speaker accordingly recognizes the merits of the 
arguments raised by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. I must, 
however, state that what is involved here is not <I>prima facie</I> a 
question of privilege, but rather a point of order.
<P>
	Finally, to answer the question raised by the hon. member for 
Roberval, as to whether ministers may be questioned on a public 
statement unrelated to their departmental responsibilities, I 
reiterate the principle that a minister may be questioned during 
Oral Question Period on matters directly related to areas 
affecting his department. The member is incorrect in claiming 
that a minister of the government may be questioned on any 
comment he may have made. The precedents and the 
parliamentary practice are very clear on this point: a member 
may not question a minister concerning a public statement that 
is not directly related to his department.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In closing, I would like to add that since the beginning of this 
Parliament the exchanges during question period have been 
interesting and lively and in the overwhelming majority of cases 
marked by the respect that we owe to  ourselves and to this 
House. I am certain that we can continue along this path.

them and may also serve as a guide to all members as well.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="REGIONALECONOMICDEVELOPMENT">REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister appointed the Minister of Finance as the minister 
responsible for Quebec's regional economic development. 
However, because of his personal economic interests, which we 
do not criticize him for but which exist, the finance minister's 
room to manoeuvre is significantly reduced on several issues of 
importance to Quebec's economic future.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister admit that his finance minister's 
room to manoeuvre is extremely reduced on several economic 
issues of major importance to Quebec since he cannot, as he 
himself acknowledged, deal with the high speed train, the 
Magdalen Islands ferry, the multifunctional smart ship or, in 
large part, the conversion of defence industry to civilian uses? 
Does the Prime Minister admit that Quebec is thus poorly 
served?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Absolutely 
not, Mr. Speaker. We have ministers responsible for every 
portfolio and if there are cases where the Minister of Finance 
cannot get involved for the reasons we all know, well, the Prime 
Minister comes from Quebec and he can intervene. However, the 
Minister of Transport or other ministers consider the issues and 
report back when it is time to do so. Everyone knows how 
competent the Minister of Finance is and, considering the 
responsibilities we have given him, he could not do any better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the Prime 
Minister has seen fit to appoint ministers responsible for 
Western Economic Diversification, the Atlantic provinces' 
development and Quebec's development, I imagine he had good 
reasons to do so.
<P>
	Are we to understand from what the Prime Minister just said 
that every time the minister he entrusted with Quebec's 
economic issues cannot get involved, the Prime Minister will 
take over his portfolio and intervene as the minister responsible 
for Quebec should?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this may occur in one or two areas, especially in transportation 
matters, for the reasons we all know, but these issues are well 
known by all the ministers and by the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In this as in most cases, the Minister of Transport is kept 
abreast of developments so Quebec's interests are never 
minimized at any time because the Minister of Finance, who 
must also deal with the rest of the regional development 
portfolio, happens to be the minister responsible. On the 
contrary, I think the hon. member should rise and say, ``We are 
very lucky that the Minister of Finance comes from Quebec''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, will the 
Prime Minister admit that the Minister of Finance is in a very 
bad position, under these circumstances, to intervene on behalf 
of the MIL Davie shipyard in Lauzon for the Magdalen Islands 
ferry, while his colleague in Transport, who is directly involved 
in the decision, and the minister responsible for development in 
the Atlantic provinces have all the freedom required to intervene 
on behalf of a shipyard in their region, in their province?

issue, the official spokesman has his hands tied, unlike his 
colleagues?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is necessary to really 
understand the objectives and purpose of the Federal Office of 
Regional Development for Quebec.
<P>
	As I announced three weeks ago and as the Minister of Human 
Resources Development announced regarding the Western 
Diversification Fund in the west, we in the Federal Office really 
intend to emphasize small and medium-sized business.
<P>
	In Quebec, we who are really the heirs of the Quiet Revolution 
and the entrepreneurial revolution know very well that Quebec's 
economic future is in our hands, in our small and medium-sized 
businesses, and as the federal government, we intend to 
encourage this dynamism; Mr. Speaker, I can assure you that 
there is no conflict of interest between the Minister of Finance, 
the minister responsible for the Federal Office and Quebec 
entrepreneurs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Finance who 
is also responsible for regional development.
<P>
	The future of the largest private employer in the Quebec City 
region is in serious jeopardy. It is riding, basically, on two 
decisions to be made by the federal government: one concerning 
the project to build a ferry for the Magdalen Islands and the 
other concerning the project to develop a multipurpose ship 
called a smart ship.
<P>
	Does the minister responsible for regional development in 
Quebec recognize that the future of the MIL Davie shipyards 
basically depends on the decision the federal government will 
make in these two matters and does he recognize at the same 
time that he cannot  intervene directly to protect the interests of 
MIL Davie in these two very important matters?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3764"> 3764 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry): </B>Mr. Speaker, as 
the hon. member knows very well I believe, we have just 
received a draft of a comprehensive business plan for MIL 
Davie. Our officials are presently reviewing this plan and, when 
a decision is made with the stockholder who has the greatest 
share of responsibility for MIL Davie, we may have an 
opportunity to give it some advice on the company. We are 
perfectly aware of the major role of this company in the Quebec 
City region.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> My question 
is for the Prime Minister. Mr. Speaker, does the Prime Minister 
not agree that the very fact the Minister of Finance is incapable 
of answering this question in the House clearly shows the 
difficulty he has carrying out his functions as minister 
responsible for regional development in Quebec, given he is 
incapable of intervening in favour of MIL Davie in cabinet, 
while his colleagues from Transport and Public works will be 
able to defend without any restrictions the interests of shipyards 
in the Maritimes?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is very clear to me that in the case of the prairies the file is the 
responsibility of the Minister of Transport. We are following 
and I am following personally this file.
<P>
	I believe the interests of everyone concerned are very well 
protected. The mandate that has been given to the Minister of 
Finance does not mean he is responsible for the Minister of 
Transport. We have a very good Minister of Transport who is 
looking into this need and what is required for transportation. 
He has to look at all the alternatives and the costs and the 
decision will be made in due course.
<P>
	In the case of the chantiers maritimes, we have ministers 
responsible. The office that is under the responsibility of the 
Minister of Finance has nothing to do with MIL-Davie or 
transportation or defence. It has to do with small and medium 
sized businesses. The minister is doing an excellent job helping 
them.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> No, it was not to watch the hockey game.

their T4s and T5s. Frankly, today there are lot of teed-off 
Canadians out there.

<P>
	Every year Canadians spend countless millions of dollars on 
accountants and lawyers to have their income tax returns 
prepared. The 2,091 page Income Tax Act is an unmitigated 
mess of rules and regulations and is screaming for reform, as are 
many Canadians.
<P>
	When will the Prime Minister instruct his ministers and 
mandarins to simplify the income tax system to reflect equity, 
efficiency and effectiveness and thereby reduce the tax burden 
on Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is very evident that the hon. member of Parliament read the red 
book.

supply motion will be on this very subject. I hope the Prime 
Minister takes the time to listen to some of the comments by 
members of this House.
<P>
	Currently tax freedom day is July 7. That is how long 
Canadians have to work to pay their share of the costs of this 
government's red book plan.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister, when can Canadians expect to pay 
less in taxes in a current year than they did the year before?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians will be in that position the minute all Canadians who 
want to work find jobs. That is the best way to reduce the tax 
burden. However when 11.6 per cent of the people are 
unemployed such as the situation we faced when we were 
elected, we asked how we could rectify that.
<P>
	The easy answer is to have programs that will create jobs. 
However, I note every time we want to have a program to create 
jobs the Reform Party is opposed to it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, the income tax 
system is so complicated that the revenue department is the 
largest employer in the public service with over 35,000 
employees at a cost of $1.8 billion. That is a workforce larger 
than the town of Shawinigan.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister, has the government calculated how 
many billions of dollars it could save in government 
administration costs and how much individual taxpayers could 
save in tax preparation charges by introducing a fair and 
integrated system of taxation?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that is why we have committees of the House of Commons 
looking into that. The Minister of Finance is looking into it all 
the time also.

<P>
	I noted in the debate on the budget and when there was a 
rumour something might be changed that very often the Reform

many changes.
<P>
	We are trying to change the GST and replace it with a fair 
system of taxation. I am very confident the committee will come 
out with a report next month so that the Minister of Finance will 
be in a position to study the recommendations of the House of 
Commons. This is a very complex system that people want to get 
rid of. I know the Reform Party wants to keep the very complex 
system of GST. One of the statements made by the leader of that

Secretary-General. Could the Minister for Foreign Affairs 
indicate whether Canada intends to support this proposal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, it is clear that the slaughter which continues in Rwanda 
cannot be tolerated by countries that have had development aid 
programs in Rwanda.
<P>
	Canada is among those countries who are trying, within the 
United Nations or the Organization for African Unity, to find 
ways to make these factions who are killing each other today see 
reason.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	I can inform the hon. member that preliminary talks which 
took place at the United Nations have not been successful, and 
that is why we feel that perhaps another forum, the OAU for 
instance, might be in a better position to start a conciliation 
process and persuade the parties to stop killing each other. Any 
proposals to that effect will certainly be supported by Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
considering the increasing number of Rwandan refugees who 
are fleeing the civil war and 30 years of close ties between 
Quebec and Rwanda, does the minister intend to increase the 
humanitarian aid he announced previously?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, as the hon. member is aware, the Canadian 
International Development Agency has donated $1 million for 
emergency aid, and we have also donated $2 million to the 
International Red Cross to help save lives and help the wounded 
in that country. It is not much, considering the extent of the 
slaughter. Canada, in co-operation with other countries, is 
trying to determine what kind of humanitarian aid should be sent 
immediately.
<P>
	Obviously, as long as the fighting and the carnage continues, 
it is extremely difficult to bring in humanitarian aid and ensure 
it reaches those who need it. Nevertheless, Canada and other 
countries will continue to look for ways to go and help these 
people who have been left to fend for themselves.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	The minister is on record as stating that he fundamentally 
disagrees with the proposition that there is a crisis in confidence 
in the Canadian system of justice. He has also stated he thinks 
the justice system works well and that it is fundamentally sound. 
Today it is reported that the minister has been selective in the 
use of his statistics to back up these claims.
<P>
	Does the minister truly believe that a 61 per cent increase in 
violent crimes over the past 10 years does not constitute a crisis 
in Canada's criminal justice system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me say first that I do not 
think any useful purpose is served by a protracted debate about 
the numbers. The fact is any amount of crime in Canada is too 
much. The justice system could always be improved and we are 
working hard to achieve that.
<P>
	On the subject of the numbers and the statistics, let me point 
out to the hon. member that the statistics reported today in one 
of the newspapers on this very subject involve numbers going 
back to 1962. While that is interesting what is perhaps of more 
relevance to today's purpose are the more recent statistics.
<P>
	Since 1977, in the last 16 years during which numbers have 
been kept, homicides are up only 4 per cent. Those are the 
statistical facts from the same source referred to in the 
newspaper this morning.
<P>
	Reference is made to violent crime. However in many of those 
statistics if you look behind the initial number, violence often 
includes such things as schoolyard shoving and slapping by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3766"> 3766 </A></B>
<P>
young offenders, behaviours which were not charged in the days 
before the statute but now are and form part of the statistics.
<P>
	I say to the hon. member that any amount of crime is too 
much. I insist that we keep this issue in perspective and I repeat 
that the justice system on the whole is in very good shape.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is also reported that since the death penalty was 
last used in 1962, and granted it is a figure used in 1962, the 
murder rate in Canada has more than doubled.
<P>
	Is the minister going to attempt to convince Canadians there is 
no crisis in the justice system by using selective statistics? Or is 
the government prepared to introduce the necessary legislation 
to ensure the protection of society?
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have dealt with the point 
about the statistics. The more recent numbers over the last 16 
years are far more reliable and meaningful. Let us put aside the 
question of numbers and get to the root of this issue.
<P>
	I know the hon. member and I are of the same mind on one 
issue. That is that we have to improve the justice system in order 
to diminish crimes of serious violence. We have to do that by 
making the laws more effective and by attacking the underlying 
causes of crime.
<P>
	I know as we introduce measures in the weeks ahead on those 
subjects in this House that we can count upon the hon. member 
and her party to support us in that cause.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Opposition is mounting to the adjustment strategy for Atlantic 
fishermen. According to a report in today's newspaper, a 
spokesperson for Newfoundland fishery workers has rejected 
the minister's proposal which would have each fishery worker 
sign an individual contract committing him or her to undergoing 
training or doing community work in exchange for benefits.
<P>
	Will the minister concede that his proposal for individual 
contracts is being roundly criticized and has raised some 
legitimate concerns and consequently, is he prepared to 
negotiate collective agreements with the unions, as is being 
recommended to him by the spokesperson for the fishery 
workers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, first let me point out that the 
comments or quotes used by the hon. member are not exactly 
what the head of the fishermen's union has said. He said they had 
some questions about the nature of it.
<P>
	I would like to point out to the hon. member there are already 
a number of programs that we offer in which there is an 
agreement about participation by the person who takes a benefit 
from human resources. For example on the question of training, 
one is expected to have certain obligations on their side.
<P>
	We are trying to apply a principle of mutual responsibility in 
this area. This subject was extensively discussed with members 
of the fishermen's union beginning last February. They had 
plenty of opportunity to conduct and to exchange points of view 
on this matter. In fact, during the course of those discussions 
there was no objection raised.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
morning's newspaper quotes the spokesperson as saying:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``We don't sign individual agreements; we sign collective 
agreements''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Surely the minister has read these comments.
<P>
	Will the minister not agree that, after going over the heads of 
the provinces, it would, at the very least, be in his best interests 
to secure the co-operation of the unions representing fishery 
workers and will he undertake, therefore, to meet with the 
unions before proceeding to sign any individual contracts?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me first point out to the hon. 
member that this agreement we arrived at in the Atlantic 
fisheries did not go over the heads of the provinces. It was 
extensively discussed with each province involved and they 
were in agreement with the program. That is a fact.
<P>
	Second, we discussed all these matters with the unions. Every 
union was involved in extensive consultations. When the 
minister of fisheries and I announced the program we said if 
there were any problems or concerns with the evolution of the 
agreement we would be glad to sit down with them and work 
those problems out.
<P>

what went on. The fact is that this program is based on very

question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The latest media report suggests that President Clinton has 
now publicly taken the side of the American farmers in the 
durum wheat dispute. Given that the United States' own 
international trade commission has scoffed at the unsupported 
allegations of unfair Canadian trade practices, will the Prime 
Minister personally contact President Clinton? Will he ask him 
to rise above domestic politics and take a leadership role in the 
interest of free trade?
<P>
<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> I did that a 
week ago with President Clinton, so the question is a bit late.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplemental.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister outline for the House what steps he is 
going to personally take to assure that this trade war does not 
spread and threaten to become a full fledged trade war 
world-wide?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have done what is possible to be done.
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture has strongly made the point since 
January to his U.S. counterpart. The Minister for International 
Trade did that with his counterpart as well. I mentioned the 
matter two or three times to President Clinton. We hope that 
reason will prevail. We are selling wheat there because wheat 
produced by Canadian farmers in many instances is better.
<P>
	Senator Bradley for example argued last week that it was not a 
good move for them to try to stop our durum wheat. He 
recognized that durum wheat produced in Canada is much better 
for making pasta. I was pleased to see an American senator use 
the argument I made a month ago.

<P>
	The city of Montreal is planning a project named Futuropolis, 
which would be located in the technopark. The first phase of this 
project could require investments of up to $225 million within 
the next three years and attract some 200 companies involved 
with information highway technologies. The SODIM, the 
agency responsible for industrial development in Montreal, is 
committed to investing $200,000 in a feasibility study, provided 
the federal and Quebec do the same.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Industry, responsible for the information 
highway, intend to give a favourable answer to the city of 
Montreal regarding the financing of a feasibility study on the 
Futuropolis project?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
would be glad to receive and study a proposal from the city of 
Montreal. Up to now, our commitment to finance the 
information highway has been limited to supporting the 
CANARIE project establishing networks across Canada to form 
the basis of the electronic highway.
<P>
	Moreover, as the member knows, we are in the process of 
drafting regulations regarding the electronic highway.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
seems somewhat caught off guard by this project; he should 
make inquiries on Futuropolis, a project which could certainly 
allow Montreal and Quebec companies to take advantage of 
potential spin-offs and could even become a major element of 
the information highway development.

	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice and concerns the 
extradition of Michael Lawrence Drake.
<P>
	In March 1992, Drake was charged with molesting a two and a 
half-year old girl in Washington. While awaiting trial, Drake 
jumped bail and fled to Canada. In June 1992, an American court 
found Drake guilty of sexual assault in absentia. Last week, 
Drake was released on bail by Canadian officials pending an 
extradition hearing before the B.C. Supreme Court.
<P>
	Why did Canadian officials release Drake into the community 
when he has already been convicted of sexual abuse of a child 
and when he has already proven his willingness to jump bail in 
the United States?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> These questions that are posed many times are 
so specific that I do not know that all ministers or any ministers 
can have a complete grasp of specific cases. Perhaps there would 
be another venue where the member could get that information. 
However, I will permit the Minister of Justice to address himself 
to this case generally, if he has the information.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the issue is now one of 
extradition as the hon. member has said.
<P>
	As such, it will first go to the court with respect to the issue of 
a warrant of committal and then eventually it will come to me, if 
that is the process followed. It is open to the person in question 
to apply to the Minister of Justice eventually no matter what the 
outcome of the court proceeding. If the person is committed then 
the minister can intervene under the statute.
<P>
	I do not propose to comment on the substance or the merits of 
the extradition procedure. The member's question goes to the 
issue of detention and the person being in the community during 
the pending of the proceeding. I will be happy to make inquiries 
about what happened with respect to that matter and respond 
factually to the member when I get that information.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
really appreciate the forthrightness of the answer of the 
minister. It is indeed the matter of detaining an individual who 
was convicted this way and puts into jeopardy the young 
children in our communities.
<P>
	I really urge the minister to answer this question. When will 
we stop hiding behind the law and put the protection of children 
first?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is indeed a much more 
general question.
<P>
	Let me say that in all cases where people are accused of 
serious crime, including sexual interference with children, it is a 
question for the court in accordance with the bail provisions in 
the code whether such persons are released pending trial, and 
indeed following trial, pending sentence or an appeal from 
sentence.
<P>
	All I can say to the hon. member is that I am confident that 
crown attorneys across the country exercise their judgment 
responsibly and that courts in each case consider the safety of 
the community in determining whether bail should be granted 
either in the event of trial or afterward.

growers to immediately stop the dumping of U.S. apples into 
Canada. As usual the government talks a good game but also as 
usual nothing concrete comes of it. The best the government has 
come up with is for the growers to start anti-dumping action 
through the Canadian International Trade Tribunal which will 
take at least five months before damage is halted. These growers 
are being hurt by this dumping today.
<P>
	Will the minister take action now to stop this destruction of 
the apple industry in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
	I have met with representatives of the apple growers on two 
occasions, not just the apple growers in British Columbia but 
elsewhere in the country. The member failed to point out that the 
reason we face this problem is because the Canadian apple 
growers lost a case earlier. The result of this is that they must 
now show actual damage before we can again take up the case 
and come to what we hope will be a successful conclusion.
<P>
	It is important for the member and the House to recognize that 
to rush in before we have adequate facts to prove our case, 
having lost the first case, would be extremely unwise. Therefore 
we are working with the apple growers to develop the best 
possible case so that the next time we go forward we will not in 
fact lose as we have before.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of National Revenue will recall that at a 
recent Chamber of Commerce meeting in Penticton he 
expressed concerns for the apple producers of Canada. He will 
also recall that he stated that once proof of damage was supplied 
to his department, immediate action would take place. I remind 
the minister that that information was supplied early in April by 
the fruit growers.
<P>
	Can the minister please tell this House today when Canadians 
will see his government take action?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr.

premise. I and all members of this government are very

particularly apple growers, faced with the American 
competition that is flooding across the border. He is also correct 
in stating that we will proceed as soon as we believe we have a 
case that can be won.
<P>

Canadian voters.
<P>
	Now that the Charlottetown accord outcome has been 
reinforced by these results will the government save tax dollars 
and drop its appeal of the gag law?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am replying as government House leader.
<P>
	This issue is an important one and because it is important I 
think it deserves to be tested in the courts.
<P>
	I understand the hon. member's concerns. I will review this 
matter with the Minister of Justice but I continue to believe 
there is an important issue to be dealt with.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, this has 
already been tested in one court but the important question is has 
the government estimated the cost to taxpayers involved in this 
appeal and if so will it table these figures?
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will ask the Minister of Justice to look into that.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member and other members of this House to 
consider the cost to the Canadian economy and to the Canadian 
population generally if it is possible for wealthy groups to 
influence the election unduly and not be under the same kinds of 
constraints as political parties. This is an issue that deserves to 
be considered.
<P>
	I do not know why the hon. member does not want to have that 
done if he is concerned about democracy in this country.

	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
during the budget speech the Minister of Finance said the

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, earlier, you 
handed down a ruling which I accept and respect and which we 
will abide by in the future, but I would appreciate some 
additional explanations.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. I reread all the exchanges which 
took place, and my decision was reached after spending an entire 
weekend considering the issue.
<P>
	If the hon. member would like further information, first of all, 
I would ask him to read my ruling, and if he has any questions he 
would like to ask me in my chambers or perhaps would like to 
ask the Clerk, he is welcome to do so, but the point has been 
made and the Chair's decision stands.
<P>
	Is this the only point the hon. member wishes to make?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not my intention 
to question your ruling. Not at all. I simply said first of all that 
we respected this ruling, but it will lead to your making another 
decision, and that is what I wanted to say, if you are prepared to 
entertain the following question.
<P>
	You said in your ruling, which we accept, that a minister could 
answer only on a subject related to his jurisdiction. You added 
that the minister should not answer questions which do not 
relate to his jurisdiction.
<P>
	I would appreciate it if you would analyse the implications of 
the following. If your ruling is respected from now on by 
everyone in this House, does that mean that when we question a 
minister within his field of competence while referring to a 
statement made by one of his colleagues, does that mean that the 
colleague who is quoted will not have the right to answer the 
question?
<P>
	In other words, for practical purposes, if I cannot ask a 
minister about a statement he made concerning the Department 
of Finance and he does not have the right to reply, does this mean 
that if I put my question to the Minister of Finance on a 
statement made by his colleague, the minister who is quoted 
would not have the right to rise in the House and the Minister of 
Finance would have to answer my question? That is what I 
would like to know, because there are implications for the ruling 
you just made, because usually, if we quote a minister's 
colleague, often the colleague will rise to justify what he said. 
Now you said in your ruling that he does not have the right to do 
that.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order! Hon. members can put questions to the 
Speaker at any time, but these are hypothetical questions. If 
there is anything arising from what we discuss here in 
Parliament, and if a member, any member, has any questions 
about what happened in the House, I would be glad to provide 
some answers. However, if they are hypothetical questions, I 
think the Chair should consider whether an answer is necessary. 
I would like to leave this for the time being. Any other 
questions?

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-16, an act to approve, give effect to and declare valid an 
agreement between Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada 
and the Dene of Coville Lake, Déline, Fort Good Hope and Fort 
Norman and the Metis of Fort Good Hope, Fort Norman and 
Norman Wells, as represented by the Sahtu Tribal Council, and 
to make related ammendments to another Act, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Crowfoot had the 
floor before Question Period. I believe he has 15 minutes left in 
his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, continuing with 
my speech on Bill C-16, I submit that a strong, economically 
self-reliant Sahtu nation will be a benefit to all Canadians.
<P>
	This agreement also provides for a transfer of funds from the 
Canadian taxpayer amounting to $130 million over the next 15 
years. This amounts to over $8 million a year. These funds are 
apparently designated for areas such as education, training and 
heritage preservation.
<P>
	I am sure that Canadians would support this transfer of tax 
dollars for these purposes as well as the allocation of the land 
involved. However, I do not believe that the Canadian people 
will support these articles of the agreement unless there is a 
clear indication that the financial dependency on the taxpayer 
will end some time in the future.
<P>
	This agreement provides no such assurance. In fact, it is clear 
from the agreement that the Sahtu's right to receive benefits 
from existing or future aboriginal programs will continue, 
therefore continuing the dependency which this government 
contends will be extinguished by this agreement. This defeats 
the purpose of the agreement itself.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	In this connection I would like to comment on an article in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I>. According to a March 29, 1994 report the 
federal government has spent more than $50 million on 
self-government negotiations with native groups over the past 
seven years, yet it has produced only one agreement. About 400 
native communities have entered self-government talks but 
most have abandoned the process because it is long, 
bureaucratic, limited and legalistic.
<P>
	According to the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, this was the finding of a 
federal audit. The audit apparently described a host of 
weaknesses in the federal policy for negotiating 
self-government deals at the community level and concluded 
that the process is long, cumbersome and expensive.
<P>
	Federal payments to native groups for the negotiations 
jumped by 500 per cent since the process began in the 1986-87 
fiscal year. The department of Indian affairs has given $30 
million to aboriginal groups for the talks and has spent a further 
$20 million on internal operating costs.
<P>
	The department has spent $50 million creating a cottage 
industry around these negotiations, where lawyers and political 
leaders are the only ones who benefit while the deplorable living 
conditions of the individual aboriginal person has not changed 
as a result of the expenditure of these funds.
<P>
	I suggest the weaknesses evident in the Sahtu agreement are a 
reflection of the flawed negotiation process identified by the 
federal audit. The interests of the Canadian taxpayer are not 
protected in the agreement.
<P>
	Within the agreement the means exist by which the Sahtu 
nation can continue to demand that the federal government tax 
the wealth of Canadians for their use, in spite of the enormous 
land mass assigned to these people, the significant resource 
royalties agreed to and the multimillion dollar cash settlement 
provided.
<P>
	This is neither fair to the Sahtu nation nor the Canadian 
taxpayer. It is unfair to the taxpayer because there is no end to 
the financial support demanded and unfair to the Sahtu people 
because it does not end their dependency on the Canadian 
taxpayer and therefore is not a formula for self-reliance.
<P>
	A final area of concern to many Canadians is that this 
agreement creates entitlements and rights based on race and 
ethnic origin and will be as racist a document as is the Indian 
Act. The agreement will create special status for the Sahtu 
nation based on race and destroys the principle of equality of 
citizenship in that all Canadians ought to stand equal before the 
law.
<P>
	This does not bode well for the future unity of our country. I 
believe the intolerable conditions faced by aboriginal people is 
due to the fact that for many years they did not have equal rights 
in Canada. They were discriminated against at all levels of 
society. Their language, religion and culture were suppressed. 
Job opportunities were non-existent for the majority of 
aboriginal people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3773"> 3773 </A></B>
<P>
	In order to correct the situation we must ensure they stand 
equal before the law. If we grant them special status, harmony 
and unity will not be the result.
<P>
	While the rest of the world, including South Africa, is 
bringing the barriers down between races and ethnic groups, we 
are in the process of erecting them through agreements such as 
this. We saw it in the Meech Lake accord, the Charlottetown 
accord and we are seeing it again in this agreement. People are 
being granted special rights and privileges based on race and 
ethnic origin.
<P>
	These rights and privileges are being paid for by the Canadian 
taxpayer. The formula cannot succeed in a multicultural society 
such as Canada. We must ensure that all Canadians stand equal 
before the law regardless of race, language, culture or religion.
<P>
	This may be the greatest failing of the Sahtu agreement. It 
grants special rights based on race and ethnic origin and in doing 
so destroys the principle of equality of citizenship in Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Members should know that we have 
now passed the five hour point in the debate, so we now go to 10 
minutes speeches and no questions or comments, starting with 
the member who is about to be recognized. The hon. member for 
Peace River.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I live in one 
of those large northern ridings where there are many reserves 
and Metis settlements.
<P>
	I am very concerned about the precedent the government is 
setting with this overly generous settlement. I support the 
concept of self-sufficiency and self-reliance inherent in the 
successful land claim settlement process. In no way do I argue 
with the principle.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	However I encourage the government to dismantle the 
department of Indian affairs and let the people involved conduct 
their own affairs. This approach develops responsibility and 
places decision-making in the hands of those most directly 
involved.
<P>
	Let us deal with the magnitude of the settlement. Seventeen 
hundred and fifty-five people will be receiving a financial 
package of $130 million, including interest. The land being 
handed over is equivalent to eight square miles per person.
<P>
	I will put this into perspective. When my forefathers came to 
Canada in 1869, over 100 years ago, they received 210 acres of 
farmland in the Muskoka Lakes area for a family of nine people. 
By comparison each person, not each family, receives a 
settlement of 5,120 acres. With this kind of generosity I do not 
think there is any doubt how these 1,755 people will be voting in 
the future.
<P>
	My own farm operation in northwestern Alberta, one that my 
wife and I have built up over 30 years, involves 1,280 acres, two 
sections of farmland. Compare this to eight sections per person 
in the settlement. I know a lot  of farmers who would not mind 
finding out that their land was being claimed as a settlement and 
getting a payout under this generous rate.
<P>
	Let us not forget that the original treaty agreement called for 
each person to receive just 120 acres, about 5,000 acres less than 
is now being proposed.
<P>
	In addition to the more than generous settlement of land and 
money, the people involved will still enjoy their aboriginal 
status and still have access to all present and future aboriginal 
programs, as well as access to resource development.
<P>
	My colleagues have spoken about the very great potential for 
resource development in the area. The agreement allows the 
Sahtu to have shared resource revenue resulting from 
development, something which most Canadians do not enjoy.
<P>
	In conclusion, it is clear that the government is setting a very 
bad precedent, one it will be pressured into meeting in future 
claims. We all know a lot of land claim settlements need to be 
resolved in the future. I think this one is a very bad precedent 
indeed. It comes at a time when our country is staggering under a 
burdensome debt. We cannot afford this kind of settlement.
<P>
	I suggest we send the bill back to the drawing board. The 
government can do better. It must do better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to oppose the rubber stamping of this massive, 
open-ended and precedent setting agreement with the people of 
the Great Bear Lake in the Northwest Territories called the 
Sahtu Dene and Metis comprehensive land claim agreement.
<P>
	First let me state that I am strongly in favour of prompt 
settlement of native land claims, as well as encouragement 
toward self-government on a tribe by tribe basis.
<P>
	Why then would I oppose Bill C-16? It is for the following 
reasons. First, because the agreement is a blank cheque, a 
giveaway, of non-renewable natural resources plus resource 
royalties which belong to all the people of Canada.
<P>
	Second, instead of simply protecting aboriginal rights and 
providing a municipal type ownership of major settlement areas, 
this is a massive transfer of land in fee simple ownership to a 
very tiny percentage of our national population.
<P>
	Third, it is a complex, open-ended agreement with a number 
of provisions no sensible person should sign regarding his own 
personal affairs, let alone the affairs of the nation.
<P>
	Regarding resources, the sparsely settled basin of the 
Mackenzie River today largely remains a unexplored and 
underdeveloped treasure trove. Although an oil glutted Canada 
turned down the Mackenzie Valley pipeline in 1977 and passed a 
10-year moratorium, future developments and future needs of a 
resource starved nation may yet see us looking toward this 
region as a  major transportation corridor, with the addition to 
tugs, freight barges and native fishing boats plying a river whose 
volume of fresh water is surpassed in Canada only by the St. 
Lawrence.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3774"> 3774 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	The Mackenzie basin's largely unknown mineral resources 
nevertheless have inspired the mining rushes of Yellowknife, 
the Great Bear Lake and the Canol project for oil and gas.
<P>
	Government policies today are seriously injuring a once 
mighty mining industry, but a wiser future government might 
once again see thousands of jobs in resource development in the 
Mackenzie basin whose already known riches include 
Yellowknife's gold and possibly diamonds, Uranium City and 
Echo Bay's uranium, the tungsten of Flat River and Faro's lead 
and zinc, in addition to the petroleum of Norman Wells and the 
Athabasca tar sands.
<P>
	As a miner and prospector, I challenge the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development and the Minister of Natural 
Resources to tell the people of Canada how many millions of 
dollars in non-renewable resource wealth this agreement gives 
away forever by ceding mineral rights to 1,800 square 
kilometres of a mineral rich Mackenzie basin to the 982 adults 
and 773 children of the Sahtu Dene and Metis.
<P>
	In addition to 15 annual cash payments of between $3.8 
million and $9.6 million in 1990 dollars; in addition to a 
percentage of oil and gas royalties received by the government 
within the settlement area and including the Norman Wells oil 
field operated by Esso; these two ministers are prepared to hand 
the 982 adults and 733 children a blank cheque for mineral 
resources.
<P>
	I would be intrigued to learn when in aboriginal history oil 
and gas and other mineral exploration development became an 
aboriginal right.
<P>
	My second objection to Bill C-16 is that the agreement takes 
away from common ownership by all the people of Canada, an 
area larger than the combined land mass of Vancouver Island 
plus the Fraser Valley plus the Okanagan Valley where I live and 
hand this entire area over in fee simple ownership once again to 
982 adults and 733 children.
<P>
	As I stated, I am strongly in favour of settling native land 
claims promptly and encouraging our aboriginal people to move 
toward self-government on a tribe by tribe basis. I would have 
no objection to an agreement recognizing special rights of the 
Sahtu Dene and Metis to such renewable resources as hunting 
and fishing as carried on in native communities prior to colonial 
contact.
<P>
	I might even see myself agreeing as part of self-government 
for these people a municipal type ownership being vested in the 
appropriate bands regarding their major settlement areas of Fort 
Good Hope, Colville Lake, Deline, Fort Norman and Norman 
Wells.
<P>
	However according to a brief prepared by Melvin Smith, 
Q.C.: ``No court in Canada of which I am aware, has decided that 
an aboriginal interest in land goes so far as to entitle aboriginal 
people to fee simple or full ownership''.
<P>
	My colleagues and I in the Reform Party on behalf of all the 
people of Canada are opposed to settling native land claims by 
handing over the fee simple ownership of massive chunks of 
land. We believe it would be far more appropriate for this House, 
as guardians of the rights of all Canadians, including 
generations yet unborn, to give native people special rights to 
hunting and fishing and to guarantee native people special 
representation on all governmental bodies having jurisdiction 
over water use and land use in land claim areas. It is more than 
excessive. We believe it is foolhardy and contravenes the right 
to equality of treatment for all citizens of this enormous country 
to hand over so much land in fee simple ownership.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Moving on to my third point, I see this agreement as having 
many serious flaws. For example there is a map accompanying 
this agreement which gives the impression that a certain specific 
piece of land has been decided upon. This is simply not true.
<P>
	Appendix C to the agreement goes into some detail to describe 
the process for land selection which allows the Sahtu Tribal 
Council and the government to pursue the process of land 
identification and selection. In other words, this bill is asking 
Parliament to endorse giving away a huge tract of land which has 
not yet been specifically defined.
<P>
	Pages 119 and 120 of the agreement are similarly 
open-ended. Section 26.4 merely appoints a working group to 
consider and make recommendations regarding a list of heritage 
places and sites. Also page 120 is blank, except for this note: 
``Sahtu Dene and Metis sacred sites. To be completed by 
parties''.
<P>
	Can signing this open-ended agreement be considered proper 
guardianship? Can signing this agreement be considered careful 
stewardship of a land which belongs today to our grandchildren? 
I say no.
<P>
	Another aspect of this agreement which I find troubling is the 
multiplication of quasi-governmental boards. For example it 
will create renewable resource councils for each community. It 
will also create boards for renewable resources, for land use 
planning, for surface rights, for reviewing environmental im-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3775"> 3775 </A></B>
<P>
pact as well as land and water boards. Of course, there is an 
arbitration board.
<P>
	I an told this government plans to introduce later in 1994 the 
Mackenzie River resource management act. This will spawn 
even more boards and panels to co-ordinate all those other 
boards and councils and panels and to regulate land and water 
uses that cross the settlement areas.
<P>
	In view of the fact there are only 982 adults in the Sahtu Dene 
and Metis, one might be forgiven for wondering who will be left 
to carry on the traditional native pursuits of hunting, fishing and 
trapping when they are going to have so many councils and 
boards and panels to sit on?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member's time with the 
10-minute limit has expired. I wonder if he wishes to seek 
unanimous consent to go on a bit longer.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent to let the member complete his 
remarks?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson</B> Mr. Speaker, unfortunately the answer is that 
probably a significant part of the cash payment going to these 
natives supposedly for their good will be used to hire white 
lawyers and social workers and negotiators and other greedy 
hangers-on of the so-called Indian industry to deal with this 
agreement's miles of red tape.
<P>
	Finally, in regard to future self-government for these people, 
this agreement provides a framework of sorts in appendix B. But 
it also says that in case of disputes this agreement takes 
precedence over future self-government agreements.
<P>
	Also, according to the Indian affairs minister, it takes 
precedence over other federal, territorial and municipal laws as 
stated in <I>Hansard</I> on April 25. I believe it is wrong to set a 
precedent whereby any native land claim agreement should be 
allowed to trample all existing federal, territorial or provincial 
laws and municipal laws in the land claim area.
<P>
	In conclusion, I wish to extend my personal best wishes to the 
Sahtu Dene and Metis people in their efforts to obtain a prompt, 
just settlement of their land claims. I can see that many people 
have spent many hours and much effort on this agreement, but I 
strongly object to some of its basic principles.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
participating in this debate today as this House examines the 
wisdom of supporting Bill C-16, the Sahtu land claim 
agreement, I have been fortunate in having the benefit of hearing 
the many thoughtful, sincere and well-informed arguments 
made by members from all parties. I would like to acknowledge 
their contribution to this debate and thank them for it. Their 
perspectives have been a great help to Canadians in weighing 
this initiative, the Sahtu land claim agreement.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	It is always difficult to express any reservations about such an 
initiative. As we have seen already in this debate to do so brings 
down swift charges of lack of compassion, fairness and 
generosity.
<P>
	I doubt if any representative of the people of Canada cares to 
be depicted in such harsh terms. However, someone surely has 
the duty and obligation to weigh agreements such as this in a 
thoughtful and reasoned way, especially since the well-being of 
the people directly affected, the people represented by the Sahtu 
Tribal Council, is an issue. In addition the interests of all 
Canadians, the 27 million people whose welfare is entrusted to 
the 295 representatives chosen to sit in this Chamber must also 
be weighed and considered.
<P>
	It is plain to see that many of Canada's native peoples live in 
social and economic conditions that are appalling in a country 
with the third highest standard of living in the entire world. 
There has been a little verbal sparring about whether these 
individuals would now be enjoying a pastoral existence of 
self-sufficiency if they had been left as the sole inhabitants of 
this vast land that we know and love as Canada.
<P>
	The present reality is that Canada is home to more than 27 
million people from many other lands due to a policy of 
immigration that has been maintained by Canadian governments 
from the very first one to this present one. The process of 
immigration will not be reversed. Our duty therefore is to make 
decisions on behalf of all Canadians that are good and right and 
just and in light of current and foreseeable future realities.
<P>
	For decades Canada's decision makers have attempted to 
ensure that the needs and aspirations of Canadians of native 
origin are met and looked after by the creation of a huge 
bureaucracy costing in excess of $10 billion each year. That is 
over $10,000 per capita for Canada's 997,000 aboriginals. 
Unfortunately very little of this money actually reaches the 
individuals for whom it was intended. Instead, it is used to fuel 
an ever growing bureaucracy.
<P>
	It is painfully evident this multiplication of tax funded 
bureaucrats, advisors, consultants, lawyers, studies, programs, 
grants and politicians has done little to assist the plight of the 
vast majority of native peoples. Instead, a deplorable state of 
dependency, surrender of initiative and erosion of pride and 
values has resulted.
<P>
	Does the agreement before us resolutely and energetically 
redress this ineffective approach of the past? No, not at all. 
Instead, it leaves in place the approaches that have allowed the 
present state of affairs and then incredibly adds to them with yet 
more boards and councils.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3776"> 3776 </A></B>
<P>
	Will self-esteem and initiative be restored to the Sahtu people 
through receiving a windfall of thousands of dollars to each 
individual? There is no provision, no process put in place that 
would permit this newly acquired purchasing power to be used 
to hold the Sahtu's own leaders and advisors accountable to 
them. I strongly recommend that this element of democratic 
accountability be considered an essential dynamic in the coming 
self-government negotiations.
<P>
	Further, the agreement is silent on any obligation for the 
Sahtu to be subject to the federal laws of Canada, including the 
charter. This requirement surely ought to have been made 
explicit in the section dealing with the provision for negotiation 
of self-government agreements.
<P>
	The biggest concern raised by this agreement is the precedent 
it sets. It is not difficult to show expansive generosity with land 
that few Canadians will ever need or use when the number of 
people compensated is minuscule, less than 2,000.
<P>
	What happens when the same process affects a land base that 
is directly vital to the personal and economic interests of not 
only a significant number of Canadians but to municipal and 
provincial governments as well? How will the Government of 
Canada then be able to offer the same level of land and cash to 
significantly larger numbers of native people? If it cannot, will 
it be able to justify to those claimants a different level of 
compensation and settlement? Have these fundamental issues of 
fairness and equity been thought through?
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Since everything awarded to one group must be paid for from 
the resources and work of the rest, this is a question which also 
will affect the interests of all of us as the claims process 
proceeds with other native groups across the country. This is 
especially so because, as others have also pointed out, the 
settlement awarded here does not extinguish or even diminish 
the huge cost of existing programs extended to native peoples.
<P>
	I would like to say that the federal government ought to be 
praised for many aspects of this proposal. It recognizes the need 
to move expeditiously to resolve such claims. A resolution of 
this nature is long overdue in fairness to native Canadians and 
for certainty to all. The cost of such settlements increases 
dramatically when there is delay in reaching agreement.
<P>
	We would also applaud the fact that the people affected were 
directly consulted and their approval obtained prior to 
proceeding with this agreement. There is also a healthy element 
of self-determination in the proposed arrangement when it 
comes to resources and land use. I believe Canadians would 
support that especially if it could lead to self-sufficiency and 
placed the Sahtu on the same level of contribution to the 
country's well-being as other Canadians.
<P>
	I also believe that so long as all Canadians are subject to the 
same federal laws and charter, an accommodation of community 
customs and values at the local judicial level will benefit the 
administration of justice in the region.
<P>
	In short, there is much that is positive in this agreement. 
However I believe this government needs to accept the many 
expressions of concern about the specifics of the agreement and 
consider them in the constructive spirit in which such criticisms 
are intended.
<P>
	The deficiencies in the agreement ought to be rectified and 
addressed before the bill is passed in this House.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (for the Minister of the 
Environment)</B> moved that Bill C-23, an act to implement a 
convention for the protection of migratory birds in Canada and 
the United States, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as part of its plan to modernize Canada's wildlife 
legislation, the federal government has brought forward this day 
amendments to the Migratory Birds Convention Act.
<P>
	In 1916 Canada and the United States signed the migratory 
birds convention to protect species of migratory birds common 
to both countries. Bird populations were declining rapidly at the 
turn of the century and in 1917, Parliament implemented the 
convention by passing the Migratory Birds Convention Act 
which regulated the hunting and use of migratory birds and 
prohibited their trafficking and commercialization.
<P>
	The legislation also provided for the establishment of 
migratory bird sanctuaries. Today there are a total of 101 
migratory bird sanctuaries in Canada covering roughly 11.3 
million hectares of land.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There have been only minor amendments to the act since 
1917. It has become suddenly outdated. It no longer provides 
our migratory birds with the protection they need. 
Seventy-seven years in the continental management of 
migratory birds have taught us some important lessons. It is 
time to put these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3777"> 3777 </A></B>
<P>
lessons to work and to modernize the legislation through early 
action on the bill.
<P>
	The government's amendments to the act will update the 
definitions in the act. It will make them appropriate for 
migratory bird protection as we enter the 21st century. The act's 
prohibitions will be clarified.
<P>
	The provisions of the act are being modernized, particularly 
with regard to administration and enforcement, because the old 
act no longer provides effective means or penalties to deter law 
breakers. This is especially true with regard to poaching and 
with regard to illegal commercial uses of migratory birds.
<P>
	As is pointed out in the global convention on biological 
diversity which Canada signed, a strong and effective legislative 
program is an important part of any strategy to conserve and 
protect our natural resources.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Poaching is a serious crime. By killing protected migratory 
birds, poachers destroy a wildlife heritage common to all 
Canadians and to all inhabitants of countries which share, 
benefit from and depend on these birds. Amendments to the 
legislation call for increasing possible fines to a maximum of 
$25,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, 
or both. Provision is also made for additional fines in an amount 
equal to the monetary benefits accrued as a result of the 
commission of the offence. Furthermore, under the proposed 
amendments, the courts would be able to make sentencing 
orders directed at the lawbreaker. The courts would be given 
increased authority to deal with lawbreakers. Provision is also 
made by issuing tickets.
<P>
	Moreover, amendments provide for harsher treatment for 
illegal commercial transactions such as the sale of products, the 
sale of companion birds and the illegal organized hunting of 
large numbers of birds. Fines for illegal commercial 
transactions would correspond to the nature of the offence and 
could include the seizure of weapons, vehicles, boats, aircraft 
and even companies used by the guilty parties in the commission 
of the offence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Updating the Migratory Birds Convention Act will help 
ensure that populations of birds are maintained at sustainable 
levels. Amendments to the act were developed only after 
extensive consultations with affected interested parties, 
including the provinces and territories, the aboriginal groups, 
conservation groups and other non-government organizations, 
hunters and ordinary citizens. The proposed changes have been 
requested by all provinces and territories and by many interested 
groups.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	The federal government carries out its responsibilities for 
migratory birds through a strong partnership with the provinces 
and territories. Provincial and territorial wildlife agencies assist 
in migratory bird enforcement. Various types of protected areas 
form one network for havens for migrating wildlife, whether 
they sanctuaries be federal, provincial or territorial in 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	These amendments will strengthen that partnership even 
further. For example, with the agreement of the provinces and 
territories, designation of conservation officers for the purposes 
of enforcing the Migratory Birds Convention Act will be made 
easier. Any seizures of illegally obtained wildlife could be sold 
with the proceeds going to the provinces, the territories or the 
federal government as appropriate.
<P>
	The amendments will help us become better and more 
effective stewards of our migratory bird sanctuaries as part of an 
overall concept of flexible landscape and ecosystem 
management. For example, at certain times of the year, such as 
the breeding season, quite strict protection measures might be 
called for, perhaps to prevent beach goers from walking on 
plovers' eggs. At other times of the year uses may be more 
flexible. Good law, good enforcement and good management 
can help us sustain our ecosystems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Set in the broader perspective of both the Migratory Birds 
Convention Act and the convention it implements, this is one of 
the safeguards concerning one aspect in a series of global or 
hemisphere-wide partnerships to protect birds and other 
wildlife as well as their habitats.
<P>
	These partnerships take the form of land conservation 
programs like the Canadian Wildlife Service Latin American 
Program in which Canada and its Latin American neighbours 
join together to preserve the southern habitats of our common 
visitors. They also include the Biodiversity Convention, a 
global instrument as I indicated earlier.
<P>
	This spinoff from the UNCED recognizes the value of wildlife 
and its habitat for the world. And this value stems from the fact 
that fauna and flora are part of a natural heritage without 
compare, represent a major socioeconomic resource and play a 
growing role as a general health status indicator for increasingly 
stressed ecosystems. Gulls and cormorants are valuable for 
instance to show the level of environmental disruption in the 
Great Lakes and St. Lawrence region.
<P>
	We must not forget the important contribution to our economy 
made by activities related to fish, fauna and flora. As a matter of 
fact, Statistics Canada indicated that Canadians and American 
tourists have spent, in 1991 alone, $1.4 billion on recreation 
activities involving water birds. Not only has spending in that 
area helped maintain over 30,000 jobs, but it has generated close 
to $1 billion in personal income and $743 million in federal and 
provincial tax revenues.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3778"> 3778 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to stress that only very minor changes were made 
to the Migratory Birds Convention Act. We must therefore 
proceed as quickly as possible with these amendments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The provisions of the act are being modernized particularly 
with regard to administration and enforcement because the old 
act no longer provides the effective means of penalties to deter 
law breakers.  This is especially true with regard to poaching 
and illegal commercial uses of migratory birds. As pointed out 
in the global convention on biological diversity which Canada 
has signed, a strong and effective legislative program is a key 
part of any strategy to conserve and protect natural resources.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Therefore the government's amendments to the act will 
update definitions in the act. It will make them appropriate for 
migratory bird protection as we enter the 21st century. The act's 
prohibition will be clarified.
<P>
	I urge all members of the House, regardless of political party, 
to support the bill very strongly. It represents a big step forward 
in our common goal toward sustainable development.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I hope that all the hon. members of this House will strongly 
support this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
assistant critic for the environment and sustainable 
development, it is a pleasure for me to speak on Bill C-23.
<P>
	This bill seeks to modernize and update a law dating back to 
1917. To understand it better, I think that we have to go back a 
little into our history and look at the situation at the turn of the 
century. In the early 1900s, there was considerable exploitation 
of migratory birds and trade in them. As a result, their numbers 
dropped drastically. The need to intervene to end this illicit 
trade and to protect the species was increasingly urgent.
<P>
	In 1916, Canada and the United States signed the Migratory 
Birds Convention. The next year, in 1917, Parliament passed the 
Migratory Birds Convention Act. The provisions of this Act 
seek to regulate the hunting of migratory birds and to prevent 
traffic and trade in them.
<P>
	Through permits, this law controls the use made of migratory 
birds. Several aspects of the 1917 law are obsolete today. For 
example, the penalties provided in the Act are no longer what 
society is entitled to expect. Fines from $10 to $300 are 
provided for infractions. Bill C-23 as presented today increases 
these penalties very significantly.
<P>
	Amounts of up to $5,000 and even $25,000 provided in clause 
13(1) will deter poachers, we hope. The evolution of our society 
and the example of penalties alone show the importance of 
updating and modernizing this law, of strengthening the 
enforcement rules and clarifying the procedures.
<P>
	For us in the Bloc Quebecois, several aspects of this law are of 
great interest. As I said in the introduction to my speech, it was 
very necessary to update the legislation. In particular, we hope 
to add that not only birds, their eggs and nests are protected but 
also their embryos and tissue cultures.
<P>
	We think that this provision is essential; given the evolution 
of biotechnology and the amazing possibilities that exist or will 
exist in this regard, this provision is most desirable. Clearly, 
however, such a scientific achievement was unimaginable in 
1917 and the law could not include such a clause.
<P>
	According to various environmental groups, millions of wild 
birds are illegally captured, poisoned or driven from their nests 
throughout the world. Therefore it is appropriate for us to 
legislate in this way in view of this phenomenon.
<P>
	We learned in the <I>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</I> last January and in 
<I>La Presse</I> that 1,000 of 9,600 bird species were in danger of 
extinction; that is, more than 10 per cent of our birds could 
disappear very soon. We agree that the situation is urgent.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	An article in the March 24 issue of <I>La Presse</I> contained some 
comments on the seriousness of the situation. The author 
showed that 70 per cent of existing species in the world are in 
decline. According to one study he quotes, the illegal trade in 
wild birds is a growing threat to the species, especially in 
Southeast Asia.
<P>
	<I>World Watch</I>, an American magazine, gives some of the 
reasons why the number of birds is decreasing in Canada and 
throughout the world, and I quote: ``Most bird species are in 
decline because the natural balance is upset by the global 
expansion of mankind''.
<P>
	Of course, the problems caused by deforestation due to 
farmland expansion or urban spread, industrial and domestic 
pollution are but a few of the factors contributing to the 
declining number of birds in Canada and throughout the world. 
In North America alone, deforestation may have caused the 
alarming reduction in bird population in 250 species breeding on 
its territory.
<P>
	As I said earlier, we must speak up on the illegal trade in birds. 
According to a study by the World Wide Fund for Nature, this 
lucrative trade is growing by leaps and bounds. In the last 20 
years, 2,600 species have been identified among those traded. 
This commercial activity is flourishing in Southeast Asia. To the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3779"> 3779 </A></B>
<P>
five million birds traded each year must be added an estimated 
three million in China.
<P>
	We are in a position to realize that this kind of trade affects 
much more than our two countries. We are legislating on a 
bilateral Canada-U.S. solution but we must also see the problem 
as a whole.
<P>
	Serious allegations have led us to consider this problem from 
an international standpoint. Some airlines will not transport 
wild birds. That is fine. However, the article from the WWF 
goes on to say: ``Singapore proclaimed itself the hub of this 
trade for the whole region''. Because of loopholes in the 
legislation, wild birds illegally exported from Indonesia, 
Thailand or Malaysia become legal goods when they go through 
Singapore.
<P>
	You might say we are a long way from our bill on migratory 
birds in Canada and in the United States, but we are not. 
Environmental problems such as acid rain, the ozone layer, 
dangerous goods and many others know no boundaries. And the 
impact here of these various problems require us to take a stand.
<P>
	Clearly, Bill C-23 is a positive measure in this context. We 
cannot oppose a good initiative. However, the international 
scope of the problem probably requires a worldwide approach as 
well.
<P>
	It is because problems related to the ozone layer have such an 
international dimension that the Montreal Protocol was signed 
with several countries. The issue of importing and exporting 
dangerous goods could not be solved with a national piece of 
legislation. Again, several sovereign states had to agree on 
regulations concerning the exchange and transportation of such 
goods. Canada could be the leader in this field and set, through 
an international convention, standards which would provide 
some protection to this species.
<P>
	I will conclude by reaffirming my support to Bill C-23, but I 
also want to remind you of some proposed legal principles for 
environmental protection and sustainable development, which 
are approved by Canada.
<P>
	Article two of these principles provides that: ``States shall 
conserve and use the environment and natural resources for the 
benefit of present and future generations''. Article three says: 
``States shall maintain ecosystems and ecological processes 
essential for the functioning of the biosphere, shall preserve 
biological diversity, and shall observe the principle of optimum 
sustainable yield in the use of living natural resources and 
ecosystems''.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	In article 8, we see that the States shall co-operate in good 
faith with other States in implementing the preceding rights and 
obligations.
<P>
	These are only 3 of the 22 principles for environmental 
protection, as found in the Brundtland report entitled <I>Our 
Common Future</I>.
<P>
	I would urge the Canadian government to look forward when 
it deals with environmental protection and sustainable 
development, but to keep in mind all the agreements already 
signed. In this case, we have no other choice but to protect the 
migratory birds. However, we should be careful in doing so not 
to impinge on other jurisdictions. Too often, our legislation 
grants too much discretionary power to the minister, who can 
choose to enforce only parts of the law. We do not think this is 
the case with this bill. That is why my party and I want the bill to 
be referred to a committee who will seek to improve it.
<P>
	Together, let us protect the endangered species.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> I am very pleased today to 
stand and say that the Reform Party is in support of Bill C-23 at 
second reading. It is an act to protect migratory birds. Of course, 
we think of birds and wildlife together.
<P>
	I have the good fortune of coming from a very wonderful 
constituency. Of course all members in the House say that, but 
my constituency is so wonderful that it happens to contain three 
of Canada's national parks. My riding has Kootenay National 
Park, Yoho National Park and Glacier National Park, which 
gives you an idea of the grandeur of the area I represent.
<P>
	In addition, we also have an area called the Columbia River 
wetlands. The Columbia River wetlands are 180 kilometres 
long. They are comprised of a 26,000 hectare flood plain. I 
would like to read a short section from a brochure by B.C. 
Wildlife with respect to the Columbia River's hydrological 
cycle.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The habitats within the Columbia River flood plain provide food, shelter and 
cover for an exceptionally large number of birds and mammals. Waterfowl 
comprising the most abundant and observable species group utilize the 
wetlands for breeding and brood rearing, for refuge during the flightless 
periods of the moult, and for feeding and resting during spring and fall 
migrations. Single counts have revealed more than 15,000 ducks in the autumn, 
more than 1,000 whistling swans in the spring.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I should say that I also have the good fortune of living just 
south of this area. I have seen these whistling swans in the lake 
in front of my home. They are absolutely beautiful birds.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The rare trumpeter swan also appears in migration. Breeding Canada geese 
number some 1,200 pairs. Other birds sharing the wetlands are loons, gulls, 
terns, rails, bitterns, hawks, bald eagles, ospreys and 100 or so species of 
songbirds. Colonies of great blue herons comprising some 300 pairs constitute 
the second largest concentration in western Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3780"> 3780 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Up to 90 per cent of the elk, 70 per cent of the white tail deer and 15 per cent of the 
moose in the upper Columbia basin depend on these wetlands for their survival.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This gives us an idea of how magnificent and pristine this area 
is. Therefore I have a personal vested interest in Bill C-23.
<P>
	At the conclusion of what I just read I mentioned the fact that 
there are also big game. We actually have about 25 per cent of 
the hunting in British Columbia for big game within my 
Kootenay East constituency.
<P>
	I should mention it is not just an environmental issue although 
that is important enough, but it is also an economic issue. We 
have guide outfitters, taxidermists, sports shops, camera stores, 
saddle and outdoor equipment makers. In addition there are 
campgrounds, restaurants, motels, gas stations, automobile 
dealers, tire shops, grocery stores. All benefit from these 
wildlife resources, particularly during the fall hunting season 
when business would otherwise be slow.
<P>
	We happen to be on one of the three western flyways. 
Depending on what happens with respect to the amount of water 
on the prairies, we may have up to tens of thousands of birds 
migrating overhead in the fall and again in the spring. It is 
indeed an absolutely magnificent area.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	The major reason I stand in support of Bill C-23 is because it 
is the foundation and cornerstone of being able to co-ordinate 
the regulators and the regulation.
<P>
	Members should know that the British Columbia conservation 
data centre which is a section of the wildlife branch of the 
Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks in British Columbia 
has an exhaustive list of birds that are actually protected within 
our area. There are the western grebe, the bald eagle, peregrine 
falcon, sharp tailed grouse and long billed curlew. I could go and 
on with the number of birds that we are very, very proud of in our 
area.
<P>
	I can report there is a tremendous level of co-operation 
between the regulators and the industrial users in my 
constituency. All of the forest companies are working in 
co-operation with the B.C. fish and wildlife branch. They are 
involved in doing cut blocks in co-ordination with that branch. 
In some cases they are taking as little as 30 per cent of the 
standing timber to come up with a particular kind of 
configuration for certain birds or animals. In other instances 
they are doing other things.
<P>
	Often when thinking of the word environmentalist, speaking 
for myself I think of placards, protests, arrests, or civil 
disobedience. If we really want to see environmentalists 
anywhere in Canada, we should turn up at the rod and gun 
organizations in our constituencies. These are people who are 
going out of their way, putting their own blood, sweat, tears and 
money into preserving and improving the environment. In 
preparing for this presentation I took time to speak to four such 
groups.
<P>
	One was the Kimberley Wildlife and Wilderness Club. It 
pointed out that with respect to migratory birds the biggest 
single item that has worked against them has been the inclusion 
of hydro power. I must admit I had always been a great fan of 
hydro power up until the time I started to look at this. The impact 
hydro power has had on migratory birds has been singularly 
devastating.
<P>
	I mentioned blood, sweat and tears. The Golden and District 
Rod and Gun Club notes it has a gander lander. A gander lander 
is simply a manmade place where the geese can land, so it is 
called a gander lander. Over the past 15 years the Golden Rod 
and Gun Club has been involved in constructing between 100 
and 105 gander landers. Five or six times during the winter 
months members go out and spend the whole day upkeeping and 
maintaining those.
<P>
	In addition I spoke to members of the Elkford Rod and Gun 
Club. One of their concerns was with respect to snags. These are 
tall dead trees which are required for nesting for certain kinds of 
birds. I am happy to report that although a lot of them have been 
destroyed in logging operations for the protection of the people 
who are actually doing the logging, the B.C. forest service has 
just implemented a snag program. It is going out to the bush and 
identifying these snags and is taking steps to leave them 
standing so that they can be nesting places for birds. This is done 
in such a way that it is a safe process under workers 
compensation.
<P>
	Members of the Sparwood and District Fish and Wildlife 
Association had two issues of concern. One issue of concern 
which I am sure all Canadians share is that whatever we are 
doing with Bill C-23 or any other bill, because this has the 
potential of overlapping on native issues, we take some time and 
see how those things relate.
<P>
	The final thing they pointed out, which may come as a 
surprise to some people, is that they are actually having a 
population explosion of grizzly bears. There is an area down in 
the far southeast corner of my constituency, in the bottom corner 
of British Columbia, that is a remote area with a certain amount 
of logging and basically there are very few humans in that 
particular concentration. As a result the grizzlies have actually 
reached a point at which they may become a problem.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	These rod and gun club members are law-abiding citizens. 
They are committed to the wildlife, they are committed to the 
environment. Something that I do not understand, because I am 
not a hunter, is that they are also committed to hunting. Last 
time I looked hunters used guns.
<P>
	These people as law-abiding citizens believe in safe storage. 
These people as law-abiding citizens follow all of the rules for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3781"> 3781 </A></B>
<P>
responsible use. These people expect me and other people in this 
House to stand up against the imposition of certain city values 
that seem to be pushing them into a corner.
<P>
	Unfortunately the imposition of city values may come from 
the fact that many birds arrive in the city dead, packaged and in 
freezers and there is no recognition of what went into that dead 
bird arriving in the freezer, much less the enjoyment that these 
people have in a responsible way of enjoying hunting during the 
fall season.
<P>
	We support Bill C-23 because it supports the migratory bird 
protection and finally we support it because it reflects the values 
of responsible, active, participating environmentalists, 
law-abiding Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the 
outset let me congratulate the parliamentary secretary, the 
member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, for his opening 
remarks and for having set the tone for this debate and also for 
having ensured that there will be a thorough examination at the 
committee level so as to provide for consultation with interested 
Canadians.
<P>
	Also I would like to congratulate the member for Terrebonne 
and the member for Kootenay East for having put forward such 
interesting observations that will certainly add to the quality of 
the examination and also because they give life to what 
otherwise would seem a rather stultified and bureaucratic piece 
of legislation. It is not stultified. It is not a dull and uninteresting 
piece of legislation.
<P>
	On the contrary, I would argue that this is a very important 
piece of legislation being introduced by this new government 
today in the House mainly for three reasons. One, it is important 
because the movement of migratory birds has enormous 
significance for our farmers, for the role that birds play in the 
ecological balance and in maintaining a control of insects in the 
open agricultural environment. That role of course is well 
known but it is never underlined and highlighted enough.
<P>
	Second, to the urban dwellers the arrival and departure of 
migratory birds and their staying in Canada during the good 
season is a source of enormous pleasure. That pleasure is not 
limited to bird watchers. It is a well known shared interest that 
Canadians have for the presence of this magnificent species.
<P>
	Third, the fact that our literature and our heritage are based on 
the presence of migratory birds is witnessed alone by the fact 
that we have found it over the decades desirable to produce 
banknotes and coins reproducing some of the better known 
migratory birds in Canada.
<P>
	For all these reasons it is quite safe to assume that deep down 
in the subconscious of the Canadian psyche there is a 
tremendous attachment to wildlife and therefore the migration 
of birds means more than just what that poor term conveys. It is 
an attitude toward nature. It is an attitude toward wildlife and 
essential pleasure is derived from it which cannot be easily 
described with plain words as I am attempting to do today.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	For these three reasons I would say we are debating here in 
this House a piece of legislation that is significant for us and can 
have very significant repercussions for future generations of 
Canadians as other speakers have already highlighted, in 
particular the members for Terrebonne and Kootenay East.
<P>
	This bill will allow for the creation of sanctuaries. It will 
ensure the management of areas important for the protection of 
migratory birds. It is important to note that at the present time 
we have in Canada some 101 bird sanctuaries protecting roughly 
11 million hectares which are covered for that purpose.
<P>
	If we look at the new act it is intended to broaden the 
definition of migratory birds. This is important because it will 
include sperm, embryos and tissue cultures. This is intended as a 
protective measure against development in biotechnology 
which may take place in future years. It is a very good clause 
that is proactive and of particular value.
<P>
	Under this bill regulatory authorities will be established. One 
can only say that on the whole this bill is most laudable and very 
well prepared.
<P>
	The contentious parts, however, that could be discussed and 
raised today relate, as is usually the case with these kind of bills, 
to fines and enforcement. Very briefly, I would like to draw 
attention to the fines which under the present legislation, before 
this bill comes into force, are a mere $10 to a maximum of $300. 
They are only levied upon summary conviction. Evidently there 
is here a vacuum that must be filled and we must say that this 
legislation is long overdue.
<P>
	In the proposed bill the maximum fine will be $5,000 for 
summary conviction offences and up to $25,000 for indictable 
offences.
<P>
	The question is are these fines really sufficient? I am sure 
there are a variety of views on this in reply to this question. In 
other words, is $5,000 adequate to deter someone from harming, 
killing or possessing and illegally trading protected species?
<P>
	From the comments made by the member for Terrebonne I 
would be inclined to conclude that this fine is not enough, that 
the legislators should give the judge sufficiently broad range of 
fines and let the judge decide how strong the fine should be. 
However, the penalty should be as strong as it can conceivably 
be because it will also serve a purpose not just this year and next 
year but probably 10 or 20 years from now when this legislation 
is likely to be amended, but we do not know for sure. Therefore 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3782"> 3782 </A></B>
<P>
the question of fines is one that raises a number of interesting 
questions.
<P>
	The same can be said about enforcement. Enforcement 
officers will be appointed under this legislation. Their powers 
will be more consistent with other federal and provincial 
conservation legislation. Subsection 13 addresses this particular 
aspect of enforcement.
<P>
	The question is whether a person who commits or continues to 
commit an offence for more than one day should be penalized or 
whether a limitation of one day is one that ought not to be 
deleted so that there is no reduction in the offence that is 
contemplated by the judge.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	I would be inclined to think the enforcement section needs a 
good examination by the committee to make it stronger. It is true 
that the amendments will become strong deterrents to those who 
would traffic in wildlife. There is no doubt that they read very 
well. We have to make sure that there is enough strength in the 
Canadian Wildlife Service and in the provincial affiliated 
departments to carry out what is in the legislation.
<P>
	Therefore I must bring to members' attention a statement 
made recently by the Animal Alliance of Canada in which a 
recommendation is made to stop the continued erosion of the 
numbers of wildlife enforcement officers, that the current 
vacancies of five enforcement people be filled and the 
remainder of 29 person-years be completed to bring the 
enforcement officers to a level that was promised in 1991, which 
is just above 30.
<P>
	One must wonder whether in a country as large as Canada with 
such a large federal jurisdiction it is realistic to expect an 
enforcement of this important legislation with only 30 
enforcement officers or thereabouts. Evidently the answer is no 
and evidently we will have to address this very important 
question.
<P>
	Resources must be allocated to enforcement. These 30 or so 
positions must be increased, otherwise Canada is running the 
risk of not being able to meet its obligations under this 
legislation, under the Cites legislation as well as the Wild 
Animal and Plant Protection and Regulation of International and 
Interprovincial Trade Act. That is quite a lengthy title for that 
matter.
<P>
	There are a number of questions that ought to be put on record 
on second reading. I would simply reduce them to the following.
<P>
	Is there sufficient power provided by this bill so that the 
present minister and future ministers can undertake all the 
necessary action to ensure the protection of migratory birds?
<P>
	Is the scope of this convention broad enough now that Canada 
has entered into NAFTA? Should initiatives not be launched at 
the political level as well as at the technical level to broaden the 
scope of the Migratory Convention Act so as to include Mexico 
and both Central and South America since as well we all know 
the movement of birds does not respect boundaries?
<P>
	This convention is binding only on North America. If the 
scope of the convention is not broadened, a number of species 
could be in danger in the years ahead.
<P>
	Many of our Canadian species do straddle two continents. We 
have to understand that all wildlife is really world wildlife, not 
just limited to Canada. Our ability to enjoy the presence of 
migratory birds in Canada depends also on the ability of 
protecting the species in those regions of the world where they 
spend their winter.
<P>
	Therefore, the Canadian songbirds as we know and appreciate 
them depend on the rainforests of Central and South America. 
This is a political message that we have to carry to the 
international fora to ensure that this convention is broadened to 
its largest possible scope. Otherwise Canada will have a very 
limited chance to improve the survival of the species in the 
decades ahead.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	We are debating today not just what would be the reality of the 
nineties but most likely the reality of the first half of the next 
century since this kind of bill does not reach the floor of the 
House of Commons that frequently.
<P>
	In conclusion I would say that the changes proposed to the act 
are essential. They are very desirable. They are timely. We must 
work together to ensure there is a co-ordinated effort to achieve 
the protection of migratory birds.
<P>
	We must ensure that the fines are a very strong deterrent. We 
must do our best to find ways to ensure the enforcement of the 
proposed act is carried out in every area of the federal 
jurisdiction at least. I suppose there could be excellent 
co-operation between provincial and federal services. We must 
ensure that the powers to create new sanctuaries are 
implemented and that the existing sanctuaries continue to be 
protected.
<P>
	Finally, as I just mentioned and before I sit down, I would 
really make a plea to the Minister of the Environment to 
consider taking an initiative personally to ensure the scope of 
the convention is enlarged to include all the Americas and to 
provide the necessary protection in decades ahead.
<P>

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38, I wish 
to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the

electronic highway.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak in support of the bill to amend the Migratory 
Birds Conventions Act. I commend my colleagues on both sides 
of the House for their sensitivity and support of the bill. In 
particular I support my colleague from Davenport who has 
examined the bill carefully and has put forward some very 
sincere concerns.
<P>
	Along with the Canada Wildlife Act, this act urgently needs 
updating to come into line with current environmental 
legislation in both Canada and the United States. Many 
provisions of the act as it now stands are ineffective or are 
simply not in harmony with related federal, provincial or 
territorial legislation.
<P>
	Today I would like to focus on how the bill will affect one 
particular group that is following the updating process very 
closely, and that is Canada's First Nations. In fact the bill now 
before the House is only one of three initiatives in this area 
having particular importance for First Nations. The other two 
are the effort to amend the Canada-U.S. migratory birds 
convention of 1916 and the implementation of an interim policy 
on enforcement, especially the provisions on water fowl 
harvesting by aboriginal people.
<P>
	The 1916 convention is a binational agreement governing the 
conservation of migratory birds in Canada and the United 
States. In our country the Migratory Birds Convention Act is the 
enabling legislation for the implementation of that agreement.
<P>
	Regulations under the act control the hunting of migratory 
game birds during certain periods of the year. They also 
establish closed seasons to protect breeding, nesting, brooding 
and moulting birds at other times of the year.
<P>
	These and other provisions complement measures taken by 
the United States, the provinces and territories, wildlife groups, 
the private sector and individuals to conserve this valuable 
wildlife heritage.
<P>
	In many cases the different authorities and sectors have 
worked in close co-operation toward that common goal. One 
outstanding example of such a partnership is the North 
American water fowl management plan.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	In some areas of Canada, especially the north, migratory birds 
have traditionally been an important food source for aboriginal 
peoples. First Nations continue to rely heavily on this source at 
different times of the year. In certain cases activities that are 
protected by aboriginal rights are not covered by the provisions 
of the Migratory Birds Conventions Act. For example, the 
hunting by natives of migratory birds during the closed season 
from March 10 to August 31 or the collection of eggs. Of course 
aboriginal people also hunt birds during open seasons. Hunting 
migratory birds does more than provide food to First Nations. 
Traditional hunting  activities have a great significance in 
aboriginal culture. Preserving that culture means preserving 
Canada's wildlife resources.
<P>
	In its present form the migratory birds convention fails to 
provide for closed season harvest and egg collection by 
aboriginal people. That omission can be rectified only by 
amending the convention itself, a step that requires negotiation 
between the United States and Canada. As I mentioned we are 
seeking to initiate the necessary negotiations. They should take 
place later this year.
<P>
	First Nations take a significant proportion of the migratory 
birds hunted in Canada. The latest estimates suggest that 
aboriginal people harvest between 250,000 and 750,000 ducks 
and roughly 350,000 geese each year. For ducks that represents 
13 per cent of the Canadian harvest and 6 per cent of the total 
North American harvest. For geese the figure represents 32 per 
cent of the Canadian harvest and 12 per cent of the total North 
American harvest. Geese constitute a major food source for 
some aboriginal communities, notably along the Ontario and 
Quebec coasts of James Bay.
<P>
	Given the magnitude of the annual harvest and our desire to 
safeguard the subsistence harvesting needs of First Nations we 
must work in co-operation with aboriginal communities. We 
need new partnerships to achieve the shared goals of 
conservation and management of ducks and geese.
<P>
	An amended convention will promote such partnerships, 
particularly in the form of co-management agreements, 
self-government agreements and the wildlife management 
provisions of comprehensive claims agreements.
<P>
	Already co-management with aboriginal people is being 
implemented for the conservation of caribou, polar bear and 
other species. The approach is generating the needed data on 
harvest which can serve as a basis for agreement on harvest 
objectives. We wish to build on this success in our future efforts 
to amend the convention.
<P>
	Earlier at workshops organized through Canada 
representatives from government, aboriginal communities, 
wildlife groups and others discussed options for closed season 
harvesting. These consultations provided valuable guidance for 
the coming negotiations with the United States on amending the 
migratory birds convention to allow for hunting and egg 
collection by natives.
<P>
	Of course the amendments to the convention and to Canada's 
legislation and regulations must respect aboriginal and treaty 
rights to hunt migratory birds. To ensure that they do, thorough 
consultation is a must. That is how we will achieve the best 
possible provisions for addressing aboriginal concerns.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3784"> 3784 </A></B>
<P>
	Consultations are now under way on such changes to the 
convention with the full participation of aboriginal 
organizations, the provinces and territories, and environmental 
and conservation groups. It will not happen overnight, but 
discussions to this date have been encouraging. What is more, 
Canada and the United States are now working on convergent 
tracks as we prepare for formal negotiations.
<P>
	Among the changes now under consideration by hon. 
members to the Migratory Birds Convention Act, one provision 
concerns the procedure for amending the convention itself. The 
bill before the House will allow the schedule to the act setting 
out the convention to be amended by order. The change will 
ensure that Canada can promptly fulfil its obligations to the 
United States, the convention and all those affected by an 
amended convention, in particular aboriginal peoples.
<P>
	Until such time as the convention is amended an interim 
enforcement policy governs our application of the Migratory 
Birds Convention Act and the Canada Wildlife Act in the areas 
of closed season hunting and egg collection by aboriginal 
people. This policy gives top priority to conservation. It will 
remain in effect until after passage of the bills modernizing the 
two acts and until the convention itself is amended.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	The interim enforcement policy also stresses consultation and 
co-operation, two very important elements in any effort to build 
partnership for conservation with the First Nations.
<P>
	There are pressing reasons for proceeding with the present 
amendments to the Migratory Birds Convention Act. It requires 
time to lay the groundwork for amending the migratory birds 
convention so that it takes into account the needs of aboriginal 
peoples.
<P>
	While we continue to do that, however, we must safeguard the 
resources themselves. We must ensure that they are used 
sustainably. To do this Canada must act at once to update its 
wildlife and migratory bird legislation, strengthening 
enforcement and modernizing administration.
<P>
	Any delay could jeopardize Canada's ability to ensure 
sustainable population levels for migratory birds and other 
wildlife. Let us consider the need to deal with the illegal 
commercial sales of murres and other migratory birds. That is 
only one reason we cannot afford to postpone these 
amendments.
<P>
	For the benefit of Canadian wildlife Canada must proceed 
with the updating of the Migratory Birds Convention Act and its 
companion, the Canada Wildlife Act. At the same time we must 
continue extensive consultations with aboriginal people to meet 
their needs and concerns. The proposed amendments to both acts 
will in no way prejudice the outcome of these broader 
initiatives.
<P>
	Canada's wildlife needs protection and it needs it now. That is 
why the government has introduced the bill now before the 
House to amend the Migratory Birds Convention Act, and that is 
why the bill deserves swift passage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to help hon. members in considering the bill now 
before the House allow me to offer some background on 
migratory birds and Canada's efforts to protect and conserve 
them.
<P>
	The Migratory Birds Convention Act provides protection for 
over 400 species of migratory birds in Canada. Among them are 
water fowl, sea birds, shore birds and song birds. In all it is a 
remarkably wide variety.
<P>
	Environment Canada's Canadian Wildlife Service works to 
ensure that all species of migratory birds will continue to 
survive and benefit future generations of Canadians. 
Safeguarding migratory birds requires many different measures 
because the birds themselves have such varied habitats and ways 
of life.
<P>
	In every case, however, there are the same basic components 
to the strategy pursued by the wildlife service. It monitors bird 
populations. It informs Canadians about the status of birds and 
their habitats. It co-ordinates multi-party efforts to preserve 
habitats. It establishes and enforces regulations to curtail the 
abuse of birds.
<P>
	In some cases research is needed to understand how human 
activity affects the chances for birds to survive. Sometimes 
special plans have to be made for the recovery of endangered 
bird species. The wildlife service deals with these needs as 
required.
<P>
	In every case a broad ecosystem approach is essential 
involving many stakeholders. That approach is central to the 
work performed by the Canadian Wildlife Service.
<P>
	The issues demanding attention are highly diverse. For 
example, tree harvesting may affect migratory song birds. 
Pesticide runoff from farms may harm water fowl. Commercial 
fishing nets may trap and drown sea birds. Spills of oil and other 
harmful substances may jeopardize entire sea bird colonies.
<P>
	One crucial step that must be taken is to identify critical 
habitat for migratory birds not only in Canada but throughout 
their flyways. In this instance many of Canada's migratory birds 
winter in Latin America and the habitats must be protected. With 
this in mind the Canadian Wildlife Service has established a 
Latin American program to further Canada's interest in 
migratory birds wintering south of the U.S.-Mexico border. The 
program seeks to identify the needs of migratory birds so that 
they can be included in conservation planning.
<P>
	To this end it relies heavily on co-operation with other 
countries and international organizations. That co-operation 
must be seen in the memorandum of understanding between the 
Canadian Wildlife Service  and the American and Mexican 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3785"> 3785 </A></B>
<P>
wildlife agencies to conserve migratory birds and their habitats 
in Mexico.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	The service has also helped established international 
initiatives. One of these is these is the international waterfowl 
census of the International Waterfowl and Wetlands Research 
Bureau. Another such initiative is the Western Hemisphere 
Shorebird Reserve Network. The network's objective is to 
identify and protect critical areas for the migration of 
shorebirds. Under this initiative the Wildlife Service has worked 
with countries throughout South America to develop an atlas of 
coastal shore bird habitats.
<P>
	Here in Canada two hemispheric shorebird reserves have so 
far been identified, both of them in the upper Bay of Fundy. 
These have been twinned with three wetland sites in Suriname 
designated as hemispheric shorebird reserves in 1989. Work is 
proceeding to identify other important sites in Canada and to 
secure their designation and protection under the network.
<P>
	Game bird species present a special challenge. They are an 
important recreational resource, translating into significant 
economic activity. At the same time we must see that this 
resource does not depreciate. In other words, we must ensure 
that it is used in a sustainable manner.
<P>
	Canada manages migratory game bird species through an 
annual regulatory process for monitoring and controlling 
hunting. Associated with this process are population surveys. A 
hallmark of the process is consultation, in particular with the 
provinces and territories and with the American government 
agencies.
<P>
	The Canadian Wildlife Services follows a two pronged 
approach in managing game bird species. One component of that 
approach is regulation and compliance; the other is habitat 
enhancement. Both efforts draw heavily on national and 
international input. Within Canada there is a notable 
contribution from the provinces and territories and increasingly 
from co-operative wildlife management boards involving 
aboriginal groups.
<P>
	Internationally Canada works with the flyway councils set up 
to manage the birds according to their natural migratory 
pathways. We also work with the North American Waterfowl 
Management Plan Committee.
<P>
	To support the consultations of developing game bird 
regulations, status reports are prepared. These publicly 
available documents give information on game bird populations 
and explain proposed changes to the regulations. The status 
reports are distributed to many Canadian and American 
organizations with an interest in migratory game bird 
conservation and with reports these organizations are in a 
position to influence the development of regulations.
<P>
	The Wildlife Service also publishes an annual newsletter 
entitled ``Bird Trends''. This deals with the population status of 
Canadian birds. A top priority of the Wildlife Service is 
promoting public awareness about migratory bird issues. This is 
the first step toward fostering the volunteer networks on which 
the service relies for data collection.
<P>
	Together with the Canadian Nature Federation the service 
sponsors Birdquest, a public information and education project 
on migratory birds. Birdquest encourages a basic understanding 
of the ecology of a bird, populations, and it does this by teaching 
participants about bird identification, bird study and bird 
conservation.
<P>
	Those who successfully pass through Birdquest qualify to join 
one of the service's volunteer based programs. These play a key 
part in supporting migratory bird conservation initiatives and 
they help the service identify problems and implement 
solutions.
<P>
	More important, the Birdquest program encourages 
Canadians to become actively involved in initiatives that 
contribute to migratory bird conservation. One of the most 
notable initiatives to protect migratory birds is the North 
American waterfowl management plan. This unique 
undertaking offers a forum for international agreement on a 
broad range of waterfowl management issues. It also provides 
the focus for action to enhance waterfowl habitat.
<P>
	Under this co-operative agreement a series of joint ventures 
are targeting species inhabited areas of special concern.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	In Canada the aims are to secure important waterfowl habitats 
throughout the country, to address the serious decline in western 
waterfowl populations, to initiate the collection of long-term 
survey data for eastern duck populations and to delineate and 
monitor the distinct breeding populations of Arctic nesting 
geese.
<P>
	The north American waterfowl management plan brings 
together Canada, the United States and Mexico. It is a formal 
representation from Canadian provinces and territories as well 
as American states. Among its key contributors are the federal 
government, departments in Canada and the United States alike. 
It also involves many non-government organizations.
<P>
	We can find broad co-operation in most of the activities of the 
Canadian Wildlife Service. With the United States the service 
works to conserve migrant songbirds through a program called 
Partners in Flight. With the aboriginal people, the service joins 
in co-operative wildlife management boards. With Canada's 
leading environmental non-governmental organizations, the 
service has a long history of joint projects.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3786"> 3786 </A></B>
<P>
	Above all, with the provinces and territories, the service 
works to ensure the enforcement of the Migratory Bird 
Convention Act and to preserve ecosystems as habitats for 
wildlife and to tackle the problems of endangered species.
<P>
	These are efforts that directly benefit all Canadians. Through 
the amendments to the Migratory Bird Convention Act it will be 
possible to reinforce these efforts and for that reason I support 
the passage of this bill. I urge all hon. members to do the same.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as a strong advocate of wildlife conservation I am pleased to 
speak in support of this bill to amend the Canada Wildlife Act.
<P>
	Wildlife has a special place in our country. It is part of a 
heritage we all value. In the north many Canadians still earn 
their living by wildlife harvesting. Throughout the country 
wildlife related activity is a cherished form of recreation for an 
overwhelming majority of people.
<P>
	Our challenge is to see that this heritage is passed on to future 
generations of Canadians. At the moment I am regrettably 
unsure that we will succeed.
<P>
	Wildlife populations in Canada today are under considerable 
stress. More and more species are being designated as 
endangered and some populations are experiencing declines. 
But the outlook is not entirely bleak because while the dangers 
are greater than ever before, so is the support for wildlife 
conservation and so is our understanding of what it takes to 
protect and conserve our living natural resources.
<P>
	Back in the 1970s when the Canada Wildlife Act was passed 
we thought mostly in terms of protecting individual species that 
were at risk and our efforts were limited by a failure to recognize 
the wider social and economic benefits of wildlife.
<P>
	That recognition is now becoming more common. We know 
that wildlife activities make a significant contribution to 
Canada's economy. In hard dollar and cent terms we need to 
maintain our wildlife to maintain our prosperity, our 
communities and our traditional lifestyles. That is why close to 
90 per cent of Canadians want better protection for our wildlife.
<P>
	We also have come to recognize that working with individual 
species is not necessarily the best way to conserve wildlife. 
Certainly this is justified in the case where a particular species 
faces special threats. We have realized that each species is part 
of a web of life on which it depends and which it helps sustain. 
Tear apart that web and many species may no longer be able to 
survive. Patiently mend the web and you may help save not one 
but dozens of species.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	In other words, we have understood that the most effective 
way of ensuring the health of wildlife is by ensuring the health 
of the ecosystems in which they live. No creature can long exist 
outside its accustomed habitat.  Our task, first and foremost, is 
to protect key ecosystems, to conserve essential habitat. This is 
how we can ensure that future generations of Canadians will 
enjoy the benefits of a rich wildlife heritage.
<P>
	In 1973 our predecessors in this Chamber were far-sighted 
enough to know the value of habitat protection to wildlife 
conservation and they incorporated that approach into the 
Canada Wildlife Act. The act allows the Minister of the 
Environment to acquire lands for the purpose of research, 
conservation and interpretation. Under the act, 45 national 
wildlife areas have been established in the intervening years, 
covering 287,000 hectares of territory.
<P>
	The areas are managed by the federal government in 
co-operation with provincial and territorial authorities as well 
as non-government organizations. They complement an 
extensive system of national and provincial parks and other 
protected areas which encompass much prime wildlife habitat.
<P>
	Internationally as well we have seen a growing appreciation 
of the need for an ecosystem approach to wildlife conservation. 
That is what underlines the North American waterfowl 
management plan, the Ramsar convention on the conservation 
of wetlands of international importance and, most important, 
the historic global convention on biological diversity adopted at 
the Earth Summit in 1992.
<P>
	Among other things, the 1992 global convention calls for each 
signatory nation to establish a system of protected areas as a way 
of conserving biodiversity. To meet our commitments under the 
convention Canada must now redouble its efforts on this front.
<P>
	We made a promising start in November of 1992 at the first 
joint meeting of Canada's federal, provincial and territorial 
ministers responsible for wildlife, parks and environment. The 
tri-council meeting called for development of Canadian 
biodiversity strategy. It also gave fresh impetus to the effort to 
complete Canada's network of protected areas, including areas 
representative of Canada's marine natural areas.
<P>
	That effort has been defined in different ways. At times the 
call was to set aside 12 per cent of our country's territory as 
protected areas. But more important than achieving a particular 
figure is protecting representative samples of the Canadian 
ecosystems. Inevitably that means protecting key habitat on 
which our wildlife depends.
<P>
	The bill now before the House will improve our ability to do 
that. It broadens the definition of land in the existing Canada 
Wildlife Act to include both land and marine areas alike, out to 
the 200 nautical mile limit. This wider definition will put the 
administration of the act in line with the ecosystem approach. 
Under the amended act it will be possible to establish new 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3787"> 3787 </A></B>
<P>
national wildlife areas protecting habitats where wildlife 
reproduce, as well as associated offshore areas in which they 
feed.
<P>
	The more extensive our network of national wildlife areas the 
better will be our protection for wildlife. Already this network 
covers a diverse array of landscapes and ecosystems throughout 
Canada and they support such varied activities as hiking, 
photography, bird watching, grazing or haying, and hunting, all 
in a manner compatible with the wildlife conservation 
objectives of a given area.
<P>
	Allow me to describe a few of the national wildlife areas in 
existence or shortly to be established. In New Brunswick this 
year we will see the designation of Portobello as the province's 
fifth national wildlife area. This designation will protect over 
2,000 acres of wetlands where waterfowl breed and stop on their 
annual migration as well as the Old Growth Forest where moose, 
whitetailed deer and black bear still roam.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	In Quebec, Cap-Tourmente is an area that combines 
archaeological and wildlife significance. This site of the north 
side of the St. Lawrence River was established primarily to 
protect the habitat of the world's only greater snow goose 
population but it also contains remains of prehistoric as well as 
more recent times. Here Samuel de Champlain built a dwelling 
and a stable in the early years of European colonization.
<P>
	In Ontario the Long Point national wildlife area forms a core 
of an international biosphere reserve. This fragile sand based 
ecosystem on the shore of Lake Erie contains unique habitats, 
including a significant portion of the remaining Carolinian 
forest and critical wetlands.
<P>
	In Saskatchewan Last Mountain Lake is North America's 
oldest waterfowl refuge. Parliament first set aside land here in 
1887 and this year it will be formally designated as a national 
wildlife area.
<P>
	Yukon will get its first national wildlife area in 1994 with the 
designation of Nisutlin River Delta under the Teslin Tlingit land 
claims agreement. The area will protect approximately 5,200 
hectares of inland river delta used by waterfowl as breeding 
grounds and a stopping point for their migrations.
<P>
	In particular, it will shelter the tundra swan, a species listed as 
vulnerable with only 15,000 individuals in existence throughout 
the world.
<P>
	Nisutlin is especially significant for the part being played by 
the first nations in its creation. In the Northwest Territories 
Polar Bear Pass has been the national wildlife area since 1986. It 
has also been recognized as a wetlands of international 
importance under the Ramsar convention and a significant 
biological site under the international biosphere program. This 
Arctic oasis supports some of the largest concentration of birds 
and mammals in the far north.
<P>
	In the eastern Arctic huge numbers of sea birds nest at Coburg 
Island or at Nirjutiqavvik and it provides feeding habitat for the 
beluga, the narwhal, the walrus, the polar bear and three species 
of seals. A national wildlife area will be created there in 1994 
under the terms of the Nunavut final agreement. The area will 
protect 3,450 hectares of land area and 14,350 hectares of water 
area for a total of 17,800 hectares.
<P>
	The Inuit of the community of Grise Fiord will have a direct 
say in the management of the land use decisions affecting this 
area.
<P>
	Far to the south of the island at the mouth of British 
Columbia's Fraser River, Alasken national wildlife area has 
been in existence since 1976. This is an important staging area 
for migratory birds, including the lesser snow geese from 
Wrangel Island in the Russian Arctic.
<P>
	This is only a small selection from the list of Canada's 
national wildlife areas but it shows the variety and richness of 
these sites. It also shows the flexibility of a concept of wildlife 
area under Canada's Wildlife Act.
<P>
	In Ontario's Long Point, for example, virtually all human 
activity must be closely monitored to avoid ecological damage. 
In constant, buildings standing at Alasken from before the site 
was designated now are used as offices of the Canadian Wildlife 
Service's Pacific and Yukon regions.
<P>
	Other wildlife areas are open for many types of recreational 
activities, including closely regulated hunting, fishing and 
trapping.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	In other areas local native people continue to exercise their 
traditional wildlife harvesting rights. That flexibility is one of 
the keys to the success of the national wildlife areas.
<P>
	In many cases the sites that we seek to designate are of great 
importance to particular communities and groups. Our 
challenge is to gain their support and co-operation, to find ways 
of working together for common goals, including the goal of 
wildlife conservation.
<P>
	This is truly sustainable development at work. Perhaps the 
greatest value of our national wildlife areas is that they give us a 
model for sustainable development, one that we should apply 
more widely. This House has an opportunity of doing exactly 
that by amending the Canada Wildlife Act. I am confident that 
hon. members will appreciate the importance of this bill and will 
give it swift passage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with considerable interest to the presentation of the 
members opposite.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3788"> 3788 </A></B>
<P>
	I am wondering if the member opposite is aware that the 
penalties under the migratory birds act are in many respects 
much more severe than any penalties envisioned under the 
Young Offenders Act. For those watching this debate on 
television who may still be awake, I wonder if the member 
would comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I will comment on the 
portion of the migratory birds act that you spoke of. Quite 
obviously those penalties you may consider overly severe. I 
consider them reasonable and severe in order to protect our 
migratory game birds.
<P>
	As you know from the-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I appreciate that the hon. member is 
new, but would he please address his remarks to the floor. We do 
not refer to other members as ``you''. We say ``the member'', 
rather than ``you''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker. Certain the comments 
that have come forth in the question are appreciated. We are well 
aware in this House in recent weeks of the concerns that have 
been expressed on the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	Members on both sides of the House have heard the replies 
with regard to those questions from the Minister of Justice. I am 
not going to try to second guess him. I will wait for the hon. 
minister to bring forth his proposals on the Young Offenders Act 
and how he intends to make those amendments.
<P>
	As far as the migratory birds act, I am in support of it. We may 
have to strengthen those penalties in future years in the 
protection of our wildlife.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to 
rise in support of Bill C-23, an amendment to the Migratory 
Birds Convention Act.
<P>
	I note that this act was written in 1917. I do not think millions 
of passenger pigeons were flying between the United States and 
Canada across Lake Ontario in 1917 but there had been millions 
of them before the turn of the century.
<P>
	After 75 years it is high time that we revised this act and 
amended it where necessary. Rachel Carson in her book <I>Silent 
Spring</I> alerted all of us to the dangers of pesticides and 
herbicides among bird populations. We have to keep that in 
mind. The situation has certainly not improved since that time 
and more needs to be done.
<P>
	I know we are working hard on whistling swans. I would still 
like to see some bluebirds in the spring. There is even a dearth of 
warblers. Canada has a particular responsibility in this regard. 
Hundreds of species fly north to nest in our northern wilderness 
each year and fly south again in the fall to take colour and song 
to our southern neighbours so that we particularly must be 
cognizant of our role in maintaining biodiversity with respect to 
birds.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to bring forward the results of an important 
survey made by the Canadian Wildlife Service in 1991. It 
surveyed 103,398 Canadians and it provides information on the 
socioeconomic benefits of biological resources in Canada. This 
was the third such survey since 1981 done by the Canadian 
Wildlife Service and some of the important findings are as 
follows.
<P>
	In 1991, 18.9 million Canadians, 90.2 per cent of the 
population, took part in one or more wildlife related activities, 
devoting a total of 1.3 billion hours and $5.6 billion to these 
activities.
<P>
	The majority of Canadians, 86.2 per cent, stated that it is 
important to maintain abundant wildlife and 83.3 per cent stated 
that it is important to protect endangered or declining wildlife 
populations.
<P>
	On the economic side an estimated 1.8 million Americans 
visited Canada for fish and wildlife in 1991 and spent $842 
million on these trips which provides us with a significant 
balance of payments in this area since that is five times the 
amount Canadians spend in the U.S. on such trips.
<P>
	A second report is being prepared which will examine in more 
detail the impacts resulting from wildlife related activities on 
the Canadian economy in the form of income and jobs.
<P>
	I quote from the Minister of the Environment: ``The 
conclusions I draw from this survey are that Canadians remain 
strongly committed to the protection and conservation of 
abundant and diverse wildlife and that spending on wildlife 
related activities makes an important contribution to the 
Canadian economy. Those are among the reasons why the 
federal government is dedicated to working with the provinces, 
territories, environmental groups and the private sector on 
initiatives such as wetlands conservation and the protection of 
Canada's biological diversity''.
<P>
	Birds such as the golden plover and the Arctic tern travel 
thousands of kilometres twice each year from Canada's northern 
reaches to South America. Birds do not know anything about 
municipal, provincial or national boundaries. It therefore 
behooves us to do the best job we can in amending the Migratory 
Birds Convention Act to assure the world that biodiversity will 
continue and that our feathered friends will be here for many 
years to come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to take about five or ten minutes to speak on this 
bill.
<P>
	I am in support of the bill and congratulate the minister and 
the parliamentary secretary for their work in this regard as well 
as all officials of the environment department.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3789"> 3789 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to take this occasion to raise an issue of local concern, 
one that affects very much the citizens of 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell with regard to wildlife, 
particularly migratory birds. Perhaps when I introduce this 
subject some members might think that it is trivial issue. I want 
to assure members that it is not. It is indeed a very important 
issue for the agricultural community of 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As you know, Canada geese spend the winter in the United 
States and come back in the spring to nest in Ungava, in northern 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Until some years ago the migration route of these birds was 
somewhere around Kingston, Ontario, and the birds would land, 
approximately 120,000 of them, on Wolfe Island and from there 
move north flying approximately in a north-northeast direction. 
For reasons that officials of the Wildlife Service of Environment 
Canada do not understand fully to this day, the birds have 
changed their migration route and are gradually flying farther 
and farther east. They now fly between Ottawa and Montreal. 
That is approximately the route.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	They first stop in my riding and then in the Papineauville area. 
In fact, there is a Canada geese festival celebrating these 
beautiful birds on their way north.
<P>
	They are a magnificent sight and like all my constituents I like 
to see them fly above. However, there is a community in my area 
which, for obvious reasons, finds that less enjoyable, and that is 
the farm community.
<P>
	As I said, the birds stop in our area and their number can reach 
75,000 to 80,000 at once. If the area was forested, they would do 
little damage. Even in a corn field they would not do much harm. 
But in a field of alfalfa or tender grass, very rich in protein 
because they grow on rich soil, they can play havoc. The losses 
suffered by farmers in my area are enormous.
<P>
	I have here a report prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture 
which puts the losses at $240 per acre, and we are talking about 
hundreds and hundreds of acres destroyed every year. On several 
occasions, I asked the federal government to help these farmers. 
Unfortunately, I never obtained anything with the previous 
government.
<P>
	I believe there are three solutions or three elements of 
solution to the problem we have in my riding. First, I think the 
agriculture departments of the Ontario provincial government 
and the federal government should implement a policy for 
compensating specific site owners, a program similar to the crop 
insurance they have in Quebec. In other words, if one specific 
producer loses part of his crop, he should be eligible. The 
Ontario plan does not allow for the analysis of such local losses. 
To be eligible, losses have to be regional and of course  birds do 
not land on a complete region; they visit one site, destroy 300 or 
400 acres at a time, but not the fields around that area. 
Therefore, that plan should be modified.
<P>
	Second, there is a problem with the approach used to control 
birds when they decide to land on one specific field.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Until about three years ago farmers in 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell were given permits by 
Environment Canada to shoot down one bird. The farmer would 
receive a permit to kill one bird. After killing the bird he would 
turn it upside down, pursuant to instructions given by 
Environment Canada, and spread out the wings. They are very 
huge birds. With the bird turned upside down it can be viewed 
from the sky by other birds and of course they would never go 
near that farm for the rest of the season. That was working 
reasonably effectively.
<P>
	Three years ago Environment Canada took the position that 
the birds were gradually dwindling in numbers and we could no 
longer afford to do that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That might be true, but I have a problem with that. If it is true 
the bird belongs to an endangered species, how come hunting 
those birds is permitted in the fall? If all that is true, why not 
prohibit fall hunting? In the past, I never succeeded in getting 
my point across to officials in charge of those issues.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	It seems to me that if there must be control, it should be in the 
fall, when after all, it is a luxury to hunt them, not a necessity as 
it is in the spring when farmers should be allowed to shoot them. 
After all, perhaps only 25 farmers would be allowed to kill one 
bird each to avoid such serious losses.
<P>
	Anyway, this was turned down. Instead, farmers were given, 
at great cost to taxpayers, guns and blank cartridges to scare 
them off. But, needless to say, these animals are extremely 
intelligent, over and above everything else, and once you shoot 
at them three or four times without hurting them, they are no 
longer afraid of your gun. So much so, Mr. Speaker, that farmers 
bought automatic propane guns that shoot once every half hour, 
or something like that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Farmers in the area were explaining to me that for the first day 
the birds would leave when the shots were heard. On the second 
day they would leave about five minutes before the shots were 
heard. On the third day they would just tip their head up, listen to 
the shot and tip it back down again and continue eating. That is 
how effective that particular Environment Canada fiasco was for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3790"> 3790 </A></B>
<P>
my electors. All of this was a tremendous expense for the 
taxpayers.
<P>
	Finally last year I thought we had the solution where 
Environment Canada offered to the electors of my area to 
establish a series of wildlife refuge areas.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Three areas had been designated as bird sanctuaries, one 
along the South Nation River, the other one near the Ottawa 
River, and the third one not far from Cob Lake, in my riding. 
Everything was planned, but unfortunately, the government 
withdrew its offer to supply funds. My constituents did not 
appreciate that at all. It happened under the former government, 
of course, not ours.
<P>
	Still, material losses are nonetheless great, and that is what I 
want to bring to the attention of the House. As I said, to hon. 
members who deal with issues concerning the whole country, 
this may seem to be just a local and rather unimportant issue, but 
I assure you, Mr. Speaker, that when you lose-and I have the 
estimate here-when you lose $240 per acre and when you lose 
suddenly 200 crop acres, it is not very funny.
<P>
	Several constituents of mine, several farmers in 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell suffered losses because of that. 
There are two things I hope for. First, I hope that the federal 
government will convince the Ontario government to amend the 
crop insurance program so that these farmers can be 
compensated.
<P>
	On the other hand, I hope that a solution will be found, either 
proposing sanctuary measures or restoring the program 
allowing each farmer to eliminate one bird every season, all the 
more so since, as I was saying, only about twenty farmers are 
involved.
<P>
	I am not raising this point to tell you that I am not one of those 
who want to keep protecting that species, quite the contrary. 
However, I must stress that when people realize that no one 
wants to hear them, it sometimes happen that they take the law in 
their own hands. But there is no winner under such 
circumstances, because people will cause damage and will no 
longer respect these birds. What I want to do is make sure that 
that species will be protected. After all, they are a Canadian 
symbol and, what is more, they are very unique birds. I have 
been briefed about Canada geese.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For those of us who are English speaking, they are known as 
the Canada goose, a symbol of our nation until we put the loon 
on the dollar. Before that I guess the Canada goose would have 
probably been the most famous bird we had. It still is a beautiful 
creature.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to raise these concerns because they affect greatly the 
electors of Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. At this time of year I 
am deluged with phone calls from farmers who see their crops 
being lost because of the damage being done. It is the role of the 
government that makes these laws, laws that I support, to ensure 
that they are made in such a way so as to not sacrifice the 
agricultural community. Both can co-exist quite well if we  put 
our minds to making sure that that co-existence does not mean 
that one community is sacrificed for the other.
<P>
	It does not have to be that way. All we need to do is work 
co-operatively. I am confident that with people like the Minister 
of the Environment, the parliamentary secretary who is a very 
able person in the area, that we will succeed where we have 
failed before in preserving the crops of the farmers of 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And who knows, by establishing sanctuaries such as these, as 
we could, and as the department had suggested a year ago, 
perhaps we could increase the number of people who would go 
and see these beautiful creatures in their habitat. And the 
appreciation for these great birds would increase if we all 
worked together. That is, in any case, what I wish for, and I hope 
the department will examine that issue, which is very important 
for those I have the honour to represent in this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That being said I want to go on record supporting the initiative 
that is before us today and to again ask the government to think 
of the electors of Glengarry-Prescott-Russell and the 
problem they have in this area of wildlife management.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate and thank our colleague from 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell for his speech. One can see how 
sensitive and knowledgeable he is about the subject.
<P>
	I have a technical question to ask him. He mentioned a 
measure suggested which would allow farmers who suffer 
damages to kill one animal per season. I fail to see how this 
could possibly change or improve the situation, and I fail to see 
what impact this could have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is an easy question to answer. 
When the program was in place, it had a very positive impact 
since birds which flew over the area and saw one of their own, 
dead and turned on its back to afford them a better view, would 
get scared. It is as simple as that.
<P>
	That approach was so efficient that, according to 
departmental experts, birds would not go within about one 
kilometre of the site where they saw a dead bird.
<P>
	When you study these birds, and I had the opportunity to do so 
since these birds are a problem in my riding, you understand 
how intelligent they are. In fact, they are so bright that, at the 
risk of repeating myself, they would only need a couple of days 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3791"> 3791 </A></B>
<P>
to tell the difference between a real rifle and one that is used 
only to make noise without hurting them.
<P>
	However, it is interesting to observe such a phenomenon and 
to see that these birds will do everything possible to avoid an 
area where they feel threatened.
<P>
	I would like to say that this problem is different every year. 
Apparently, it has something to do with the heat of the earth. For 
example, birds base the speed at which they head for the north on 
the degree of thawing. If the earth does not thaw fast enough, 
they will stay in my riding for maybe three weeks. Can you 
imagine the damage they can make during that time. Sometimes, 
like last year, they only stay for about five or six days, because 
the earth warms up more rapidly. Maybe the frost was not so 
bad, or things were warming up more rapidly, or something like 
that.
<P>
	After a short stay in our area, they resumed their journey to 
the north. Needless to say that, with the very cold weather we 
had this winter, I suspect these birds will stay a little longer in 
my riding this year, unfortunately for our farmers, but 
fortunately for bird watchers.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	That is probably why they will stay with us for a few more 
days, even though they have been in this area now for two or 
three weeks.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and referred to a 
committee.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you would find consent to 
suspend the sitting until such time as the House is ready to deal 
with the adjournment debate.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The deputy whip may not be aware but 
I believe the House is ready to deal with the matters on the late 
show.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I was not aware the members were already 
present in the House. That being said, I amend that to move that 
we proceed immediately to the adjournment debate and that Mr. 
Speaker see it as the time of adjournment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INFORMATIONHIGHWAY">INFORMATION HIGHWAY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, on April 25 
last, I put a question to the Minister of Industry asking him to
<P>
explain the absence of representatives of the cultural 
community on the committee in charge of defining the 
government's strategy for the information highway.
<P>
	I also conveyed to him my concern over the fact that the 
provinces were not involved in the process. Today I would like 
further clarification to be provided with respect to these two 
questions.
<P>
	I represent the riding of Chicoutimi. The Saguenay region was 
the first in Quebec to welcome a multimedia centre, an 
investment of $80 million which will result in 250 jobs. I feel 
concerned by the electronic highway.
<P>
	In the Throne Speech and again in the budget speech, the 
government announced it had the intention of putting forward a 
Canadian strategy for developing the information highway.
<P>
	As we all know, the government has appointed an electronic 
highway advisory board. This board has 29 members, including 
one from my riding in the person of Mr. Charles Sirois, and I am 
very pleased with that.
<P>
	Among these 29 members are representatives from the cable 
broadcasting, broadcasting and telecommunications industries, 
but none from the cultural industry. But there are living 
strengths, creative forces and expertise only waiting for an 
invitation to share their vision.
<P>
	The cultural community is structured. It has its own structures 
and experienced representatives. Why are they excluded from 
this process? In the name of what? The artisans of the cultural 
industry cannot be ignored when dealing with this issue.
<P>
	Besides the establishment of an infrastructure per se, there is 
the content of the information travelling on this electronic 
highway. One of the objectives of the board is to strengthen the 
French and English cultural identities; yet the board has no 
representatives from the cultural community. There is a glaring 
contradiction in there. How can this operation be credible when 
the committee does not include any representatives of the 
cultural community, despite the extra dimension and the 
extremely important expertise they could bring? This is not a 
whim but a matter of representation. Culture will not be affected 
only indirectly; it is at the heart of the electronic highway.
<P>
	Although the committee includes 29 members, the Minister of 
Industry did not appoint any representative of the cultural 
community. Industry, however, is well represented. They 
apparently preferred to leave out players who could have made a 
necessary, useful contribution.
<P>
	Under its mandate, the council is being asked to deal with 
copyright and intellectual property issues and to come up with 
results. Is this not an admission that workers in cultural 
industries make a considerable contribution? Why are these 
players absent from the process defined by the government, 
then?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3792"> 3792 </A></B>
<P>
	The Ostry report recommended creating a ministerial 
committee and provincial participation as well. The government 
ignored that. Instead, the electronic highway will be developed 
behind closed doors, with only one player and in the federal 
arena. Excluding the provinces and the cultural community is a 
bad start in designing the electronic highway.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have this opportunity to discuss the concerns raised 
by the hon. member for Chicoutimi regarding the government's 
strategy on the electronic highway.
<P>
	The government has already stated clearly that it has three 
main objectives in that regard: to promote job creation; to give 
every Canadian access to that highway; and to reinforce 
Canadian sovereignty and cultural identity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I wish to assure the hon. member that the government was and 
continues to be very aware of the information highway's cultural 
dimension.
<P>
	The advisory council will contribute to the dialogue on this 
subject. I believe we should all be appreciative that so many 
prominent men and women have accepted to donate their time 
and effort in this vital cause. By its very mandate the council 
will reach out to Canadians. In so doing it will help to identify 
key policy issues as well as to involve a wide range of 
stakeholders.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Chicoutimi said that the cultural 
community was not represented on the advisory council.
<P>
	In selecting the advisory council members, the government 
tried to appoint the most qualified people, those who can best 
put their knowledge and experience to the service of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	In that perspective, I believe that the government should be 
congratulated for appointing such remarkable Canadians to the 
advisory council on the electronic highway.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38(5) the 
motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted.
<P>
	The House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. 
pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 5.38 p.m.)
