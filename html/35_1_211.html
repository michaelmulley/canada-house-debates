	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider implementing 
a new program of mining incentives which would encourage exploration and 
development in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to introduce in this House 
today a motion calling on the government to consider a program of 
mining incentives which would encourage exploration and 
development in Canada. First of all, allow me to commend the hon. 
Minister of Natural Resources for officially declaring a national 
mining week last month.
<P>
	This shows that the government recognizes the mining sector's 
important contribution to the Canadian economy and partly fulfils 
our commitment to promote at the international level Canadian 
interests in this area.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I believe that the industry has also done a tremendous job in 
promoting mining through its Keep Mining in Canada campaign. I 
want to congratulate it on this important initiative.
<P>
	I would also like to thank the Minister of Finance for 
implementing in his 1994 budget measures to allow the 
deductibility of reclamation funds. I recognize there has been a 
substantial increase in exploration throughout Canada in 1994 and 
there is a prediction of a further increase in 1995 to a level of 
approximately $650 million. Despite this, major problems and 
impediments still exist to a sound and sustainable mining sector in 
the country.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	Some of the impediments that were identified both in the natural 
resources committee report, the Whitehorse mining initiative 
report and by the industry are as  follows: insecurity of land tenure 
either because of the creation of new parks or because of native 
land claims; flight of exploration capital to third world countries, 
especially South America; complexity, duplication and delays in 
issuing permits and environmental assessments; and to a lesser 
degree, the effect of profit and non-profit based taxes and levies.
<P>
	Canada needs a minimum of $900 million to $1 billion worth of 
exploration capital annually to rebuild our ore reserves which have 
been depleted to a dangerous level.
<P>
	I would like to state a number of statistics which will clearly 
demonstrate the importance of mining to the Canadian economy. 
These facts are based on information from Statistics Canada and 
Natural Resources Canada.
<P>
	The mining and mineral related industries employ 335,000 
Canadians. Of these, roughly 57,000 were employed in mining, 
including coal mining, 57,000 in smelting and refining, 85,000 in 
metal semi-fabrication and 129,000 in metal fabrication.
<P>
	Mining is the mainstay of employment for over 150 
communities. Canada is the world's largest mineral exporter. 
Mining provides 14.6 per cent of total exports and contributes 
$11.7 billion to the trade balance. Canada produces some 60 
commodities, leading the world in the production of uranium, 28 
per cent; zinc, 15 per cent and potash, 34 per cent.
<P>
	Canada is the world's second largest producer of nickel at 22 per 
cent; cadmium, 11 per cent; asbestos, 17 per cent; elemental 
sulphur, 22 per cent; and ranks among the top five producers of 
platinum, group metals, gypsum, aluminium, copper, lead, cobalt, 
titanium, molybdenum and gold.
<P>
	Mining, and resource industries generally, lead all other 
industrial sectors in productivity. During the last decade labour 
productivity increased by 103 per cent in mining and 
concentration, by 87 per cent in smelting and refining and by 32 per 
cent in metal semi-fabrication. In 1993 mining added $20 billion to 
the Canadian economy, equaling 4.2 per cent of the gross domestic 
product.
<P>
	Canada is the third largest mining nation in the world. For every 
10 jobs created in the mining industry, eight more spinoff jobs are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13208"> 13208 </A></B>
<P>
created. Almost 80 per cent of Canada's mineral production is 
exported. Mining  provides 14.8 per cent of Canada's total exports, 
contributing $9.9 billion to the mineral trade balance.
<P>
	Minerals and metals account for 60 per cent of the material 
transported in Canada by rail and through our ports. Ontario at 30 
per cent; Quebec, 17 per cent and B.C., 16 per cent, account for 
more than 60 per cent of Canadian mineral production.
<P>
	Mining stocks make up 55 to 60 per cent of trading on the 
Vancouver Stock Exchange; 20 to 30 per cent of trading on the 
Toronto Stock Exchange and 20 per cent of trading on the Montreal 
Stock Exchange.
<P>
	The amount of land used for mining in Canada is less than half 
the size of P.E.I.
<P>
	Let me now inform the House of the worrisome trends in the 
mining sector that forebodes a very uncertain future. Since 1991 
Canada dropped from first place to fourth place in its ability to 
attract international investment in new mines according to the 
Metals Economics Group in Halifax.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	Between 1990 and 1993 Canada saw 44 mines close and only 24 
mines open. Canada lost 19,579 mining jobs between 1990 and 
1993. In 1970 mining contributed 6.4 per cent of the GDP and in 
1993 4.2 per cent. In 1992 exploration expenditures were the 
lowest since 1967. Mine site investment reached $6.7 billion in 
1991 and by 1992 that number was cut in half.
<P>
	In 1988 the amount of exploration and development money spent 
in Canada was about $800 million, compared to less than $400 
million in Chile. These numbers were reversed in 1992. In 1993 
Canadian companies spent almost as much if not more in Latin 
American as did the local companies.
<P>
	In 1993 employment in the mineral industry was 335,000, about 
2.5 per cent of the total national employment. This is a 3.5 per cent 
drop from the 1992 figure of 347,000. In 1992 mine investment in 
Canada was about $3.1 billion, down from 1991 figures by 18 per 
cent. In 1993 Canada's mineral production totalled $14.9 billion, a 
decline of 10.8 per cent from the 1992 amount of $16.7 billion.
<P>
	Canadian companies with budgets of more than $1 million spent 
close to $260 million on exploration outside Canada in 1993, 
almost half of their total budgets. This is an increase over 1992 
when they spent 40 per cent on their exploration budgets abroad.
<P>
	Since World War II the cost of fine based metal deposits in 
Canada rose from $6 million to about $150 million, a 25 per cent 
increase as corrected for inflation in 1989 dollars.
<P>
	My motion calls on the government to implement a new program 
of mining incentives which would encourage exploration and 
development in Canada. What do we mean by mining incentives? 
Most people would  automatically equate incentives with grants or 
tax based measures but there are incentives that are much more 
important than that.
<P>
	The mining industry does not want grants. It wants a level 
playing field and a tax system which is truly competitive with the 
rest of the world. It wants security of land tenure and a certainty of 
continuity in the rules of the game in terms of issuing permits and 
doing environmental assessments.
<P>
	How can the mining industry interest investors when the goal 
posts keep moving all the time? How can it convince investors to 
spend hundreds of millions of dollars only to have the property 
declared a park, as it was done recently in British Columbia with 
the Windy Craggy property?
<P>
	Although I recognize that most of these rules fall under 
provincial jurisdiction, I believe the federal government must play 
a leading role in bringing all parties involved together. If we want 
to create more parks in the country, let us do it now and declare 
them off limits. However, let us also ensure the industry that the 
rest of the country is open for business and that if it spends 
exploration dollars it will be permitted to develop its discovery and 
reap the benefits.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Natural Resources conducted 
extensive hearings with all the stakeholders. The result was nine 
key recommendations on mining incentives which were almost 
entirely present in the Whitehorse mining initiative report.
<P>
	I would like at the present time to present the House with those 
recommendations:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Recommendation 1: That the federal government, in conjunction with its 
provincial counterparts, work to remove the structural impediments to mineral 
investment outlined in the Whitehorse mining initiative final report by the year 2000.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Recommendation 2: That, on recognition of the uncertain long term prospects of 
the mining sector, the need for a more attractive exploration investment regime for 
junior companies and the positive impact of mineral exploration activity on regional 
development and job creation, the federal government implement tax measures in its 
February 1995 budget to encourage Canadian mineral exploration.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Recommendation 3: That, subsequent to recommendation 2, the federal 
government introduce a mineral exploration incentive by modifying the Income Tax 
Act to incorporate a change in the adjusted cost base of flow-through shares from a 
value of zero to the actual cost of the shares-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Recommendation 4: That in order to enhance the effectiveness of exploration 
work financed by means of flow-through shares, the federal government enable the 
exploration activity funded through such shares to be carried out over a period of 
one full year after financing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Recommendation 5: That, to assist junior and<I>or single mine companies, the 
federal government exempt mineral exploration and development companies without 
revenue from mineral production, from application of the Large Corporations Tax.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13209"> 13209 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Recommendation 6: That in order to enhance the effectiveness of mineral 
exploration, core geoscientific funding under existing federal-provincial mineral 
development agreements, MDA, be preserved under alternative programming.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Recommendation 7: That once initial steps have been taken to improve the 
investment climate in Canadian mining, the federal government, its provincial and 
territorial counterparts and the domestic mining industry develop, through 
consultation, an integrated approach to communicate the positive features of the 
Canadian mining sector to potential investors.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Recommendation 8: That Natural Resources Canada, together with its partners in 
the provinces and the industry, establish a national database on active and orphaned 
mining sites and reclamation work that must be undertaken on those sites.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Recommendation 9: That the Minister of Finance amend the Income Tax Act so as 
to defer taxation of income generated within mine reclamation trusts until the funds 
within these trusts are finally allocated for reclamation purposes and that the minister 
make an announcement to that effect in the next federal budget.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	The main thrust of the last federal budget was deficit reduction. 
It was about putting our financial house in order. It was about 
getting the fundamentals right so that all sectors of the economy 
including mining could regain confidence in Canada. I agree 100 
per cent with the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	It would have been very difficult to justify tax breaks or 
expenditures in one sector of the economy while cutting all other 
sectors dramatically. However, we must look at the next budget and 
beyond. While I realise it would be next to impossible to 
implement all the measures recommended in the natural resources 
committee report in the short term, there is much we can do 
without breaking the bank.
<P>
	Some of these measures are included in the keep mining in 
Canada 10 point program: establish a process for land use planning 
that respects mineral tenure to ensure both the protection of 
Canada's natural heritage and access for mineral resource 
development; streamline federal-provincial environmental 
regulations to avoid costly duplication and delays; implement an 
appropriate incentive to stimulate grassroots mineral exploration; 
change tax laws on mine reclamation funding to encourage 
investment in new mines; launch a national initiative to build 
necessary infrastructure for northern Canada's economic 
self-reliance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, there are still many Hemlos and Boisla Bays in 
this country. It is up to us as a government, to the mining industry, 
to the First Nations, and to environmentalists to join forces in a 
spirit of co-operation and compromise so that mining can become 
once again the cornerstone of the Canadian economy.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to congratulate my colleague, the hon. member for 
Timiskaming-French River, on presenting Motion M-292, which 
reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider implementing 
a new program of mining incentives which would encourage exploration and 
development in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	After sitting on the Standing Committee on Natural Resources 
with my hon. colleague for nearly four months to review the 
Canadian mining industry, I would say that the government is well 
aware of the situation of this industry, which is confronted with one 
of the greatest challenges it has had to face in years.
<P>
	The fact is that base metal reserves have been dwindling since 
the 1980s, and these are unlikely to be replenished quickly in the 
near future, as mineral exploration has declined in Canada in recent 
years.
<P>
	The mining industry has repeatedly expressed its concerns to the 
Government of Canada, which, instead of making the adjustment 
process easier, is in fact making matters worse by letting the 
investment climate deteriorate in the mining industry in Canada, as 
compared with rival countries.
<P>
	More specifically, the mining industry claims that recent trends 
in mining taxation have caused a decline in exploration and other 
investment activities in the Canadian mining industry.
<P>
	A mining exploration incentive program similar to the one put in 
place in the 1980s should be implemented, but with stricter 
controls. In spite of the depletion of base metal reserves, Canada's 
geological potential is still enormous.
<P>
	Just to show how great this potential is and how much interest it 
generates, suffice it to say that, on April 25, more than 700 people, 
VIPs, guests and employees, attended the official opening 
ceremony of the Louvicourt mine, near Val d'Or, 2,000 feet 
beneath the surface of the earth.
<P>
	This mine, which was started up with $300 million in 
investments and will provide more than 350 direct jobs for a 
minimum of 15 years, is the result of a joint federal-provincial 
initiative, the province being in this case Quebec, to conduct 
exploration around old mining sites that had already been mined 
out and were therefore not considered as likely to offer sufficient 
prospects.
<P>
	New technologies and adequate financing made it possible to 
open this mine containing copper, zinc, gold and silver, with an 
estimated capacity of approximately 4,000 tonnes of ore per day 
for the next 15 years. Recent finds in adjacent zones could extend 
the life of the mine to 25 years; it is the largest underground copper 
mine in Quebec at this time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13210"> 13210 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition, three other major mines will open in the next two 
years as a result of flow-through incentives from the 1980s that 
promoted a surge of mine exploration.
<P>
	This is proof that federal tax incentives must be enhanced by 
adapting them to those of the provinces, so as to encourage 
preliminary mining exploration and replace the base metal 
reserves, in Quebec and in Canada, being depleted.
<P>
	Such a measure would also limit the impact of the developing 
countries which, through aggressive promotion campaigns, 
managed to convince many Canadian companies to concentrate 
their efforts on mining opportunities at the international level.
<P>
	Because of this, the Canadian mining sector is getting smaller. 
This, in turn, has a major impact on the Canadian economy as a 
whole, as well as on many regional economies which rely heavily 
on the mining sector.
<P>
	Mining incentives provided in Canada are not less attractive than 
those existing in most other competing countries. Yet, these 
incentives do not generate enough preliminary mining exploration 
activities to replace the reserves of base metals being depleted.
<P>
	In the meantime, some developing countries have many high 
quality mining projects on the go, either on the surface or just 
under it, and they currently do not need incentives to promote their 
preliminary mining activities.
<P>
	It is therefore necessary to intensify preliminary mining 
exploration in Quebec and in Canada. The solution could be to 
improve the overall international competitiveness of mining 
investments in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	To that end, it is essential that all levels of government strive to 
create a favourable investment climate. This includes the following 
measures: first, improving environmental regulations and the time 
required to deliver mining licences; second, improving land access 
and land use, as well as the tax provisions which relate to income 
and which are not based on profits; third, having a positive impact 
on the other costs relating to the operation of a company.
<P>
	The time has come to take into account the economic impact of 
the restrictions and prohibitions which were imposed in the 
eighties regarding land use, and which adversely affect Canada's 
image as a place to invest. We must look at the economic benefits 
related to our mineral resources, and we must make major 
improvements to the process for designating protected areas, as 
well as to the industry's ability to have a significant impact on that 
process.
<P>
	As early as September 1992, in its report on the mineral industry, 
the intergovernmental working group on the mineral industry 
identified five urgent issues  necessitating government 
intervention. They were the following: first, stopping the erosion of 
Canadian producers' competitiveness in certain key sectors of 
mineral production, including copper and nickel; second, 
increasing reserves of base metals in Canada; third, finding new 
ideas and developing technology, policies and programs to make 
grassroots prospecting more efficient, so that new high calibre 
mineral deposits can be discovered, like the one at Louvicourt, 
close to Val d'Or; fourth, reversing the obvious trend among 
mining investors, including Canadian mining multinationals, of 
passing Canada over in favour of developing countries in Latin 
America, Asia, or the Pacific with rich resources; fifth, in general, 
implementing a policy and regulatory framework that is more 
conducive to maintaining the viability of the industry and 
stimulating investment in the exploration and development of 
minerals in Canada.
<P>
	Regarding the production costs associated with the main metals, 
Canada is very competitive on the metal market because of the low 
cost of operating its mines, which is mostly the result of high 
productivity levels in the industry.
<P>
	In fact, the Canadian mineral industry was able to considerably 
increase its productivity because of the rationalization caused by 
the recession in the 1980s. The productivity of all sectors of the 
industry markedly increased as a result of new technologies and 
new mining methods, which were developed in Canada for the 
most part.
<P>
	We must consider future generations. We must prevent the 
decline of base metal reserves by planning now for the exploration 
and mining of new deposits to replace those that will eventually be 
depleted.
<P>
	I would like to point out that financial incentives, sometimes 
offered by provincial governments and sometimes by the federal 
government, exist or should exist, but they should be properly 
co-ordinated. For instance, assistance for the purchase of mining 
equipment. In this case, the company should be given a tax holiday 
of two or three years-the time it takes to build a mine. Quebec 
does this in the case of new mines but the federal government does 
not.
<P>
	There are also regional investment funds. In fact, it costs at least 
$10 million to do the exploration work on a site that may yield 
$100 million. However, if there is no money to dig, this does not 
create jobs. We need regional investment funds to develop local 
sites.
<P>
	We also need a consortium. The Fonds de solidarité des 
travailleurs du Québec wants to invest money in mining 
development. We are glad this is happening in Quebec, but it could 
be done in other provinces as well. Mr. Speaker, since you say I 
have only a few minutes left, I will drop the list of suggestions. I 
can take them to the natural resources committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13211"> 13211 </A></B>
<P>
	In concluding, I want to mention very briefly the main points 
we discussed on the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, 
namely that the mining industry merits immediate tax relief to 
help offset the existing structural impediments, to restore some 
of the fiscal advantages taken away during previous rounds of tax 
reform, and to boost sagging levels of domestic exploration.
<P>
	Finally, to enhance investor attraction to flow through shares, 
historically an important source of investment capital for junior 
mining firms, it was proposed that the adjusted cost base of such 
shares should be changed from zero to the actual cost of the shares.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	This incentive should be available for five years, allowing time 
for structural reform to be completed.
<P>
	Finally, these tax changes, together with the measures I 
mentioned earlier, would help create a climate more conducive to 
investment in the mining sector in Quebec and Canada and would 
help to create jobs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must confess that I 
approached the debate this morning with some trepidation because 
I saw the words mining incentives in the motion of the hon. 
member for Timiskaming-French River.
<P>
	My immediate thought was he wants some lollipops for the 
mining industry. However, having heard the hon. member speak 
and explain that what he is really seeking is a more sensible and 
sane regime of mining taxation, a more reasonable regulatory 
regime both federally and provincially, I support the hon. 
member's motion and I am pleased to do so.
<P>
	I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that the 
natural resources committee held extensive hearings last fall on 
this very question and came up with nine recommendations that 
were endorsed by all parties in the committee. Of course the 
government chose to ignore all the work that was done and all the 
witnesses we heard in that committee. Perhaps we have learned to 
accept that. That is the way Parliament works.
<P>
	Maybe we can revisit some of these things. On the federal side, I 
would particularly like to see a revisitation of recommendations 4, 
5, and 9, all of which deal with taxation and which would not cost 
the government a great deal of money in terms of revenue forgone 
but would send a message to the mining industry to indicate that we 
are in business here to do mining and the mining companies are 
welcome.
<P>
	On recommendation 4, which deals with the way flow-through 
funds are spent, under existing regulations if one raises money 
through a flow-through issue the schedule of spending is tied to the 
taxation year. The  result of that is that if a company gets its 
underwriting complete and gets its money right near the end of the 
taxation year, they then have to rush out and spend it madly before 
the taxation year has ended. This causes all sorts of grief for the 
people in the field and it causes huge amounts of money to be 
wasted.
<P>
	I have had personal experience with this on several occasions. 
We must get away from that and allow companies, as was 
recommended by the committee, the possibility of having a full 
year to spend the funds once they are raised. This is extremely 
important, and it would cost the government nothing. It only means 
a small change in the way the regulations are enforced.
<P>
	I would urge that we look again at the current taxation system of 
applying the large corporations tax to mining companies that have 
no income. There are quite a few of them out there, and if they are 
doing exploration work and have no income they are obviously 
either raising more money in the capital market or they are going 
into debt. This is not recognized when you make them pay a tax on 
their assets. This does not make sense. It is not good for the 
companies and it is not good for the country.
<P>
	The final one that I would like to see brought in, and I hope it 
will be brought in next year, is our recommendation for changes to 
the Income Tax Act with regard to the deferring of taxation on 
income generated in mine reclamation trusts.
<P>
	If a company is obliged to put money into a trust in order to 
satisfy future obligations for mine reclamation, surely to heavens 
they should not be taxed for the income on the money that they do 
not have, which is what we have now. Let those things be treated 
like an RRSP, which is what the committee recommended. Again, 
it would cost the government very little, but it could get us a few 
new mines and it certainly would encourage the mining industry.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Getting on to some more general matters, away from taxation, 
we all know that we are witnessing and have been witnessing a 
progressive decline in investment, employment, and mining 
exploration over the last five years. On an average, we are losing 
6,000 employees per year in the industry and have been for the past 
five years. Part of it is due to taxation, but most of it unfortunately 
is due to land use policies, regulatory policies, and the lack of 
security of tenure. I would put a great big exclamation mark beside 
that lack of security of tenure.
<P>
	It is no fun to go out and spend many millions of dollars 
developing a mining property and then find that because the rules 
have changed you are not going to be allowed to develop it. The 
classic example, of course, was the Tatsenshini case in northern 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13212"> 13212 </A></B>
<P>
British Columbia, the Windy Craggy deposit, where it was almost 
absent-mindedly decided by the Government of British  Columbia 
to abandon the traditional Canadian principle of multiple land use 
and to tell a company that had spent huge amounts of money 
developing what would have been a mine that would have 
contributed billions of dollars of economic activity to Canada: 
``No, you cannot put that into production. It is gone. It is going to 
be inside of a vast park. We are going to forgo all this potential 
economic activity and take away your property rights to provide a 
playground for a few well-heeled tourists''. This is economic 
madness.
<P>
	Of course the federal government also is not without guilt in 
regulatory nonsense. When the Kluane Park in the Yukon was set 
up some 20 years ago, they were advised by their own Geological 
Survey of Canada that the area had considerable mineral potential 
and that some of it should be left out for future development. And 
the government said no, we are going to have it all reserve. First it 
was turned into a land reserve and it has since been turned into a 
park. There are potential mineral deposits there, and they are 
locked away from beneficial use for Canada for untold years to 
come.
<P>
	Federal regulations also impinge on a minor scale, which can 
been very irritating. I can cite a personal experience I had a few 
years ago in northwestern Ontario. I had to build a bridge across a 
creek in order to move a drill rig onto a property. I got all the 
necessary permits from the forestry department and the 
environmental people. I was ready to go when someone said, ``Oh, 
by the way, you have to have a permit from the coast guard''. I 
thought they were joking, but they were not. This was a little creek 
about 50 feet wide and about 12 inches deep and I was told that the 
coast guard had jurisdiction because this was navigable water. I 
said they were mad. Yes, it is navigable. You can paddle a canoe up 
that creek; therefore it is navigable water so you need a permit from 
the coast guard to build your bridge. Surely we can have some 
changes to that type of regulation to make this a more attractive 
country to work in.
<P>
	I could on with this sort of anecdotal material probably for the 
next couple of hours, but I think members are getting my general 
message. I do support the hon. member for Timiskaming-French 
River in his initiative and I do hope the House will ultimately give 
approval to his motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a 
pleasure for me to participate in the debate on the motion of the 
member for Timiskaming-French River. I am very, very pleased 
to support the motion.
<P>
	The motion calls upon the government to look at the mining 
industry and what it can do to support it. This motion calls on all 
sectors of our economy that deal with mining to work together to 
keep mining in Canada, as the slogan of the Mining Association of 
Canada reminds us.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	On a personal note, I would like to mention that mining is part of 
my family and part of my personal history. My father was a part 
time prospector and mine developer. I have fond memories of days 
up near Shining Tree on his small gold claim. You would probably 
be interested to know, Mr. Speaker, that the very first mine in 
Canada was in Bruce Mines, Ontario, in my riding, on the north 
shore of Lake Huron. It was a copper mine, which was established 
in 1850. It may not be a fact that everybody knows, but everybody 
should know this. I thank my colleague for that piece of history.
<P>
	I also want to say that my home is in Elliot Lake, Ontario, which 
once was the uranium capital of the world. There is now just one 
uranium mine left, but it is still very much an active part of the 
mining community. Even though this mine may possibly close next 
June, the fact is that mine rehabilitation, which I will cover a bit 
later in my comments, will keep Elliot Lake in the mining industry 
for many years to come.
<P>
	One of the most important things this debate allows us to do, 
apart from calling on the government to work with industry to 
make sure that mining remains a strong part of our economy, is to 
make sure Canadians understand how important mining is to our 
economy and to our communities.
<P>
	There are a number of myths about mining. I appreciate the 
attempts by the Mining Association of Canada to deal with the 
myths and I would like to help them in that regard. There is a myth 
that mining has an impact only on remote areas of our country. The 
fact is that yes, mines tend to be opened up where there are not very 
many people around, but there are 300,000-plus jobs that are 
directly related to mining and another 300,000-plus jobs that are 
indirectly relating to mining. A significant percentage of those 
jobs, possibly even a majority, are in our cities. Our economy is 
significantly impacted by mining. We just need to look at the 
papers every day and see how active the trade is in metals and 
minerals.
<P>
	Another myth I would like to dispense is that mining will always 
be here and will always be part of our economy. However, that is 
only true if we continue to look for new reserves of metals and 
minerals. It is not the kind of thing we can just ignore and pretend 
that sometime in the future we need not worry about our reserves of 
these natural resources. We must always work diligently to 
maintain our inventories.
<P>
	There is the mythology that mining is environmentally 
damaging and that the industry is irresponsible. This is also not 
true. Tremendous strides have been made in the mining sector and 
in mining communities to deal with the sometimes temporary 
damage that must necessarily take place in the landscape. The 
Canadian mining sector and miners have made a commitment to 
preserve the environment and to make sure that when a mine is 
closed  down reclamation is put in place to return the land to a near 
natural state. Those initiatives have been tremendous in Canada. 
Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13213"> 13213 </A></B>
<P>
mining companies and miners, who are among the best in the world 
in their business and work, have done a great service to our country 
and to the world in terms of leading in environmental protection.
<P>
	Another myth I would like to deal with is that mining is a 
low-tech industry. Well in fact mining is very high tech. I 
mentioned a moment ago that Canadian miners are among the best 
in the world. They are among the best in the world because the 
mining sector is very high tech. In fact, innovation is taking place 
all the time.
<P>
	Members might be interested to know that for the output of a 
million dollars of product it takes half the manpower resources in 
the mining sector compared to the manufacturing sector at large. 
This is an indication that in order to compete in the world and to 
produce metals and minerals at prices that are competitive we have 
to utilize and invest in high technology. We have done that in this 
country.
<P>
	I would like to come to what the federal government is trying to 
do in its efforts to support the mining sector. There are many 
programs. I know we are being called upon at various times to put 
more money into the sector through tax incentives. This motion 
today does not call for those specific measures. We do hear from 
time to time that there should be more tax measures in support of 
the industry.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	In fact much leadership is now provided by the federal 
government in terms of support for the mining sector. That 
leadership has led to partnerships which set an example for the 
entire world. In my own community of Elliot Lake the CANMET 
laboratory is doing some leading edge research on mine 
rehabilitation.
<P>
	Under CANMET and in partnership with stakeholders in the 
mining community we have MEND, the mine environmental 
neutral drainage program. This is a major partnership to ensure that 
the acid produced from mine tailings is minimized and that there is 
no damage to the environment. This kind of research can help the 
world. There is mining development around the world and Canada 
is a leader in terms of protecting the environment. We must show to 
the rest of the world that there is a way to mine properly and to 
preserve the earth.
<P>
	The federal government is also involved in the aquatic effects 
technology evaluation program. This program determines through 
our satellite technology what kind of impact mining is having on 
the environment. It helps industry in terms of preparing 
environmental assessments and resolving problems.
<P>
	The leadership we are seeing in the mining sector in 
co-operation with the federal and provincial governments is quite 
amazing. I was at the Sudbury 95 Mining and the  Environment 
conference just last week. I was impressed. The conference was 
sold out. People came from all over Canada and around the world. 
Every continent was represented. The interest in responsible and 
sustainable mining truly impressed me.
<P>
	This leads me to the one single point I would like to make in all 
of this. The Mining Association of Canada in its outline of what 
kinds of things the federal government can do to assist says that an 
important first step is a sound mine reclamation policy. It is 
interesting that the first thing it says is mine reclamation. It is not 
saying the finding of more minerals and metals or tax incentives to 
assist in the milling and processing of metals and minerals. No, it is 
saying the most important thing is mine reclamation and I have to 
agree. Mine reclamation and mine rehabilitation is the way to go.
<P>
	My colleague, the member for Timiskaming-French River, 
mentioned that we have been asked to consider the tax status of 
interest earned on the mine reclamation funds. I know this is a 
touchy issue. While the Minister of Finance has not committed 
himself or the government to make moves now on this or any other 
tax measure, his mind and ears are open. He is listening. We have 
an ongoing dialogue with him and the Minister of Natural 
Resources to ensure that the tax regime that impacts the mining 
sector is proper, appropriate and productive.
<P>
	I want to commend the Mining Association of Canada for 
putting reclamation first. This government did respond, as I would 
like to remind the House, in the 1994 budget by providing that 
funds put into a mine reclamation fund would create a tax deferred 
situation so that taxes would not be paid right now on funds 
invested in mine reclamation. How we treat the interest in those 
funds is a debate that we would want to continue with the industry. 
I would point out that the interest saved by the industry because of 
the tax deferral is something that is a benefit in its hands.
<P>
	What is the future of mining in this country? Fundamentally it is 
based on the prices out there for metals and minerals. My colleague 
beside me knows about farming and perhaps a little bit about 
mining too. He knows in farming that it is the prices which really 
count the most at the end of the day and at the end of the season. It 
is the same thing in mining.
<P>
	We have seen a tremendous increase in mining investment over 
the last few years. In 1993 it was some $500 million of investment. 
We expect this year to be up into the mid or high $600 million of 
investment. We are not as high yet as we were in the early 1980s 
but the trend line is right.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	We can compete with the rest of the world. We can compete 
because we have the best miners in the world. We have the best 
mining companies in the world. We have an attitude toward mining 
and the environment  which is a kind of leadership that makes me 
proud to be a Canadian, to have a little connection to the mining 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13214"> 13214 </A></B>
<P>
industry through my community, my father and my own few 
summers at Inco in Sudbury.
<P>
	In conclusion, I too call on my colleagues in this government to 
pay attention to the mining industry, to continue partnerships, to 
continue finding ways that will ensure that mining is an integral 
part of our national economy for generations to come and, I would 
suggest, indefinitely. We need those jobs. We need the economic 
benefits for the communities involved. I am very pleased to be able 
to say a few words and encourage my colleagues in this House and 
all Canadians to be supportive of the mining industry in this 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Wood (Nipissing, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise today to add my support to the motion put before this House by 
the hon. member for Timiskaming-French River.
<P>
	The major topic we are addressing today is the importance of the 
mine manufacturing industry in our nation. Like my other 
colleagues, I feel it is necessary to point out the importance of the 
mining industry to the Canadian economy.
<P>
	I suspect that a number of hon. members in the House, 
particularly those from urban areas, do not realize the impact that 
the mining industry has on our economy. The facts clearly show 
that the industry is a key component of the national economy.
<P>
	In 1993 mining products represented 15 per cent of Canada's 
total exports which resulted in a $10 million trade surplus. This 
industry contributes approximately 4 per cent to the gross domestic 
product of the nation. In addition it may surprise many members of 
the House that 60 per cent of all Canada's rail and sea freight is 
directly related to the mining industry. While these economic 
statistics are very impressive, it is also important to look at the 
central role this industry plays in the lives of individual Canadians.
<P>
	The industry directly supports approximately 100,000 high 
paying skilled jobs in mines across Canada. The future of about 
150 Canadian communities is dependent on the success of their 
local mines. These single industry cities and towns are reliant on 
the continued development of the mining industry to ensure their 
very existence. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians live in these 
communities. They are keenly aware of the importance of 
preserving our mining industry.
<P>
	Having stated the importance of mining to so many communities 
in the country, it may interest those present today that there are no 
mines operating in my riding of Nipissing. Northern Ontario is rich 
in mineral deposits. However my riding does rely on an abundance 
of subsidiary industries. There are no ore deposits and that is why I 
am speaking in favour of the motion designed to assist the 
expansion of the mining industry.
<P>
	The answer is that the manufacturing spinoffs from other mines 
in the region are a driving force to the riding of Nipissing. Those 
familiar with the industry may recognize some of the major 
manufacturing exploration companies in my riding, such as Boart 
Longyear, Warren Equipment Ltd., JKS Boyles Ltd., and J. S. 
Redpath Ltd. These companies are all located within the city of 
North Bay and employ a large portion of the local workforce. 
However the importance of the continued success of the mining 
industry extends beyond these big players.
<P>
	The database of the Mining Association of Canada lists no less 
than 25 companies within the city of North Bay that manufacture or 
supply products related to mining. These products range from 
diesel electric locomotives to specialized spare parts, to core 
drilling and drill bit supplies.
<P>
	The point I am trying to make is that there does not need to be a 
mine in one's community to benefit from the mining industry. I 
suspect that virtually every member of this House has a company 
within their constituency that directly or indirectly has business 
within this industry. In Ontario specifically, the 1994 study of Ernst 
&amp; Young found that about 72,500 people are employed by direct or 
spinoff jobs resulting from mining.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	I believe the facts which I have presented illustrate the 
importance of the mining industry to Canada. It has become 
necessary to act to protect this crucial industry.
<P>
	As others have stated, the mining industry has suffered serious 
setbacks in recent years. Low mineral prices and a worldwide 
recession caused job loss and restructuring within the industry. To 
stay productive, many engineering manufacturers and exploration 
companies expanded their operations to foreign markets. The 
initial pain which resulted from the changes has been offset by the 
benefits of exporting to new markets. Nonetheless, these 
companies cannot survive on exports alone.
<P>
	The key market for most of these companies is and will continue 
to be the domestic market. Canadian mines are the primary buyer 
of Canadian mine manufacturing products. This is due to the 
natural advantage of proximity and the fact that many of these 
Canadian products are technically superior.
<P>
	This design and engineering superiority is the result of years of 
research and development which occurred during more prosperous 
times. In order to maintain the advantage especially in cutting edge 
technology, we must ensure the future viability of the Canadian ore 
reserves.
<P>
	The motion and the recommendation suggested here today by the 
hon. member for Timiskaming-French River addresses many of 
the issues needed to revitalize the Canadian mining industry. 
Foreign mines are not necessarily prospering because they have 
larger or better ore reserves. They are prospering because the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13215"> 13215 </A></B>
<P>
investment  climate in those countries is such that the mines can be 
developed and exploited with a higher expectation of profit.
<P>
	Many foreign governments have acted to attract investment 
dollars through tax breaks and incentives. In Canada one of the 
chief disincentives to investing in mining is the high non-profit 
taxes and other charges which artificially increase the cost of doing 
business here. This has hindered our ability to attract new investors 
while at the same time companies operating here have had to make 
cuts to other areas in order to ensure their profitability.
<P>
	One of the key areas that has suffered is exploration. This is a 
grave tragedy because without exploration there will be fewer 
discoveries of ore deposits and therefore fewer new mines. If this 
continues, the mining industry in Canada will die a slow and 
painful death along with most of the associated manufacturing 
industries.
<P>
	The motion before the House today asks us to consider making 
changes to the investment climate as it relates to the mining 
industry, particularly in the area of mine exploration. What is 
proposed is not radical. It calls for the implementation of the 
majority of the recommendations put forward by the natural 
resources committee of the House.
<P>
	In truth, by encouraging the exploration for and the development 
of mines the government will be creating jobs and stimulating the 
economy which can only serve to increase revenues. Most 
important, by encouraging exploration we will be increasing the 
probability of finding new ore deposits. These undiscovered 
resources represent the future of the Canadian mining industry. 
They will be the mines of the next century.
<P>
	If we do not prepare the way for its future then I fear our mining 
industry will falter. If the mines fail then I expect the small and 
medium size companies manufacturing and supplying mining 
materials will not survive. These are the companies which support 
the local economy in my riding of Nipissing and it is for this reason 
that I speak in favour of the motion today.
<P>
	We as parliamentarians must act to ensure the future viability of 
the mining industry in Canada. Motion No. 292 represents an effort 
to address the fundamental problems facing the industry today. If 
we make it more attractive for investors to bring their money here 
or to keep it here, then we will be assured that the process of the 
exploration and development of mineral resources will become 
healthy once again.
<P>
	Canada is a world leader in mining and mining technology, but 
this position has been challenged in the last decade. I am 
supporting the motion today because I believe it represents one of 
the steps we need to take to recapture a position we have rightfully 
earned.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as chairman of the northern Ontario caucus I am very 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Motion No. 292 put 
forward by my colleague from Timiskaming-French River.
<P>
	Mining in northern Ontario is of historical significance. It has 
provided significant economic growth in northern Ontario and is 
the source of a significant number of jobs. It is a very important 
industry in northern Ontario. The motion talks to the need and the 
logic of government continuing to support the industry.
<P>
	Canada's mining industry is the third largest in the world. It 
employs over 330,000 people and adds over $20 billion to the 
Canadian economy. The Canadian shield which covers northern 
Ontario is one of the richest ore bodies in the world. We produce 
over 60 different commodities. We have almost 500 mines and 
quarries. Unlike many other industries, when jobs are created in the 
mining industry there is a spinoff effect of almost 6:1 as compared 
to several others where it is 2:1 or 3:1.
<P>
	However, mining is different from many of our resource based 
industries. It is not a renewable resource. One thing that is known 
when a mine is open is that eventually it will close. That is why it is 
absolutely essential that we search out, seek and explore for new 
supplies.
<P>
	Canada is fortunate to have the reserves. We can continue to 
mine far into the future but we need to take action. We need to 
provide the incentives that will enable our companies to go out 
there to search out these areas of new supplies. Government should 
and will create a climate in which the private sector will be able to 
do so. Government needs to invest in exploration and in 
development.
<P>
	There are three broad areas in which we should be doing this. 
First, I mention creating an environment that allows the industry to 
prosper; second, creating a tax regime that is conducive to 
exploration; and, third, providing technological and other 
assistance to the industry.
<P>
	In respect of the environment, creating the budgetary climate in 
which business and industry as a whole can prosper is important. 
Our budget of last February brought in government expenditure 
controls and brought in a firm plan to reduce the deficit. It will help 
not only the mining industry but all industries in Canada.
<P>
	Trade must be encouraged and international barriers must be 
decreased and relaxed. The Ministry of Natural Resources program 
to encourage trade by going to Europe and Asia and explaining to 
the world what is available in Canada is an important initiative. We 
have to go out there to create an environment by co-ordinating 
environmental assessments between the federal government and 
the provinces and to provide certainty to  companies so that they 
<P>

<B><A NAME="13216"> 13216 </A></B>
<P>
know how long and exactly what is going to be necessary to 
develop a particular find.
<P>
	We need to create a tax regime in the country that is competitive 
with the world so that when a company is deciding to invest in 
exploration it will choose Canada because it receives treatment that 
is equivalent or similar to that in the rest of the world. I am 
referring to things like accelerated depreciation, research and 
development tax credits on technical research, and moderate source 
deductions. We need to do something about source deductions such 
as our reduction in the UI premium. We need a competitive tax 
regime on profits. As was mentioned earlier by one of my 
colleagues, contributions to mine reclamation were made tax 
deductible in 1994. We need to look at the income earned within 
those funds being tax deductible.
<P>
	We need to help the industry in terms of technology and other 
areas. Seeing as we are coming to a close of private members' hour, 
let me conclude by saying that we need to support the mining 
industry. It is a large employer and important source of 
international trade. For many areas of rural Canada, including 
northern Ontario, it is the backbone of our economies.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the bottom 
of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	Orders of the day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, I move-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. In terms of 
process I am calling for orders of the day. The table officer will 
indicate what those orders are and then I will deal with the matter 
of recognizing the government House leader.

<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MOTIONSINAMENDMENT">MOTIONS IN AMENDMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the problem, with Bill C-76, is in the section dealing with 
transfer payments-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I would like to check 
something with the officers at the Table, and I will get back to the 
hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.
<P>
	The debate is on Motion No. 3 at the moment. I understand that 
the hon. member has already participated in the debate on this 
motion. He cannot therefore speak again on Motion No. 3.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-76 and on the motions in 
group No. 3.
<P>
	One of the biggest threats we have to all aspects of society is the 
budget brought down last February. Nothing else will have a 
greater effect on social programs, health care, education, RCMP 
and in the House than the budget. Decades of irresponsible 
overspending by Liberals and Conservatives alike have put the 
things we cherish in grave danger.
<P>
	Briefly summarizing the situation, we now find ourselves 
federally with a debt of $570 billion and provincially with a debt of 
some $240 billion.
<P>
	We proposed a long time ago, before the budget came down, that 
we would have a balanced budget and we shared with the 
government our views on how to do that. Unfortunately the 
government did not heed us. What we will see in three years' time 
with the budget proposed by the government is a debt which will be 
$100 billion greater than what it is now and an interest payment 
which will go from $40 billion to $50 billion per year.
<P>
	The money we have to spend on the programs I mentioned will 
decrease from $120 billion to $102 billion. How will the 
government fulfil its responsibilities to the Canadian public? Those 
are responsibilities on which Canadians rely. The reality is that the 
government simply cannot do it.
<P>
	We must prioritise our spending. We must define that which is 
most valuable to the Canadian people by listening to them to 
discover what they value the most. We must have the courage to cut 
where cuts are required. The cuts must be fair and be sensitive. 
They must ensure the people who cannot take care of themselves 
will be taken care of. The programs which are to be preserved, 
those meant to take care of individuals in need, will be  compro-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13218"> 13218 </A></B>
<P>
mised. Those individuals who are least able to take care of 
themselves will bear the brunt of the budget.
<P>
	We introduced a plan which would reduce our deficit to zero in 
three years. Our plan would also attack the real ogre in the 
equation, our debt.
<P>
	Two areas I will focus on are health care and aboriginal affairs. 
The government claimed it was actually cutting spending but the 
reality is it took $6 billion out of its $11 billion in cuts from 
transfer payments to the provinces. That will compromise two 
areas integral to our society, health care and education.
<P>
	The government is saying it will take money away from the 
provinces but that they must provide the same services which they 
did before and in a timely fashion. The government also said to the 
provinces that because of the Canada Health Act they could not 
raise the funds themselves. It would hamstring them. Therefore, 
the provinces are now forced and have been forced for some time to 
ration health care.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Tragically what we saw this past weekend was the manifestation 
of rationing in health care. At the Ottawa Heart Institute 25 people 
died while awaiting surgery. These were 25 deaths that need not 
have happened if there had been enough money to pay for them. 
That is what is happening. Ironic in this is that the head of the heart 
institute is Senator Keon. He substantiated this claim by saying part 
of the problem is there is not enough money to pay for what we ask 
for in health care.
<P>
	We must understand this is one example of many. In British 
Columbia one can wait 13 months even if in severe pain to get a 
new hip. I ask members to put themselves in the shoes of an elderly 
person in severe pain needing to get a hip replacement but could 
not. What a tragedy to endure those months of pain.
<P>
	Prince George wanted to ensure a safe and effective blood 
transfusion system and so patients were given the option of getting 
their own blood by withdrawing it before surgery and then having it 
put back in during surgery. It would cost $150 per unit. The 
government refused to pay for it, which was fine because the 
patients were prepared to pay for it. It was a much safer way of 
providing blood transfusions. Within one month the provincial 
government said no to this because it goes against the Canada 
Health Act. The government will forbid Canadians from receiving 
their own blood, blood that would be free of HIV, hepatitis B and 
other disorders. The hospital now has to pay $500 a unit in order to 
get blood for transfusions. What a waste.
<P>
	We need to amend the Canada Health Act. Let us get a new 
Canada Health Act, one made in Canada, one unlike that in the 
United States and unlike that in the United Kingdom. We must 
define essential services and ensure those services are covered for 
every Canadian  regardless of income. The rest can be done through 
private insurance and such.
<P>
	We should allow the provinces to raise their own money and 
allow private clinics to occur, assuming essential services will be 
covered. This is not a threat to public health care at all because it 
would enable individuals to pay for health care where they need it. 
Some individuals would go off the public system into the private 
system which would provide more money on a per capita basis for 
people in the public. This would enable them to get health access 
particularly for essential services in a timely fashion. What is 
happening now is the Canadian public is not getting it done in a 
timely fashion.
<P>
	The next thing I will look at is the Department of Indian affairs 
and the sad state of affairs among some of the aboriginal peoples. I 
need not talk about the litany of problems they are having right 
now. I ask each member to visit a few reserves and see for 
themselves the tragedy many aboriginal people are facing today 
within their society. Even though we are cutting money from many 
segments of our budget, one area that is increasing and will 
increase by 12 per cent over the next three years, about $600 
million, is the department of Indian affairs.
<P>
	Despite a decrease in the civil service we found the Indian 
industry of lawyers, negotiators and advisers is actually increasing. 
This increase in growth rate is the largest Ottawa dependent 
industry we have right now. Is this valid?
<P>
	We are trying to redress the tragedy we see in many social circles 
on native reserves; substance abuse, unemployment, general 
malaise and sexual abuse are rampant. This needs to be rectified 
immediately. However, it will not be solved by pouring money into 
the system as we have done before and continue to do. This does a 
terrible disservice.
<P>
	The aboriginal leadership cries for more land. However, will this 
really help the aboriginal people? I think not. Claims have been put 
forward, such as Nishga claim, in the amount of over $400 million. 
The government has to pay for this and it amounts to $97,000 per 
person. Is this really going to help native people on reserves who 
will not receive any help? I think not.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	We are trying to help the native people to help themselves. I 
maintain that our current programs will not do this. We must, 
therefore, go back to first principles, the basics of human need, the 
basics of human condition.
<P>
	Natives and non-natives alike need to have a sense of purpose, a 
sense of destiny and of control. With our current policies we have 
created an institutionalized welfare state of internalized 
dependency. People ask not what they can do for themselves but 
what we can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13219"> 13219 </A></B>
<P>
do for  them. There is a terrible malaise of the soul which current 
spending practices will not rectify.
<P>
	I propose taking a new look at the situation. In order to do this, 
people must have a sense of self-respect and destiny. People have 
to be provided with the skills to take care of themselves, provided 
with employment. This is the only way they will be able to take 
care of themselves in the future.
<P>
	External assistance is not a substitute for the fundamental need 
for people to provide for themselves and make valuable 
contributions to society.
<P>
	In closing, I would strongly urge the government to invest in 
policies that will enable native people to take care of themselves in 
a sustainable way in the future. Land claims are not the answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, most members have have had an 
opportunity to speak to the motions in group No. 3.
<P>
	I would like to refer to the motions presented by the opposition 
members and to put on record the government's response to them 
and why we are not voting in support of them.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 20, 21, and 22, as proposed by the member for 
Kamloops and I believe supported by the NDP, propose that the 
WGTA would remain in force. The government is committed to 
changing the WGTA because it feels that after years of discussions 
on the prairies, the time has come to transform the grain handling 
system in western Canada. Liberals are very confident that the way 
the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, the Minister of 
Transport and the Minister of Finance have developed this 
legislation is correct, that the proper consultations have taken place 
and now the country is ready to proceed.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 75 and 76 are proposed by the member for 
Lethbridge. Motion No. 75 would reverse the government 
amendment adopted by the Standing Committee on Finance on 
May 18 of this year. The purpose of the government's amendment 
is to ensure that an equitable arrangement with respect to the 
transition payment is made by a landowner and his tenant. Many 
farm groups have specifically requested that the government make 
the amendment to the WGTA in the legislation known as Bill C-76.
<P>
	Motion No. 76, also proposed by the member for Lethbridge, 
would reverse the government's amendment adopted by the 
Standing Committee on Finance on May 18 of this year. The 
purpose of the government amendment is to ensure that an 
equitable arrangement with respect to the transition payment is 
made by a landowner and his tenant as requested by many farm 
groups. The government's amendment to subsection 4(4)(c) is to 
provide for the tax treatment to be given to  that portion of a 
transition payment made by an owner to his tenant.
<P>
	The government in amending the WGTA to provide that an 
equitable arrangement is reached between an owner and his tenant 
is being responsive to the concerns expressed by many producers.
<P>
	Motion No. 77, also proposed by the member for Lethbridge on 
behalf of his party, proposes that subsection 6(c) be deleted. That 
section allows the minister of agriculture to make regulations 
prescribing conditions that must be met by an applicant in order for 
him to receive a transition payment, including the condition that an 
equitable arrangement be reached between the applicant and 
tenant. This would reverse the government amendment adopted by 
the Standing Committee on Finance on May 18. The purpose of the 
amendment is to ensure an equitable arrangement with respect to 
the transition payment is made by a landowner and his tenant as 
requested by many farm groups.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Finally, in this group of motions, the finance critic for the 
official opposition has not proposed that clause 26 of Bill C-76 be 
deleted. The effect of this motion would be to repeal the Western 
Grain Transportation Act but no compensation would be payable to 
owners of the prairie farmland.
<P>
	This motion would preclude the government from making any 
payments to owners of land in recognition of loss in land value that 
may result from the termination of transportation subsidies. A 
cornerstone of this legislation is to provide compensation.

would be unanimous consent that Motions Nos. 23 to 45 inclusive 
be deemed to have been read, so that Mr. Speaker will not have to 
read or ask for us to dispense on every single one.

recommendation of the chief government whip. Is it agreed?

	He said: Mr. Speaker, in the budget of February 27 the Minister 
of Finance proposed cutting over the next two years $7 billion from 
programs which transferred money to the provinces for health care, 
post-secondary education and social programs. With respect to 
social programs it would cut money for both for social services and 
social assistance. Bill C-76 is the bill which implements those and 
other budget measures.
<P>
	My amendments in group No. 4 and those in group No. 5 attempt 
to stop, attempt to kill, those cuts by deleting all those sections 
which would implement them. As I said in the earlier budget debate 
this is no fun for me. It is with no joy that I have to do this, but I 
feel I have no alternative.
<P>
	In my view these proposals in the budget are completely 
contrary to what we said in the red book during the election 
campaign. They are completely contrary to what we said during 
nine years in opposition. They are completely contrary to what we 
did when we were in government under Prime Minister Trudeau 
and Prime Minister Pearson.
<P>
	My group four amendments would do three things. First, they 
would delete clauses 30, 31 and 32 of Bill C-76, which clauses 
would cut payments under the Canada assistance plan as of April 1, 
1996. These payments would terminate the Canada assistance plan 
by the year 2000.
<P>
	The Canada assistance plan is that federal law by which social 
services and social assistance are financed in the provinces. By that 
law shelters for abused women and children, day care centres, 
foster homes, care for the aged and different types of social 
assistance are financed.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	Secondly, my amendments in this group would delete clauses 33 
to 41 inclusive of Bill C-76. These clauses would set up a new 
delivery system for reduced health care payments under the Canada 
Health Act.
<P>
	Thirdly, my amendments in this group would delete clauses 44 to 
47 inclusive, which would set up a new system for reduced 
payments to the provinces for post-secondary education and health 
care.
<P>
	In effect, my amendments if carried would stop the cuts and stop 
the new delivery system for reduced payments and reduced 
national standards for social services.
<P>
	Why am I doing this? I am doing it first of all because social 
programs in this country are not the cause of the deficit. In a 
question put to the Minister of Finance approximately two weeks 
before the budget in February, a member of this House asked him 
whether social programs were the cause of the deficit. The Minister 
of Finance said no. As a matter of fact he said that social programs 
were the same percentage of gross domestic product today that they 
were 20 years ago in 1975. Therefore, if social programs are not the 
cause of the deficit, why are they being attacked in the bill, whose 
goal it is to reduce the deficit?
<P>
	Second, I am opposed to those provisions in the budget and in 
the budget bill because they would cause severe harm to those in 
need. They would widen the gap between rich and poor in this 
country and in my view lead to social unrest and increased crime.
<P>
	Let me refer to a few recent articles. If members look at the 
business section of Saturday's Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>, June 3, they will see 
an article entitled ``The Widening Gap'' in which the former head 
of the Economic Council of Canada, Judith Maxwell, is warning 
that even if there is an improvement in the standard of living over 
the next few years, not everyone will share in it. She went on to say 
that we can expect increasing polarization in our society.
<P>
	We can also look at a recent article in the <I>Citizen</I> dated April 6, 
1995, in which the headline is ``500,000 fall into poverty''. This is 
an article on the annual report of the National Council on Welfare, 
entitled ``Poverty Profile'', in which they say that nearly half a 
million more Canadians became poor in 1993, even though the 
economy was pulling out of the recession.
<P>
	Then we have the committee of the United Nations, which for 
the second time in three years is criticizing the Canadian 
government because the Canadian government is failing to meet its 
obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights. In particular, they refer to Bill C-76.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to refer members of this House to an 
excellent book that has appeared recently. It is a book  by Linda 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13222"> 13222 </A></B>
<P>
McQuaig called <I>Shooting the Hippo</I>, in which she deals at great 
length with many of the issues I am discussing today.
<P>
	I am also opposed to those provisions in the budget because they 
are contrary to what we promised during the election campaign. I 
want to read once again what we said in our red book at page 74:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since 1984, the Tories have systematically weakened the social support network 
that took generations to build. Not only have they taken billions of dollars from 
health care and from programs that support children, seniors, and people who have 
lost their jobs, but they have set us on the path to becoming a polarized society 
divided into rich and poor, educated and uneducated, with a shrinking middle class. 
This is not the kind of country most Canadians want to live in. In a polarized society, 
crime, violence, intolerance, and group hatred flourish.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what we said during the election campaign when we said 
that we would attack the deficit. I agreed with that, that we would 
reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic product within 
three years of taking office. However, we said that we would not do 
it by reducing social programs. We said we would do it by cutting 
out waste in government, by getting rid of non-productive 
expenditure, by closing the gaps and holes in the tax system, and by 
providing for economic growth by providing for jobs so that people 
would be paying taxes instead of collecting unemployment 
insurance and social welfare, so that businesses would earn profits 
and pay taxes instead of going bankrupt. That is what we said 
during the election campaign.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I am wondering what happened in this country to the doctrine of 
the living wage. When I was at St. Francis Xavier University in 
Antigonish during the fifties we studied two great encyclicals of 
the Catholic Church, Rerum Novarum, which was from the late 
19th century, and Quadrogesimo Anno, which came out during the 
1930s, which taught the doctrine of a living wage. That doctrine 
was that everybody who works has the right to a wage to support 
themselves and their families with basic necessities. With the type 
of direction in which we are going today, with people working 
part-time, for minimum wages, with no unions and no support 
services, we are going completely contrary to that doctrine, which I 
thought was an excellent doctrine. I have supported it over the 
years. By the way, it was the philosophy by which I approached 
these sorts of problems in Parliament. That doctrine seems to have 
disappeared from the landscape of Canada.
<P>
	I would like to say a word about affordability. Some people say 
that we cannot afford these programs today. However, we have an 
expanding number of consumer goods and services. Does it seem 
right that we can afford an expanding number of consumer goods 
and services but we cannot afford post-secondary education, health 
care, and social services at the level we set them at from the middle 
1960s on? Is not the business community  caught in a 
contradiction? They are saying on the one hand that we cannot 
afford these very important services at the usual level. On the other 
hand, through advertising they are urging us to buy more and more 
consumer goods and services. They are urging us to take out loans 
so we can buy more and more. They are urging us to use our credit 
cards to the hilt. What can we afford?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I note that you are indicating my time is coming to 
a close. I simply want to say in conclusion that I regret I have to 
make these sorts of interventions in the House. However, I cannot 
contribute to tearing down a system that for my 29 years in the 
House I helped build up with the Liberal Party, first under Mr. 
Pearson when he was Prime Minister, then Mr. Trudeau, and when 
we followed the same philosophy for nine years in opposition. I 
just cannot do it.
<P>
	I ask my colleagues to look very carefully at the things we said in 
opposition and in the red book. I ask that we be honest and fair and 
follow through on those things.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I think this time it is really my turn and I am much obliged 
to you for allowing me to speak on the fourth group of motions on 
Bill C-76.
<P>
	Bill C-76, as it relates to the Canada social transfer, poses a 
major problem to Quebec. As the Leader of the Opposition 
mentioned again at second reading in particular, the problem is 
enormous. We said so during the finance committee clause by 
clause study of this bill. We, in Quebec, have a major problem with 
this bill on social transfers, because the federal government is 
cutting shamelessly in transfers to the provinces in the areas of 
social assistance, post-secondary education and health.
<P>
	It is a disgrace to reduce these transfers on the backs of health 
care users, the underprivileged who have to rely on welfare or 
students, who are already among the most vulnerable groups in our 
society these days; just look at the number of students covered with 
degrees who are searching for jobs.
<P>
	Quebec also has a major problem with this bill as it seems to 
reflect the intention to ultimately impose standards or general 
guidelines throughout Canada, including Quebec, in the areas of 
social assistance, health and post-secondary education.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	During the debate at second reading, we were a little surprised 
when the Minister of Finance announced, out of the blue, the 
amendments which he was going to table to satisfy Quebec and 
make sure that it does not have the impression of being again the 
victim of strong arm tactics, like in 1981, because that is what it is.
<P>
	But this is yet another attempt to isolate Quebec. Indeed, Quebec 
will never fit into the mould imposed by Canada-wide standards, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13223"> 13223 </A></B>
<P>
particularly in the education  sector, which is the cornerstone of 
Quebecers' identity. Education is the cornerstone of the Quebec 
culture; it is the instrument which ensures its continuity. 
Consequently, Quebec will never accept to toe the line, to follow 
general guiding principles and even promote them, as asked by the 
other nine provinces and the federal government, in a sector as vital 
as education.
<P>
	Let me go back to the Minister of Finance. He said that he was 
tabling amendments designed to make Bill C-76 acceptable to 
Quebec, as regards the implementation of Canada-wide standards. 
This is the last version of the bill, as tabled by the minister. It reads: 
``The Minister of Human Resources Development shall invite 
representatives of all the provinces to consult and work together to 
develop, through mutual consent,''-the expression ``mutual 
consent'' is never defined-``a set of shared principles and 
objectives for the other social programs''-these other social 
programs are post-secondary education and social 
assistance-``referred to in paragraph (1)(d) that could underlie the 
Canada Health and Social Transfer''.
<P>
	The first question that comes to mind, as I said while reading the 
clause, is what do we mean by mutual consent? Does it mean an 
amendment tabled by the Minister of Finance? If we look back at 
the recent past, the last 10 to 12 years of relations between Quebec, 
Canadian provinces and the federal government, we see that things 
were normally done by mutual consent, and that mutual consent 
could be, for example, the agreement of the federal government 
and seven provinces constituting 50 per cent of the population. 
That is what mutual consent could be, and it could be used to 
establish national education standards and to force Quebec to make 
the decision to either get in line and follow the guiding principles 
or national standards or to have the federal government cut off all 
funding. This is what it could come down to.
<P>
	If that is what mutual consent means, to establish a national 
consensus, this bill settles nothing. On the contrary, the version 
revised by the Minister of Finance is even worse than the initial 
version, which said: ``maintaining national standards, where 
appropriate''. Now, appropriateness is not even in the picture. They 
will take the agreements signed by the provinces and the federal 
government and will impose them across Canada, without even 
giving Quebec a chance to say its two bits.
<P>
	I must say that this is quite a sensitive issue for Quebecers, as 
Quebec has been strong-armed many times before, in particular in 
1981, by the Prime Minister of the time who was a main player if 
not the band leader in the patriation of the constitution against 
Quebec's will, the person responsible for Quebec's isolation.
<P>
	The national standards contained in Bill C-76, in the part on the 
Canada social transfer and research, are another example of the 
Prime Minister of the day strong-arming Quebec. In the history of 
relations  between Quebec and Canada, the Prime Minister has 
always specialized in strong-arm tactics against Quebec. It is not 
surprising to see a bill like this one introduced by a Minister of 
Finance whose boss is the present Prime Minister and a former 
lieutenant of Pierre Elliott Trudeau.
<P>
	And it comes as no surprise to see another instance of strong arm 
tactics as the government tries to shove national standards down 
Quebec's throat, in a sector as crucial as education, when we know 
that the present Prime Minister led the second attempt to strong 
arm Quebec which led to the demise of Meech Lake in 1990. He 
was there with his cellular phone in the hallways on Parliament 
Hill, conferring with the leader of the opposition in Manitoba, Mrs. 
Carstairs. He was giving her his instructions on the Meech Lake 
Accord.
<P>
	He instructed her to isolate Quebec, to make Quebecers feel they 
were left out. This comes as no surprise.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	We are not surprised but we are amazed that this government is 
so blatant in its approach. It makes no bones about it. They seem to 
think there is nothing wrong with calling this flexible federalism: 
giving the provinces full jurisdiction over areas which belong 
under their jurisdiction in any case. We are not surprised to see this 
third instance of strong arming in ten years, but we are surprised to 
see the government drop any pretence at diplomacy and do this 
openly, putting everything on the table and saying that if Quebec 
does not like it, its funding will be cut. That means up to $7 billion 
could be cut annually, the equivalent of federal transfer payments 
for the three items I mentioned before.
<P>
	Whether the government likes it or not, during clause by clause 
consideration of the bill in the Standing Committee on Finance, 
there were various representations. I would say that 90 per cent of 
those from the provinces, with the exception of Quebec, asked for 
national standards. However, all representations from Quebec, 
without exception, objected to setting national standards, 
especially in the ultra sensitive education sector.
<P>
	Whether people like it or not, whether it was rejected or not in 
1990, there is a distinct society in Quebec, and a distinct nation. 
And this people will never allow English Canada to decide what 
should constitute the objectives of a pillar of Quebec's cultural 
future. Never will Quebec permit this sort of policy to be imposed 
on the province on the pretext of establishing a coast to coast 
standard in Canada.
<P>
	Never will we allow Bill C-76 to make Quebec toe the line, as 
the present Prime Minister has tried to do since 1980, by promising 
us all sorts of reforms following a ``no'' vote on Quebec 
sovereignty, but by doing the opposite. That is, he has worked to 
Quebec's  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13224"> 13224 </A></B>
<P>
disadvantage over the 15 years that followed. We will never agree 
to Bill C-76 in its present form.
<P>
	We will never allow the Canada social transfer, which the federal 
government has already cut by $2.5 billion, to be applied uniformly 
and despite Quebec's refusal to such sensitive sectors as education. 
We will never permit the present Prime Minister to continue his 
dirty deeds against Quebec, which began following the referendum 
in 1980, continued in 1981 with the patriation of the Canadian 
constitution, despite the wishes of the National Assembly, and 
carried on in 1990 in his work against the Meech Lake accord, 
which did not recognize Quebecers as a distinct people, but simply 
allowed us the strict minimum, a minor distinction as regards the 
distinct society.
<P>
	We will fight the provisions of Bill C-76 with our last ounce of 
energy, as the purpose of this bill is to isolate Quebec as the Prime 
Minister has done since his arrival in politics.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the hon. government member who spoke 
before the last member. I would like to commend this gentleman 
for his honesty in addressing squarely the fact that these new 
provisions under Bill C-76 for transfer of money from the federal 
government to the provinces to help pay for and support social 
programs are in total contradiction to the position taken and the 
promises made in the Liberal red book during the election. The 
member is to be commended for urging the government to show 
some integrity in the way it carries out the promises it made to 
Canadians.
<P>
	The government knew or ought to have known that this country 
was in some financial difficulty. It should have been honest with 
the Canadian people during the election, as other parties were, and 
forthrightly suggested to them that changes would be made. 
However, it did not. In spite of that, changes were made by the 
government to funding for social programs, among them under Bill 
C-76.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	The unfortunate thing is that these changes were not made in a 
planned and managed way. They were not made in a way that 
would allow the provinces to properly and sensibly deal with the 
changes, the funding drops and the different rules the federal 
government unilaterally decided to play by and imposed on the 
provinces in Bill C-76.
<P>
	This is causing a great deal of difficulty for the provinces, which 
are responsible for delivering these services to Canadians, and 
thereby to Canadians themselves. The difficulties of poor 
government leadership and planning really go right down to the 
bottom line which is where people are or are not being served.
<P>
	With respect to the funding for the Canada assistance plan or 
welfare, the money for CAP is presently based on a per capita 
formula. The money which the federal government provides to the 
provinces for welfare payments is based upon the welfare rates and 
population of each province. The more money the province spends 
on welfare because of its rates or caseload, the more money is 
transferred.
<P>
	What Bill C-76 does is to provide a new formula. There are at 
least two things wrong with the formula, maybe more. The first is 
that it was imposed without any consultation with the provinces. 
This is rather shocking when we think about the fact that people's 
lives are involved in this about which Liberal members always say 
they are so concerned. They are so concerned about compassion, 
fairness, equity and all of those good things yet without the 
slightest consultation with the people who are going to be affected, 
these kinds of changes are made. The provinces are rightly upset 
and unhappy that they were not consulted and had very little chance 
to prepare or have a say in what was going to happen to them.
<P>
	The second problem with these changes is that the formula 
imposed provides a formula for transferring money only up until 
the 1996-97 fiscal year. After that there is no formula and no plan at 
all. That is a real difficulty. How are the provinces and the people 
dependent upon services supposed to plan for the future or have 
any sensible long term goals and strategies when the funding which 
is always the underpinning of a program has been so cavalierly 
dealt with?
<P>
	On asking the department, as I did, what its long term 
projections were, its five-year or 10-year projections for the 
programs based on the changes it has made in Bill C-76 that we are 
debating here today, the department said it did not have any. This is 
an absolutely shocking admission from a department which is 
supposed to be running some of the most important programs in 
our country. There are people who genuinely need these services.
<P>
	The provinces are struggling with their own debt, their own 
fiscal situation and with the bigger picture of the economy, which 
was caused by the debt and deficit situation of our federal 
government. Some people think Reformers tirelessly mention that 
but it is so critical. How are these entities supposed to deal with the 
responsibilities they have given this situation when there are these 
sudden unexpected and unexplained moves made on the provinces 
without consultation?
<P>
	We have some real difficulty. Some of the most troubling things 
to the provinces and to Canadians are provisions in Bill C-76 which 
allow the federal government to make a unilateral imposition of 
standards and rules for the use of these funds. The words in the 
section are that there will be a mutual agreement about how the 
standards are imposed. Again, according to the  department when 
questioned it had to admit that mutual agreement is not defined. 
Does it mean the federal government in one province? Does it 
mean the federal government in two provinces? Does it mean the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13225"> 13225 </A></B>
<P>
federal government in seven of the 10 provinces with 50 per cent of 
the population? We do not know. It is not defined at all.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	The federal government is diminishing its support for these 
programs but has the gall to say it is going to say how the money 
will be spent. It is going to call the shots. It is going to call the tune 
even though it is not paying the piper. This is a recipe for disaster.
<P>
	The provincial governments very rightly one of these days and 
probably sooner than later are going to tell the federal government 
to go take a hike, as they are already doing on health care. How can 
the federal government impose its own will on the provinces, 
especially when it very obviously is so poorly thought out and 
poorly managed when it is diminishing greatly the support it is 
giving the provinces for these programs?
<P>
	We have a federal government that wants to decide everything 
but other people are going to pay for it. Not only that, other people 
are going to pay for it in an atmosphere under a regime that keeps 
changing unilaterally. This simply is not workable for our social 
programs and for the support that this country's needy, who truly 
are needy and need the support under the welfare program, are 
wanting to retain.
<P>
	When we look at Bill C-76 and the changes in the payments 
made under it, especially to the whole area of CAP funding we 
need to look at the fact that there should be some real consultation 
with the provinces, some mutual agreement. This is supposed to be 
a co-operative federalism. Instead, we have a very haughty, a very 
arrogant, a very single minded national government changing the 
rules in the middle of the game. It is changing them in the short 
term without any long term plan. It even admits that and then 
expects the provinces to continue to deliver services on standards 
that the federal government insists upon and sets.
<P>
	What happens if the provinces do not fall into line? Under this 
bill, any payment the federal government might be making to the 
provinces can be interfered with. This is simply financial 
blackmail. There is no other word for it. There are many payments 
the federal government makes to the provinces under a variety of 
agreements. Yet the federal government says it can and will 
abrogate any and all of those agreements if the provinces do not toe 
the line the way the federal government thinks they should on a 
number of service delivery issues such as CAP.
<P>
	I would suggest to the Liberal government that this is no way to 
run a country. It is certainly no way to run a country where many 
levels of government, particularly  the two main ones, are 
responsible for the well-being of citizens and for providing 
services and spending the citizens' money in a way that best 
benefits everyone.
<P>
	When a federal government is so arrogant it actually stands and 
says that things must be done its way or any dollars it might have 
promised are at risk, what kind of management style is that? How is 
that going to get co-operation? How is that going to get interaction 
among levels of government that really will benefit all the citizens?
<P>
	We very strongly condemn the way this has been done. We 
acknowledge and Canadians realize there have to be changes to the 
structure of funding programs. However, this kind of change and 
the way in which it has been done is totally unacceptable and 
totally against the best interests of our country.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to second the motion of the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. It is true that the clauses in Bill C-76 which 
the member is proposing we delete, and I am in agreement with 
that, represent a fundamental restructuring of the social and health 
system of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	It certainly makes a mockery of the review done by the human 
resources minister in which many people participated thinking that 
they could have real input. It certainly makes a mockery of the 
national health forum that was supposedly established to set out 
more clearly a national system of health.
<P>
	Most concerning about the clauses that are proposed to be 
deleted is that they change Canada in a very profound way. While 
social and health programs are of foremost importance to citizens 
of the country in their daily lives, there are important economic 
programs that provide a social infrastructure absolutely essential to 
the competitiveness of the country.
<P>
	It is shocking the Liberals have joined with the Bloc and Reform 
parties to dismantle national programs. Rather than saying up front 
that they are prepared to dismantle the programs, the Liberals are 
prepared to do it as one article recently stated: ``by erosion through 
stealth, by the death of a thousand cuts''.
<P>
	Even today the government has brought in limited debating time 
for an extremely serious issue. It suggests that not only are the 
Liberals not keeping their promises in the red book but they do not 
want it brought before Canadians who will look at it more carefully 
and see the real implications. The shift has come without a full 
public debate. That is why it is so important to have a full debate in 
the House.
<P>
	On other issues, whether the use of drugs in sports or medicare, 
we had independent commissions. This is one proposal I have 
made because of the long term impact of  the clauses we are now 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13226"> 13226 </A></B>
<P>
asking to be deleted. They should be deleted until there has been 
further in depth study of the long term social and economic 
implications to the country.
<P>
	The Liberal government is sending a clear message to Canadians 
that it is willing to abandon its responsibility to promote economic 
and social equality. Canadians should be reminded once again that 
the Liberal Party won the last election on its promise to make job 
creation the number one priority of the federal government. Instead 
Bill C-76, a financial bill, kicks the legs out from under some of the 
supports that have softened recessions in the past and would do so 
in the future.
<P>
	At a time when child poverty is at the highest rate we have had in 
history, when the United Nations is criticizing us for our 
lamentable record on poverty issues and when many young people 
are giving up hope, the government has all but abandoned the 
promises that brought it here.
<P>
	Does the government have a national vision in terms of these 
important programs. We can only judge by its actions. When 
Canadians look at the clauses in Bill C-76, they will wonder about a 
government whose only goal seems to be to complete the 
downward spiral of social programs and encourage the lowering of 
wages and benefits for Canadian workers everywhere.
<P>
	The $7 billion cut to federal transfers for post-secondary 
education, health care and social assistance will have a profound 
effect in further creating the haves and have not provinces and 
territories. The Canadian Hospital Association and the Canadian 
Medical Association have expressed their concerns about specific 
clauses of the bill. They are experts in the field who know what the 
effect will be on health care should the clauses pass.
<P>
	The bill is not about making a small change to social and health 
programs. It is about dismantling them. The block funding 
arrangement means that funding from the federal government will 
not be tied to specific programs. It suggests that the government no 
longer embodies a national vision of the programs. That is why I 
say the motion must be supported. There must be much more study 
and much more understanding by Canadians about very important 
decisions on the future of health care and social programs.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	My colleague from the Bloc Quebecois says that national 
standards are terrible. They have guaranteed, particularly under the 
Canada Health Act, some equity from sea to sea to sea. There is no 
guarantee it will continue. There is no guarantee at all. As the 
funding is not just reduced but no longer available from the federal 
government, the federal government will no longer have a say in 
implementation in the provinces and territories.
<P>
	Under Bill C-76 the cash transfers to the provinces and 
territories will run out within the next decade. Without the power of 
enforcement the federal government will not be able to maintain 
medicare as a public not for profit system.
<P>
	Even Liberal members of the finance committee who studied the 
bill opposed the plan, because it is a betrayal of everything the 
country has stood for. We are in a mad rush to the bottom. I am 
afraid we have not seen the end of it from the government.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is on record as saying that we need to get our 
health care spending down and that maybe the Canada social 
transfer is one of the ways he will do it.
<P>
	Let us look at the facts. We are spending about 10 per cent of 
GDP on health care. The Prime Minister says that is too much. The 
major increases in health care costs continue to come from 
increasing drug costs and private health insurance for extended 
health coverage. We spend only about 6.8 per cent of GDP on 
public insurance.
<P>
	The Liberal government can do something to reduce health 
expenditures. It can rescind and repeal Bill C-91 that provided 
patent protection for multinational drug companies and 
dramatically increased drug costs and the costs to every health plan 
in every province and every territory.
<P>
	The United States spends far more on health care than we do. It 
is precisely because it has a private system that is out of control. If 
one charts the statistics one can see that until the late 1960s when 
Canada introduced its public system health care costs were rising at 
about the same rate in the United States and in Canada. We spent 
about the same proportion of GDP on health. However when our 
public system was introduced we began to save money. The growth 
rate in the United States has continued to skyrocket where ours has 
levelled off. Now the United States looks to us for solutions.
<P>
	The government promised that it would not withdraw from or 
abandon the health care field but the bill breaks the promise. The 
government is abandoning every Canadian who trusted the 
government. It is abandoning poor Canadians and the unemployed. 
It is abandoning the ill.
<P>
	I despair for the country when the government has turned its 
back on the people. I strongly oppose Bill C-76. I strongly support 
the motion of the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. I urge 
and indeed plead with the government to delete the clauses so there 
may be further discussion, public debate and open debate on the 
serious and fundamental restructuring of the social and health care 
plans.
<P>
	Should the government choose to do so, it would have praise 
from many parts of the country. This is the opportunity for 
government members to vote for the motion to delete the clauses 
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to take part in the debate at report stage of Bill C-76, an Act to 
implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on 
February 27, 1995.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	I oppose this bill, which maintains national standards in the 
health field and provides for the introduction of new national 
standards with respect to social assistance and post-secondary 
education. These measures fly in the face of the provinces' 
autonomy and jurisdiction. If the provinces did not comply with 
these national standards, the federal government would impose 
sanctions by cutting transfer payments, having already cut benefits 
to the unemployed and those receiving social assistance and 
planning to target seniors next.
<P>
	This bill will affect the education sector, a sector of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction and one that is vital to Quebec's cultural 
identity. These Canada-wide standards will reflect the interests of 
the majority of English speaking provinces, not the reality of the 
special situation in Quebec, which is a distinct society.
<P>
	In my opinion, this bill has two fundamental objectives: first, to 
steam roller over the legitimate claims of the government of 
Quebec in its own areas of jurisdiction; and second, to introduce 
unprecedented cuts in provincial transfer payments and, 
consequently, in social programs.
<P>
	The first federal budget in 1994 began by offloading $5.5 billion 
in cuts onto the backs of the unemployed and $2 billion in cuts onto 
the backs of welfare recipients and the education system for the 
period from 1994 to 1997. The February 1995 budget announced 
additional cuts of $7 billion in transfer payments for social 
assistance, education and health, and another $700 million in cuts 
to unemployment insurance. Is this is the much touted flexible 
federalism of the Liberals?
<P>
	In addition, the Minister of Finance announced in his last budget 
that the government will review the old age pension plan. Seniors, 
including the 15 per cent of the population in my riding of Bourassa 
who are aged 65 or over, can now expect to see their cheques 
further eroded. I hope that seniors will again rise up and protest, as 
they did under the Mulroney government, against the deterioration 
in their living conditions, particularly with respect to pensions.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, as it is almost 2 p.m., you will 
complete your remarks after Question Period.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House will 
now proceed to statements by members.

	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, francophone 
minorities outside Quebec still face multiple frustrations ranging 
from the violation of their education rights to the lack of adequate 
government services in French at both the provincial and federal 
levels. Yet, instead of helping Acadian and other francophone 
communities, the Liberals prefer to lend a hand to their 
gravediggers.
<P>
	This weekend, the leader of the Liberal Party in Ontario 
confirmed her opposition to any plan to establish a French 
language university in Ontario. Mrs. McLeod did not hesitate to 
violate the constitutional rights of francophones in her province by 
delaying the creation of a French school board. At the same time, 
the Government of the Northwest Territories is following in the 
footsteps of the Ontario Liberals by refusing to recognize the 
education rights of the French speaking minority in its new 
education law. In the meantime, the federal Liberals are greeting 
this infringement of francophones' rights with silence.

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the Liberals were in opposition they roundly 
castigated the Conservative government for not speaking out 
against human rights abuses in China. In their red book of broken 
promises they said: ``We will continue to support democracy and 
respect for human rights worldwide''. Yet in government the 
Liberals have done an about face.
<P>
	The sixth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre passed 
yesterday without a whimper from this government. Yet the people 
of China are still under the boot of a repressive regime. Human 
rights abuses abound and democratic principles are squashed.
<P>
	In the face of this the government has said: ``Give us your money 
and we will turn a blind eye'', saying that trade should take 
precedence regardless of a country's poor human rights record. In 
the same vein, Canada is one of the world's leading suppliers of 
arms to the third world.
<P>
	In the red book it said: ``Canada will help develop greater 
international and intercultural collaboration in the interests of 
peace, justice and humankind''. Sadly, the red book promise has 
shown once again that it is a book of hypocrisy.

appropriate that the inauguration of this year's National 
Transportation Week took place in St. John's, Newfoundland, the 
first time the kick-off has ever been held in our province. It gave us 
the opportunity to focus on our important local and provincial 
transportation issues.
<P>
	The organization committee provided the delegates with a taste 
of Newfoundland life that included a harbour tour and a seminar at 
the Marine Institute, St. John's world class marine science research 
facility.
<P>
	As islanders, Newfoundlanders understand the value of 
transportation. We rely on marine transport to take our products to 
market and bring back to us the goods we need.
<P>
	The theme of this year's National Transportation Week is 
``Careers in Transportation: Opportunities, Training, Skills''. It is a 
reminder that the modern national transportation system requires 
highly skilled and dedicated people. We all have a stake in seeing 
that the transportation sector continues to attract the best 
candidates possible. A successful transportation sector will keep 
the country moving into the next century.

remarkable young Canadian inspired Glenn to take up this

	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
Canadian company that recently brought jobs and investment to 
Oakville is also bringing sensible cost savings to Canadian 
hospitals without harming patient care.
<P>
	In May, Livingston Healthcare Services Inc., an Ontario based 
health products distributor, opened a new logistics facility in 
Oakville. This company has introduced to Canadian hospitals a 
cost saving innovation: just in time delivery. The result is that 
hospitals no longer need to keep large, expensive inventories.
<P>
	Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto has saved over $200,000 in its 
first year using this system. While the Toronto hospital anticipates 
savings of over $1 million annually, these savings have no negative 
impact on patient care and in fact can allow money to be 
reallocated to improve it. The latest investment and expansion has 
the potential to benefit all Canadians.

serious consequences for Montreal and a disastrous impact on the

Ontario is saying that hiring on merit alone is right, workfare is 
right, and balancing the budget by a fixed date is right. Like 
Alberta, Ontario is saying that the Reform agenda is right.

Operation Blue Star, the attack on the Golden Temple, one of the 
Sikhs' holiest shrines, and the Tiananmen Square massacre.
<P>
	On June 3, 1984, the Indian army stormed the Golden Temple, 
injuring and killing hundreds and perhaps thousands in the process. 
The invasion of the Golden Temple was more than an assault on the 
shrine itself; it was an assault on the human rights of Indian people.
<P>
	On June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square was the site of a brutal 
attack on students by the Chinese army. Television cameras around 
the world recorded the horror of students being shot and run down 
by tanks.
<P>
	In China as in India, the attack on the students was not only a 
savage murder of innocent people but also a vicious attack on 
human rights and democracy.

period of 17 months, one can hardly call this a monumental failure. 
We brought unemployment down from 11.5 per cent to 9.4 per 
cent. That does not mean we are satisfied. We have to keep trying 
to create more and more jobs. I think the budget we brought down 
in February showed that we intend to put public finances on a 
sound footing and make it very attractive to invest in Canada.
<P>
	That is also why the Minister of Human Resources Development 
is preparing an income security reform proposals, so that we can 
combine our job creation programs and the way we operate our 
social services so the poor in Quebec and elsewhere will again have 
the dignity of a job, as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, these artificial figures cannot hide the fact that for the past 
five months there has been no net job creation in Canada. And that 
is the truth.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> I may remind the Prime Minister that the worst 
city in Canada in terms of poverty and dependence on government 
funds is Shawinigan, in his riding, and the fourth is Grand-Mère, in 
his riding as well.
<P>
	Jobs are becoming harder and harder to find, and because of 
repeated cuts in unemployment insurance, fewer than 50 per cent of 
the unemployed today are entitled to unemployment insurance 
benefits, compared with nearly 80 per cent five years ago.
<P>
	That being the case, could the leader of the government tell us 
whether his government intends to suspend the new cuts in 
unemployment insurance, especially those announced by his 
Minister of Finance in the last budget?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I just said, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development is working on draft proposals to ensure that resources 
earmarked for unemployment insurance and welfare payments can 
be used to create jobs or subsidize certain jobs that could not be 
created without government intervention.
<P>
	That is precisely the focus of the government's activities at this 
time. We will bring legislation before Parliament this fall, and we 
hope the opposition will help us pass it as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if it is progressive legislation to take care of the needy in 
our society, we will support it, but if it is more of the same, we will 
vote against it, even if we are alone in our defence of the needy in 
this Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Since the unemployment rate in Quebec still 
varies very little, between 11.5 per cent and 12.5 per cent, and the 
employment rate has not moved for five months, and considering 
that 50,000 more people in Quebec are living on welfare and 
thousands of unemployed workers have now been excluded from 
unemployment insurance, does the leader of the government, does 
the Prime Minister realize that his government's record on 
unemployment during the first 18 months has been dismal?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since October 1993, 173,000 new jobs were created for 
women in Quebec, and the unemployment rate for women in 
Quebec has gone down from 12.1 per cent to 10.8 per cent. That is a 
substantial improvement.
<P>

	I must say I am delighted to see the opposition take an interest 
in the real problems of this country, instead of talking about 
separation, cunning decisions, and sharp shifts and mirages. We 
want to work with everyone, with the governments of the

social and economic situation of this country. The best way would 
be to stop talking about the constitution and separation and talk 
about employment every day, the way we are doing today.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, allow me 
to remind the Prime Minister that, over the past nine years, the 
Canada that produced so many unemployed and welfare recipients 
was managed by federalists, as was the province of Quebec. This is 
the result of their policies. They should not try to muddle the issue: 
this is their legacy, and Quebecers are increasingly aware of that.
<P>
	Currently, more than half of Canada's unemployed are not even 
eligible to UI benefits any more. No question about it: this is the 
result of this government's actions. This situation shows how the 
government targeted the unemployed, rather than unemployment.
<P>
	Last year alone, the UI fund generated a $4 billion surplus, yet 
the government still intends to cut another $700 million. Given that 
surplus, and the fact that over half of the unemployed are no longer 
eligible to the UI program, will the government agree to not go 
ahead with this unacceptable cut of $700 million?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have to take into account the fact that, before us, there 
was another government, in which the Leader of the Opposition 
was a very prominent minister. That government left us with a $6 
billion deficit in the UI fund, and we have to pay it off.
<P>
	Indeed, if the Conservative Party, which included a very 
prominent minister and lieutenant for Quebec, generated such a 
deficit in the UI fund, we, as a responsible government, must pay 
that deficit, as we are doing, and re-establish a UI fund which will 
truly serve in difficult situations. That would be an easy thing to do 
now if the Conservatives, including the Leader of the Opposition, 
had not been in office for so long.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when there 
is a reference to the plight of poor people, it is the separatists' fault, 
and when there is a reference to the government's UI cuts over a 
three year period, it is the Conservatives' fault. Enough is enough.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister agree to stop being irresponsible, as he 
has been since the beginning, and will he recognize, as does the 
Quebec minister for income security, that 43 per cent, a percentage 
which reflects a  tragic situation, of the new households joining the 
welfare rolls in Quebec have been excluded from the UI program 
because of the cuts made by this government? Will the Prime 
Minister finally admit that?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I explained a minute ago that we are working on it. Since 
we formed the government the economy has created more than 
430,000 new jobs in Canada. We would like to see the situation 
improve more. The problem was put in our lap when we came here; 
11.5 per cent were not working and were on unemployment 
insurance. At the moment we are trying to solve it.
<P>
	I am delighted to see the Bloc Quebecois talking about jobs 
today. At long last it is not talking about separation, the tournage 
and the virage and tricky questions. It is talking about real 
problems. I am delighted to see the leader of the Bloc Quebecois is 
today having another virage; he is getting preoccupied with job 
creation. I am happy today.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, both the

like competence and merit with respect to the government's latest 
patronage appointments in the B.C. justice system.
<P>
	There is no possible justification for turning aside a firm with 20 
years experience in narcotics prosecution in favour of 
inexperienced political friends.
<P>
	Can the justice minister explain to the House specifically how 
the new firms in the revenue minister's Victoria riding have more 
competence and merit than the firm the government terminated?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I note with satisfaction nothing in 
the hon. member's question suggests the new agent is not 
competent. The new agent is competent.
<P>
	The premise of the hon. member's question is the appointments 
were somehow motivated by patronage. Of the new agents 
supported by the government, 38 per cent had acted as agents under 
the previous government. In British Columbia of the 38 agents 
whose mandate has been confirmed, 47 per cent had acted as agents 
for the previous government. We appoint agents on the basis of 
competence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is 
really interesting. According to the news reports we are getting 
there is serious concern on the part of law enforcement people. One 
report from Victoria says a judge last week examined a charge and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13233"> 13233 </A></B>
<P>
commented he  hoped the new drug prosecutor learned how to spell 
marijuana correctly.
<P>
	Was the justice minister made aware of the very close political 
ties between the revenue minister and the Victoria law firms before 
the appointments were made?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if we were to determine who was to 
continue as an agent for the government based on the stripe of the 
party that appointed them, it seems to me that 20 years ago the 
government in office was a Liberal government. Surely the premise 
of the hon. member's question is faulty.
<P>
	As we find agents to represent the federal interest in court we 
look for people competent for the task. That is the approach we 
have taken in British Columbia and across the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
speaking specifically about the situation in Victoria and the three 
firms there with absolute ties to the revenue minister.
<P>
	Will the minister now do the right thing and rescind these 
obvious patronage, political appointments and award the contracts 
on the basis of merit alone?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, these agents were appointed 
because they are competent to do the work they have been asked to 
do.
<P>
	The hon. member should also observe as he looks at the 
government's record of appointing legal agents the changes we 
have made with respect to training new agents, the clarity in the 
terms and conditions governing their appointment, and that we are 
addressing the issue of conflicts which has never before been 
regulated by government. We are ensuring the people who 
represent the government in court abide by those standards in 
respect of not only competence but also conflict of interest. That is 
a stride forward.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	One of the nine demands made by the Quebec women who 
marched against poverty was the creation of an accessible 
manpower training network. As all stakeholders in the labour 
market in Quebec know, Quebec's labour sector has unanimously 
demanded exclusive control over job training for the past six years.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	Does the minister realize that this extraordinary march against 
poverty organized by Quebec women clearly and  dramatically 
demonstrates the effects of the federal government's repeated 
refusal to give Quebec exclusive power over manpower training?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member draws a 
somewhat curious conclusion. The fact is that in the past year 
alone, over 50,000 women in the province of Quebec have 
benefited directly from federal employment training programs. It is 
the largest training program being offered to women throughout the 
country. We are making a very serious effort to respond to the real 
needs of women not just in Quebec but across Canada.
<P>
	In this effort it would be much more important if we could find 
the ways to work together. I am sure the women who were in the 
march this weekend would want governments to work together to 
co-operate and collaborate, not to work in terms of setting up 
separate jurisdictions, separate kinds of identity but to co-operate. 
That really is the spirit by which we can conquer poverty in this 
country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I repeat, 
Quebec has unanimously demanded power over manpower 
training. And women, some of them single parents, some of them 
stuck in low paying jobs, some of them re-entering the workforce 
after having raised their families, made the statement yesterday 
that they need a co-ordinated job training policy and they are 
asking Quebec to provide it.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that until Quebec receives 
exclusive power over manpower training, women will continue to 
be cruelly disadvantaged?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

twists the really deep and sincere interest and emotion of the 
women to try to turn it into an argument for separatism.
<P>
	What we offered a year ago is exactly what the member said. We 
offered to the province of Quebec, as we did to all provinces, a 
fully co-ordinated labour market program. We would do the

<B><A NAME="13234"> 13234 </A></B>

Canada Opportunities Agency is appalling''.
<P>
	Since these words were spoken by the current public works 
minister six years ago, I would like to ask the minister to stand and 
explain what has changed. Why is Liberal pork barrelling 
acceptable to him on highway 104 but appalling when the Tories 
did it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government and the Minister of 
Transport have answered this question time and time again.
<P>
	Highways are under provincial jurisdiction. It is up to the 
provincial minister of transport to determine the priorities of where 
he wants to put those highway funds. This government obliges 
what the province asks for and that is what we have essentially 
done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
guess we are not going to get that fellow up here to talk about this. 
Let me quote the public works minister once again. This is a recent 
quote: ``Drivers had better get used to the idea of toll booths on the 
Trans-Canada if they expect major highway projects to proceed''.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister if he would like to get up. 
In addition to the recent tax increases on gas, are we to expect these 
tolls on the Trans-Canada because his ministers are using the 
highway improvement money to buy votes in their own ridings?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again to educate the Reform 
Party, highways are under provincial jurisdiction. To toll a highway 
is the responsibility of the provincial government. Not to toll a 
highway is the responsibility of the provincial government. Surely 
the Reform Party, which calls for more autonomy for the provinces, 
would not want this federal government to intrude on provincial 
jurisdiction.

question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In 1993, Canada's child poverty rate was the second highest 
among industrialized countries. Last year, more than one in five 
Canadian children were poor. And all that the federal government 
has on its social program reform agenda are cuts, cuts, cuts.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that the problem of child poverty 
is caused by their parents' poverty and that the measures taken by 
the government since it was elected only push families closer to the 
brink of poverty, in particular by making many of them ineligible 
for unemployment insurance?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have said right from the 
beginning that one of the real purposes for undertaking a major 
modernization of our social programs is to tackle the whole 
problem of poverty faced by women and children. The beginning of 
that was to create the proper economic climate.
<P>
	I would like to point out to the hon. member that in the past year 
alone there has been an increase in employment in the province of 
Quebec. Over 42,000 new jobs have been created for women in 
Quebec. That is one important way to provide economic security. 
At the same time, as the hon. member well knows, we have put 
forward an offer and a willingness to engage in the cost sharing of a 
new child care program to enable women to more easily get back 
into the workforce.
<P>
	We are certainly open and willing to have discussions with the 
provinces. We have already set in motion a program with the 
aboriginal First Nations of this country to start a child care 
program. We would certainly like to continue that work in 
discussions with the provinces. We are making an effort.
<P>
	The most important way the hon. member can help in the 
question of getting a combined collaborative effort on the issue of 
poverty for both women and children is to work to make sure that 
the social reform goes ahead in the quickest, most effective way 
possible.

unemployment insurance system, which push more and more 
families on to social assistance, exacerbate the already glaring 
problem we have with poverty?
<P>
[<I>English</I>]

Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is the same question. As 
the hon. member will probably know, in the House of Commons

that one way of tackling that problem was to give the provinces 
more flexibility.

very successful program in Quebec, to aid and abet in those areas. 
We are simply waiting for a reply, again on our willingness to 
co-operate in those areas.

to bring about a real attack against the question of poverty is going

in this matter the RCMP is acting as the provincial police service 
pursuant to an agreement between the federal government and the 
Government of British Columbia whereby the RCMP acts as the 
provincial police. This is a matter for the attorney general of 
British Columbia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the attorney general of British Columbia has told the 
people that he will not interfere with the job the RCMP has to do.
<P>
	If the attorney general of B.C. is not giving direction to the 
RCMP, someone is and is telling it not to enforce the injunction to 
remove the illegal blockade. I am sure the people of Canada, 
particularly the people of British Columbia and those who are 
involved with having equipment behind the barricades and are 
being kept from going into Douglas Lake ranch, would like to 
know exactly why the RCMP is not enforcing its mandate. Who is 
telling it not to?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in this matter the RCMP is not acting on behalf of the federal 
government when it comes to enforcing an order of the courts in 
British Columbia. The RCMP is acting as the provincial police 
service pursuant to an agreement with the Government of British 
Columbia.
<P>
	Therefore I again suggest to my hon. friend that he direct his 
question to the attorney general of British Columbia. I understand 
my hon. friend's concern about the matter, but it is not one under 
which the RCMP is acting under the direction of the federal 
government.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley,

challenged me to provide him with information that the Babbar 
Khalsa was a terrorist organization.
<P>
	On Wednesday, May 31, the RCMP named the late Talwinder 
Singh Parmar and six colleagues as suspects in the Air-India 
bombing.
<P>
	Today I have provided the minister with a copy of a 1989 
newspaper photo of Parmar holding a rocket launcher surrounded 
by dozens of machine guns and rockets. At that time Parmar stated 
that if anyone wanted to commit suicide he should board an 
Air-India plane. He also stated that then Indian Prime Minister 
Rajiv Gandhi would not be allowed to live beyond 1990.
<P>
	I have a question for the Minister of National Revenue. Which of 
the above items does he believe qualifies the Babbar Khalsa society 
for charitable status?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for sending over a copy of 
the document, which was on my desk when I arrived in the House. 
Unfortunately I do not speak Punjabi and it has been a little 
difficult for me to understand the true import of her question, but I 
thank her for the effort.
<P>
	It is the policy of the Government of Canada not to support 
terrorist organizations of any type, whether on the Indian 
subcontinent, in the former Yugoslavia, in Ireland or wherever. We 
provide no support with respect to charitable status.
<P>
	Where we have reason to believe a charitable organisation is not 
living up to its charitable status, which requires it to be promoting 
religion, education or certain social services, we launch an 
investigation. Any organization could be looked at, depending on 
the information we receive. Twenty organizations are now 
appealing their denials of charitable status in the federal court. We 
follow it up closely.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder just how much evidence the minister 
will require before he realizes that the Babbar Khalsa is a terrorist 
organisation and not a social club.
<P>
	While I do not expect the minister to listen to members of the 
opposition, could he explain what rationale his ministry used to 
ignore a protest from CSIS made over a year ago that the Babbar 
Khalsa should be denied charitable status?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the denial of charitable status is something which I 
have suggested can be appealed in the courts. It is something we do 
on the basis of proper investigation and information.
<P>
	We are quite willing to accept the views of the hon. member that 
a picture of a member with guns surrounding him is evidence, but I 
suggest it is totally contradictory to the Reform Party's gun policy 
that the mere presence of a photograph with weapons causes one to 
be investigated and causes one to lose charitable status.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to update the House with respect to the 
situation right now in the country.
<P>
	While the forest fire season got off to a slow start, unfortunately 
we are now seeing the destruction of many thousands of hectares of 
Canada's forests in the western part of the country. For example, in 
British Columbia 112 fires are burning; in Alberta, 24 fires; in

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
amounts allocated to social housing by the federal government 
have been falling at an alarming rate since 1992. Last March, the 
Minister of Finance cut the CMHC's budget by $307 million, 
effectively killing any hope of new social housing initiatives. 
Yesterday, 20,000 people demonstrated in Quebec City to remind 
the government that social housing was one of their nine key 
demands.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Public Works not agree that his cuts to 
social housing subsidies are a direct attack against the essential 
needs of the most vulnerable families in our society, despite 
Liberal election promises that these people would enjoy an

Government of Canada has had to undergo an extensive review of 
its programs. Canada Mortgage and Housing has been no 
exception.
<P>
	The hon. member will know the Government of Canada provides 
on an annual basis $2 billion for approximately 140,000 units 
across the country. Furthermore, the government was able to 
provide $100 million under the auspices of RRAP. There have been 
a number of other initiatives too long to mention.
<P>
	Perhaps I could conclude with a final one. Under the auspices of 
the private-public partnership centre of Canada Mortgage and 
Housing and the private sector, 49 projects creating over 2,500 
units in the country have been put in place.

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
amendments to the Young Offenders Act the justice minister 
included a provision to have 16 and 17 year olds tried in adult 
court.
<P>
	Provisions in the Criminal Code and carried on in Bill C-41 
stipulate persons under 18 convicted of first degree murder are 
eligible for parole after serving between 5 and 10 years. Adults 
convicted of first degree are not eligible for parole until serving a 
25-year sentence.
<P>
	I have a question for the Minister of Justice. What is the purpose 
of having 16 and 17 year olds in adult court if they are not going to 
receive adult sentences?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows as a 
member of the justice committee which considered Bill C-37 
including these specific provisions that the proposal is that for 16 
and 17 year olds transferred to adult court and convicted of first 
degree murder the period of parole ineligibility would be 10 years. 
That was arrived at, as the evidence before the committee 
demonstrated, because it was thought to be the appropriate balance 
between recognizing the age of the young person convicted of the 
offence and recognizing the need to protect society.

been passed by the House.

	The plan to group funding for health, social assistance and

the Canadian Hospital Association, labour organizations, the 
provinces and territories. Even the nine Liberal members on the 
finance committee have said the cash portion must be retained.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister finally listen to Canadians and set out 
plans to ensure that the cash transfer portions for social and health 
programs will continue past the year 2000?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is exactly what we are trying to achieve in the bill. If 
we do not pass the legislation, there would be no cash transfers for 
health purposes within two or three years in some provinces.
<P>
	That is why we changed the system, so there would always be 
cash transfers and we can ensure that the five conditions the House 
supports for medicare is respected. The only way to achieve it is by 
making these changes.

	If we were to follow the advice of the leader of the NDP, within a 
couple of years provinces like Quebec, for example, would not 
receive any cash payments and we would have absolutely no more

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Bourassa has seven 
minutes remaining.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
conclude my remarks on Bill C-76. It should be noted that the 
Liberal government has already reduced the net income of seniors 
by approximately $500 million with the tax credit cuts imposed in 
the 1994 budget.
<P>
	The freezes and cuts imposed by the federal government since 
1984 currently translate into a $9.7 billion shortfall in the funding 
of social programs in Quebec. We have more than 808,000 people 
on welfare in Quebec today; in Ontario, they are more than a 
million.
<P>
	In 1980, about half of the social programs in Quebec were 
funded through federal contributions. By 1997, only 27 per cent of 
these programs will receive federal funding, while Quebec sends 
$29 billion in taxes to Ottawa every year. Since the Liberals took 
office in 1993, the number of welfare recipients has increased by 
53,000 mainly because of UI cuts.
<P>
	That is the kind of compassion demonstrated by the Liberals for 
the most disadvantaged segment of our society. These cuts fly in 
the face of red book promises and everything the Liberals stood for 
in the last election campaign.
<P>
	The federal government only manages to increase the problem of 
poverty, instead of alleviating it. The Chrétien government is the 
largest producer of welfare recipients in Canada.
<P>
	Close to 500 Quebec women took part in the march to denounce 
poverty and the plight of children, and also to promote a better 
world. The 200 kilometre march, which I enthusiastically 
supported, started from Montreal, Longueuil and Rivière-du-Loup, 
lasted 10 days, and ended yesterday in Quebec City with a 
demonstration, in front of the National Assembly, in which 15,000 
people participated.
<P>
	There are still too many women affected by poverty because of 
their family situation, their age, their training, or the fact that they 
are unemployed or on welfare. Yet, federal cuts to social programs 
only make the situation worse for these women.
<P>
	I want to pay tribute to these marchers for their courage and for 
their cause, which also concerns men and the population as a 
whole. This march is a giant step in the fight against poverty in 
Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
	I want to point out that Mr. Parizeau's government reacted 
positively to the claims of these women. For example, minimum 
wage will increase by 45 cents on October 1st, going from $6 to 
$6.45. At the federal level, minimum wage is only $4. It is a 
disgrace.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	The federal government should know that the vast majority of 
minimum wage workers in Canada are women. This march had 
other positive results: housing for homeless women, training for 
welfare recipients and the automatic collection of child support 
payments.
<P>
	In addition, the sponsorship period for immigrant women is 
reduced from ten years to three. As a result, immigrant women will 
be able to free themselves from abusive or violent husbands 
without too much trouble, I hope. At the federal level, however, 
this sponsorship period is still 10 years. This is a disgrace.
<P>
	As far as the preventative withdrawal of pregnant women from 
work and parental leave are concerned, Quebec is way ahead of the 
federal government. The federal government must act quickly to 
improve its social legislation in order to protect women instead of 
cutting everywhere, except where necessary, especially in defence 
spending. I just found out that the Liberal government has decided 
to purchase 15 search and rescue helicopters and 32 helicopters for 
the navy at the astronomical cost of $2.6 billion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13242"> 13242 </A></B>
<P>
	It is outrageous that this government is spending billions on 
military equipment at a time when it is cutting social programs, 
UI benefits and social transfers. This decision is all the more 
disturbing since upon taking office in 1993 the Liberal Prime 
Minister cancelled the contract to purchase 50 helicopters that had 
been signed by the old Tory government. I am accusing this 
government of not keeping its word in this matter.
<P>
	I am asking the federal government to withdraw Bill C-76 and 
enter into negotiations with the Quebec government. The federal 
government must withdraw completely from social programs, 
education and other areas under Quebec jurisdiction. In return, it 
should give Quebec full fiscal compensation by transferring tax 
points.
<P>
	The time has come to end federal interference in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. Quebec has the right to give itself job 
creation, manpower training, education, health and welfare policies 
in line with its own needs and priorities.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I am against Bill C-76.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to discuss the Bill C-76 motions that deal with 
provincial transfer payments and more specifically the Canada 
health and social transfer.
<P>
	A number of Reform motions are designed to remove the 
government's ability to unilaterally decide what constitutes the 
violation of national standards, for instance in the Canada Health 
Act, and to unilaterally decide what the financial penalty should be.
<P>
	The Reform Party has proposed amendments that would force 
the federal government to take provincial governments to court for 
alleged violations of national program standards and would 
subsequently allow the courts, not cabinet, to determine any 
penalties.
<P>
	Our second goal is to prevent the federal government from 
imposing additional unilateral national standards like 
cross-country welfare rates without the consent of all the 
provinces. Clause 48, for example, uses the phrase ``by mutual 
consent'' in the context of additional national standards and criteria 
for services. This would in effect permit the Minister of Human 
Resources Development to proclaim new standards in welfare 
without the consent of the province of Alberta or Quebec, for 
instance.
<P>
	In committee both Reform and Bloc members questioned 
government witnesses as to the intent of the mutual consent clause 
and how it would work. Would the government, for example, seek 
unanimous consent from the provinces when it changed national 
standards, or would it use the seven out of ten provinces rule 
representing over 50 per cent?
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	What does this mutual consent clause really mean? Mr. Speaker, 
with the bank of lawyers we have working for the government you 
would think this clause would be made more clear. I guess that is 
why we have a justice lawyer suing the government for boredom 
for lack of work.
<P>
	The bottom line is that Reform's amendments ensure Canadians 
that clause 48 will not be brought in as an excuse by any cabinet 
minister to set out national standards unilaterally without the 
consent and co-operation of the provinces.
<P>
	Another concern of ours is that the motive underlying many of 
these changes and the creation of the Canada health and social 
transfer is to provide the federal government with a bigger stick to 
whip dissident provinces into line. For example, in Motion No. 57 
we propose to delete a section of clause 51 that would allow the 
federal government to withhold equalization payments and other 
provincial transfers for violations of the Canada health and social 
transfer conditions. In other words, this clause would allow the 
federal government to withhold cash from other programs even 
after the cash component of the Canada health and social transfer 
has been exhausted.
<P>
	Reform wants to move in the other direction, toward 
unconditional provincial transfers. Let us move control over our 
social programs closest to the level that administers them. Let us 
rethink the way the federal government provides services to 
Canadians.
<P>
	This Liberal government promised to provide a new blueprint 
for social reform. That promise, like so many, was broken when the 
Minister of Human Resources Development failed to deliver on his 
green paper. There was a promise not to increase the tax load on the 
long-suffering, overtaxed Canadian taxpayer. It was broken to the 
tune of $500 million a year with the imposition of a 1.5 cent per 
litre tax on gasoline and the elimination of PUITTA, the public 
utilities income tax transfer, also in Bill C-76.
<P>
	There was a promise of a more open Parliament where MPs 
would be free from party discipline. This was broken when Liberal 
MPs who voted against the government's gun control bill were 
stripped of their committee positions.
<P>
	Now we are debating a bill that continues the trend of breaking 
promises that have been made to Canadians. In 1960 Prime 
Minister Pearson promised the provinces the federal government 
would pay 50 per cent of the costs of national health care. This was 
the condition insisted on by the provinces and promised by the 
federal government. Without this promise the provinces would not 
have agreed to national medicare. For example, the 1966 medical 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13243"> 13243 </A></B>
<P>
care act clearly states that ``the amount of the contribution payable 
by Canada to a province in  respect to a medical care insurance plan 
is an amount equal to 50 per cent''. That is still in the act.
<P>
	What is the state of that sacred promise today? Today the federal 
government's contribution to health care funding is not 50 per cent, 
as promised; it is now less than 23 per cent and falling. Because it 
is breaking its fundamental financial promise, the federal 
government is slowly undermining the other principles of 
medicare: it undermines accessibility as waiting lists get longer 
and longer; it undermines comprehensiveness as more and more 
health services are delisted from provincial insurance plans; it 
undermines universality as the system evolves into a multi-tier 
system with access to the various tiers being tied increasingly to 
ability to pay.
<P>
	The fact is that Canada already has a multi-tiered health care 
system, which the Minister of Health chooses to ignore, access to 
which has been made more restricted by rising health care costs 
and declining federal support. The challenge is to reform medicare 
so that one of those tiers can contain all the essential health 
services required by Canadians, financed by sufficient federal and 
provincial funding so that no Canadian is denied access because of 
inability to pay.
<P>
	Canadians are asking and will continue to ask when real health 
care and social reform are going to come, and from where? This is 
not going to come from this federal government under the current 
Prime Minister, Minister of Health, or Minister of Human 
Resources Development. They resist every proposal for change. 
They charge anyone who advocates change with being an enemy of 
medicare or in favour of social programs that favour the rich.
<P>
	The Liberals were only dragged into the discussion of health and 
social reforms because their officials kept telling them that if they 
did not do something the system was going to collapse and they 
would carry the blame.
<P>
	Like all previous governments, all they have done is study the 
issue. That fiasco held by the social reform people of the human 
resources development commission who went across the country 
loaded with paid people to show up and private interest groups 
presenting their points of view was a complete scam and sham. 
Nothing fruitful has come from that.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	As well, the 1995 federal budget is a perfect example of the fact 
that the government has no real vision for our social programs and 
therefore picks the simplest route. It cuts funding to the provinces 
while at the same time failing to give them more flexibility in 
administering the lesser amounts it is granting to the provinces. 
What a simple solution: give less, say less, let the provinces handle 
the problem. That is not the kind of leadership the Reform Party 
feels Canadians want, nor is it the kind of leadership the Reform 
Party will provide when it becomes the government.
<P>
	Quite simply, the Liberals want to have their cake and eat it too. 
The provinces are no longer buying this. In fact, I believe that if in 
1960 the provinces and Canadians could have foreseen the 
monopoly Ottawa has today on setting the terms and conditions of 
health care services and financing, then the present medicare 
system would not have come into being in the first place.
<P>
	The provinces need to be given more control over their affairs. If 
they do not then our social system will continue in a downward 
spiral to a point where fundamental programs like universal health 
care can no longer be afforded by or provided to Canadians by any 
government.
<P>
	My concerns are very simple. When this bill was in the standing 
committee on finance being reviewed, the officials and the minister 
appeared at that committee. We were discussing this very clause, 
clause 48. We asked the minister what his officials determined was 
meant by mutual consent. The Canada Health Act is in place. The 
five principles are there and they are a sacred trust. Everybody in 
Canada believes in those five principles. We are not going to 
quibble about those five principles. However, by denying the 
provinces the flexibility to determine how to pay for some of these, 
as I pointed out in my speech, the government is hurting them, not 
helping them. By insisting that we still need universality and by 
insisting that the provinces have to follow these rules and Alberta 
has to close some clinics that people pay for, it certainly means to 
me that the Liberals do not want solutions, they just want control, 
for no reason.
<P>
	Now we have something called the Canada health and social 
transfer, which means downloading the problems to the provinces 
and giving them less money. The government can now cut its 
budget, solve its problems and look good. In the meantime, the 
provinces will struggle.
<P>
	In the standing committee we pointed out that there will have to 
be new social programs in order to address our spending on welfare 
and unemployment because the needs of the Canadian people are 
important. When we do discuss those and the provinces then look 
at the money and funds they have available, what are they to do? 
Are they to then decide what they want to do, with one province 
doing this and another doing that, and then the federal government 
tells them it will not give them the money because it calls the shots 
and it decides what the principles are they have to follow?
<P>
	If the government does not like the principles it does not have to 
give to the provinces. If the provinces breach any of the rules in the 
program, for instance in health care, it is not only not going to give 
that amount of money for health care but it will cut the provinces 
off on other programs. That is way too much power. It is ridiculous 
and unnecessary.
<P>
	What the Liberals said in committee was that their intent of 
mutual consent was that the provinces agree.  They will not force 
anything onto the provinces that the provinces do not agree to. Is 
that really what the federal government means and what it wants 
done? I asked this in the standing committee and the government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13244"> 13244 </A></B>
<P>
turned it down. Therefore, I question if that is really what this 
government wants.
<P>
	This is what the government turned down. If verbally the 
government is promising to Canadians in a standing committee that 
nobody knows or hears about that mutual consent means that the 
provinces have to agree, then why not change the one word mutual 
to unanimous? If the government intends for all the provinces to 
agree, change the word mutual to unanimous.
<P>
	With unanimous consent, now the government has the written 
agreement that goes along with the verbal agreement of this 
government and a solution to the problem. In this way, Quebec is 
happy, Alberta is happy, Ontario is happy, all the provinces are 
happy. But this government does not want to do that. This just 
points out to me that it will say something verbally, and a verbal 
promise is as strong as a written promise. It is on the record.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	We voiced our concerns about that clause, that amendment. We 
will use the quotation of the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Finance in which he promised mutual consent means 
the provinces must agree. In the future if the provinces do not agree 
and the government forces them, it will once again have broken 
another promise.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my duty 
today to denounce one of the worst incursions in the history of 
federalism into provincial jurisdiction. Bill C-76, an act to 
implement certain provisions of the last federal budget, opens the 
door to all kinds of federal interventionism in jurisdictions 
belonging to Quebec and the other provinces, and also widens the 
scope of its incursions.
<P>
	As far as deficit-fighting measures go, we have seen better. All 
that the federal government could dream up was a merger of all of 
its transfer payments for health, social services and post-secondary 
eduction into one payment: the Canada social transfer. They hope 
to take on the deficit by offloading to the provinces.
<P>
	For 1995-96, the transfer to the provinces will effectively be 
reduced by $2.5 billion; for 1997-98, it will be cut by $4.5 billion. 
If this transpires, Quebec's shortfall could be in the neighbourhood 
of $1.9 billion, if the distribution of the Canada social transfer is 
determined by the criterion of population. That, at least, is the 
criterion which would be most favourable to the government, as it 
would result in Quebec having to shoulder close to 42 per cent of 
the cuts in transfer payments for 1997-98. If the federal 
government were to  continue using the current distribution 
method, Quebec's shortfall would still be approximately $1.2 
billion.
<P>
	The federal government would use these centralizing measures 
to relegate Quebec and the other provinces to a purely consultative 
role. At first glance it seemed as though the Canada social transfer 
would give the provinces the transfer money they needed to carry 
out their responsibilities, since the federal government would be 
withdrawing from areas of provincial jurisdiction, or so the 
government wanted us to believe.
<P>
	In reality, the bill maintains the national health standards and 
provides for the addition of new standards in the areas of social 
welfare and post-secondary education. What happens if the 
provinces do not meet these standards? The government hits where 
it hurts, in the wallet. It will cut off their rations, like it did for our 
society's most disadvantaged: the unemployed and welfare 
recipients.
<P>
	This is the point we have reached in this country. The 
government wants to impose national standards unilaterally in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction. The provinces-imagine 
that-will be consulted. Nothing in this bill requires provincial 
approval for the implementation of standards imposed by the 
federal government. This means that, in areas as sensitive as health 
and education, the federal government will be entitled to say to the 
provinces: ``Your program does not meet national standards. If you 
do not arrange it the way we want, we will cut off funding''. Not 
only is this government making unprecedented cuts to social 
programs, but it is imposing national standards in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. I wonder whether Pierre Elliott Trudeau 
ever went so far? And this is no compliment to the current 
government.
<P>
	Bill C-76 will enable the federal government to tell Quebec and 
the other provinces, at the end of unsuccessful negotiations, for 
example, that it is cutting them off if they do not accept its 
standards. It is just that subtle. In Quebec, the message will be 
understood as: ``Toe the line or you are dead''. Quebecers will 
choose this fall to suffer such humiliation or to form a country. 
Elsewhere in the country, people are not thrilled about the bill 
either.
<P>
	Take for instance the Canadian Council which criticized Bill 
C-76 in these terms when it appeared before the finance committee: 
``If the federal government tries to impose national standards 
without giving the money that goes with it, it will simply get 
negative responses from the provinces''.
<P>
	This bill will have numerous deplorable effects. Let us take 
manpower development in Quebec for example. Bill C-76 will 
allow the Minister of Human Resources Development to go 
forward with his intention to grab the savings coming from his 
unemployment insurance reform in order to create a human 
resources investment fund.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13245"> 13245 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	And this fund will be used, among other things, for manpower 
training programs, a jurisdiction that Quebec has been claiming for 
many years under governments from all political allegiances. 
Students also will be hit. Since their grants will be reduced, 
universities will have no other choice but to increase tuition fees, 
which will force students to borrow even more.
<P>
	I suggest that this government is a past master in the art of 
getting into debt. Yet, as far as I know, the federal government can 
no longer afford to interfere in provincial jurisdictions. Following 
the last budget, the government has made it clear that it intends to 
reduce its participation in the funding of Quebec social programs to 
about 28 per cent.
<P>
	While footing only 28 per cent of the bill, the government still 
wants to assume the right to interfere in our business by imposing 
its national standards. Fortunately, by 1998, Quebec will have 
taken its own destiny into its hands. The Bloc Quebecois knows 
exactly what the Minister of Finance and this government are up to.
<P>
	The bill has two objectives: first, to obliterate Quebec's claims 
in its own jurisdictions and, second, to hide from the people the 
truth about transfer cuts to the provinces and the effects that these 
cuts will have, especially two years from now.
<P>
	Federal transfers to Quebec, and I want to specify here that this 
is Quebecers' money, taken from the $30 billion in taxes they sent 
to Ottawa, will be reduced by 32 per cent between 1994-95 and 
1997-98.
<P>
	The bill is a perfect example of what motivates us to want to 
become sovereign; this is plain interference, except that this time 
the government is going further than any other centralizing 
government has ever gone. We denounce that and the people will 
hear us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
thank the Reform Party member who allowed me to take the floor 
now, since I have to leave in a few minutes.
<P>
	I am happy to address the House today on Bill C-76 at report 
stage. Since our arrival here in Parliament, we have seen this bill 
take shape. It reflects the whole approach of the government to 
transfer payments to provinces.
<P>
	The government introduced over time a series of measures 
which affected and reshaped its approach. It started with a cap on 
equalization last year, which affects mainly Quebec. The amount 
has been estimated at $1.5 billion over the next five years.
<P>
	Last year's budget contained cuts to unemployment insurance 
and also to what we call shared costs programs, that is 
post-secondary education and health. Cuts estimated at $2 billion 
had already been announced in  last years's budget, and this years's 
budget brings further reductions totalling $7 billion, which will 
come into effect in the next two years, that is $2.5 billion next year 
and $4.5 billion the following year.
<P>
	This year's reductions come on top of last year's cuts. The whole 
area of transfer or transfer payments to provinces has therefore 
been hit with massive cuts.
<P>
	The government also tried to conceal the whole thing in the 
budget by presenting transfers to provinces, tax points and 
equalization payments all together. It mixed them all up in such a 
way as to give only global amounts and summarized data. From 
now on, the federal government will administer a new Canada 
social transfer that will combine all the amounts it contributed to 
CAP and the Established Programs Financing for post-secondary 
education and health. By these cuts, or the merging of these three 
fields in order to make one global cut, the government is hiding its 
true intentions.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development had given some 
hints with his consultations and the rainbow series of papers he 
distributed. At that time, it was supposed to affect post-secondary 
education, among others. There was also mention of other sectors 
such as health, but that was still to come, since there were also 
consultations on that issue.
<P>
	Now, in order to avoid debates such as this and not wanting to be 
seen as the culprit for having made all these cuts, the federal 
government says: ``Let us add everything up and cut the envelope''. 
This way, we can shift the blame to the provinces''. We have a fine 
example of this in Quebec with the whole debate we are having 
about health care reform, which is aimed of course at improving 
delivery but is also motivated by cuts imposed by the federal 
government.
<P>
	Because of these cuts, the provinces are forced to choose. The 
federal government did leave them some leeway. That is what they 
call decentralized federalism: ``You must cut, but you get to choose 
where these cuts will be made''. This is easier said than done, 
because at the same time the government is telling us: ``You will 
required to comply with a number of principles arising from the 
Canada Health Act and, regarding social assistance, residency 
requirements will be excluded as grounds for denying assistance to 
an applicant''. Basically, we are told that these are the only two 
conditions that will be maintained, the only two national standards 
that will apply to the Canada social transfer.
<P>
	At the same time, the provinces are expected to develop other 
standards together. Upon further analysis, one realizes what the 
government means, and reads in the committee's report that it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13246"> 13246 </A></B>
<P>
recognizes the responsibility of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development to develop standards ``through mutual consent''. 
Also stated in the same report is the need to  maintain an element of 
cash payment in transfer payments as part of the Canada social 
transfer because, in time, these could be reduced to nil. It says that 
a portion of the federal transfer payments must remain in the form 
of cash payments, so that it remains possible to tell the provinces 
how to apply these standards.
<P>
	So, they have just confirmed what we suspected all along: there 
is indeed a strong desire to maintain national standards through this 
new Canada social transfer. The bottom line is that the federal 
government will reduce transfer payments and that there may be 
more federal standards than before, since the federal government 
may now impose post-secondary education standards.
<P>
	We know very well what happens during these discussions, when 
10 or 11 people sit around a table to try to define national criteria. 
There is often a lot of energy spent with few results and, at the end 
of the day, the federal government prevails through financial 
blackmail. Other decisions will have to be made by the federal 
government in coming years.
<P>
	We are still waiting for the reform of the goods and services tax, 
the notorious GST. The federal government still leaves itself a way 
out and room to manoeuvre so that it can impose its vision in future 
talks with the provinces. I remember being a guest on a radio show 
the day after the budget. Since the Minister of Human Resources 
Development was interviewed just before me, I was able to hear 
what he said. He candidly told the host-who was asking him if he 
was sorry that the federal government would no longer exercise 
control and impose standards in sectors affected by transfer 
payments-that, on the contrary, they would have more control 
than ever. This shows that what Liberals say here in this House and 
what they tell other people are two different things. I tend to 
believe what the minister said on the radio, that he did want more 
control and that the federal government would have more control in 
the long run.
<P>
	I want to link this to a number of things, to a speech by the Prime 
Minister that has been somewhat forgotten. I remember when the 
Liberal Party held its convention in Trois-Rivières, in eastern 
Quebec. At that time, the Prime Minister accused the Quebec 
government of not caring about poverty, once again using his old 
theme about how that government was only concerned about 
separation. The fact is that we care a great deal about poverty and 
we ask: Who will be affected by these cuts? Think about it for a 
moment. Who will be affected by these cuts to social assistance, to 
post-secondary education and to health care, which come on top of 
cuts affecting the UI program? We have to take a close look at this 
issue.
<P>
	The government waxes eloquently about job creation, but it 
takes measures which will adversely affect people.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	These measures will hit Quebecers even harder, because of a 
series of decisions made over the years by the federal government 
regarding spending in a number of sectors, including research and 
development. As we often said in this House, we feel that, because 
Quebec did not get its fair share in these sectors, it was forced to 
become more dependent on welfare assistance and unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	I am not proud to say that Quebec has the largest number of 
welfare recipients or unemployed. We are not proud of that, and 
this is not the kind of financial assistance which we seek from the 
federal government. If another approach had been used in the past, 
the situation might be different now.
<P>
	But this is not the case, since we were adversely affected by a 
series of decisions on structuring expenditures. In the past, at least 
the federal government would say: ``We know what we did to you, 
but we will compensate you for that''. Now, this government says: 
``In addition to that, we will cut the compensation which you used 
to receive''. This is not the kind of money which we want, without 
increasing the rest and without giving us the means to do 
something about it. Just think of manpower training and the fact, as 
was mentioned earlier today, that the federal government will 
simply not let Quebec assume control of that sector.
<P>
	This is a strange approach. There are also other financial cuts 
which will have an impact. For example, in the first year, that is 
next year, transfers through the Canada social transfer will be 
reduced by $2.5 billion, which means that Quebec will be deprived 
of some $650 million. In the House, ministers and the Prime 
Minister himself said it would probably be $300 million or $325 
million. Officials who came before the committee said it would be 
$625 million, which is much closer to the $650 million that has 
been mentioned since the beginning.
<P>
	If that is another illustration of this government's mathematics, 
it is easy to understand why people are often suspicious of its 
management and decision-making processes. They have their own 
way of calculatiing things, as ministers and the Prime Minister 
showed when they talked about $325 million for Quebec, while 
everybody knew that it was really $625 million for the first year.
<P>
	As regards the $4.5 billion in the following year, the criteria for 
the breakdown of these cuts are still to be negotiated. Otherwise, 
Quebec would have to contribute $1.2 billion. But we will 
renegotiate, and one approach that is strongly favoured is a 
breakdown according to population. Under this approach, Quebec's 
share would be $1.9 billion.
<P>
	So, the criteria change will most probably penalize Quebec. It 
will certainly not favour it, given that the provinces requesting this 
change are complaining that Quebec is overcompensated in 
comparison to them,  Ontario in particular, which will come to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13247"> 13247 </A></B>
<P>
table, according to what is reported these days, with a Conservative 
government, whether liberal members like it or not, which could 
seriously complicate the picture. So, that is how things stand right 
now.
<P>
	In short, I will resume my speech by saying that we will end up 
with less money, provinces will get less money, standards will be 
forced on them, some pretty high standards that they will have to 
observe under difficult economic conditions. No doubt about it, 
this is shifting the financial burden to the provinces.
<P>
	When the taxpayer takes a look at the federal government's 
books, he will find at first sight that there is a slight improvement, 
but he will feel a deterioration elsewhere. Either he will have to pay 
more for some services, or he will be hit by the cuts made by 
provincial governments. The situation will be a real headache for 
the provinces because they will always be caught with this whole 
intractable approach imposed on them, the compliance with 
national standards.
<P>
	That being said, I understand there is some concern in Canada 
because of the rise of the right in the area of social policy. We see it 
in Alberta, and even here in Ontario now. In Quebec, we do not 
have that problem, so people there are not afraid, and are not asking 
the federal government for national standards.
<P>
	It this system were flexible enough, we would have an 
asymmetrical solution that would be different for Quebec than for 
the rest of Canada, but here we have a Canadian vision which does 
not give much recognition to the specificity of Quebec on that 
issue.
<P>
	The time to decide will soon be here. Quebecers will be able to 
choose other models and other approaches in a public debate, even 
though our mind is already made up in that regard. The Prime 
Minister says he is concerned with the neediest, but if he wants to 
keep some credibility when his government tables its record, he 
will have to explain why he attacked mostly the unemployed, the 
welfare recipients and the students since he took office.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	I can hardly believe he really feels any compassion. We have his 
words, and then we have the facts. Here, we are faced with facts; 
that is what we are looking at, and we are very disappointed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the accommodation in switching the speaking order.
<P>
	The motions I am addressing today relate to the Canadian health 
and social transfer. This transfer was one of the more controversial 
aspects of the latest budget as it transformed the whole system of 
federal transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	The transfers were represented by the finance minister as being 
more flexible in approach. In his budget speech the finance 
minister stated: ``Provinces will now be able to design more 
innovative social programs, programs that respond to the needs of 
the people today rather than inflexible rules''.
<P>
	When that statement is considered on its own, it almost seems as 
if anyone can identify that as being something positive, 
constructive, et cetera. The provinces will be allowed to be more 
innovative and will indeed have fewer rules, therefore becoming 
more flexible.
<P>
	I wonder what definitions are meant by innovation and flexible 
and how they are actually applied. Does it suggest it will allow the 
provinces to have more control over management of the programs 
and be able to adapt programs to meet the specific needs of 
residents in their area? Of course, innovative would be to create the 
programs.
<P>
	The minister goes on to state: ``However, flexibility does not 
mean a free for all. There are national goals and principles we 
believe must still apply and which the vast majority of Canadians 
support. Our goal must be to combine greater flexibility with 
continued fidelity to those principles''.
<P>
	This suggests that the government will still be making and 
interpreting the rules and that the provinces will abide by the 
decisions and interpretations. Therefore, they will have to be 
flexible to adapt to less money because this is very suggestive that 
there will still be federal control over it. Yes, they will become 
flexible in that they will have to adapt to providing innovative 
programs on less money.
<P>
	We cannot have it both ways, especially based on this approach. 
On the one hand the federal government says it will allow greater 
flexibility, but on the other hand it is going to enforce the national 
standards.
<P>
	The finance minister continued his speech with a commitment to 
maintain the five conditions of the Canada Health Act: universality, 
comprehensiveness, accessibility, portability and public 
administration. Then the minister proceeded to outline the cuts in 
the transfers to the provinces under the new Canada health and 
social transfer. This is an excellent illustration of how the federal 
government is failing to address the fundamental problem now 
facing health care in Canada: declining federal financing combined 
with a lack of provincial manoeuvrability.
<P>
	Also in the red book there is the statement: ``The Liberal 
government will not withdraw from or abandon the health care 
field''. We are talking about semantics or the meanings of words. 
We talk about flexibility. Flexibility how? We talk about being 
innovative. How? Here we talk about withdrawal as well. 
Withdrawing or reducing finances can be interpreted as 
withdrawing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13248"> 13248 </A></B>
<P>
from the program as we knew it in 1993. Therefore, we have  
another broken promise if we interpret the word withdraw that way.
<P>
	At this time I would like to provide a little background on the 
subject. Under the Canada health and social transfer, the funding to 
the provinces will be reduced from what it otherwise would have 
been in 1996-97 by $2.5 billion. It will go down to $26.9 billion. 
That tends to suggest to me a withdrawal of funds from health care. 
Of course, it is going to make the provinces innovative and flexible 
in trying to find programs which will meet the needs of the 
provinces based on less money. It is going to be further reduced 
from what it otherwise would have been in 1997-98 by $4.5 billion, 
bringing it down to $25.1 billion.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	That is not a complete representation of the total effects of the 
cuts in the last budget. When discussing the value of the transfers 
to the provinces under CAP and EPF, the government decided to 
include the value of the tax points which were transferred in 1977. 
This component of the transfer is not and never has been a 
budgetary item. The value of the tax point transfer is not included 
in the budgetary expenditures, nor is the forgone tax revenue 
deducted from the budgetary revenues. We begin to wonder 
whether the tax point transfer was included in this whole process 
just to mask the depth and the significance the reductions which are 
proposed in this transfer to the provinces will actually be.
<P>
	The cash transfers to the provinces are scheduled to fall from 
their 1994-95 level of $25.2 billion to a 1997-98 level of $19.9 
billion. Included in the cash transfers are two components: the 
equalization component and the CHST component. Over three 
years the equalization payment will continue to grow. It will 
actually grow from approximately $8.3 billion in 1994-95 to $9.6 
billion in 1997-98. On the other hand, funding for Canada health 
and social transfers will be reduced by $6.6 billion, from $16.9 
billion in 1994-95 to $10.3 billion in 1997-98.
<P>
	When we get through all the jargon and the process of what is 
actually happening and try to figure out what the bottom line is, and 
when we consider the components of cash transfers, tax points, the 
CHST component, the equalization component, the CAP 
component and the EPF component, what is actually going to 
happen? I sat down and tried to pull this all together. It looks like 
this will represent a 39 per cent cut over this period of time to 1998 
in federal cash transfers for health, advanced education and social 
assistance as they are now being lumped into a block program.
<P>
	When we start to think of the diminishing cash contributions, the 
key question which comes to mind is: How does the federal 
government hope to enforce the national standards in health care if 
the cash contributions are diminishing every year and what will 
happen when they get down to zero? That is where clause 51 comes 
into play. It allows the government to withhold any  transfers, such 
as those going to advanced education or social services, based on 
its interpretation of the province's behaviour in relation to health 
care, or whatever it is. That is a threat to the provinces.
<P>
	In any given year, based on a judgment of the government, 
transfers can be withheld from the provinces. Again, it must be 
flexible because now it will affect the other two components as 
well. Of course, there will be more people upset, which will also 
apply pressure.
<P>
	The whole process is totally unacceptable because the control is 
being kept by the federal government instead of being 
decentralized to the provinces and closer to the people who are 
actually receiving the care. That is why my hon. colleague from 
Lethbridge has introduced the amendments which would prevent 
these kinds of contradictions and I fully support them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I usually start my 
speeches by saying that I am very happy to get up to participate in 
the debate, but I would like to begin my speech today by saying that 
I am downright annoyed. This is the worst time we could have in 
Parliament; we are given a limitation of time to speak about the 
things that are the most important to Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	I was asked not long ago what is wrong with Quebec. I said 
nothing. I was asked if we have a problem with Quebec, whether it 
wants to leave. We really do not have a Quebec problem; we have 
an Ottawa problem. That is the essence of the whole debate today. 
The federal government is intruding on these areas of provincial 
jurisdiction by our Constitution and by its use of the spending 
power intruding on our freedoms right across the country in all 
provinces.
<P>
	I even admire Quebec for bringing the issue to a head to this 
degree by saying Ottawa should wake up and listen to the people of 
Canada. We are being asked today to give formal assent to a budget 
which perpetuates the problems Ottawa has been imposing on 
Canadian citizens, taxpayers, for several decades now. It is time for 
this to be corrected.
<P>
	Does not the Constitution clearly say health care is a provincial 
jurisdiction? I believe so. The history of health care shows that 
originally, undoubtedly with good motives, the federal government 
felt it should tax all Canadians and then give the money back to the 
provinces based on their populations. There was a new plan put out.
<P>
	In the same year I was married Saskatchewan started a 
provincially funded health care system. At that time doctors in 
Saskatchewan were striking because they did not want to have 
government intrusion into the health care system. It started in 
Saskatchewan. On our marriage my wife and I moved to Alberta. 
At that time Alberta had its own private insurance which was 
inexpensive and  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13249"> 13249 </A></B>
<P>
very thorough. We had moderate medical costs covered by medical 
services incorporated. We were very happy.
<P>
	However, this virus of thinking that only the government can do 
things well continued to spread across the country until finally 
Canadians have now come to accept that we want to have 
government funded health care. Somehow there is a transition. 
When governments cause something to become legal and required 
by law, it then gains a certain degree of public acceptance.
<P>
	Now we have accepted that all of us will pay through taxes, and 
in places like Alberta through health care premiums, for our health 
care coverage. We also expect that if we need health care it will be 
available for us, just like in the old days before the government was 
involved. Is that happening? No.
<P>
	More and more we are hearing from our constituents about long 
waiting lists, certain procedures that are deinsured. The elderly, 
who certainly have paid taxes and participated in our country all of 
their lives, surely as contributors to that degree are now entitled to 
their share of what they have provided for others. They are now 
being denied even to the point at which there are some people 
suggesting older people ought to be put away because they are to 
much of a drain on the health care system. What a shame.
<P>
	In this bill we find an intrusion by the federal government, 
thinking it can tax all of us and then limit not only what it is 
providing for us but also our ability as individuals in our provinces 
to do what we can with the diminishing resources.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	Both those premises are wrong. Both fail the test of common 
sense. Both fail what Canadians want, an efficient health care 
system funded publicly but under the control of provinces. They 
would have better control.
<P>
	I always say to people in Elk Island and generally in Alberta that 
whenever they want to favour government funding to think about 
the fact that probably-I do not have the exact numbers here-for 
many of these programs we are fortunate if we get back 10 or 20 
cents on the dollar of what we send to Ottawa. We would be a lot 
better off without Ottawa intrusion. We would be a lot better off if 
Ottawa buts out of this problem. It is not solving the problem, it is 
the problem.
<P>
	I strongly endorse the amendments my hon. colleague has 
promoted in order to fix the flaws in this bill. I am very concerned 
that in our society we need to meet the needs of those who cannot 
look after themselves. To a great extent that includes people who 
are ill. When people are ill or when they become aged usually they 
are unable to continue working. Many do not have a portfolio of 
investments to provide income.
<P>
	I agree with the consensus of Canadians that we are a 
compassionate society and we will help to meet needs, whether 
social welfare needs or health care needs.
<P>
	Certainly we can pull together in meeting the needs of those who 
are needy. It is an absolutely false assumption that the best way of 
doing that is to set up two, three and in some cases four levels of 
bureaucracy in government that eat into our tax dollars and deliver 
but a portion of that in benefits to citizens needing it.
<P>
	We need to do this job much better. We need to become efficient. 
We need to reduce the amount of bureaucracy and control from the 
federal government. I am not convinced at all that as we 
decentralize things will get worse, as the Liberals claim. Things 
will get better because there will be a smaller financial drain on us 
in total, there will be closer control with more local politicians and 
more local bureaucrats basically forced to listen to the people. In 
total we will have a much more efficient system and the needs of 
people will be met better at less cost. That will also have a positive 
spin on our total economy.
<P>
	I could continue to wax eloquent on this for some time because it 
is an issue that concerns me greatly, one that needs real changes by 
the government. I will not hold my breath waiting because I know 
if I hold it too long health care may not be there to help me.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the bill on the Canada social transfer calls up the image of 
an old spent horse on its last show. It has been very useful and 
appreciated in the circus, but it is on its last legs. Yet, the owner 
wants to keep it going a little longer with some garish costume.
<P>
	Throughout the sixties and the seventies, the whole issue of 
interregional equity was at the center of the public debate. I think a 
very big mistake was made from the start, with the confusion 
between the provision of a safety net for all Canadians and the real 
need underlying the goal we should have had, which is to provide 
an adequate economic and social development so that all 
Canadians can have a decent life in their own regions.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, with the decisions we have made and the fact that 
we have been living beyond our means, we reached a point where 
the Canadian government had only two alternatives in a federal 
context. The first one, which was chosen, was to announce cuts and 
offload them to the provinces, while saying: ``Let them handle the 
problem. They are on the front line. We are going to save our 
political hide''.
<P>
	Second, the Liberals have been unable to carry their argument to 
the limit and to say: ``If we cut provincial transfers, we cannot set 
national standards, because we cannot reduce our financial 
assistance and still impose  national standards''. But the current 
government has not been able to come to that conclusion, because 
it is actually made up of many, many members who greatly miss 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13250"> 13250 </A></B>
<P>
Trudeau and the years when the Liberal government believed that, 
by borrowing money right and left, it could solve problems 
throughout the country. We now realize that foreign lenders can no 
longer wait and they urge the government to take a stand.
<P>
	So, in order to satisfy foreign lenders, the government is cutting 
its spending, even though it still argues, on a philosophical and 
political level, that national standards are needed. This would 
perpetuate one of the most significant costs of federalism, linked to 
all the quarrels and the bickering between the two levels of 
government. Some people say that the province of Quebec is 
always complaining about this situation, but look at what is 
happening in Alberta. Over there, the provincial government is 
making choices, even though its direction is controversial, and at 
this end, we have the federal government telling Alberta: ``No, you 
cannot make these kinds of decisions; they go against the national 
standards''.
<P>
	The province of Alberta has a valid argument. It maintains that, 
since the federal government is investing less and less money, it 
does not have such a strong say in the matter any more. The federal 
government should realize this and change its attitude. The people 
who are watching and also the members of the government and of 
the other opposition party should carefully consider what the 
position of the Bloc Quebecois is.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois suggests that the federal government 
withdraw from areas of jurisdiction in which it systematically 
intervened for many years by injecting large amounts of money and 
by creating false expectations. The federal government should 
withdraw, but, at the same time, it should fully compensate the 
provinces by means of a tax point transfer. This would be a positive 
incentive for each province to make the most of the little it 
receives, and keep some for other activities, thereby ensuring better 
regional development.
<P>
	Of course, this suggestion is made with a federalist vision of 
Canada's future. If we wished to maintain this old federation, for a 
few more years at least, this is the type of solution we should adopt. 
I believe we should at least try to save something from the 
wreckage. In Quebec, unfortunately for the Canadian federal 
system, we have had it with these partial solutions and we believe 
that the real solution is for Quebecers to have full control over their 
tax money, which now goes to Ottawa but which, in the context of 
sovereignty, would go to one place only, Quebec City. With full 
control, the Government of Quebec would be able to develop much 
more structured programs better able to reach their objectives.
<P>
	We are often asked this about the bills on which we vote: ``You 
make beautiful speeches on policy issues  but how are we affected 
by this?'' I would like to take the opportunity-I feel compelled to 
because of the time allocation forced on us by the government-to 
draw the hon. members' attention to a rather treacherous aspect of 
Bill C-76, which is an omnibus bill. With clause 69, 3,000 
resistance veterans will lose their eligibility to some pension 
benefits.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	What is even more devious is that there will no longer be 
compensation for those who want to be heard by a review panel. 
Just imagine in what situation veterans will find themselves. 
Today, most of them are getting on in years and their physical and 
mental health has been seriously affected by their years in service. 
Their country wanted to give proper recognition to their 
contribution by trying to compensate them for what they did for the 
nation. But today, surreptitiously, the government is going after 
these people through an omnibus bill. Temember, they are not 
millionaires.
<P>
	For example, I met elderly couples in La Pocatière or in 
Pohénégamook, in my riding. These people do not necessarily have 
access to a physician close to their home and often have to travel 
considerable distances when required to undergo a physical. The 
cost of a medical examination used to be covered by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs. But, when Bill C-76 is 
implemented, we will have a situation where these people will no 
longer be entitled to the partial reimbursement of some of these 
costs. It will become strictly a regulatory matter. Once again, 
Canadians who are in a somewhat difficult situation will have to 
pay for the financial pressures that the government is under.
<P>
	I think that the government could have been more open-minded 
and could have realized that, on top of what they did for their 
country, veterans are in the last stage of their life. I find it very 
petty to put such a burden on these people who are not necessarily 
used to finding their way through the bureaucracy in which we 
work. It shows a total lack of respect for human dignity.
<P>
	I wanted to use this example so that members would realize that 
Bill C-76 will have repercussions on the daily life of Canadians. 
And I am talking about ordinary people. I used veterans as an 
example, but the cuts that will be made with regard to the Canada 
health and social transfer-some $560 million next year in Quebec 
alone-will have an impact on all kinds of people. There will be 
repercussions of this kind on students, seniors, and social 
assistance recipients, because these programs were partially funded 
by the federal government in the past, and if the federal 
government cuts its contributions, the provinces will be forced to 
take a much more restrictive stance.
<P>
	It is important for Canadians to know that the decisions that the 
provinces may have to make will only be the fruit of the 
mismanagement by the federal government, which opened up the 
floodgate for years,  using borrowed funds, and imposed duplicate 
programs on provinces. The result of this today is that we must face 
a new, very simple reality, which is that Canada no longer has the 
means to support all of the social programs it used to offer, not 
necessarily 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13251"> 13251 </A></B>
<P>
because the programs were inherently irrelevant, but because they 
were superimposed on programs that the provinces were already 
offering. Many useless expenditures on overlaps could have been 
eliminated had the federal government only reached an agreement 
with the provinces, ensuring that the changes were made in 
co-operation with them.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to cite the example of the summit on 
health. This would have been a good opportunity for the federal 
government to ensure that the provinces would participate in the 
debates on health care, instead of imposing cuts and leaving each 
province ultimately to fend for itself. This is also an example of the 
current system's downfall. People are unable to pinpoint where 
their tax money is actually going. This is one of the reasons that I 
think that, after judging Bill C-76, Quebecers will see very clearly 
that their only solution is to opt out of the Canadian system.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Canada social transfer is the very expression of a budget that shows 
two faces: what it says and what it does. The government boasted 
that it had kept its spending under control. There was some 
applause, and some people said the government ``showed 
courage''.
<P>
	In fact, the government merely made a couple of transfers-not 
money but budget cuts-and above all, it transferred its problems 
to the people. It has to be said. It has to be said that after all the 
speeches and boasting, what it comes down to is that there are 
people who will suffer as a result of these cuts.
<P>
	So was the debate about finding out whether these were the right 
places to cut? No. The federal government looks after its own 
budget and leaves the provinces to look after theirs, with the results 
depending on whether they are rich or poor. This year, Quebec had 
the doubtful privilege of having the highest poverty rate, and it can 
look forward to being severely hit by the cuts in the Canada social 
transfer.
<P>
	In what way? It will suffer the effects of more than $50 million 
in cutbacks for the coming year and the year after, perhaps at least 
$1.9 billion. Who will be affected in the long run? People will be 
affected because they are sick or have fewer social services. 
Because fewer services will be available, some people's education 
will suffer because it will cost more. People on welfare will be 
affected as well. And if a province does not want to transfer these 
cuts to its citizens because it feels they are too substantial, it may 
have to ask its people to pay more. That will be up to the provinces.
<P>
	The Canada social transfer is typical of this budget because the 
central government can say it has done its share to bring down the 
deficit, while the provinces are stuck with the real cuts and their 
people are stuck with the problems. Meanwhile, the central 
government is making sure that the UI fund is running a surplus. 
The government expects a surplus of $5 billion, $5 billion more in 
premiums than benefits.
<P>
	With its Canada social transfer, the central government, after 
cutting funding to the provinces to the bone, creates problems to 
the extent that individuals and the provinces will have no choice 
but to try and deal with the situation and then the UI fund can be 
used as a powerful tool by the federal government to intrude in 
provincial jurisdictions, because the provinces will be pushed to 
the limit.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	This is why I say the budget is two-faced. The government says 
it is giving provinces flexibility. What flexibility exactly? I would 
like to know what sort of flexibility it is, when the provinces are 
forced essentially to slash all programs.
<P>
	And I have yet to discuss national standards. I will conclude on 
this point. Not only is the central government cutting, plunging the 
most disadvantaged provinces into an utterly impossible situation, 
not only is it positioning itself to anticipate the next recession and 
force the provinces to come and eat out of its hand, it is quite 
simply announcing that it will continue to impose common goals 
and principles and that it will use these transfers to impose, to 
promote-and that is the word it uses-its common goals and 
principles.
<P>
	When the government talks of promoting goals and principles 
under the Canada social transfer in federal legislation, legislation 
that will in all likelihood never come before the courts because it is 
short term, we can assume it has powerful ways of imposing 
standards.
<P>
	What is more distressing is that, up to now, no conditions of any 
sort were ever attached to post-secondary education. It was so 
clearly a matter of provincial jurisdiction close the heart of Quebec 
that there had been nothing like federal standards, which seemed 
unthinkable, out of the question, impossible. Yet, this so-called 
flexible bill provides that the federal government will encourage 
the provinces to establish common goals and principles in health 
care, post-secondary education, welfare and social services.
<P>
	What is not said is that, for these goals and principles to receive 
federal approval, they must be reached unanimously. The 
government has refused to say that unanimity was required, and we 
did ask repeatedly.
<P>
	We find ourselves with a government which tells us that it will 
ask one of its ministers to bring together the provincial ministers to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13252"> 13252 </A></B>
<P>
try to agree on common principles  and objectives and to use the 
transfers to promote these common principles and objectives.
<P>
	When we say that, the government gets very emotional and 
argues that we are mistaken, that it simply wants to be flexible. 
Nobody can believe that it is flexibility that the government has in 
mind. Nobody believes it because each time the government has 
been blasted by the rest of Canada which wants national standards, 
its answer has always been: ``Yes, we have asked Mr. Axworthy to 
meet with the provinces and we want national standards''.
<P>
	To conclude, I will say that this is a two-faced budget, that the 
government has two objectives: to smother the provinces and to dip 
deeper into the unemployment fund, which comes from the pockets 
of workers and businesses. The government claims that it wants to 
promote flexibility for Quebec in order to soften us Quebecers 
before the referendum, while in fact it is getting ready to use the 
Canada social transfer to promote its own principles and 
objectives.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	In so doing, the government will reach both of its goals, which 
are certainly not aimed at decentralization but rather at the 
development of a new Canada, made in Ottawa and without any 
consultation. Step by step, bit by bit and bill by bill, even though it 
denies any intention of changing the constitution-it killed the 
Meech Lake agreement after all-the government is preparing a 
new Canada nonetheless. And, judging by what is happening in 
Quebec, where the Quebec government must make painful cuts in 
health care services, education, social services and welfare, in this 
new Canada, the central government will receive loads of money 
coming from unemployment insurance premiums, from the 
citizens in fact, and it will use this money against the citizens of 
Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my colleague from 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca. We will speak for approximately 10 
minutes each.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member, being a 
grandfather-to-be, may not realize that there is no sharing of time. 
They are 10-minute speeches. There is an agreement between the 
two parties to have two speakers from each party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> I stand corrected. I am pleased to rise today to 
speak to Bill C-76 regarding the implementation of certain 
provisions of the budget tabled last February. The areas I want to 
speak to primarily deal with the motions we put forward 
concerning provincial transfer payments, the health act, social 
transfers and transfers in support of post-secondary education. 
They are contained in Motions Nos. 28, 31, 33, 35, 46, 49 to 55 and 
57.
<P>
	The motions are broken down into basically three categories. It 
is fair to begin by talking about the government's ability to 
continue to fund programs in the way it has in the past.
<P>
	Unlike the Bloc Quebecois, Reformers realize that the 
government is having some severe cash problems. We are not 
asking the government to start borrowing a whole bunch more 
money to continue the funding of the programs at the levels we 
were accustomed to in the past.
<P>
	We owe about $500 billion and our interest payments are far 
more than all the programs put together, but the government is 
cutting back its transfer payments in support of the programs. 
There is no doubt about it. Transfer payments in support of health 
care to the provinces have been declining. There is no reason to 
believe that sooner or later it will come to the point where there 
will be no federal money going to the provinces.
<P>
	I suppose this would be all right if the provinces were allowed, 
as the funds were withdrawn or diminished, to have a say in how 
the health care systems within their provinces were to be run. That 
would include the provinces having some flexibility to come up 
with creative funding plans to make up for the moneys they will not 
be receiving from the federal government.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	In some provinces, particularly Alberta, private enterprises have 
gone into the health care business. The most well known is the 
Gimble eye clinic in Alberta, a much needed service. It is a very 
busy place. People are going to the clinic because they cannot get 
the same kind of treatment on a timely basis through the public 
health care system.
<P>
	Now the federal government looks at the private enterprise, this 
much needed and much used service, and says that it is against the 
Canada Health Act, that it cannot operate any more, and that if it 
does the government will cut back on funding.
<P>
	In B.C. there are a few people making movements to provide 
portions of private health care in different areas. The federal 
government is pulling back the transfer payments and funding. I 
know it has to do it because it does not have any money. It disturbs 
me that at the same time, notwithstanding that it will not be giving 
the money, they cannot do anything about it to replace the services 
they will not have any more. This is grossly unfair to the provinces.
<P>
	Another part of the bill that really disturbs me is that the 
government has decided to put itself above what we would consider 
a judicious procedure in determining whether a province has 
violated a portion of the Canada Health Act. In other words it is 
giving itself unilateral powers in the bill to determine whether a 
province is allowing something to go on that violates stipulations 
in the Canada Health Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13253"> 13253 </A></B>
<P>
	It has given itself the unilateral power to decide what the 
financial penalty shall be. This is placing itself above what we 
normally would expect would take place in all fairness in a court 
of law.
<P>
	Our amendments would force the government, if it believes a 
violation has taken place, to put the case before a court of law to let 
a judge decide whether or not there was a violation and if there was 
exactly what penalty would be payable.
<P>
	I get concerned when I see such words in government bills, 
orders in council, governors in council and orders in cabinet. The 
Liberal government, as did the Tory government, introduced 
legislation that made it boss. Notwithstanding the arguments that 
could be put forward by the opposition parties representing their 
constituents and protecting the interests of the people of Canada 
against unfair legislation, and notwithstanding that this is supposed 
to be a House of debate, the government is constantly slipping in 
provisions in the bill that would allow it to unilaterally make 
decisions affecting all citizens of Canada.
<P>
	Where there is no provision for the people of Canada to be 
protected against bad legislation or bad judgment on behalf of the 
government of the day, it is treading on democracy. We really 
object to the fact the government can make not only unilateral 
decisions but arbitrary decisions that in many cases may not be 
sound. The decisions may have a profound effect on Canadian 
people so we have put forth some amendments to deal with it.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	We also have a problem with clause 48 that uses the phrase by 
mutual consent in the context of additional national standards and 
criteria. The bill would permit the government through discussions 
with some or all of the provinces to come to a mutual consent with 
some of them. It would allow them to create a national standard 
which could be imposed on provinces that did not provide mutual 
consent to the national standard.
<P>
	We have introduced some amendments to prevent the federal 
government from imposing national standards, for example in the 
case of welfare, without the consent of all provinces. It is simply 
not fair that a government can arrive at an agreement with some 
provinces and impose the agreement on all provinces.
<P>
	My last point deals with the creation of the Canada health and 
social transfer. The government has put all health funding, welfare 
funding, Canada assistance plan funding and post-secondary 
education funding in one basket. It is saying that it will be 
considered as a lump sum. It has done this for a particular reason. It 
knows the problems it is running into with the Canada Health Act. 
It knows the Canada Health Act is redundant at this point. It is 
simply not working because there is not  enough money to fund the 
plan we have come to know and love and now cannot afford.
<P>
	As funding for health care in Canada is diminished, I believe to a 
point of zero in the future, the government will have no stick left to 
impose a demand on the provinces that they stick to the Canada 
Health Act. Provinces like Alberta, B.C. and Quebec or any other 
province might want to be creative in raising funding to raise the 
quality of health care in their provinces to a level people want. 
With no funds left in the Canada health transfer payments the 
government cannot impose any penalties because they are not 
paying it any money.
<P>
	It has taken the Canada health payments, the Canada assistance 
plan payments, the welfare payments, and the post-secondary 
education payments and put them all into one big basket. If a 
province wants to get a little creative and flexible in providing 
health care and in the eyes of the government violates the Canada 
Health Act in some way, the government makes a unilateral 
decision that the province is in violation of the sacred Canada 
Health Act which does not work any more in any event.
<P>
	The government will have the power to withhold funds from the 
Canada health and social transfer that now includes post-secondary 
education, social welfare and the Canada assistance plan. In other 
words if the province violates a provision of the Canada Health Act 
in the eyes of the government, the government can hold back 
money for education and welfare.
<P>
	We may wonder whether the government has any sense of 
fairness. We are hearing the same old story: the group wants to 
keep control in Ottawa and anyone outside Ottawa is considered an 
additional player and made to toe the line.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	We really oppose the fact that the government has purposely put 
in these clauses in order to get a bigger stick to keep the provinces 
in line under the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	We propose to delete a section of clause 51 that would allow the 
federal government to withhold equalization payments and other 
provincial transfers for violations under the Canada health and 
social transfer programs. In other words, the amendments we are 
proposing to the clause would take away this big stick that the 
government is so conveniently putting together.
<P>
	I have spoken about the three areas of my concern on some of 
these amendments I am putting through. The thing I want to close 
on is the fact that our social safety net is in deep trouble in this 
country. The Liberal government under Prime Minister Trudeau 
introduced a social safety net that was the Cadillac of all plans. We 
started out driving a Cadillac in our social safety-
<P>

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The fault is that of the Speaker. I did

reminded me that his time had expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on group four of the motions on 
Bill C-76, the report stage. A lot of this has to do primarily with 
provincial transfer payments for health care and education.
<P>
	I would like to point out to the House something that is perhaps 
not recognized: we do have a serious problem in health care in 
Canada today. Recently in the news it was stated that medicare is 
essential to the identity of the government. That is good, because it 
is essential to the identity of all Canadians. Unfortunately, this 
government does not recognize that in this country health care is in 
dire straits.
<P>
	Recently we have seen some tragic statistics of people dying 
while on waiting lists, waiting for essential health care services that 
this government and governments across this country should be 
providing to the Canadian public. Just this last weekend we heard 
about 25 individuals who died while on waiting lists awaiting 
surgery at the Ottawa Heart Institute.
<P>
	In my province of British Columbia, if you have prostrate cancer 
you can wait over a year to get ultrasound therapy. As a result of 
this, patients in British Columbia go to the United States in order to 
get this essential service. In fact, what we see in the United States is 
a whole industry built up around Canadian people who cannot have 
their essential health care services met and therefore are forced to 
go to the United States. It is in fact the Canadian taxpayer, through 
the medical services plan of British Columbia, who pays for that.
<P>
	This is completely unnecessary, as we have the skilled 
individuals in this country who can do this. It is just a question of 
changing our priorities.
<P>
	One of the sad things that happened as a result of the last budget 
was that over $6 billion was ripped out of the heart of education 
and health care by the federal government. As a result of that, the 
provinces are now somehow going to have to make up the shortfall. 
The result is an impossible quandary. You simply cannot pay for 
what the taxpayers are asking for and the demands of health care in 
this country through the moneys that are now provided.
<P>
	What we are going to see in the future are many more tragic 
cases of Canadians who are dying while on waiting lists, waiting 
for essential health care services to occur.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party propose a number of motions relating to 
Bill C-76. First is that we remove the government's ability to 
unilaterally decide what constitutes a violation of national 
standards and to unilaterally decide what the financial penalty 
should be. To remedy this we have proposed amendments that 
would force the federal government to take provincial  
governments to court in order to determine what the violations are 
and whether there should be any penalties. Second, we have put 
forth motions to prevent the federal government from imposing 
additional national standards without the consent of the provinces. 
Last, we are trying to move towards a situation where we have 
unconditional transfers of health care and education dollars.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	I reiterate that it is impossible for Parliament to unconditionally 
remove money from the provinces and expect them to meet the 
demands of their citizens. It simply cannot be done. Tragically, the 
Canadian people do not realize this. Unfortunately, in the next 
federal election this will haunt all of us, because people who are on 
waiting lists are going to die.
<P>
	We propose a different solution, which will meet the needs and 
the objectives of having a medicare system for all Canadians and 
put it on firm financial ground.
<P>
	We do not want to destroy health care in the country. We do not 
want to destroy medicare. We want a new Canada Health Act, 
unlike what they have in the States, unlike what is in the United 
Kingdom-one made in Canada. It would entail defining essential 
health care services and ensuring that all Canadians across the 
country will have their health care services covered, regardless of 
income.
<P>
	Second, we must amend the Canada Health Act and allow the 
provinces to get their health care dollars under control. It is very 
simple. If we allow private clinics it creates a two-tiered system. 
But what happens if as a patient you want to pay for an MRI on 
your knee or your neck? You go to a private clinic and private 
dollars are exchanged into private hands. Not a cent of taxpayers' 
dollars goes into this. Sure people will get services perhaps faster 
than in the public system, but that would enable you to get off the 
public system into the private system. So those people in the public 
system would receive health care faster and more efficiently 
because they would move up the waiting list. There would also be 
more money in the system on a per capita basis.
<P>
	This is not a threat to medicare. Rather, this an adjunct to 
medicare, which will help it. Would it be a two-tiered system? Yes. 
But is it not better to have an unequal system that provides better 
and more timely access for all Canadians than a relatively equal 
system that provides poor access to essential health care services? 
The choice is very easy.
<P>
	Another aspect I would like to address is to ask the federal 
government to take a leadership role in health care in analysing the 
determinants of health care in Canada. We often put forward 
grandiose plans of studies on many things, but nobody actually 
takes the bull by the horns and tells us what makes up health care in 
the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13255"> 13255 </A></B>
<P>
	I will give some solutions. One thing that is in greatest neglect 
is the fact that in early childhood education, children aged from 
two to five years, the pillars of a normal psyche are developed. 
The pillars of good health are also developed. We do not put 
enough emphasis on that area. The emphasis we can put on that 
area will actually pay off in spades later on in the health and 
welfare of the adults.
<P>
	I would argue that we should put more emphasis on teaching 
children, at that age, not only their ABC's, but also teaching them 
about self-respect, pride, respect for other people, and appropriate 
conflict resolution. These things can be done. Although we take it 
for granted that many people know this, we would perhaps be very 
surprised to find out that in some dysfunctional families and in the 
lower echelons of the socio-economic groups, these things are 
actually unknown. Some children have not grown up with this, and 
some have grown up in very tragic situations indeed, where the 
givens of a normal psyche are not there. Many children and parents 
do not know this.
<P>
	I would ask the government to look at an interesting experiment 
that was done at Columbia University. It took over an inner-city 
school board that was wracked by violence, sexual abuse, drug 
abuse, teen drop-out rates. It focused on the aspects of teaching 
self-respect, et cetera, in the early years and found out that it paid 
off in spades when the children grew up.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	The other aspect I would like to focus on is something on 
aboriginal health care. I would seek to support some of the ideas I 
have had on aboriginal health.
<P>
	We have created an institutionalized welfare state in many 
aboriginal reserves. By continually pouring money into the 
aboriginal reserves we have not succeeded in addressing some of 
the underlying problems that are actually behind the sexual abuse, 
violence, and the general malaise of the soul that we see on many 
reserves.
<P>
	I would say let us focus on enabling the aboriginal people to take 
care of themselves. Let us put the responsibility for their destiny 
back on their shoulders. Let us help them to do that. Let us help 
them to call their own shots. Let us put an end to the 
institutionalized welfare state that we have set up.
<P>
	More money is not the answer. Giving people the tools to help 
themselves is. I would strongly urge this government to do this in 
the name of health care for all aboriginal people.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at the 
time of the adjournment is as follows: the hon. member for 
Frontenac- bovine somatotropin.
<P>
	Debate resumes with the hon. member for Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
present federal government is obviously trying to lead people 
astray. To illustrate this, I will, if I may, quote from a statement 
made by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, on March 31, 
during Question Period.
<P>
	Answering a question by my colleague, the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, on the Canada social transfer, the 
minister said this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Bloc Quebecois just keeps stating a position contradicted by facts, by the 
budget and by reality.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I can only repeat what I said earlier, namely that the budget is clear, that the 
requirements for social assistance have been reduced, that, if any standards are 
established, they will be established by mutual consent. It is very unfortunate that the 
opposition informs the people of Quebec soo poorly on such major issues.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Several aspects of this statement deserve that we go back to 
them. The first one is that the minister, the member for 
Hull-Aylmer, blamed the Bloc Quebecois for misinforming the 
people. Let us keep this in mind, as I will mention it again in my 
conclusion.
<P>
	The second aspect is that requirements for social assistance have 
been reduced. The third one is that, if standards are established, 
they will be by mutual consent. Let us analyze these two points 
before we deal with the Canada social transfer.
<P>
	As far as requirements for social assistance are concerned, the 
minister said that they would be reduced. Let us see what is 
happening under Bill C-76. Clause 48 is key to the bill as it creates 
the Canada Health and Social Transfer. It provides for the terms of 
application of the transfer. Under subclause (1), it states the three 
objectives of the Canada social transfer, namely: financing social 
programs, maintaining national conditions relating to health care, 
and maintaining national standards relating to other social 
programs.
<P>
	It should be pointed out at this point that clause 53, which 
applies to clause 48 I just mentioned, states that social programs 
include programs in respect of health, post-secondary education, 
social assistance and social services.
<P>
	The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs had the nerve to say 
in this House that requirements for social services would be 
reduced. This is what I call deceiving people. Far from being 
reduced, their number is increased. There are new constraints, new 
national standards being imposed, to be developed in accordance 
with clause 48, paragraph 3.
<P>
	This provision clearly states, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The minister of Human Resources Development shall invite representatives of all 
the provinces to consult and work together to develop, through mutual consent, a set of </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13256"> 13256 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>shared principles and objectives for the other social programs referred to in  
paragraph (1)(<I>d</I>) that could underlie the Canada Health and Social Transfer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It could not be put any plainer than that. There will be national 
standards and these national standards will concern post-secondary 
education, social assistance and social services.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	We already had national health standards; now, standards will be 
introduced in the other areas I just mentioned. This is what the 
minister calls a relaxation of rules or requirements. This is not an 
interpretation given by the Bloc Quebecois. The words were taken 
straight out of the legislation before this House, and there is a 
blatant contradiction between these and what the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs said. The Bloc Quebecois is not 
misinforming the public; the government is.
<P>
	Let us look at the third question covered in the hon. minister's 
statement, namely the development of principles through mutual 
consent. I read you the third paragraph of clause 48, which provides 
for what was referred to as dialogue. That is certainly the finest 
euphemism I have heard in a long time. I repeat, the bill itself 
provides for a dialogue to be established between the provinces to 
develop objectives and principles through mutual consent.
<P>
	Very few Quebecers will not shudder at this prospect. Quebec's 
history has demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt the pitfalls 
associated with interprovincial dialogue, especially when the 
federal government demands such co-operation and has the power 
to punish any province refusing to get along nicely with the others.
<P>
	History is repeating itself. In terms of manpower training, social 
programs and education, Quebec wants full control over its 
programs. Yet the federal government is about to systematically 
invade these areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	How can anyone reasonably expect Quebec to agree with this 
approach? How can anyone expect Quebec, which is calling on the 
federal government to simply withdraw from all sectors under 
provincial jurisdiction, to come to an agreement with the other 
provinces? Everyone knows that this is impossible.
<P>
	History is repeating itself. Because of their majority, the English 
speaking provinces will decide what standards they want for all of 
Canada. These standards will then be imposed on Quebec, which 
will be forced to respect them because otherwise its share of federal 
funds will be reduced.
<P>
	This is what they refer to as mutual consent? This is the kind of 
flexible federalism they are offering us? No thanks. In this case, it 
is not the Bloc Quebecois but the government that is trying to 
misinform the public.
<P>
	My colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot is proposing that all 
clauses dealing with the Canada social transfer be deleted, and he 
has my full support. Instead of passing the bill before us, the 
federal government would do much better to withdraw completely 
from areas of provincial jurisdiction such as health, education, job 
training and social services.
<P>
	It would be much better for the federal government to withdraw 
from this costly duplication and encroachment and transfer related 
tax points to the provinces, as the Quebec government demanded 
again very recently. A cleanup is in order.
<P>
	Government officials must stop misleading the public on our 
intentions, which are always so transparent in the end. The Bloc 
Quebecois is saying no to the Canada social transfer as proposed by 
the federal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-76 is a direct attack on the poor. We already know that, and we 
said it several times in this House, but we must repeat it again: it is 
a direct attack on the most vulnerable members of our society.
<P>
	The government wants to cut $7 billion, next year and the 
following year, in social programs. We are talking about a $7 
billion cut in programs designed to help sick people, welfare 
recipients and students. This is in addition to all the other cuts 
made since the government took office. Over the last two years, 
these cuts have totalled $10 billion in Quebec alone. They affect 
the unemployed, as well as sick people, students and welfare 
recipients. The government even cut seniors' benefits.
<P>
	This legislation targets the poor. The government does not take 
the issue of poverty seriously. On the contrary, the situation has 
worsened since the Liberals took office. Not only does the 
government target the poor, it also seeks, through this bill, to 
protect rich people, large corporations, etc.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	If the federal government really wanted to save money, it could 
take some very simple measures. First, it could withdraw 
completely from social programs and transfer its responsibilities, 
along with the tax points, to the provinces. This would only make 
sense, considering that health, education and social programs fall 
under provincial jurisdiction. By insisting on remaining involved 
in these areas, the federal government violates its own constitution.
<P>
	If the federal government were serious and really wanted to 
respect provincial jurisdiction, it would withdraw from health, 
education and welfare programs. Not only would it then abide by 
the constitution, it would also make astronomical savings. If the 
federal government really wanted to save money, it would simply 
withdraw from these programs, where there is duplication and 
overlap, at present.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13257"> 13257 </A></B>
<P>
	Think about it. Operating costs at the federal Department of 
Health reach about $1 billion every year. By eliminating this 
department, we would save $1 billion a year. The same thing goes 
for the Department of Human Resources Development, where 
operating costs probably reach up to $2 billion a year. There are 
savings to be made in every duplicated program. The federal 
government would save a lot of money if it withdrew from such 
programs as health, social services and education. But also it 
would not interfere and prevent provinces from working properly.
<P>
	For example, we know that the Quebec government has been 
asking for exclusive jurisdiction over training, but the federal 
government will not yield. Because of this conflict between Ottawa 
and the provincial government, training is not adequate, and losses 
could be as high as $250 million.
<P>
	If the federal government were to withdraw from social 
programs, from provincial areas of jurisdiction, it would save a lot 
of money. If it really wanted to reduce the deficit, this solution 
would be the most logical one to opt for, particularly as it is 
constitutionally correct and takes into account the diversity of 
Canadian society. For example, imposing national standards across 
the country not only for social programs, but also for services, 
education and health, reduces flexibility and the capacity to adapt 
and to innovate in these sectors. If the provinces were given control 
of these areas, they may be able to find solutions to these critical 
and serious problems.
<P>
	The very serious problems Quebec is currently experiencing in 
the health care sector are a cause of concern for many people. We 
are in the process of closing a certain number of hospitals in 
Quebec. In my riding, Québec-Est, people are particularly 
concerned. Last week, 10,000 people protested about what is 
happening at the Christ-Roi hospital.
<P>
	These concerns and cuts are due to the fact that the federal 
government is reducing its transfer payments-to Quebec and to 
the other provinces as well-while trying to maintain national 
standards which no longer meet our needs.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	The federal government is increasingly heading toward a form of 
bankruptcy. We already expect that, before the turn of the century, 
it will not have any money left to support social programs. It is 
already trying to maintain national standards, criteria that it 
imposes upon the provinces not because it worries about savings, 
obviously, but mostly because it wants to take over these areas of 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the federal government did not care more 
about the poor because, clearly, the situation is deteriorating in 
Canada and in Quebec. Indeed, the federal government is playing 
politics on the back of the poor.
<P>
	In Quebec, we would like to repatriate powers concerning social 
programs, because the provincial government is basically in a 
better position to deal with problems in health and education. The 
provincial government is in a better position to meet these needs. 
So far, the federal government has not properly met the needs of the 
people of Quebec; this is one of the reasons why we want to 
achieve sovereignty, because we fundamentally need those powers 
to create full employment policies and family policies, as well.
<P>
	We need those powers to integrate all the elements of training, 
education, job creation and family policy, and to create a full 
employment policy in Quebec. Quebec fundamentally needs those 
powers. In fact, it is one of the reasons why Quebec wants to 
achieve sovereignty. Not only because it would save money but 
because we want to give young people and the not so young some 
hope of getting a job.
<P>
	We also know that in Quebec we have the expertise. We have the 
know-how. We have certain projects we can develop that will help 
us do a better job than is now the case. In fact, we could hardly do 
worse, because as long as Quebec remains part of Canada, the 
situation is likely to deteriorate and surely will, because basically, 
the federal government has less and less money to contribute to 
social programs, while it tries to maintain national standards.
<P>
	This patently absurd situation will make things increasingly 
difficult for Quebecers, and that is why Bill C-76 is a genuine 
attack against the vulnerable in our society and shows no real 
interest in saving money, on the contrary. The government wants to 
reduce its deficit but, in the process, it mercilessly attacks the poor, 
the unemployed, the sick, people on welfare, students and senior 
citizens, while it could save a lot of money by simply withdrawing 
from all social programs and giving these powers to the provinces, 
in compensation for tax points.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, some time ago a group of young children were standing in 
a small ball field. They were not yet playing; they were awaiting 
the arrival of little Lloyd and little Diane. These were the two kids, 
a brother and a sister, brats though they were, who had the bat and 
ball so the game could not start until they got there. The father of 
little Lloyd and little Diane was quite wealthy. In fact, he had got 
most of his wealth from the parents of the other children who were 
waiting to play ball. He took so much money from them that they 
could not afford to buy their own bat and ball.
<P>
	Finally little Lloyd and little Diane showed up at the field and 
the kids were ready to play. Knowing all the positions and all the 
rules they were ready to start but  little Lloyd and little Diane said: 
``No, just hold it a minute. We cannot play until we explain the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13258"> 13258 </A></B>
<P>
rules of the game to you''. The kids said: ``But we already know the 
rules of the game and we know how to play'', to which they replied: 
``Yes, but it is our bat and ball, so you are going to play by our 
rules''.
<P>
	Sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution lay out the federal and 
provincial responsibilities. In the Constitution it is the provincial 
responsibility, not federal, to provide health care. It is the 
provincial responsibility, not the federal responsibility to provide 
welfare. This applies to many of the other areas as well that the 
federal government seems so anxious to interfere with. It is the old 
story of it is my bat and my ball and I make the rules once again.
<P>
	The federal government recognizes it has absolutely no authority 
to interfere in the actual operation of the health care system for 
example. It has its own brand of rules it wants to place on the 
various provinces, so it says: ``It is our money. If you want it, you 
will play by our rules''. In essence it is perverting the very acts 
contained in the Constitution of Canada creating many problems in 
our social services.
<P>
	Saskatchewan solutions are not necessarily the solutions for 
New Brunswick. Ontario solutions are not necessarily the solutions 
for British Columbia.
<P>
	I would say to my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, some of 
whom I have talked to at length: Stop talking of and working 
toward separation. We have to make some changes but instead of 
changing the boundaries of Canada we should be changing the 
government itself. We should get rid of the last bastion of the old 
traditional political parties of the past that have neither served them 
nor any other province well in these areas.
<P>
	For some strange reason members of the federal government 
seem to think they have this divine power, this extreme knowledge 
that in coming to Ottawa, they know better than the people in the 
provinces, that know better than the Canadian citizens. They think 
that Canadian citizens are not smart enough within their own 
provinces to tell their provincial governments what they want, what 
solution is going to work in their province.
<P>
	We have the same old problem coming to the provinces. It is in 
the form of the Minister of Human Resources Development and the 
Minister of Health who say the same thing as those two spoiled 
brats with the rich father: ``It is my bat and ball, so I am going to 
make the rules''. Those rules do not work.
<P>
	We agree with the concept that we have to have a devolution of 
many of the authorities from the federal government simply 
because we are not getting the solutions that work. We are 
duplicating the services. We are getting many problems that could 
be resolved better at the local level.
<P>
	Last summer I attended the official opening in my riding of a 
new water treatment plant. As I stepped up to the microphone to 
say a few words of greeting to the people gathered, the mayor of the 
town was sitting beside me. As I went to speak he whispered to me: 
``Give us money, give us money, give us money''. I said a few 
words and then said: ``Your mayor is sitting beside me saying 
money, money, money. He sounds like Liza Minelli in an old 
movie''.
<P>
	One thing the mayor did not realize, and maybe some others at 
this point still do not, was that I do not see my mandate as going to 
Ottawa to try to get federal money for the riding. I see it as trying to 
get the federal government to stop giving so much money to other 
ridings and ultimately to stop taking so much of our money in the 
first place.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	There is something inherently wrong with a system that takes 
away all one's money at the beginning of the year in taxes and then 
has one begging and pleading to get some of that money back. That 
is the way social transfers are working. It is not the federal 
government's money. It is our money. It is the Canadian taxpayers' 
money. The federal government takes it out of the pockets of 
taxpayers. It takes it away from the jurisdiction of the provinces 
which have the constitutional responsibility for most of these 
programs and then says the same old adage of it is my bat and my 
ball: ``You still must play by our rules or we will not give you your 
own money back''.
<P>
	That is unacceptable. It does not work. It is leading to debt. It is 
leading to the erosion of the very programs the Liberal government 
would have us believe it is trying to save. It is not saving the health 
care system by overtaxing, making rules that do not work in 
various regions of the country. It is creating the very problem it 
claims to be trying to resolve. The sooner the government stops 
doing that, the sooner it gets away from the rules and regulations it 
is trying to entrench with Bill C-76, the better off all Canadians will 
be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as this part of the debate draws to a 
close, I would like to review some of the amendments supported by 
the Bloc and later supported by the Reform Party.
<P>
	Dealing first with the motions of the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, these proposed amendments would remove 
all references to the Canada health and social transfer in the bill, in 
effect killing the Canada health and social transfer. The 
amendments would also keep in place the intrusive cost sharing 
rules of the Canada assistance plan that have limited the provinces' 
ability to innovate and improve their social programs to better meet 
the needs of Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13259"> 13259 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canada health and social transfer replaces the Canada 
assistance plan, which currently contributes to provincial social 
assistance and social services, as well as the established programs 
financing, which currently contributes to health and 
post-secondary education. The CHST combines existing federal 
transfers into a single block fund. It provides the provinces with 
the ability to better explore the linkages and synergies between 
health, post-secondary education and social assistance. This 
completes the gradual evolution away from cost sharing to block 
funding of programs in areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The Canada health and social transfer provides the provinces 
with the flexibility they need to experiment and improve social 
programs. There are many concrete examples of what this greater 
flexibility could entail in practice.
<P>
	These amendments would delete such clauses as clause 32 which 
repeals the Canada assistance plan. The effect of this amendment 
would be to leave in place the cumbersome and intrusive system of 
cost sharing social assistance and social services which has 
stymied provincial efforts to innovate and improve social 
programs. Moreover this amendment would perpetuate the 
administrative burden associated with cost sharing.
<P>
	Another clause that would be deleted would be clause 48. This 
clause puts in place many of the building blocks of the Canada 
health and social transfer. It includes the process in which the 
Minister of Human Resources Development will invite all 
provincial governments to work together in developing through 
mutual consent a set of shared principles and objectives that could 
underline the Canada health and social transfer and thus allow all 
governments to reaffirm their commitment to the social well-being 
of Canadians.
<P>
	The amendment would also derail the government's fiscal plan 
to reduce the burden of debt and put social programs on a more 
sustainable basis, a fiscal plan that has been designed to ensure the 
survival of social programs in the future. In this regard the 
proposed amendments would cost the government $7 billion over 
the next two years.
<P>
	Turning now to the motions of the member for Lethbridge from 
the Reform Party, these amendments would have the effect of 
reducing the power of the government and this House to protect the 
access of Canadians to health care and the basic protection of social 
assistance. To this end, they must be defeated.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	The main thrust of these amendments is to change the 
enforcement mechanisms that can be used to protect the criteria 
and conditions in the legislation, namely the five criteria and two 
conditions of the Canada Health Act and the condition that there be 
no residency requirement for provincial social assistance. The 
enforcement mechanism  put forward in the bill is modelled on the 
Canada Health Act which has worked very well for Canadians over 
the past 11 years.
<P>
	This enforcement mechanism requires the relevant minister, the 
Minister of Health in the case of the Canada Health Act, and the 
Minister of Human Resources Development in the case of social 
assistance, to determine whether a violation has occurred and to 
act. The legislation sets out exactly how these ministers should 
proceed in terms of notifying the province, making a report to the 
province within 90 days and if they are not satisfied that the 
violation has stopped that they refer the matter of penalties to the 
governor in council.
<P>
	What the amendments put forward by the hon. member propose 
is to take the ministers and the cabinet out of the process and to 
give the power to the federal court. In spite of our respect for the 
federal court and its role, it is not the appropriate place for the 
enforcement of the criteria and conditions governing the Canada 
health and social transfer.
<P>
	It is essential that these ministers, as elected members of this 
House and as members of the cabinet with particular 
responsibilities for the health care system and the social security 
system, have the discretion to determine whether the provinces are 
in compliance with the Canada health and social transfer.
<P>
	One of the main purposes of the Canada health and social 
transfer is to encourage innovation and experimentation by the 
provinces in the delivery of their programs, for example to find 
more efficient and effective methods of helping people to find and 
keep jobs and to become more self-reliant. The determination of 
whether these new approaches respect the standards set in the 
legislation must be made by a minister with a broad perspective on 
policy and the ability to use discretion and diplomacy in order to 
protect the integrity of our health and social programs. The federal 
court is simply not the best place to do this.
<P>
	Equally, it is cabinet that should use its broad perspective to 
determine the appropriate penalty in the case of a violation by the 
withholding of cash transfers. This bill will give the governor in 
council the ability to set the appropriate penalty having regard to 
the gravity of the non-compliance. The amendment would give this 
power to the federal court which would lack this broader 
perspective.
<P>
	Finally, I will deal with Motion No. 46. This motion would drop 
the reference that one of the purposes of the Canada health and 
social transfer is to promote the shared principles and objectives 
that are to be developed by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development in consultation with provincial governments and with 
mutual consent. This is of central importance to the government's 
social policy. Canadians expect their governments to reflect their 
expectations for social  programs, that they will protect the most 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13260"> 13260 </A></B>
<P>
vulnerable, that they will improve the situation of people by 
helping them to help-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The parliamentary secretary may not 
realize it but we are not dealing with Motion No. 46 at the moment. 
That will be part of the next grouping.
<P>
	Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the debate on these groupings at 
report stage debate of Bill C-76. I have listened very carefully 
because I am quite concerned about the government's lack of 
intention to continue to hear the debate in front of us today.
<P>
	When I learned that the government was invoking time 
allocation and that this closure motion by government was going to 
shut down debate on a bill that essentially, for all intents and 
purposes, is one of the most important-
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. There is great 
sensitivity among Canadians to the word ``closure''. The 
government is very proud of the fact that it has not used closure. 
The hon. member slipped up by describing time allocation as 
closure.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The parliamentary secretary will realize 
that is a point of debate rather than a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize the parliamentary secretary is 
engaging in debate. He knows that time allocation is a closure 
motion no matter what it is called.
<P>
	Members of Parliament from various parts of Canada will not be 
allowed to say what they want if there is not enough time allocated 
in which to say it.
<P>
	I listened very carefully today because the speeches made on this 
grouping of motions in particular and on the groupings that 
occurred earlier in the debate last week when I was here, were very 
thoughtful, researched presentations. The research and thoughtful 
actions should have been undertaken by the government in its own 
time before preparing this bill, which as I indicated earlier but did 
not quite complete saying because of the interruption on this 
fundamental and most important bill.
<P>
	Members are aware that the grouping in front of us today deals 
with health care. We have also dealt with issues relating to the 
elimination of the Crow rate and we still have other matters before 
us for debate. Because of time allocation and the closure motion, 
some of the motions will not even make it to the floor for debate 
before time runs out. Members who have given a great deal of 
thought and a lot of effort to preparing  amendments will not even 
have the opportunity to present them for debate because we will run 
out of time.
<P>
	This is a complete outrage. We are debating a matter that 
completely changes the way in which education and health care are 
financed, completely changes the way in which the transport of 
grain on the prairies is financed, completely changes the way in 
which Canada operates from coast to coast to coast.
<P>
	I cannot say it enough. I am completely outraged by this matter. 
It really disturbs me that when I talk about the government not 
wanting to listen-and they are sitting babbling over there, 
obviously not prepared to listen, just giving credence to the point 
that I am trying to make.
<P>
	One of the members earlier in his comments talked about 
Saskatchewan having been a founding part of medicare and our 
health care system. I speak with some credibility when I say that 
Canadians very much value their health care system. They do not 
want to see it tampered with.
<P>
	There is great evidence that the actions of the Liberals in other 
parts of the country, particularly when it relates to the provincial 
election held in Manitoba, the provincial election that is under way 
here in Ontario, the provincial election that is under way in the 
province of Saskatchewan, that people regard their health care 
system as being very important. They are indicating first in the 
electoral polls and second in the public opinion polls that they do 
not trust the federal Liberal government in this regard. They are 
translating that into their electoral votes at the provincial level.
<P>
	Some weeks ago some of the designers of Canada's health care 
system from Saskatchewan indicated to the government that it was 
on the wrong path, that if implemented the aspects that we most 
value in our health care system would be seriously eroded. The 
government heard the words of those wise individuals who spoke 
before the finance committee. Each of these wise people have 
indicated that the present system will result in the erosion of the 
health care system as we know it today.
<P>
	Certainly the government should be listening to those wise 
voices whether it be some of those who participated in the 
designing of the system out in Saskatchewan or whether it be those 
who are presently delivering the system, whether it be the Canadian 
Medical Association or as quoted today in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, the 
Canadian Hospital Association.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	If I can quote from the <I>Globe and Mail</I> of today, it indicates how 
important this is, not only to the Canadian public but to those who 
are involved directly in the system. The article reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When the Canadian Hospital Association opens its annual meeting in Calgary 
today, it will issue a ``call to arms'' against the federal government's plans for health 
care.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13261"> 13261 </A></B>
<P>
	Surely to goodness when an organization as credible and as 
astute as the Canadian Hospital Association issues a call to arms 
the government must be prepared to listen. It is incredible that 
instead of listening not only to the fine speeches of members of 
the House of Commons but to people across the country who want 
to see their health care system protected that the government 
should be moving to cut off the debate and not listen to what is 
being said anywhere in Canada. To barrel ahead as the government 
is on this matter is clearly incredible and outrageous.
<P>
	In addition to the health care bill I earlier spoke on the Crow 
legislation. The government has not demonstrated at committee 
stage or in the House that it is prepared to understand the long term 
implications of the bill, whether they apply to health care or 
assistance in getting grain to port. The immediate loss of $400 
million in grain transportation in the province of Saskatchewan 
alone is quite significant. I am quite appalled and amazed that the 
government has not taken the time to consider the long term 
implications in that regard.
<P>
	As the House leader of the New Democratic Party I am very 
mindful of the words of the government and the actions which it 
takes. I recall reading in the local Ottawa media last week when the 
House was not sitting that the government House leader indicated 
that 32 pieces of legislation would have to be passed before the 
government adjourns the House for the summer recess on June 23. 
I cannot help thinking that the government is wanting to get home 
for the summer holidays-
<P>

hon. member that his time has expired.

	Is the House ready for the question?

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I believe this includes all the motions in 
this group. Is that correct?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before I turn to the main contents of my remarks, I would 
like to remind members of the House that in the last 24 hours the 
debt of the Government of Canada rose by $100 million. It now has 
reached a total of $556 billion. This is a very severe indictment of 
the budget, of which Bill C-76 is merely a method for 
implementing its contents.
<P>
	We should periodically recall that Canada is in severe 
difficulties. We have to do more to eliminate the deficit, especially 
now that the economy seems to be slowing down and there are 
some indications of inflation raising its ugly head. I had hoped and 
wished that the government had cut spending more but obviously it 
was not to be.
<P>
	Bill C-76 implements the budget. I am here to discuss the 
amendments which the Reform Party has proposed with respect to 
the maintenance of national standards of social programs.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has a severe problem because it has 
switched from the traditional granting of cash to the provinces to a 
system which ultimately will lead to the elimination of all cash 
transfers. The reason is that along with the cash transfers used to 
come the opportunity to impose national standards on welfare and 
health and other programs which were financed. When this is 
eliminated the government will have difficulties because it will not 
have leverage over the provinces.
<P>
	How has the government attempted to resolve the problem? The 
problem has been resolved by having the opportunity, without 
consent from the provinces, to impose standards. This is an 
interpretation we have put on what is in the bill. The government is 
acting without the consent of the provinces to impose standards. 
The Reform Party believes this is a very serious matter.
<P>
	It is a pulling of power toward the centre that is unprecedented in 
Canada and we wish to oppose it. We have proposed some 
amendments which would clarify the point. No minister, no agent 
of the crown, can simply impose standards. They can be imposed 
only with the mutual consent of all of the provinces.
<P>
	The second method which is very disturbing to Reformers is the 
decision whether certain standards have been violated by any 
province can be decided by cabinet in a closed session. We believe 
it is a similarly usurpation of power which is not suitable for the 
federal state. Third, there is a clause which we find unfortunate in 
that the power to withhold finances will not just be limited to the 
program, the standards of which were alleged to have been 
violated, but the ability to withhold money applies to other transfer 
payments. That is also an unfortunate development.
<P>
	All of these approaches to try to maintain standards from the 
centre under the new Canada health and social transfers program 
are fundamentally against the current trend in Canadian society. 
What we have seen during the election campaign is the desire for 
devolution of power, to have smaller government.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	I find it ironic that the parliamentary secretary a minute ago was 
praising that his government's program would lead to devolution. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13263"> 13263 </A></B>
<P>
At the same time there is this  attempt to grab it back by trying to 
have clauses which restore and maintain the ability to set national 
standards.
<P>
	I find it interesting to consider how we got those national 
standards. I remind the House that many years ago there was the 
obligation of individuals to look after themselves and if they could 
not do it families did.
<P>
	We know when this is the case, cheating and excesses are not 
possible the way they are today. The closer programs are in their 
administration and design to the people they serve and who pay for 
them in the end, the more efficient and better they are.
<P>
	The family alone historically was not able to maintain those 
services. When society became more complex churches, fraternal 
associations and all kinds of decentralized but slightly collective 
organizations took very good care of society.
<P>
	How did it all happen? It happened in the post-war years when an 
intellectual, political and media elite imposed itself on Canada. It 
had a love affair with socialism, if not communism. The people 
who opposed these things thought the socialist experiment that had 
been undertaken in some of the industrial countries, especially the 
Soviet union, were a great success and that we should emulate 
them. This is how it came about. The initiation of those standards 
had their roots in a fundamental distrust in the wisdom of the 
people. They thought the people could not be trusted, that it took a 
political media elite to establish the kind of standards it thought 
were appropriate.
<P>
	To me the most unbelievable thing was that this elite was able to 
persuade the media and others of the merit of its program. It 
introduced in a major public relations coup the idea that national 
standards are needed for national identity.
<P>
	In the finance committee we heard a concerted effort of the 
political left discussing continuously on how a removal of these 
national standards means a destruction of Canadian national 
identity.
<P>
	I am appalled by the ease with which this idea is still accepted. 
There is not one person questioning it. Is anyone saying that before 
we had national standards there was no Canada? Would anyone 
wish to ask the Prime Ministers governing up to the 1950s if they 
did not preside over Canada? That in my judgment is a lot of bunk. 
It was not the kind of Canada which the socialist dreamers wanted 
but it certainly had a national identity. I think that is absolutely 
silly.
<P>
	In Europe the arguments are going in the opposite direction. 
Countries are attempting to integrate and unify their programs. For 
a long time the argument was there cannot be a united Europe, a 
European Union, because of different social programs. That is bunk 
also.
<P>
	When a person grows up in a country with low taxes and low 
social programs, especially retirement benefits,  they cannot when 
they retire or get sick move from that country of low cost in terms 
of taxes and the low quality benefits and say it is now their right as 
a member of the European Union to go into a country in Europe in 
which the taxes are high and the benefits are high.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	I can understand how that would result in a breakdown of the 
system. We pay the low insurance rate when we do not need it. 
Then when we have the need to draw on the system, we go where 
the rates are high. It is very easy to avoid this kind of thing both in 
Europe and in Canada. We will be able to move from a province 
with low benefits and costs to one with higher ones, except that the 
benefits we get have to come from the province in which we have 
made our payments when they were low. It is as simple as that.
<P>
	The ideas that we need national standards for national identity 
and that the system would break down because of different tastes, 
different levels of benefits and costs in individual provinces are a 
fabrication of people who were out there in the post-war years to 
persuade Canadians by any means possible that it takes people in 
Ottawa of obviously superior intellectual and moral standards to 
say what is the right level of welfare benefits, of health care and of 
unemployment insurance and various other goodies the state 
provides.
<P>
	The amendments the Reform Party has proposed try to deal with 
this. We have done so with the conviction that it is in the interest of 
Canada in the long run to continue the process of devolution. We 
have gone through a very noble experiment of centralization, of 
national standards, which has obviously failed. The programs are 
all in financial difficulties and there are more people needing these 
kinds of systems simply because they were not administered 
properly.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before I give the floor to the hon. 
member for Chicoutimi, I think that there is unanimous consent to 
allow the member to speak, as long as it is about group No. 7. Is 
that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the House for allowing me to discuss motions from 
the last group: the six motions moved by my colleague from 
Châteauguay. These motions are aimed at preventing the 
government from slashing veterans' grants and allowances 
programs.
<P>
	Need I remind the federal government that veterans are under its 
responsibility? Yet, I think that the government is abandoning some 
of its obligations and commitments toward them, despite some 
historical and solemn promises.
<P>
	Support to poor people, widows and senior citizens is already 
being cut. The government knows very well that  these cuts merely 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13264"> 13264 </A></B>
<P>
shift these needs for assistance to other public services, both 
federal and provincial. The only real savings that can result from 
this operation will be in the envelope for Veterans Affairs Canada.
<P>
	As usual, the government will have succeeded in passing the bill 
on to other federal departments or to the provinces. We agree with 
the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce who had also moved 
amendments in this regard.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	His amendments are totally in line with the Bloc Quebecois's 
efforts to oppose this government's proposed attack against 
veterans. We are therefore calling for the deletion of certain clauses 
affecting veterans, including clause 42, which amends the Children 
of Deceased Veterans Education Assistance Act.
<P>
	This amendment starts the gradual elimination of the benefits 
allowing the children of deceased veterans to pursue their studies. 
There are not thousands of them. This does not affect 6 million 
Canadians. Only 85 orphans currently receive these benefits. With 
one or two exceptions, they are the children of deceased members 
of the military who had the courage to participate in Canadian 
peacekeeping missions.
<P>
	The government is quick to act in this matter but very slow to do 
anything about family trusts and big business, for example. The 
government will now take away from these people, whose fathers 
died while serving their country, what may be their only chance to 
get an education.
<P>
	Under Bill C-76, those students who were receiving these 
benefits on budget day will continue to receive them, but the 
department will no longer take applications although some students 
might be eligible. In 1993-94, this program cost only $315,000. So 
this is the finance minister's great initiative. Not only does he 
attack the most vulnerable, but he now goes after the children of 
those who lost their lives while serving their country. What for? To 
save a drop in this ocean of expenditures. What is $315,000 in a 
budget of an amount you know as well as I do.
<P>
	Clauses 68 to 72 inclusively amend the War Veterans Allowance 
Act to discontinue the payment of allowances to veterans who 
served with the resistance. These provisions also provide for the 
phasing out of allowances awarded to allied veterans who 
immigrated to Canada after their service and resided in Canada for 
a period of at least ten years before applying for government 
assistance. This is another stupid initiative that will save very little 
money, while making life impossible for them when applying for 
allowances or even welfare.
<P>
	Clauses 68 and 71 also repeal provisions so that allied veterans 
who immigrate to Canada after their service will no longer be 
eligible for these allowances. This amounts to a pure and simple 
cut. Under clause 69, allowances  will no longer be paid to at least 
3,000 veterans. At the same time, this clause will have the effect of 
taking allowances away from another 1,000 resistance veterans 
whose old age security and CPP benefits place just above the 
normal threshold for certain health benefits, just at the limit.
<P>
	This will affect some 4,000 individuals, two thirds of whom live 
in Quebec. Today, they are told as offhandedly as can be to go and 
stand in line for other social programs from now on. The message 
is that they are no longer recognized by Veterans Affairs Canada 
and that barely making it back was not good enough.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	The government is showing them that it has no respect for the 
sacrifice they made. Sure, you may argue that, since the Minister of 
Finance is not a veteran, he cannot really understand what goes on 
or what these people are going through. However, if he spent some 
time in a theatre of operations, as a participant and not merely a 
spectator, he might review his bill immediately upon his return 
here.
<P>
	This federal abdication of responsibilities toward our veterans is 
yet another example of the arrogance displayed by this 
government. It also shows why we have to get out of that system. 
The government cannot keep to its word; it goes all out against the 
poor, while looking after the interests of its friends. It will never 
manage to eliminate its huge deficit with such a policy. Of the more 
than 4,000 people affected by these measures, I ask the two thirds 
who live in Quebec to think about this when the time comes to 
choose between the status quo, represented by a centralist and 
controlling federalism, and the sovereignty of a normal country, for 
a normal people, which will recognize their rights.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on the motion in relation to the Canada social 
transfer because the Liberal government is simply not facing up to 
the reality of the situation in Canada regarding health care. It is 
trying to hide the reality by disguising it with a large lump sum 
transfer to the provinces and leaving the provinces to deal with the 
problems while at the same time continuing to apply, certainly at 
the moral level, a very restricted Canada Health Act.
<P>
	In the <I>Globe and Mail</I> today there was a quote I can read to 
illustrate the problem very well. It is a quote from an adviser in the 
Prime Minister's office of all places who said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My view is we don't really have a problem per se. We have an incipient 
potentially harmful issue. We are not freaked by it. We just have to keep a eye over 
the horizon.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is obvious that somebody is a bit worried at least. It really 
bothers me that the government is acting as if we are back 20 years 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13265"> 13265 </A></B>
<P>
when it had control of the media and  propaganda and could tell 
people things and they actually believed it.
<P>
	Today in the information age with freedom of information and 
all the information available to people they see through the charade 
of the government. Everyone in my riding knows that the health 
care system is in trouble. All the bleating and discussion from the 
other side of the House about the Canada Health Act being 
maintained forever does not mean anything. The average person on 
the street knows there are problems.
<P>
	I cite a couple of examples in my riding to illustrate problems 
exist that will only get worse unless the government admits there is 
a problem and deals with it. For example, a lady in her early 
seventies late last fall badly twisted her shoulder lifting something. 
She tore the tendons away from the bone in her shoulder. She went 
to the doctor who told her that because the tendons had been torn 
away the only way to fix them was by reattaching them in surgery; 
they will not heal. She was put on the waiting list and in the 
meantime given some pain killers.
<P>
	Five months later the woman was still taking more and more 
pain killers. Because it is a muscle and tendons are joined to it, the 
muscle had shrunk back and it became more of a major job to 
reattach the tendons. Toward the end of February the woman's 
husband said that they could not wait any longer. Still the doctors 
could not give any date for the woman to go to hospital to have the 
tendons reattached.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	Luckily Vancouver is very close to the border of the United 
States. The gentleman arranged to take his wife to Seattle where 
she had surgery within two days of arriving there. The surgeons 
there said they could not understand what type of health care 
system there could be in Canada that would allow a woman to go 
for six months with that sort of condition. It was unbelievable and 
unheard of that it would happen in a place like Washington state.
<P>
	That is one example and I will give another example of a 
gentleman back in 1989 who noticed a bit of a problem with some 
blood. He went along to see his doctor who said it was a pretty bad 
situation and sent him to a specialist for a second opinion. The 
gentleman asked how long it would take me to get an appointment. 
The doctor said that it would be approximately 10 weeks.
<P>
	Anyone in the House who has ever been to a doctor and has 
subsequently had to go to a specialist knows that what I say is true. 
I certainly know in this case it was true. It takes anywhere from 10 
weeks or more to see a specialist. I know it is true in this case 
because the story is about me.
<P>
	When I found out that I would have to wait 10 weeks to see a 
specialist for what appeared to be a fairly serious problem, I said: 
``No, thank you. Please make  arrangements for me to go to the 
United States. I do not care if it costs me money because we are 
talking about a very serious problem''.
<P>
	The doctor said: ``Listen, let me make a few phone calls and see 
what I can do''. The doctor managed to get me in to see a specialist 
the same day. Because I threatened to go to the United States, I was 
queue jumped, which is wrong in itself. I admit that it is wrong. It 
should not be that way.
<P>
	Luckily for me I saw the specialist the same day and within a few 
days by also threatening to go to the United States for tests I was 
able to have a colonoscopy. I was diagnosed with colon cancer and 
given approximately six months to live. This was back in 1989.
<P>
	When they discovered the problem and there was a suggestion 
that there would be a waiting list for surgery, I had to raise the point 
that I was not prepared to wait, that I would go to the United States. 
Again I was queue jumped. That was not the only operation I had. 
After having part of my colon removed in 1989 I was put on 
chemotherapy, which is a devastating experience. Luckily the 
service was available in my riding.
<P>
	About six months later I required a second operation and again I 
was queue jumped. I was admitted through the emergency 
department of the hospital because the doctors knew that I would 
go to the United States.
<P>
	They said to me: ``The surgeon is on duty on Saturday. Why 
don't you come to the hospital, admit yourself through the 
emergency department, and we will take care of you?'' That was 
wrong but I believe I am here today because of the action I took to 
go to the United States for some tests and to make sure I was queue 
jumped for the rest.
<P>
	There is something wrong with a system that allows that sort of 
thing to happen. I had some of my tests done in the United States 
because I needed MRI, magnetic resonance imaging. I would have 
had to wait 10 weeks in Vancouver to go to St. Paul's Hospital 
which had an MRI. However it was only doing five scans a day, 
four of which were cranial, for brain tumours and things like that. 
There was only one per day for the rest of the body.
<P>
	The unit could easily do probably 20 scans a day but there was 
no budget. People could take a pet dog or cat and have it scanned by 
the MRI at St. Paul's Hospital because they could pay for it to have 
an MRI. However we are not allowed to pay for our own MRI; it is 
against the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	I went to Seattle and paid $1,000 U.S. for an MRI. It only took 
two days to get in. I went there and was treated like a client, not like 
a number on a medical services plan. I had my MRI. Incidentally 
nobody asked me how I was going to pay for it. They just admitted 
me and did the tests. They said: ``Mr. White, why don't you have a 
cup of coffee, come back in two hours and we will give you the 
radiologist's report?'' Three hours later I was on  my way back to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13266"> 13266 </A></B>
<P>
Vancouver with the radiologist's report and all the X-rays to take to 
my doctor.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	Everyone in Canada who has been through the process asks when 
the results will be ready after the test is done, only to be told that 
the doctor will call in two weeks if there is a problem. That is 
unacceptable. The quality of care is so much better in my 
experience when people are accountable to the system that there is 
no comparison. We have to start admitting there is something 
wrong with the system the way it stands.
<P>
	I use the New Zealand experience from time to time. I would like 
to mention briefly an experience with my mother who is in her 
eighties. She needed a cataract operation. She had to wait under the 
old system in New Zealand for up to six years at 80 years of age. By 
paying for herself she quickly got the service because in New 
Zealand people are allowed to pay for themselves. In a two-year 
period the waiting list was reduced from six years to six weeks 
because people could pay in what the government would call a 
two-tier system.
<P>
	In the long run admitting there are problems and dealing with 
them make it better for everybody. We should not be afraid of a 
two-tier system that enables some wealthy people to pay and in the 
end reduces waiting lists for everybody.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very happy to speak on Bill C-76, an act to implement various 
provisions of the last budget tabled by the Minister of Finance. The 
main purpose of this bill, as everyone knows, is to create the 
Canada social transfer which will have many repercussions.
<P>
	The new Canada social transfer will, first of all, lead to cuts in 
the federal transfers to provinces in the upcoming years. As we 
mentioned over and over again in order to show how serious the 
situation is, we can expect during the next three years $3 billion in 
cuts in all of Canada, including $2.5 billion in cuts in Quebec 
alone.
<P>
	Let me digress here. It is hard to talk about figures and statistics 
when we know that behind these figures are the harsh realities of 
life some people have to face. For example, in the province of 
Quebec, some hospitals will have to be closed, even though an 
increasingly significant portion of the Quebec population is having 
some serious problems, especially in Montreal where there is talk 
of a broken Quebec, and where life for some of our fellow 
Quebecers will only get tougher.
<P>
	I am both somewhat surprised and disappointed to have so little 
time to address this issue, because I would have had a lot to say. I 
would like to respond to a statement made last week by our 
colleague from Edmonton Southwest who, in response to the 
debate initiated by the Bloc Quebecois on the rationale for Bills  
C-76, C-46, C-88 and C-91, referred to the Bloc members' 
behaviour as tribalism. I find it most deplorable.
<P>
	By acting this way, we are assuming our responsibilities as the 
official opposition, and the Reform Party should, but does not, do 
the same at least to protect Canadian provinces against this 
unprecedented attack by the federal government which quietly 
forges ahead, bit by bit, to build tomorrow's Canada.
<P>
	We are talking about it not only because Quebec is affected, but 
because if the answer to the referendum happens to be no, which 
would be most unfortunate, all Quebecers would wake up the next 
day as part of a new Canada that would have been built behind their 
backs. It is the very notion of a distinct nation that is at stake, the 
survival of the Quebec people, but it is tomorrow's Canada that is 
being built here, piece by piece, by people like the whip who refuse 
to admit what is really going on.

we were voting on Motion No. 47.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We are voting on Motion No. 47. Because the 
hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce was not in the House, we 
put it in the name of the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a further point of order, I will be 
voting in favour of Motion No. 47.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BOVINESOMATOTROPIN">BOVINE SOMATOTROPIN</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, On 
May 16, I asked a question to the Minister of Agriculture about an 
article published in the Montreal daily <I>La Presse</I>, in which it was 
claimed that some dairy producers were illegally using 
recombinant bovine somatotropin. The minister tried to be 
reassuring by saying that his officials were investigating the 
allegations, and that he would inform me of their findings.
<P>
	That was over three weeks ago, and I have yet to hear from the 
Minister of Agriculture or his parliamentary secretary. When the 
minister is asked what he intends to do to solve the issue, he points 
out that it is not the manufacturers of the product who do not 
comply with the moratorium, but the producers who dismiss the 
directive.
<P>
	That answer clearly shows that the minister's primary concern is 
neither the reputation of dairy producers, nor the safety of 
consumers. The overriding consideration is big money.
<P>
	It is very sad to see that no one will protect the producers and the 
consumers in this most important debate.

<P>
	The minister clearly told us that he did not care by repeating for 
the umpteenth time that it is his colleague, the Minister of Health, 
who will make the final decision. It is too easy to just pass the 
buck. The Minister of Agriculture has a responsibility to dairy 
producers, not to rich pharmaceutical companies.
<P>
	Why does the government leave a doubt as to the quality of our 
dairy products, considering that our producers must slow down 
their production and that the quality of our milk is recognized 
worldwide?
<P>
	In my opinion, there is absolutely no reason for a Minister of 
Agriculture to close his eyes to acts that tarnish the excellent 
reputation the Quebec and Canadian dairy industry has built for 
itself over the years. Why does the minister allow companies like 
Monsanto and Ely Lilly to continue in the hope of making a fortune 
and having us drink milk containing a synthetic hormone?
<P>
	What is on one side of the scales is becoming increasingly clear. 
Consumers do not want to drink milk containing recombinant 
bovine somatotropin at the moment, producers see no need to use 
the hormone and studies on the safety of the product are not 
conclusive.
<P>
	Why put off extending the moratorium, then? Our guess is that 
there is no clear, explainable or public reason on the other side of 
the scales. Try explaining to a parent that his or her children are 
drinking milk that is more or less safe for purely economic reasons.
<P>
	Statistics obtained in a study by Optima Research indicate very 
clearly that a high percentage of consumers will stop buying milk if 
it contains recombinant bovine somatotropin. Why in this case is 
the minister not protecting the interests of producers by putting 
pressure on his colleague in the health portfolio to put an end to the 
hopes of the pharmaceutical companies? I know very well that this 
whole matter is one of big bucks. Are there politicians or perhaps 
senior public servants with hidden interests?
<P>
	Past certifications by Health Canada provide no assurance. They 
include breast implants, urea formaldehyde and thalidomide.
<P>
	If it approves the use of recombinant bovine somatotropin for 
dairy herds, will Health Canada agree to compensate dairy 
producers for all consumer claims as the result of health problems 
arising through the consumption of dairy products?
<P>
	In closing, I would ask why this government does not follow the 
example of the European Community and declare a moratorium 
until independent studies can really examine this hormone in 
depth? Should they ever come out in favour of its use, then and 
only then, could we start using recombinant bovine somatotropin.

	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
provide the hon. member for Frontenac and the House with 
information regarding the alleged importation and use of rBST or 
recombinant bovine somatotropin, as well as an update on various 
related issues.
<P>
	It is important to stress that the high standards and integrity of 
both the regulatory system and the Canadian dairy industry 
continue to be maintained.
<P>
	First and foremost, no decision has yet been made regarding the 
approval and licensing of rBST for use in Canada. This decision, I 
repeat again for the member, is the responsibility of Health Canada. 
Its review is being administered under the Food and Drugs Act, 
which sets out the standards for the safety of food and drugs used in 
Canada.
<P>
	A notice of compliance must be received in order to sell rBST in 
Canada. This means that the sale of rBST is prohibited and 
importation of this product is controlled at the border by Revenue 
Canada. Therefore the sale, distribution, or importation of rBST in 
Canada at this time is illegal and subject to criminal prosecution.
<P>
	I would like to also take the opportunity to highlight some of the 
key events that have occurred over the past year.
<P>
	In response to recommendations of the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-food, the government has negotiated a 
one-year delay with the manufacturers, until July 1 of this year. 
Also, the government commissioned a task force report, which 
provides more information on costs and benefits to the Canadian 
dairy industry, animal genetics, U.S. consumer reactions, and 
human and animal health issues.
<P>
	In addition, Health Canada has developed a document outlining 
how veterinary drugs are licensed in Canada. Also, both 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and Health Canada have 
completed a document outlining consistent procedures for the 
handling of biotechnology products. All documentation is publicly 
available.
<P>
	I hope this addresses the concerns on importation, as it provides 
the most up-to-date information that is available on this issue.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38(5), the motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10.00 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.32 p.m.)
<P>
