    </p><a name="Para552335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike other drugs, crystal meth does not need to be imported or grown, but can be synthesized using components that are readily available. Crystal meth is one of the most addictive and damaging of all street drugs and the tragic consequences of the lives that it affects are unacceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552336"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The province of Alberta is a desirable haven for meth labs, as are other provinces with high agricultural sectors, since hydrous ammonia is readily available because of its fertilizer component for agricultural communities. Crystal meth is finding its way into rural communities such as my own because of this situation.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to introduce this bill that would amend the Bank Act to prohibit ATM fees. The bill would prohibit banks from charging their customers fees for transferring their money or account information through automated banking machines. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's banks currently charge customers these fees for accessing their own money through the bank's own ATMs, other banks' ATMs and privately owned machines. These fees, in our view, are excessive and unnecessary, especially given the huge profits of these institutions, and they are fees that could be easily waived by the banks. This bill would give average Canadians a break on their basic banking charges.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552341"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe all Canadians would benefit from this change, particularly those on tight budgets. I urge all members to support this initiative.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regrettably there has been a proliferation of pornography within our society over the past decades. More regrettable has been the proliferation of child pornography. Child pornography is real, it exists, and its presence in our society has been growing. It is truly a threat to our children and we as a society have tasted its bitter fruit. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is a loophole in our Criminal Code that allows child pornography. Paragraph 163.1(6) states:</div>

The petitioners say that the unification of seniors with their families in Canada through immigration is a core aspect of forming strong, healthy and vibrant families and communities in Canada; that newcomer seniors currently suffer unfairly from the 10 years' residency requirement under Canada's income security programs; and that Canada's old age security, guaranteed income supplement and social assistance programs are age, capacity and needs based benefit programs, not individual contribution based income security plans.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the petitioners ask the Government of Canada to amend the Old Age Security Act regulations and policies to eliminate the 10 year residency requirement for old age security and guaranteed income supplement. The petitioners ask that the Government of Canada work with provincial governments to waive the enforcement of sponsorship obligations through government cost recovery schemes as a condition of financial support in situations of genuine immigration sponsorship breakdown involving a senior. Also, they ask that the government establish a nominal public transit charge for all seniors in Canada, similar to the nominal $45 a year charged to seniors in British Columbia. Lastly, they ask that the Government of Canada provide government funding to support more ethno-specific affordable housing for seniors who need or desire it.</div>

It is important to highlight the motion's first “whereas”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552372"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a government in waiting and in a strong position. Given that we were responsible for initiating this mission, we can speak with credibility about it. In no way is anyone on either side of this House calling into question the exceptional work of our courageous men and women. Unfortunately, we have now lost 54 soldiers. Our thoughts and prayers are with them. We must salute the courage of all of our troops.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552373"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be leading off the debate today, and I have the honour of sharing my time with the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78331,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78331&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saint-Laurent—Cartierville</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552374"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to explain the context of this motion. As I said, we initiated this mission—first in Kabul and then in Kandahar—and we are the only party that is in a position to take power after the next election. We would like to believe what the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> told us. He said that Parliament should consider what the future of this mission is to be after February 2009. The problem is that we do not believe this government and that we have an extremely weak <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78765,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78765&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of National Defence</A> who screws up on a daily basis. People who watch the news on television get the impression that he changes his mind as fast as he changes his shirt. In light of those contradictions, I think that our troops, their families and all Canadians have the right to know what is going on. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552375"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our party is giving its unconditional support to this mission until February 2009. We know that our men and women are doing outstanding work. However, we think that greater emphasis should be put on development, that we have a diplomatic role to play and that if we take a piecemeal approach, as the government is doing, the mission is doomed to failure. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552376"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, in the context of mission we took on, we wanted to take what is known as the 3D approach: development, diplomacy and defence. That would have helped us. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is important that Canadians know what to expect, that they understand that this is an international mission and that we are working very closely with the NATO forces. Backed by a Security Council resolution, we decided to participate, in order to help the Afghan people see the light at the end of the tunnel. This is important. However, we do not believe this government. We are extremely concerned about how this government is behaving with respect to the mission in Afghanistan. Hiram Johnson, Governor of California in the early 20th century, had something interesting to say on this. He said:</div>

      <div>“The first casualty when war comes is the truth”. We are bothered with the way the government is acting right now, the way that it is promoting the mission itself and the way it is making all those big announcements to buy equipment. It is buying equipment and spending billions of dollars for equipment that we are supposed to need for the mission. However, when we realize what is going on through the delivery date, the equipment will only be ready after February 2009. If we are supporting a mission and we want to provide that equipment, why do we bother to spend billions of dollars without any white paper, without any plan?</div>
    </p><a name="Para552379"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are saying that because we are going to Afghanistan, we need tanks, helicopters and some other equipment but when we look at the delivery date, it seems the helicopters will be ready in 2010. It seems that those tanks, besides the ones that we are leasing, will be ready by the end of 2008.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552380"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe the mission is important and we believe our men and women should have the equipment they need. As a matter of fact, even General Hillier at that time, when we put forward that mission, was pretty clear. He said, “We have the best equipment and the government in place is providing us with what we need”. That was the Liberal government at that time. Therefore, we will need to find some other reason why we want to spend all that money on equipment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552381"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were announcing, as members will remember, in the restructuring plan to provide more equipment for the troops but we were doing it in a way where the process was a bit more transparent. We did not have a minister of national defence who was a former arms dealer. We did not have a minister of national defence who was a lobbyist promoting that equipment and who was in charge of the requirement to have that equipment for the troops. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the while, there is a mission going on in Afghanistan. Men and women are fighting for democracy, to free and support the Afghan people. However, we do not know exactly where we stand. Every time we turn on the television, listen to the radio or read the newspaper, we are given the impression that we could stay in Afghanistan for another 10 or 15 years.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need in this file is clarity. We need a responsible government to send clear messages to international institutions. The Liberal Party of Canada supports a multilateral approach. Unlike the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, who would have liked to see Canadians in Iraq, we decided to go to Afghanistan because of a Security Council resolution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552386"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We worked with our NATO allies and took a multilateral approach. It was the international communities as a whole that decided that we had to settle the situation in Afghanistan. It corresponded to important Canadian values. In light of that, obviously it was essential to take part in the war. And we went ahead. Remember that our colleague—the former acting leader, member for Toronto, Minister of Defence and exceptional Minster of Foreign Affairs—made announcements at the time.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other colleagues of ours also worked towards this end. It was always extremely respectful. We had the advantage of being clear; we gave a cut-off date. We said that it was not a Canadian mission, but that we would take part in it.</div>

    </p><a name="Para552389"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for using tanks against guerilla warfare, most of the experts say that not only does it lead to stalemates and to escalation of the violence, but it is not necessary. Even the German army exchanged the caterpillar tracks on its tanks for wheels because it knows that, in order to protect the troops and play a development role, you do not arrive in villages with tanks, saying, “Welcome, I’m here, we love you”. We knew that the LAV3s we had at the time, the armoured vehicles, were enough to protect our troops. We have to wonder: What do they want tanks for?</div>
    </p><a name="Para552390"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that my speaking time is limited, but it is important to mention that the goal of this mission is important. Although essential, this mission should also have a cut-off date. We will still be there as far as development and diplomacy are concerned. We can also play an advisory role, as we have always done. It is important to say that we do not want to end up in a situation like Bush in Iraq.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to comment on a couple of things my hon. colleague said. There are so many things that it is hard to know where to start in terms of what was misinformation, what was misguided or what was simply irresponsible and unconscionable. I am sure as the day goes along we will probably elevate the level to things of that nature but for now I would like to point out a couple of inconsistencies.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my hon. colleague talks about equipment for the mission, he is talking about C-17s, C-130Js, Chinook helicopters and so on. They are not just equipment for the mission in Afghanistan. They are equipment that Canada, Canadians and the people who rely on us around the world have been deprived of because of decades of Liberal neglect of the military.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552397"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the equipment for the floods in Manitoba, for the ice storms in Quebec and Ontario and for DART have been moved by U.S. Air Force C-17s or rented Russian airplanes. That is not the way a sovereign nation, which looks after its own people and its responsibilities abroad, handles its military affairs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552398"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does my hon. colleague see a use for C-17s, C-130Js and Chinooks beyond the mission in Afghanistan, or is he so blinded by the political games the Liberals are playing that he is not looking beyond 2009?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are too many different answers to the same critical question: What is the government's plan for Canada's forces in Afghanistan? Canadians deserve a clear answer to this question.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadians expect our mission in Kandahar to end in February 2009, but this government has been deliberately ambiguous on this point. We owe Canadians, as well as our allies, clarity. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as our NATO allies believe Canada's commitment in Kandahar to be open-ended, they will never prepare for our departure.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By February 2009, Canada will have met its obligations to NATO in southern Afghanistan. We will have served the people of that country for seven years. We will have served them in a full combat role for three years, in the most dangerous part of the country. By then, it will have been one of the longest military combat roles we have ever played.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the Government of Canada makes clear now to our allies our plans in Afghanistan, Canada will be put in an untenable situation by the end of our current mandate in February 2009. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government must tell our allies now to begin planning for the assumption of this role in southern Afghanistan. We owe it to our soldiers to begin planning now for passing control and execution of this mission to others.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Success in Afghanistan cannot be achieved by military means alone. The basic goal for Canada in Kandahar should be to win the hearts and minds of the Afghan people.

That date has never been set. Last May, in fact, he asked the House to extend the mission to 2009. If he wants the end date to remain open, then he should tell the Canadian people as much. He should state clearly, as President Bush has done in Iraq, that he intends to stay in Afghanistan until certain conditions are met. He should say so, but he should not have us believe that he wants to end the mission in February 2009, as we are clearly stating. I am calling for clarity. I have always believed in clarity.</div>

However, let me also say, given the amassing evidence that the current search and kill combat mission, the aggressive combat strategy, in Kandahar is utterly failing, that it is bringing more insecurity to the lives of ordinary Afghans.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552456"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very difficult to understand how the Liberal opposition that, when in government, dragged us into that ill-conceived mission could now argue for an extension by two more years of a mission that actually a majority of those members expressed serious reservations about, going back almost a year now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Liberal leader this. How does he reconcile the increasing evidence that this is a failed mission, that the insecurity is growing, that the number of deaths among our troops and civilians is growing, with a proposal put before us now to extend the mission by two additional years?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the House know that it is not just Canadians who are watching this debate. It is not just Canadians who hear the date that has been put forward. That shows an incredible weakness, vulnerability and opportunity for the Taliban to declare victory. This is unacceptable to me.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I highlight the fact that the Government of Canada's commitment to the reconstruction and security of Afghanistan is not limited to southern Afghanistan. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afghanistan is the single largest recipient of Canadian development assistance. Canada's contribution to the reconstruction and development of that country is improving the daily lives of many thousands of people. The efforts of our soldiers, diplomats and development specialists are bringing about positive change in a very challenging environment, and we are making real progress.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share with the House some of the achievements to which our assistance has contributed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada is among the top five donors of the Afghan reconstruction trust fund, a multilateral mechanism that contributes to regular salary payments to more than 270,000 civil servants, including 144,000 teachers. The Afghan government was especially proud that over 6 million children had returned to school by last month, compared to 5.4 million last year. Nearly 35% of that number is girls. This is a major accomplishment. By contrast, only 700,000 children were in school in 2001 and not one of those was a girl.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78774,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78774&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of International Cooperation</A> and myself were in Afghanistan last week. We met with the education minister, a very eloquent man. I am sure some members of the House met with him when he was here less than a year ago. He could not say enough good things about the difference Canada had made in getting children back to school, in paying teachers' wages, in providing education for these teachers, who can in turn impart it to the children so those children can have hope of a better life.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another solid building block that has exceeded our expectations is the micro-finance investment support facility for Afghanistan. I will refer to it as MISFA. As of February 28, over 325,000 Afghans, almost three-quarters of whom are women, have obtained small loans and savings services. Each month the program reaches an average of 10,000 new clients. Last week the minister and I met with a group of these women. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050">(1050)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para552473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the hope that we impart to these women. Not all people will be entrepreneurs, but we met with a group of them who are. I spoke with one middle aged lady who had no hope at all under the Taliban. This lady is manufacturing suits and clothing. Her husband is now working for her as are 14 other members of her family. She is earning a living for her entire family through a microcredit loan that was provided to her with the support of the Canadian government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other women are making pottery, dishes, processing food, all kinds of small home-based industries that would never have started under the Taliban, that would have been unable to be financed unless countries like Canada and other donor countries had not stepped up and become involved in that process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through CIDA, the Government of Canada is also proud to be a trusted partner in the national solidarity program, which has been successful in Kandahar and elsewhere in the country. We have 16,000 community development councils, elected by the local village people, that make decisions as to what projects should be funded. Local councils decide where the money from CIDA and other donor countries will be spent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister Zia, with whom we met, told us that not one of those projects, which had been decided by a local council, had been targeted by insurgents. This is the success that we need to provide the environment for these projects to flourish under. Minister Zia met us at one of these community development council meetings, which was about 40 kilometres outside of what we refer to as the wire.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78774,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78774&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of International Cooperation</A> and I travelled outside the wire where Canadians and civilians would not have dared travel a year or two years ago. We sat down with the local council and discussed what its projects were. This has to continue. This is the opportunity that we have provided.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it takes as military presence to provide the security for this kind of project to flourish under. Those projects bring water to new crops. This is the way we will solve the opium problem. There is irrigation water available, but until we fund the process to get it to these fields so they can grow alternative crops, we will be unsuccessful in getting rid of the opium crop.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is supporting projects that are changing the lives of the people of Afghanistan. From helping UNICEF establish a maternal health clinic in Kandahar to funding projects that provide alternatives to poppy production across the country, Canada is making a difference in changing lives. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is remarkable that the Liberal Party can stand up and talk about balancing aid to military involvement. Canada's military has been involved in some of the greatest conflicts of this century. As a nation, we believe the lives of people outside of our borders have value and fighting for democratic freedoms is worth it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Liberals, the numbers of people helped through Canadian aid in Afghanistan are just that, numbers. They are unable to see that each of those numbers, each of those millions of little girls going to school, has a name, a face and a hope that there is better life than the one they have known. Canada is not helping numbers. We are helping real people who deserve no less than we do: shelter, food, water and the ability to provide for their families. Why do the Liberals believe the people of Afghanistan deserve to be abandoned?</div>

Bill Graham (Toronto Centre, Lib.)</A>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I have a comment and a question. The hon. member started his comments by suggesting to members of this House and to the Canadian public that by having this debate we are somehow being disloyal to our troops and giving comfort to the Taliban.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest to him that if that logic takes place, we will never be able to ask in committee a question of the Chief of the Defence Staff as to whether or not the operational tempo of our troops is being stretched. We will never be able to ask a question of any of our operational leaders as to what the nature of the success of the mission is. It will always be hidden under the pretext that we are giving comfort to the enemy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest to hon. members that as members of this democratic institution we will have lost this war today if we give to the Taliban the control as to what we can debate in this House of Commons. We should never allow ourselves to go there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion recognizes the fact that our troops are often stretched in these missions. We have committed, as our leader said, for the longest period of time. It is a reasonable proposition for us to debate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is what I would like to ask the hon. member to say from his departmental point of view. If we had the commander of the forces in the south in this House or before the committee, would he say that CIDA is delivering the type of aid and the amount of aid necessary for them to conduct an anti-insurgency operation?</div>
    </p><a name="Para552487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our understanding is that we are not delivering the level of aid necessary to do that, and while we can say that there are some successes, those successes are not sufficient to allow us to win what is not a military war but an insurgency matter, which requires an approach of aid, of diplomacy, of governance and of winning the war against opium trafficking and corruption and all the other issues in the Afghan government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not have that coordinated approach, we will never succeed at this, because it is not a military operation. Our leader made that clear in his speech and that is the thrust--</div>

I got a little caught up in my answer and I did not answer the question. Yes, the commander communicated to us directly that we are making a difference and that we are improving the lives of those Afghans that we are there to help. Can we do more? We can always do more, and we can do more on our own soil, but yes, we are helping. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are here today debating this motion because the Liberal Party of Canada now sees fit to abandon the mission to which it originally committed our nation. It seems that even in opposition the Liberals are determined to continue their new leader's record of not getting the job done. Is that the legacy we want to have for our Afghanistan mission? That we did not get the job done?</div>
    </p><a name="Para552502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, the deputy leader of the opposition, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78667,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78667&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Etobicoke—Lakeshore</A>, has some different views. Let us look at what he has said about this mission just in the last several months. He said:</div>

          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para552504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Liberal Party now committed to abandoning the children and patients even if we have not stabilized the security situation by 2009? The deputy leader said:</div>
    </p><a name="Para552505"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</div>
    </p><a name="Para552506"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Liberal Party now committed to gambling that Afghanistan will not become a safe haven for terrorists again? The deputy leader said:</div>
    </p><a name="Para552507"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

    </p><a name="Para552508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Liberal Party now committed to risking human rights and the great tradition of our country?</div>
    </p><a name="Para552509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went further. He wrapped the mission in his own party's flag just last summer when he said:</div>

      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para552511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the deputy leader of the Liberal Party told us, “We should stay there until we get the job done...”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2009, are Canadians going to be saying that we did not get it done? We are talking about the future of a country. We are talking about the future of some 30 million people, people just like us, except that we have the good fortune of living in Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time of year, while many Canadians are engrossed in NHL playoffs and tax returns, Afghans are overwhelmed by much more fundamental preoccupations. Will their daughters be safe as they go off to school today? Will their crops wither from the drought this year? Or can they really rest assured that the Taliban who scattered from their village months ago have no plans to return?</div>
    </p><a name="Para552514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human lives hang in the balance. The motion hastily put forward today, which asks this House to call upon the government to terminate the Canadian Forces operation in Afghanistan by February 2009, demands that we make a hugely important decision without sufficient information and analysis. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly February 2009 is the current date to which we are held. It is the date that the members of this House supported. For that reason, it must be taken seriously.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, any proposal for an extension or a termination of our military mission in Afghanistan beyond February 2009 must be analyzed with the highest level of scrutiny, with the utmost appreciation for the work that Canadians and our allies have invested thus far, and with heartfelt concern for the plight of the Afghan people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552517"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of respect for the vote taken by parliamentarians in May 2006, I insist that we not rush to judgment here today. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1110"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110">(1110)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para552518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We brought forward a motion to the House to extend the current Afghan mission to February 2009. The government has been clear that if it were to seek a further extension it would come to Parliament to do that, and that remains our position.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para552519"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that this mission has come at a cost. Tragically, it has cost Canadian lives. The costs to Canada form a crucial part of the equation when we look at the viability of this mission for Canada in the years to come. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552520"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the costs are only one part of the equation. The men and women who are currently facing danger in Afghanistan are well aware of this.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para552521"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They understand that when we evaluate this mission we also need to weigh the reasons for it and the potential to make a difference.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552522"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reasons are straightforward. The government of Afghanistan has asked for our help. Our allies and partners are depending on our contributions. The mission has been authorized by the United Nations and is being led by NATO. And quite simply, the future stability of Afghanistan has a bearing on the security of the world and the security of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552523"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mission is not just about help for the Afghans. It is about international peace and security.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552524"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, as the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78765,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78765&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of National Defence</A> highlighted in Montreal a few weeks ago: six million Afghan children, one-third of them girls, now go to school compared to 700,000 in 2001, all of whom were boys; 6,000 kilometres of roads have been built and repaired; 2,500 villages have electricity for the first time; and 80% of Afghans now have access to basic health care, compared to only 8% in 2001.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552525"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if we took the Canadian Forces out of the equation? </div>
    </p><a name="Para552526"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that security is needed for development and reconstruction initiatives to move forward. Development and reconstruction need to continue if the people of Afghanistan are going to have faith in the ability of their democratically elected government to provide for them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552527"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mission is an integrated pan-Canadian effort. Not only that, but Canada's efforts fit into a larger multinational mission. We are in Afghanistan with 36 other countries. We are clearly not the only ones bearing the burden of this mission. In fact, Poland, Australia and the United States, among others, have just stepped up their contributions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552528"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks in part to the efforts of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78765,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78765&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of National Defence</A>, significant progress has been made in strengthening our collective efforts in southern Afghanistan. In fact, just last week the minister held a meeting with the defence ministers of the other countries working with us in southern Afghanistan. We are part of a multinational team, a team that is depending on us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552529"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion that stands before us today, which aims to carve in stone a deadline of February 2009, would have an impact far greater than many realize. It would let down our allies and partners in this mission. Quite simply, we would be shirking our responsibility to provide international and, ultimately, Canadian security.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552530"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only do we have international partners depending on us, but even more importantly, we have Afghan lives on the line.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552531"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting a deadline for the Canadian Forces' withdrawal right now would send a clear and dangerous signal to the Taliban. For the sake of the Afghans, our mission cannot be measured simply by the number of years or months we have invested. That is not an indicator of success, but simply a mark on a calendar.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552532"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should not impose artificial deadlines that ignore the facts about progress being made toward agreed development and security objectives. This mission is to be measured by the impact we are making and will continue to make for the people of Afghanistan and for the people of Canada.</div>

It appears that he has not paid sufficient attention to the terms of this mission.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552535"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loose talk has been engaged on the opposite side of the House to the effect that this side of the House wants to abandon Afghanistan, whereas clause 5 of this resolution makes it very clear that we imply, as any sensible person would imply, that Canada's commitment to reconstruction, to diplomatic engagement and even, let me add, to military contributions to security in Afghanistan might well continue after February 2009 under a Liberal government. The issue here is whether it involves indirect combat operations in southern Afghanistan. That is point number one.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552536"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second point that needs to be emphasized is that the parliamentary secretary talks as if the deadline was imposed by this side of the House. I would remind the member that February 2009 was the date proposed by the government. We on this side of the House are simply saying that the deadline is a fixed deadline.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552537"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make another point. When this deadline was brought before the House in May 2006, this side of the House was given six hours to debate a matter fundamental to Canada's national security.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552538"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government brings back another motion to extend the mission, I would ask the parliamentary secretary to allow the Canadian people and this House to have the debate that the motion warrants, as opposed to the situation we had last time when the debate was basically not enough time to give Canada enough time to consider the matter in all its gravity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552539"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that there were meetings with Canada's allies in Quebec last week, what discussions were held in Quebec about the future of the mission, the extension of the mission? Canadian citizens have a right to know what engagements the Government of Canada is making with respect to the future of the mission.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552540"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the parliamentary secretary could clarify what discussions are underway with our allies in respect to the extension of the mission.</div>

    </p><a name="Para552554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to start as well by getting one thing out of the way for the Bloc Québécois. I must admit that we are totally fed up with being told every time we ask a question about the mandate of the mission that we do not support the mission or do not support the troops in the field. This is a totally Bush approach, so named because President Bush always says that whoever is not with him is against him.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to remind my Conservative colleagues that this is a parliament. A parliament does not express a single point of view. The government is entitled to its point of view, but the opposition is too. The Liberals are entitled to their point of view, just as the Bloc Québécois and the NDP are. We are elected by people who send us here to represent them. It is only natural that we will not always have the same approach or look at issues from the same angle. The opposition and the Bloc Québécois are tired of hearing certain things. Every time we question the government, every time we introduce a motion or a bill that is not in line with government policy, they tell us that we do not support the troops. That is simply not true. We should show respect for all points of view in the House, try as much as possible to reach a consensus, and then decide the issue on a vote. That is what democracy is all about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we are a little fed up with constantly being told that we do not support the troops. We support them, and even with the motion before us today, we will continue to support them. I would like to remind the government, though, that in politics it is the civilian authorities who decide what a country’s armed forces will do. When that is not how it works, it is simply because it is not a democracy any more. The day we have 308 Conservative members here, we will be living in a dictatorship. It is not very hard to figure out and I hope things never come to that. That is why parliaments are responsible for dealing with these issues and why they are made up the way they are with a government and an opposition. We should respect the points of view expressed by all the parties in this Parliament. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to quickly review a little history. First, people are wondering how it is that we have Canadian soldiers on Afghan soil. We have to recall the entire situation. This is important, because we need to keep repeating how this came about. It is not complicated; it came about in response to the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon. The American government reacted very strongly and the UN also reacted. The next day, or the day after, the UN declared that the American government had the right to defend itself. Also the next day, NATO, which is a military and political alliance, invoked , for the first time, Article Five of its constitution declaring an attack on one member to be an attack on them all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From that point onward, the Liberal government of the day and the Bloc Québécois said that it was entirely legitimate, and most importantly legal, internationally, to send soldiers there. That is how it started, under American command, with Operation Enduring Freedom. People went to Afghanistan to oust the Taliban from power, to ensure that this could never happen again. There were in fact a lot of terrorist training camps, and that question had to be settled once and for all. Canada, like many other countries, said that we had to support the Americans there. We have no problem with this, unlike with what is happening in Iraq. We had a UN mandate and a NATO mandate, and so it was entirely legitimate for us to go there. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operation Enduring Freedom began and the Americans decided that they had to stabilize the capital first, and so they stabilized Kabul. We helped them do that. We had troops there. As well, NATO was getting more and more involved. There were discussions among all of the allies, and everyone seemed to be saying that NATO should be the organization in charge of the entire operation. That is what started to happen. As soon as Kabul was stabilized, NATO began to take control, and after that it was decided to move backward around the compass, in terms of the cardinal points. To explain, the NATO forces started by stabilizing the north, and then NATO took control.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1125"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125">(1125)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para552560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The west was stabilized, and then NATO took control. The south was stabilized, and then NATO took control. On July 1 of last year, NATO took total control of Afghanistan. Certainly the Americans are still there, but a sort of division of labour has occurred. However, everyone agrees that it is NATO that now holds the mandate. We are currently participating in a NATO operation. That is why Canadian troops are on Afghan soil.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for what has been going on in Kandahar since we have been there, there is a problem. A military operation has its limits, and the Conservative government has failed to understand this. It has placed too much emphasis on the military operation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552562"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People say that the logic is simplistic when we talk about the 3D approach—the government's official policy: defence, diplomacy and development—and when we say we have 2,500 soldiers in the ground in Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552563"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For development, we have six people looking after CIDA's development projects. I do not want to hear anyone say this is false, because we were there and we were told this when I asked the question of how many people on the ground were assigned to CIDA and development programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552564"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For diplomacy and Foreign Affairs, we have six people as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that this mission is very unbalanced. Everything that is happening proves this to be true.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the escalating military involvement. The minister said we would not be sending tanks over there. But then what happened? And it is not just tanks. More purchases are being justified every day. We have now bought $21 billion worth of military equipment. These purchases are often justified by saying that it is for Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552567"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the C-17 strategic lift aircraft. My colleagues have already talked about this. Before now, it cost about $50 million or $100 million to lease them. Now, they are costing us $3.4 billion, and on top of that, the economic spinoffs were poorly orchestrated. Once again, Quebec has been victimized in terms of these contracts. Clearly, the military is ramping up.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552568"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we sent tanks. Then, oddly enough, after a meeting in Quebec City with the military personnel responsible for southern Afghanistan, including the Dutch, the minister stated that we would lease equipment from our German friends and buy it from our Dutch friends. The deal was probably made at that meeting. These discussions must have taken place in Quebec City. All of a sudden, the tanks are arriving, with a $650 million price tag. All that taxpayers in Canada and Quebec have to do is pay the bill. There is no doubt that the military is ramping up. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552569"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pakistan issue is also a problem. When they say the situation has deteriorated, that means they are having problems catching the Taliban. As soon as things heat up, they take refuge in the Pakistan oasis. I call it that because when their fighters are tired out, the border is so porous that they can get into Pakistan easily. Neither the NATO troops nor the Canadian troops can follow them into Pakistani territory because that country is an ally in this war. Nevertheless, intentionally or otherwise, NATO troops have a very hard time controlling the border. Pakistan is therefore a huge problem. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552570"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we have seen no progress regarding poppy cultivation. This is a fundamental problem in Afghanistan. We have been hearing for months that this issue needs to be resolved. The government, however, prefers to bombard us with the importance of military force to drive out the Taliban. Meanwhile, the Taliban encourages poppy cultivation. They use it to fuel and finance their activities. Once again, a misunderstanding by Canada and its allies on this matter suggests eradication or aerial spraying of chemicals to destroy the crops.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552571"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then what? What do we say to the peasant who earns his meagre income from that? For it is not the peasant—the one who grows it—who profits most from it. It is the middleman who comes afterwards. So what do we say to that peasant? That we are sorry, but this afternoon, our dozens of tractors in his field are going to put an end to his poppies?</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1130"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130">(1130)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para552572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have begun saying that, if we wanted to drive them into the arms of the Taliban, there was no better way to do it. The Taliban tell the people they are willing to protect them and pay them for their crops. This problem must be resolved, especially since it also causes corruption and finances the Taliban regime. The best way to solve it is definitely not eradication. We should instead be trying to find ways to use this crop to legitimately supply the pharmaceutical industry, for instance. The Senlis Council released an excellent study on this topic. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552573"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, having attended NATO meetings, I know that there is a great deal of discussion between NATO and the European Union to determine whether, if a peasant's poppy field is replanted with potatoes or tomatoes, part of the crop can be sold on the European market. These are discussions between NATO and the European Union. That makes sense because if you replace poppies with tomatoes you may not be able to sell them because of the small domestic market, lack of money or the fact that it just is not profitable. If you sell five tomatoes at the market whereas you wish to sell five cases, it is impossible to get ahead financially. However, if the European Union and NATO become involved and share a part of their domestic markets, it can work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552574"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the matter of the caveats, or the rules of engagement. There have been significant problems in this regard among our allies. Canada has no caveats. Canadian troops patrol 24 hours a day and carry out all kinds of operations. To my great surprise, when I went to Faizabad in northern Afghanistan at the invitation of NATO, the German troops said to me, “Mr. Bachand, it is 8 o'clock, we must return to camp”. I asked why we had to return to camp at 8. They replied that their parliament had given the order to return to camp at 8 o'clock.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552575"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, you will indicate how much time I have left as I do not wish to see you become impatient.</div>

At 8 o’clock, this poor member was told that we have to return to the camp. That was the caveat established by their parliament. At 8 o’clock, they have to return to base. I told myself that this did not make sense. How is it that Canadian soldiers do not have this caveat and all of our allies do? At present we are working very hard on this matter. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552579"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must agree that we have a great many problems with the Karzaï government. Mr. Karzaï is known as the mayor of Kabul, which means that the people do not see him having any authority outside Kabul. Therefore, it is very difficult to establish his authority. As one moves away from the capital, his authority continuously diminishes. It is the war lords and clan chiefs who decide what will happen. Some governors —probably many—it is a known fact, have been corrupted by the illegal trafficking. Even some members of the Afghan Parliament are known as influential members of the illegal drug trade. That causes a great many problems. Many civilians have been killed. In a military operation, seeing that the bombing takes place without distinction between civilians and the Taliban, that has certain consequences. The population rises up against that. They have the impression that they are facing an army of occupation and not a liberating army. They see an army that does not make enough distinction between civilians and the Taliban. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552580"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The matter of prisoners is a very important point. We called for the resignation of the minister on this point because he misled the House. And that is continuing. When our soldiers take prisoners they turn them over to the Afghan authorities. We have received reports from the American state department that clearly show that torture is a regular practice there. People have their toenails or fingernails pulled out, or their fingers cut off. Women there are sex slaves. They are thrown in with the prisoners and so are children. It is there in the report by the state department. Those are not the words of the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78805,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78805&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saint-Jean</A>; it is the United States state department. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552581"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Canadian soldiers who are involved in that are in grave danger. The minister is an accomplice to it. The Government of Canada could brought before international tribunals; perhaps even before the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of War Crimes, to which we are a signatory. We could face charges. The Speaker of the House might also face charges. Indeed, responsibility for this situation could be extended to the entire Parliament. So, there are dangers. When the Bloc Québécois raises these kinds of issues, we are accused of not supporting our troops. As I said at the start of my remarks, what constantly irritates us is that every time we suggest the least amendment, we are accused of not supporting our troops. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been to Afghanistan twice and I have met with General Richards, the NATO commander. He said himself that if we do not change course and if we maintain the military approach, in six or seven months we will lose 70% of the population. People would rather side with the Taliban than with an army like that, especially in light of the abuses I have just described.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc has long been calling for a change in this mission. The numbers speak for themselves: $1.8 billion has been invested in the military and $300 million has been invested in development. Let us talk about development. Earlier, I talked about people and their responsibilities. They get Afghan companies to sign contracts, but there is no accountability. An individual is given $100,000 to dig a well in a village. A year later, no one has checked to see if the well has been dug. What did they do with the money?</div>
    </p><a name="Para552584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are huge problems and it is time to come up with solutions. Instead of focussing on these problems, this government wants to buy more tanks and send more troops. That is a reflection of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>'s foreign policy. He sticks close to George W. Bush all the time and tells him we are behind him. The message to our European allies is that we support the Americans, and that message is not well received.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has happened many times. There was the war in Lebanon, and this <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> has put forward many other policies that fly in the face of multilateralism, which Canada was long known for. Where did Canada's strength lie? First, in peacekeeping, and second, in its ability to find solutions. Canada had friends throughout Europe. Now, we attach ourselves to the Americans and take George Bush at his word when he says that we are either with him or against him. Canada has decided to be with the American president and, naturally, against those who are not. Of course, that is not how things really are, but I see the reluctance of the 27 NATO countries. Many say that they do not recognize Canada. We believe that Canada's multilateral approach is essentially good. But in the absence of that approach, problems arise. We become isolated and a virtual slave to the American government. Military contracts are a prime example. We are sending billions of dollars south of the border and demanding nothing. Yet we are the buyer, we are signing the cheque.</div>

Why does he not call for an international conference? Is he afraid of antagonizing his American friends? He should call for an international conference with Iran and all the neighbouring countries, such as India and Pakistan. Diplomatic solutions—the third D—must also be found. We cannot just close our eyes and say that Pakistan is our ally and we should leave it alone, when it continually gives refuge to the Taliban.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will therefore support the motion. We agreed to extend the mission to 2009, and the motion clearly states that military operations will continue until 2009. For a very long time, we have tried to tell this government that it should change the mandate of the mission, but it has not listened. Now we have the answer. We will carry on until February 2009, at which time military operations must end. The Bloc Québécois believes that this is a sound position. We will support this motion.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His question is valid, but we have another two years before us. The military operation will not end tomorrow morning. We will see what happens in 2009. For now, we support this motion because we have often tried to persuade the government that it is going in the wrong direction, that there has been an escalation of military activity and that everyone agrees that is not what we should be doing. Despite that, the signal that the government has been sending is that they are plowing ahead. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore decided that it is time to act. We are telling the public that it will end in February 2009 and we will withdraw from combat operations. That is what the motion says. It does not say that we will stop development and reconstruction. It does not say that we can not go elsewhere in Afghanistan. The motion before us leaves open many options, but in our view, it means an end to a strictly military approach. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not believe that this will have an effect on the Taliban because other avenues are proposed, such as international conferences or the presence of a senior UN representative.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The members of the Standing Committee on National Defence went to southern Afghanistan, to Kandahar. For several days, I asked to see clinics and hospitals and schools. We were always told that for security reasons we could not leave the base. We had to rely on the journalists and our own heated protests to get out. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we did get out, we were taken to the Afghan army training centre, which was very interesting, and the Afghan police training centre. But that is not what we wanted to see. We would have liked to see whether development was happening. Personally, I have doubts. We are always being told that it is wonderful, that everyone has gone back to school, but a lot of other groups are giving us information and telling us that this is not what is happening, that there are no schools. The girls who were in school a few years ago are now at home, because there may be Taliban who take a dim view of them going to school. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552609"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We therefore think that it is time to focus on development and reconstruction. As was said, we will finish the job, to meet our international commitments, in February 2009. Clearly, we will cease military combat in February 2009, and I hope that we will work on reconstruction and development.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP opposes this motion. Why? Because it prolongs a George Bush style combat mission in Afghanistan.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, a year ago the NDP opposed the proposed extension of the mission. Had the Liberals listened to the NDP at the time, we would be following a path of reconstruction, aid and redevelopment now, not the current path of counter-insurgency and combat. The Liberals now claim to agree with the NDP that the current mission is wrong, and if they do agree, then why wait two years to begin the withdrawal of our soldiers? </div>
    </p><a name="Para552627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The record is clear. The Liberals took us into this mission when it was called Operation Enduring Freedom and was directed directly from the White House. They never consulted with Canadians; they never consulted with Parliament. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things wrong with this mission will continue to be wrong for the next two years and it will only get worse: a seek and kill counter-insurgency; imbalance between military and humanitarian aid spending; deteriorating humanitarian conditions.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showing leadership in Afghanistan means working for peace negotiations. Chris Alexander, Canada's former ambassador to Afghanistan and now a leading UN official in Afghanistan, said that the absence of a peace deal in Afghanistan is fuelling the conflict. Gordon Smith, former senior Canadian diplomat and head of the Centre for Global Studies at the University of Victoria, called on the international community to undertake serious efforts at inclusive and comprehensive peace negotiations. This is what Canada must be doing, but as long as we are engaged in the offence in the south, this will not be possible.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an effort to try to find common ground, let me propose the following amendment to determine whether or not the House would be willing to take the appropriate actions. The amendment would read as follows: “That the motion be amended by deleting the words after 'operations in southern Afghanistan' in the preamble and replacing them with the following: 'This House call on the government to begin now to withdraw Canadian Forces in a safe and secure manner from the counter-insurgency mission in Afghanistan and call upon the government to notify NATO of this decision immediately'”.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequences of the current approach that the Canadian government is taking, along with the Americans, is to increase support for the Taliban. Where we see reduced support for the Taliban is where the Taliban is being made increasingly irrelevant because of an approach that focuses on a completely different strategy: building support, building the country and building democratic institutions.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I prepared this morning for this debate today I re-read the comments that I made last May 17 when the House was considering the extension of this flawed mission in Kandahar. The New Democratic Party voted against the extension of that mission. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said then that any time we put the lives of Canadians in harm's way, we have a duty to determine clearly a number of points and those were: is this mission really necessary; is it a mission that can succeed, has it a good chance of success; and are we doing everything possible to ensure the safety and the well-being of our soldiers?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Canadians have a right to expect that before our soldiers are sent on a dangerous mission that due diligence has taken place, that we understand the situation clearly in which we are placing them. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in Afghanistan is incredibly complex. The threats go far beyond the Taliban. The forces of the warlords who are still in control of militias in Afghanistan, the criminal elements there, the porous border with Pakistan, the fact that insurgents can go back and forth across the border with impunity, the criminal elements involved in the poppy production in Afghanistan, all contribute to the negative security environment.</div>

Now the minister says there is no such capacity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552665"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government needs to clearly show Canadians that the Canadian Forces can respond to any needs that may happen domestically here in Canada while this mission is draining our capacity. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2010 Olympics will be in Vancouver soon. There are security needs there. The minister has been briefed on those as well for the Canadian Forces.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen a very real escalation of this counterinsurgency mission in Afghanistan in the past year. The government has purchased 100 new tanks. Contingency plans are in place for sending CF-18s. We have seen plans by National Defence for rotations until 2011. Over and over again I have pleaded with the government to address the inadequacy of the detainee transfer agreement with Afghanistan.</div>

Now, what are we faced with? Four separate investigations about detainee transfers and still the government refuses to amend this agreement. It still maintains there is nothing wrong with it, even though the minister had to stand in the House and apologize to Canadians for misleading them about the role of the International Red Cross in that agreement. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552669"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main problems is that no criteria for success has ever been laid out by the previous Liberal government or by the Conservative government for what would be deemed to be success in Afghanistan. The reality is that young Canadian soldiers are being killed and wounded with greater and greater frequency in a combat mission that is both failing and futile.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552670"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many more casualties must we suffer before the government comes to its senses? The number of insurgents killed or the number of foreign soldiers deployed are not signs of progress. Progress can only be measured by tangible results for the people of Afghanistan: the delivery of clean water, electricity, peace and security, and improvements in the quality of life of Afghans, not more uncertainty, not more tanks rolling down the hills of Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552671"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the leader of the NDP has proposed an amendment that would begin the withdrawal of Canadians from this counterinsurgency mission as soon as possible. We need to look at a new approach and we need to look at that new approach immediately. We need practical solutions, so that Canada can take a leadership role in working for peace in Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552672"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to work in collaboration with other countries in the world to bring development, to bring justice to Afghanistan. We must use our background and skills. We have an incredibly well trained and educated military in Canada. We must use those skills and our background as Canadians to bring diplomacy and peace negotiations that would ensure lasting security and peace for the people of Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only smart way to proceed. Every time we go out and the ISAF mission goes out and kills another young Afghan, we create more sympathy for the Taliban and more insurgents coming forward. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said earlier that I have considered this motion as a member of Parliament, as a Canadian citizen, as a mother and as a grandmother. I want to remind everyone in the House that we are talking about the lives of real people. We are talking about Canadian lives and we are talking about Afghan lives. This counterinsurgency mission is not a mission that I can support or that my party can support. We will be voting in opposition to this motion.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a report by Human Rights Watch, there have been 48 attacks by insurgents in Afghanistan. In her speech, the member talked to us about her fondness for our military, and she also spoke to us as a mother and a grandmother.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a list here of what the Taliban require of women and impose on them: they cannot work outside the home or study at university; they are stoned for extramarital relations. The list includes 30 criteria.</div>

    </p><a name="Para552688"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember one soldier who was part of the group that did the supply lines. He talked to me and said that he was anxious to get home. When I first met him, I did not think he would talk to me because he had an appearance about him of being kind of tough and standoffish. However, as he began to talk he had a real impact on me when he said that he just wanted to go home. He said that he had seen and done things in Afghanistan that he never thought possible and that he just wanted to go home.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In saying that, I am not insinuating that the men and women who are serving in Afghanistan do not take their work and their duty seriously. I want to make the distinction that it is the government that chooses where it sends the Canadian Forces and that the Canadian Forces go where they are sent willingly. However, the impact that man had on me and the depth of his feelings I carry with me today.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the kinds of success that we would all like to see, and I acknowledge that the government also wants to see success, it is in exactly the way that the member is talking about. Our belief is that we can come to that success in a different way. Away from this counter-insurgency mission and away from the search and destroy kind of focus of this mission is the way to go in building a lasting peace in Afghanistan.</div>

It should not be for the complete withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, which is what the NDP has proposed and what the Leader of the Opposition proposed in November last year, although with the caveat that he would consult with other members of NATO. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The withdrawal of our troops in Afghanistan is not what should happen. If that were to happen, if the Dutch, the British, the Americans, the Germans, all members in the multinational force, were to completely withdraw their troops from Afghanistan, as proposed by the New Democratic Party, the Karzai government would collapse tomorrow, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan would collapse tomorrow and in its place we would have a government that would not be favourable to Canada's interests, a government much like the Taliban that was in there prior to 2001, a government that would act as a safe harbour for radical elements that would later come back to attack targets throughout the world and attack innocent civilians.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has not been a quiet year since the government voted to extend our commitment in Afghanistan. It was a vote that, as we all know, the government did not see as important enough to debate to its full extent because at that time no one had any illusions on what the vote was really about. It was meant as a cheap, partisan ploy, a way to suggest to Canadians that the Liberal Party was somehow soft on the Taliban, on terrorism and on a whole range of challenges to freedom and democracy in the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not long after that vote that I was at a ceremony back in Surrey and had the chance to discuss the vote with some of my constituents. I mention this ceremony because it has a very special significance in light of the vote that day. This was a ceremony for remembrance markers on the graves of our veterans, veterans who, for one reason or another, went unrecognized in death, unrecognized for the great battles they fought for our great country. There are literally thousands of such soldiers, Canadian heroes who still lay unrecognized in cemeteries across this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am proud to say that two of my constituents, Mr. Andy Block and RCMP Constable Marc Searle, brought this situation to the public's attention. I believe it brought home to us all the incredible sacrifices of the generations before us. It also brought home the incredible sacrifices of our soldiers in Afghanistan today. It made it quite clear to all of us that the defence of democracy, of the freedoms we enjoy and affirm every day in this country, is a very serious thing, indeed it is a matter of life and death. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trust that our citizens put in us as legislators to decide upon commitments such as Afghanistan is a trust based upon the belief that we will not take shortcuts for partisan purposes.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When speaking to my constituents that day and when speaking to them since that vote, I have had a chance to explain why I voted no to this mission. The government would have us believe that Liberals do not care for freedom the way it does. It would have us believe that Liberals such as myself think that our soldiers fighting in Afghanistan is a bad thing and that we are naive enough to think democratic institutions can come before our soldiers fighting for safer schools, for running water and for safe streets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course we know that, above all, we must fight the very people who do not want us to put in schools, running water and the reliable infrastructure of functioning communities. This is obvious, but here is the point. It is easy to decide to go to a country like this but it is not easy to know how and when to get out, which is why we must start with the idea of three parts of a plan for engagement. Defence, development and diplomacy have their own benchmarks. Each is a component that requires its own strategy and its own timeline. None can be viewed in isolation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552703"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have spent a long time inside and outside this House talking about the defence component. We have talked dollars and sometimes we have talked cents but we have not devoted a fraction of the time to talk about what we are doing with the development and diplomacy in Afghanistan. The point is that we need to talk about what our measurable targets are for a functioning democracy.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are committed and I am glad we are committed to the Afghani people and the reconstruction of their society. We need to hold an emerging democracy to the same standard as we hold our own. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552705"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with so many of the battles we enter into that soon become wars, we need to determine those standards of development and democracy. We need to determine how they can be met with the least bloodshed. Once those standards are reached, we can get out of the way and let a government, a democracy flourish on its own. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552706"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Afghanistan mission has changed in both its structure and its purpose. It has lost that crucial balance between diplomacy, development and defence. What is worse, the government has refused to commit to an exit strategy or even indicate an end date.</div>

    </p><a name="Para552708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already one of the longest military commitments in Canadian history. It has lasted longer than the Boer War, World War I, World War II, the Suez crisis and the Korean War. In each of those wars and incidents we found resolutions through treaty or unconditional surrender.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552709"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afghanistan is different. What we are witnessing is an insurgency that is partially being driven by Taliban terrorists but also by those who view NATO troops as foreign occupiers. The more tanks we send, the greater the perception that this is indeed the case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to review the current mission. We need to put more of a focus on training the Afghan National Army and additional provincial reconstruction teams.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also hold parliamentary hearings in which the Conservative government fully participates so that Canadians, through their parliamentarians, can receive vital information about the mission and assess its goals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only through training the Afghan army, equipping the Afghan bureaucracy with the knowledge and tools to create accountable governments and by investing in basic infrastructure that we will achieve the kind of results that will move Afghanistan forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of those approaches have been given little air time by the government. Perhaps it does not see partisan gains in the real debate. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We brought forward this motion to make clear the government's position on whether it is extending the mission beyond 2009.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a privilege for me to have this opportunity to speak today. I know all members in the House, the people of the Churchill riding, and indeed all Canadians, join me in honouring our brave young men and women in uniform.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552729"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to express how pleased I am to have the opportunity to speak on Canada's mission in Afghanistan, as it remains the most important issue in the minds and hearts of all Canadians. Moreover, the recent heightened incidence of casualties, since moving into the conflict-ridden southern Kandahar region, highlights the significance of constructive dialogue among parliamentarians on our current role and direction in Afghanistan, such as the motion we are debating today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me to fully contribute to the debate on this mission, I feel it is necessary to begin by explaining why I feel our current mission is important to Canadians, to the Afghan people, and to the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrific events that took place on the morning of September 11, 2001, undeniably impacted not only the United States, but Canada as well. Since this time we have witnessed changes to both our domestic and foreign policies that have been directly related to these events, which many will agree reflect the changing realities of the world we live in today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552732"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When 9/11 occurred, it made it clear to the world that the instability in Afghanistan was a threat to the world. The Taliban was consciously harbouring terrorist groups such as Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552733"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help bring stability to the Middle Eastern region and Afghanistan, the United Nations Security Council authorized the creation of an international security assistance force. This UN mandated force would be composed of soldiers from NATO countries, Canada included.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552734"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the leadership of a Liberal government, Canadians would embark on a mission of hope. It was a mission that would bring strength to an otherwise failed and dismal state, a mission that would bring rights and education to women, and a mission that would provide opportunity and peace to the Afghan people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552735"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this mission, the Liberal government established the 3D approach in dealing with our tasks in Afghanistan. We were to focus on diplomacy, defence and development. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552736"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians across the country maintain that this is the most appropriate direction, as this mission cannot be won by focusing efforts and capital on military above the rest. We must acknowledge and embrace our genuine partnership with the Karzai government. Through diplomacy we can build stronger ties and assist the Afghan people with their emerging democracy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552737"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, we must continue to work hard to earn the trust and respect of the Afghan people. This aspect of the relationship must obviously be addressed through economic opportunities and developmental aid toward reconstruction efforts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552738"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Canadians also acknowledge the challenges of such a complex mission and the attached risks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552739"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, we have witnessed a drastic increase in fatalities, the vast majority of which have occurred during combat or in bomb attacks by insurgents. This is why it is absolutely imperative to provide adequate military support to the Canadian armed forces and not put them in harm's way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552740"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's efforts in Afghanistan have been extraordinarily successful. In fact, I recall when Afghan President Hamid Karzai visited Canada last year, he praised the work of our Canadian soldiers and development workers. He said in an interview with the CBC:</div>
    </p><a name="Para552741"></a><p>
      <div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para552742"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president was truly thankful for our cooperative support and commitment to stability and development in his ravaged country. However, his visit was underlined with his persistence to address the situation with a balanced approach. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals balanced foreign policy for Afghanistan was clear for our Canadian soldiers who would be fighting, as well as their families and communities watching from a distance.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members on this side of the House are able to contrast that initiative with the ambiguous and misguided direction that the current Conservative government seems to be taking, most notably the shameless news to hold a parliamentary vote on a two-year extension of our mission after a mere six hours of debate in the House.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, our military commitment is scheduled to end in February 2009. As always, Canada will live up to our word to the international community and the Afghan people and not pull out early as many have repeatedly demanded.</div>

To make matters even worse, two weeks ago the Conservative <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78765,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78765&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">defence minister</A> said that Canada would stay in Afghanistan until 2009 and that the Conservatives would re-evaluate next year whether to extend the mission. Now the minister has admitted that the mission has not even been discussed in cabinet.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552748"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister's incompetence is insulting to Canadians and, quite frankly, draws into question the minister's overall credibility.

They expect clear and strong leadership as opposed to the uncertain and contradictory sentiments we have been receiving from the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552749"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Liberals, we unequivocally support Canada's troops. We believe supporting our troops means providing clear, responsible leadership on Afghanistan. Out of respect for our courageous soldiers and their supporting, loving families, we demand that the Conservative government begin to take this mission seriously and stop misleading the House, our soldiers and their families.</div>

    </p><a name="Para552770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we have this type of debate. We have had it in the past. It is important for Canadians to get as much information as possible about what our troops are doing in Afghanistan. It is not an exercise that Canadian troops and Canadian governments take lightly. We want to make sure that we are making certain achievements, and we see that, and it is good that Canadians can hear that today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Canadians should be proud of the men and women of our troops, who are serving not only Canada in Afghanistan, but serving NATO and the United Nations. Afghanistan is a country that is emerging from years of war and destruction. Afghanistan is a country that is looking for hope. Its people understand democracies to a certain degree and they want to try to achieve a democratic country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552772"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this country, we know that it is not just a general election that forms a democracy, but rights, values, principles and the rule of law, all those things. Canadians wish to extend those same rights and those same benefits to countries and regions all around the world and very specifically to Afghanistan. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552773"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is working hard to support this process. Not only are we working hard to back our military, our defence and our troops, but we are working very hard to support the process of extending human rights and those priorities that Canadians have.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our soldiers, our Canadian development workers and our diplomats are helping Afghans pursue their legitimate aspirations of peace and security and a guarantee of a better future for their country and for their children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress made by the people of Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban regime has been very impressive and we must take every opportunity to ensure that Canadians are aware of their own role in this success.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552776"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I would like to tell members of the House of Commons about what Canada has done to help develop and support development in Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552777"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of speeches have been given, and there will be more, but I want to look specifically at one of the issues that has come forward at our committee, and that is how women's lives very clearly have been changed in Afghanistan. I want to take a very brief look this afternoon at how we have made an impact for the women in Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552778"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that these women bear the lion's share of the responsibility for looking after the health and the educational needs of their families. In many places, the men, the husbands, are out working, but the mothers and the women of the communities are the ones on whom a great deal of the burden falls.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552779"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the women have the opportunity to participate more broadly in their communities, development progress takes place at a greater pace and their families benefit even more. For that reason, Canadian development assistance places a priority on ensuring the equality of women. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552780"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Afghanistan Canada has helped over 300,000 Afghans, 72% of them women, to obtain small loans and financial services to start their own businesses, their micro-businesses, or to purchase tools so that, even very primitively, they can become engaged in agriculture and farming in order to facilitate and meet their families' needs.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Canadian project supports the renovation of up to 4,000 community schools. For the first time, many young girls are able to attend these schools. Extracurricular activities are created around the schools so that these children and these communities find something to do with their time, something that is going to enhance their communities. Through all these schools, 9,000 teachers will be trained. This project, whose essential goal is to educate girls, has a budget of $14.5 million.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is the government responding in this kind of way? Because we recognize the importance of making sure that boys and girls and men and women get the type of education that is needed in the long term. It is not just to solve the problem of getting them into schools now, but to solve the problem in the long term so that we can see productivity in a country where it has been so badly lacking over the years.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are encouraging women to participate in local development. More than 16,000 community development councils have been elected across Afghanistan. On many of these councils women are participating for the first time as full members, making important decisions and playing a role in how these projects can be delivered to improve, for example, public health in Afghanistan.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is working to make women's rights known in Afghanistan. Again, it is not simply that we want to educate the children. We want Afghans to know what is acceptable when it comes to women's rights. We have helped to open centres where women can get legal advice, find shelter, take literacy training or obtain health services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are supporting the democratization of Afghanistan. The country has adopted a new constitution. It has held presidential and parliamentary elections.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not certain of the percentage of women in our Parliament. The other day here many people wore pins that stated, “Elect more women”. I know that 25% of the parliamentarians in Afghanistan are women, a higher percentage than Canada's. They are contributing in that manner and they are showing the country that there is a place for them in their democracy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are promoting the education of girls. Today 5.5 million Afghan children to go school. A third of these children are girls. This is something that country has not seen before.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552789"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These initiatives show the very concrete steps that Canadians are taking in Afghanistan to help Afghanistan rebuild. There is a long road ahead.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552790"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today in committee, a former journalist and an expert on Afghanistan, Mr. Van Praagh, stated the following in his presentation: “Democracies and would-be democracies near and far will suffer a great defeat in the greater game if Afghanistan, Canadian credibility and NATO effectiveness are lost”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask members to listen again as I repeat it: “Democracies and would-be democracies near and far will suffer a severe defeat in the greater game...”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is that greater game? It is the greater game of spreading these rights and freedoms, the democracy, the values and the principles that we appreciate here, and this will suffer a great defeat if the credibility of Canadians and NATO there in Afghanistan is lost.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can make a difference in that country. Canada has always looked for places where we can make a difference. It is one thing to talk about sending aid here and sending aid there, but when we are in a place where we can make a difference and when we make that difference, let us make sure that we continue to do that. Let us make sure that we continue to do the fine job that we are doing.</div>

I will say that is what I do think. I think that Canada in the long term will be providing humanitarian aid in Afghanistan. Right now Afghanistan is our number one recipient country around the world. We have always been there for countries like Haiti. We have always been there for sub-Saharan countries in Africa. We have always been there in many of those countries and we have not been asked for total exit strategies from any of those countries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552800"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly in the long term I hope that Afghanistan is secure, that the Afghan army and the police force can secure the country in Afghanistan so that Canadians stay there and continue the fantastic work that they are doing in education and many other areas.</div>

A regime came in that helped facilitate terrorism. A regime came in that ignored the rights of men and women. A regime came in that said there is no such thing as religious freedom, there is no such thing as young ladies going to school, there are no such things. Perhaps that is when we dropped the ball.</div>

I appreciate that my colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78855,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78855&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Crowfoot</A>, is splitting his time with me and is allowing me this opportunity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552808"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to begin by talking about the greatest privilege and honour that I have had certainly in my nearly 14 years as a parliamentarian, but also probably the greatest privilege I have had in my lifetime. That was to spend Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day on the ground in Afghanistan with our troops celebrating Christmas there in Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552809"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was that such a great privilege? Because I passionately believe that the greatest gift any citizen can give to his or her country is to serve it in a time of war. The greatest sacrifice any citizen, and by extension one's family, can make for one's country, is to put one's life on the line defending the things and the values in which we believe so strongly, the values of freedom and democracy, the things that have been granted to us by the sacrifices of thousands in the past. That is why it was such a huge privilege for me to be in Afghanistan at Christmastime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552810"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember speaking in the forward operating bases with the young men and women, and there are many women who are there fighting the Taliban as well as young men, and having some come up to me afterward and saying that I must have drawn the short straw to have to spend my Christmas away from my family and there with them. I said it was quite the contrary. My two colleagues and I who were privileged to join the chief of the defence staff, General Hillier, and others in Afghanistan had to lobby to get there. We wanted to be there to show our young men and women in uniform who are over there doing this tremendous job for us that they and their mission have our unqualified support.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552811"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding this whole nonsense that somehow we can support the troops and yet be opposed to the mission, I can say, having visited with a great many of these young men and women there, that they do not draw that distinction. Why? Because they believe heart and soul in what they are doing and so do their families. Their families support them. Obviously they are worried about them, worried sick about them, but they know why they are there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we should be taking the lead from the troops. If they and their families are willing to make that sacrifice, if they believe in the mission, then who are we to doubt it, for it is they who are making the sacrifice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552813"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made a promise when I was there at Christmastime. I made a promise to those young men and women that I would carry their message back here at every opportunity. I have done that in my riding; I have done that at every opportunity I have had, like today, to speak about the successes they are gaining, inch by inch, yard by yard, at the cost of their blood. I made a promise that I would carry that message back to Canada, as did my colleagues who were there on that trip with me.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552814"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to bring forward in this debate a rather famous quote from Edmund Burke, someone who is highly regarded as perhaps the father of modern conservatism. He said, “All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing”. I think that statement could be amended in this modern age to refer to good men and good women, but the sentiment is right. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552815"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should never lose sight during this debate of why we originally went to Afghanistan. We went there to track down and bring to justice Osama bin Laden and his henchmen as the evil mastermind and financier of 9/11. We went there to ensure that Afghanistan would never, ever again be a bastion of terrorism, a home for the training ground for terrorists to launch their attacks around the world.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is we believe that we are engaged in a war on terrorism, a war on evil people, just as we were during the first and second world wars. We believe that these people have to be brought to justice.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was about to say, imagine if in 1939 this place passed a motion saying we were going to engage in combat, we are going to try and bring Adolf Hitler to justice and all the Nazis who support him, but we were only going to do it for a couple of years. Imagine if we said in 1943 that we were going to cut and run, we were going to get out of there. Imagine if we said whether we won or lost, whether they were brought to justice or not, we were going to quit. Imagine that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those members say they believe in the mission. Not a chance. The mission is to bring these people to justice. The mission is to ensure democracy and freedom in Afghanistan. The mission is to ensure that country is never used again as a base for terrorism, as a base to launch worldwide terrorist attacks such as the one that took the lives of over 2,000 people at the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, and in that hijacked aircraft--</div>

    </p><a name="Para552840"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countries have tried isolationism in the past. Countries have tried pacifism in the past, and it does not work when dealing with evil people and evil regimes. Let us look at history.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552841"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I wish that our NATO allies would step up to the plate more in southern Afghanistan and carry some of the heavy lifting that we and a few others have been doing? Of course I do. The troops do as well. They told me that when I was there. We all do. I would remind people who are viewing this debate today that this is nothing new.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552842"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did our forefathers wish the Americans had become engaged in World War I before 1917? Of course they did. What did the Americans learn by being isolationists before 1941 when for nearly two and a half years Canada and our allies carried the fight with the Nazis? They learned, much to their horror, with Pearl Harbour, that isolationism does not work when we are dealing with evil. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552843"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP has suggested that somehow we can reason with the Taliban, somehow we can negotiate with al-Qaeda. That is ridiculous. That does not even warrant serious debate. There is only one way to defeat evil and that is to fight it with all our strength, to fight it with all our courage every day, and to fight it united. If we give in to temptation and support this ridiculous motion, evil will triumph.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552844"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals may honestly believe that this debate and this motion will somehow give some comfort to the men and women in Afghanistan and to the grieving families of those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice, but it will not. It will only give comfort to our enemies, to the Taliban.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening very carefully to that speaker, I would suggest to him that he read the points that this motion is based on. He was totally off in a different direction by talking about the second world war. Let us put everything into perspective. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552847"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Leader of the Opposition and as the defence critic clearly pointed out earlier today, this is an international mission. Canada committed to a certain timeframe. Unfortunately, the Conservative government prematurely committed to extend it without any conditions. I want the member to answer to those so-called caveats. The government is stuck with this without being able to take off these so-called caveats.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552848"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are in this mission together like we were during the second world war that he referred to, we should engage collectively. Other nations do not want to get involved. They say they suckered the Canadians to be there because we committed without putting in the terms of engagement first.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552849"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the member answer to his people and to the military? It is shameful to say that we do not support our military because we want to debate this motion.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the part the Liberals do not understand and that I was trying to communicate. I hope, for the viewing public at home today and those in the gallery, that I am doing a reasonable job of trying to communicate this. When someone is in a life and death struggle against evil there are no conditions for withdrawal. It is either win or lose and that is how simple it is. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the other parties to somehow suggest that we can set some parameters around a fight against evil is extremely shortsighted. It does a complete disservice to both the men and women in Afghanistan on the front lines and their families back home.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He advocates in a very specific way that not only should we completely ignore the idea that supporting our troops means asking tough questions on their behalf, doing our homework and where the mission is failing actually being prepared to stand up against the abuse from the government to say so and, if necessary, against public opinion to say let us find alternative approaches.

    </p><a name="Para552864"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stand here to debate this motion today, I want to first extend my deep sympathy to the families and friends of all the soldiers who paid the ultimate price and sacrificed their lives serving their country. I also want to wish all who have been injured a full and speedy recovery.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552865"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I am going to refrain from using any partisan finger pointing. Given the magnitude of this matter, I am hoping that by avoiding partisan accusations parliamentarians will actually debate the substance of this motion and not be distracted by one-upmanship in order to make a point. This discussion is not only critical for Canadians and our Canadian soldiers, but it is also very important for Afghanistan and our international partners.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552866"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today many doubts persist about the future and success of our current mission in Afghanistan. The goals of the current mission in Kandahar appear to be ambiguous and uncertain. Canadians have many questions about our strategy in achieving our goals and about tangible signs of success. They have questions about the length of this mission. They have questions about the exit transition. Surely these questions deserve real discussion and responsible answers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552867"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians supported the initial deployment in Afghanistan. The original goals were to help the Afghani nation dispose of horrible, radical and destructive elements and to participate in helping establish a democratic system that would enable genuine progress. Recently though, Canadians have been observing a marked change in tone and scope when it comes to this mission.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552868"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that the current approach is not working. It is unquestionable that the Taliban has gained popularity and support. It is undeniable that opium growth has more than doubled over the past year. It is a fact that our Canadian troops have been suffering more casualties. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552869"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to encourage all parliamentarians who are going to engage in this discussion to avoid the silly accusation we have already heard today that this debate offends our troops or represents a lack of support for their sincere work. Parliamentarians and Canadians are extremely proud of our soldiers and support them wholeheartedly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552870"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly why we are having this debate and this is exactly why Canadians are watching this debate. Our support must be expressed by being responsible when making serious decisions about their future deployments. So for anyone who is thinking about it, please spare us the rhetoric and help us focus on a healthy, serious and effective debate that will honour the sacrifice of our soldiers and their keen willingness to serve our country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552871"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also caution any parliamentarian who will spend most of their time describing the ruthlessness of the Taliban and its supporters. All Canadians are aware of the Taliban. This not about whether the Taliban is evil. What we need to examine is how effectively we are helping the Afghan people to progress and to prosper.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552872"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our mission strategy is to chase Taliban elements around the rural areas of Afghanistan, it would be fair to assume that this would become an endless and counterproductive objective. This would only embolden the Taliban and stir resentment among villagers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552873"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best approach to defeat the Taliban is to marginalize it by offering hopeful alternatives to Afghans and shutting the door on its attempts to exploit frustrated and angry villagers. We must focus our efforts on creating a vibrant and rewarding environment where civil institutions are strong, job opportunities are growing, political expressions are encouraged and education is accessible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552874"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we make this mission into a pure military operation, no one wins. If we frame this mission as a form of retribution, it loses sight of its real intended objectives, and if we focus on engaging the Taliban in an arms race as the minister has said, it is bound to turn into an aimless and endless goal. Our soldiers have served honourably for five years in Afghanistan and by 2009 it will be seven years. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must take a long, hard look at what we have accomplished to date, celebrate our successes and learn from our experience. It is unacceptable that we bury our heads in the sand and pretend that all is well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552876"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many real and serious questions. The government is making these questions more urgent by remaining ambiguous and unclear about the future of the mission. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552877"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are uncertain about the intention of the government in regard to the future of our deployment. We all know that Canada is committed until 2009. What we do not know is the intention of the government beyond that. The Conservatives insinuate that we could be there for an additional 10 to 15 years, but when they are asked direct questions, they avoid clear answers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552878"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this motion, we are hoping to send a clear message to all Canadians about what the House of Commons expects in the future for the mission. By voting to support the motion, we are making it clear that we want our troops to leave the southern part of Afghanistan by 2009. By voting against the motion, parliamentarians will further confuse Canadians and send mix messages about what are our goals. Canadians want answers to legitimate and fair questions. They expect these questions to be handled thoughtfully and openly. We do not want to lose our focus and get distracted by blind emotions or ideology.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552879"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mission is multidimensional, complex and it deserves thoughtful deliberation. Simplistic and one dimensional slogans are not satisfactory. One need only examine history or current world affairs, including what is happening in Iraq, to see that even the most sincere intentions can end in failure if various cultural, humanitarian, military and economical aspects are not considered. Reflecting on these factors is not a sign of weakness; it is a sign of strength. Ignoring these factors can only be interpreted as a sign of weakness and negligence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552880"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians want us to ensure that our brave troops are sent on peacekeeping missions with well defined goals, a clearly outlined strategy and a well defined time commitment. Canadians can also see that we need to re-examine our current strategy and clearly explain the horizons of our goal and scope.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552881"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is exactly why I am supporting the motion.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006 there was a vote in the House that said we would stay in Afghanistan till 2009. The first question I had from some of the people who had been there was, “Whatever makes people in the House of Commons think that by 2009 it would be the time to move out? Whatever put it in their heads that would be the time to leave Afghanistan?” </div>
    </p><a name="Para552884"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person was seriously aggravated, asking if we were saying that we should pull out of Afghanistan at a specific time, that we should give the enemy enough time to survive until then and let them rebuild and become very strong so maybe they could bring the battle to the soil of Canada, to the North American continent. He asked if we did not realize that the Taliban and al-Qaeda were trying to destroy western civilization. He wondered why we were saying there would be an end when we would have to pull back. He said that they would be on our soil and that we would have to defend our people on our land. If that was the case, why were we not going after them?</div>

    </p><a name="Para552899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having visited our troops in Afghanistan in May 2006, I can tell members they are the most committed personnel we will ever see and they understand why they are there. I believe all members of Parliament, regardless of party, support our troops in the field.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we should understand this motion. The motion clearly says that we will end our military engagement in Kandahar in February 2009. It does not preclude other Canadian activity, military, diplomatic or development-wise, in other parts of the country. It talks about in Kandahar.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not solely a Canadian mission. Under the auspices of the United Nations, and NATO in particular, we are shouldering the responsibility along with other NATO allies. What is important to keep in mind is that the government has not announced, in terms of rotation, to NATO who will come after us, as we did before, under the previous Liberal government, in Kabul where the Turks came in after Canadian troops had served there. Therefore, the issue is about notifying NATO that someone else will have to step up to the plate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not abandoning Afghanistan. Nor are we walking away. We may in fact have a different focus in Afghanistan after February 2009. However, as long as we are in Kandahar until February 2009, this party and our leader has made it very clear that we support our men and women in the field. Do not suggest otherwise. To be very clear, we support our men and women.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to point out that Canada has contributed significantly in the field. Although some NATO allies have covenants about terms of engagement, we believe very strongly on this side of the House that the government needs to continue to pressure our NATO allies to put more troops in the field and to assist in shouldering the responsibilities that we have under this mission. Now we only have six countries out of twenty six that are prepared to do so. That is not good enough. Canadians are prepared to, in some cases, give the ultimate sacrifice, but we cannot do it alone. It is not solely a Canadian mission.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to ensure that the government puts more pressure on Pakistan. Having been in Pakistan on two occasions, recently in February, I had the opportunity to speak with both the foreign affairs chairs for the Senate and the House of Pakistan. They indicated they had 80,000 troops along the border, but, clearly, it is a very porous border. Obviously there are also political issues in Pakistan itself, but it recognizes the contribution of this country. Pakistan is stepping up to the plate more than it has in the past. Prime Minister Aziz had indicated very strongly to me that it was working with their allies, including Canada and the United States, to seek out, capture or destroy Taliban and al-Qaeda forces. However, we need more diplomatic pressure, and the government can do that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is the focus of the government has been purely military. It has not been on the other two aspects, which are critically important, diplomacy and development, which I will speak about a little later.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552906"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an opportunity not only in assisting and training the national Afghan army but, in particular, the national police. Back in May 2006, six RCMP officers and one officer from Charlottetown were in Kandahar helping, but that is not enough. We have a lot of opportunity and expertise to assist the police. One of the problems, quite frankly, is they are not paid on a regular basis. Another aspect is they do not have the right training and motivation, and that needs to be done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552907"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, we are shouldering our responsibility. It was the Liberal government that stepped up to the plate after 9/11. We support this mission. Any suggestion that we do not is pure fallacy. The fact is, by February 2009 we are saying that others have come up to the plate and we need to look at other opportunities for Canada.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335">(1335)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para552908"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest a couple of things. First, when our leader indicated very clearly that we support this mission, he also said that we should not forget the important role that we have in the diplomatic community and how we can assist in that regard. Again, we do not hear enough about that. If in fact that is going on, we need to hear more and see more transparency on that particular issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552909"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that when it comes to the issue of the poppies, we could be doing more. We know we could be doing more in terms of CIDA. We hear about all these projects that are being created by CIDA. I can say that, in the short term, these projects are very good and putting young women and young children back to school is extremely important. However, the sustainability of some of these projects is what we must question because three or four months after the buildings have been built we often hear that they have been destroyed by fire and so on by either the Taliban or al-Qaeda forces. Therefore, we need to look at a strategy more in terms of longevity. I think that is extremely important.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552910"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that we have had a disproportionate number of casualties compared, say, to the Dutch who are in an equally difficult position, but we have never shrunk from our responsibilities. However, the question I have for the government is why is it reluctant to put pressure on our allies to say that by February 2009, a date which the government proposed in the House back in May 2006, we will end our military involvement in this region, we are now seeking a rotation ,as we did previously, but we will not be walking away.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552911"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> used the term “cut and run”. I do not remember anyone on this side of the House ever suggesting that. In fact, I find it extremely offensive to suggest that anyone on this side of the House would do so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552912"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe, though, that we cannot have a military option without a diplomatic option and without a development option. If we really want to improve the lives of the average Afghani, we need to coordinate better all of the development aid that is going in, to which about 44% can only be spent currently by five major ministries in the Afghan government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552913"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, there is the issue of accountability. Where is this money going? In terms of our aid, Afghanistan is not even among the 25 CIDA recipients and yet the bulk of our aid is going to Afghanistan. If it is going to go there, we need to be able to say that this is the status of the project, this is what is happening and this is where we are going with this particular project because we must ensure we are getting value for dollar.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552914"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, through our provincial reconstruction teams, as the House knows, we are very active but again we cannot do one without the other. We need to have them there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552915"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think President Karzai has been very clear on that. A military option alone will not solve the problem. We must work with our allies to be effective. Again, without that ability and without the government making it clear to those allies, we will continue to have uncertainty. Uncertainty is not good for our troops overseas and it is not good for the Canadian public. As parliamentarians, we have a responsibility to do our utmost to ensure an improvement. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552916"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I see young girls going to school for the first time and learning to read and write and learning certain skills, this is something we did not see under the Taliban. We want to ensure this continues forever but we will not be able to do that unless we work in a coordinated manner with our allies to ensure this is done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552917"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's response is that if we do not support 100% the direction of the government we are not supporting the troops. That is not true. We will not take a back seat to anyone when it comes to the support of our personnel overseas but we also will not shirk from our responsibility of indicating very strongly to Canadians and to our allies that they need to take more responsibility and that from six of the twenty-six that they all must end these covenants, that they must become actively engaged and that we must be doing what is the right thing, not only for the Afghan people but for our personnel whether they be military or otherwise.</div>

    </p><a name="Para552919"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late last year he stated that he would not take any action without consulting with our NATO allies and yet this motion in front of the House states that no consultations are to take place. As a matter of fact, it calls upon the government to notify NATO of this decision immediately. There are no consultations, only withdrawal from southern Afghanistan, whereas late last year it was consultations with our NATO allies and the withdrawal of all our troops from Afghanistan with “honour”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552920"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I am confused about the Liberal Party's position on this. I do not think it has made the case as to how withdrawing troops from southern Afghanistan would actually enhance the stability of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.</div>

    </p><a name="Para552922"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that if we are going to notify NATO of our intent to withdraw our troops from the Kandahar region in February 2009, then the government has the responsibility is to ensure there are other troops for the rotation. That is what the previous Liberal government did. I do not think there is any question that we notify them in the consultation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552923"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that the government refuses to say whether or not it is even going to consult in terms of this date. It came up with this artificial date of February 2009. The House voted, and we take the will of the House, that we will accept February 2009. I would suggest that in those intervening two years since that motion leading up to 2009, the government will have lots of time to indicate what progress, if any, it is making in that regard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552924"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the official opposition was more than clear. If we read his speech at the Université de Montréal in February 2007, it said that we will be there until February 2009, pursuant to the resolution in this House. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552925"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the member does not seem to understand is that if we are going to notify NATO, we expect NATO to then be in a position to say, “Yes, and the rotation will be country X”. That is what we did and that is what I expect the government to do.</div>

    </p><a name="Para552931"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our position is very clear. Again, in the Leader of the Opposition's speech of February 2007, we have said that we support the mission but we also said that it is an international mission. It is not a clearly Canadian mission and, therefore, in terms of the rotation, which has never come out of the mouth of the government, it needs to have someone lined up, as we did before when we were in Kabul and we had Turkey lined up. The government has not done anything about that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552932"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been very clear in our objectives. We support development and we support the enhancement of young women and children going to school. We support diplomatic efforts and we support our troops 100% in the field. However, at the end of the day, we are not expected to be there and it is not realistic to suggest that we will be there, in terms of Kandahar, beyond 2009. We need to know what the government is going to do. As it is the government, it needs to answer that. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to recognize my fellow citizens from La Pointe-de-l'Île and say that there is a military base in this riding which sends out all sorts of things, including unfortunately the coffins used in Afghanistan. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552935"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to remind the House that the government forced a debate, making it impossible to ask the questions and get the answers we needed. The result was that the deployment was extended until 2009, although the motion only passed by a margin of five votes. The government took the House hostage. Now we find ourselves in a situation that might have been better if parliamentarians had been consulted. Instead, this deployment was forced on us until 2009. I am not saying that we would have been against it, but we could at least have discussed how to go about it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552936"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This mission is not Canada’s only mission. There are 2,500 soldiers in Kandahar as opposed to 37,500 in all of Afghanistan, if my figures are correct.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552937"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the mission in Kandahar, which is specific to Canada, is proving very difficult. The Bloc Québécois supports the Liberal motion to inform our allies and colleagues that the Canadians will withdraw from this mission in February 2009. Canadian combat operations in southern Afghanistan will cease in February 2009. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552938"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the short amount of time available to me, I would particularly like to say that Canada has ascribed far too much importance to the military mission in comparison with the humanitarian mission and reconstruction. Why do I remind the House of this? Because this is not an ordinary war. Especially in Kandahar, it is a war against guerrillas. Guerrillas do not have tanks or the same weapons. Guerrillas cannot keep going without support from the local population, and that is why it is important to remember that Afghans must receive support and see the kind of reconstruction that will give them hope. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552939"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do I say this? Because we have been getting signals. For some time now, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development has been hearing from witnesses. Nearly all of them, apart from those in the army, have been telling us that the Afghans are losing hope. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552940"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why? There are many reasons. A professor from Carleton University reminded us of them this morning. They are losing hope because the democracy and freedoms they were promised are in serious jeopardy and because corruption is widespread, as it was previously when the Taliban came to Afghanistan. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552941"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must remember history. The Taliban were driven out by the American army, by the Canadians and others. The Taliban were able to enter Afghanistan because of the corruption of the warlords. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552942"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was the poverty of most people and the wealth of a few. Why the difference? It is related to this corruption, which is based on the poor distribution of the money that is being sent, for all the reasons with which we are very familiar. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350">(1350)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para552943"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This money passes through the hands of many racketeers, so that fewer projects are actually carried out and less money really gets to the Afghans. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552944"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there are drugs. We must not forget that right now Afghanistan produces 90% of the world’s opium. This is an extraordinary source of funding for the Taliban and once more a source of corruption. Let me say in passing that these Taliban are capable of paying the soldiers trained by the Canadian army and the other armies much more than they are paid by the Afghan army. I heard this said in a Canadian embassy by a military official who was there. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552945"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freedom of expression and the press is now threatened and jeopardized by the government because Canada is too dependent on the warlords—at the time of the American invasion, the warlords controlled only 3% of the territory. It is because of drugs, opium, but also because farmers make money, though not much, from growing poppies. Twelve percent of the population are involved in growing poppies. So, if we try to eradicate this crop, as we are doing right now, the farmers will once again be forced into the arms of the Taliban.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552946"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So something else must be done and other means found. The Bloc has suggested using this drug, buying it and using it for medicinal purposes. It is extremely important to know that something else must be done. A senior official from the United Nations even said that it would be better to buy it up than to let it corrupt the whole system in Afghanistan. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another extremely important question is the lack of coordination among all those who wish to do humanitarian work—including Canadians and the Afghan government—and those who perform security-related work. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next winter, when the troops and leaders at various levels are less busy, some thought should be given to transforming what the PRTs, the Provincial Reconstruction Teams, do. The soldiers are not trained to do humanitarian or reconstruction work. According to some recent reports, their efforts in these areas meet with failure and give rise to successive problems. Humanitarian workers could therefore do their work under the protection of the military, but we must not continue with the PRTs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there is a lot to do in order to restore hope to the Afghans. All we have to do is restore their hope. It is true that security is necessary and soldiers are needed, but soldiers are not the goal sought and are not even the primary means. The primary means is to restore hope to the Afghans. </div>
    </p><a name="Para552950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this, Canada must not be afraid to insist that it is time to put an end to the corruption. This message must also be aimed at the Karzai government. It is up to him to do some housecleaning to ensure that the Taliban who are still being supported by the Afghan people cannot return this time, like they did the first time.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Canada must have the courage to take a very firm stand. Today, we heard some very shocking and strong evidence about President Musharraf. Pakistan is training, arming and instructing the Taliban. We cannot let this situation continue.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, much remains to be done. The Bloc Québécois supports the soldiers working there. However, for the sake of their health and their lives, we are saying that the military should focus its efforts on construction and humanitarian assistance. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, Canada is giving $1 billion over the next 10 years for development projects in Afghanistan. For him to stand up and say that CIDA's budget is for 25 countries and that somehow we have missed Afghanistan is totally misleading.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Liberals have said that there are no new goals or there are ambiguous goals in Afghanistan.

Since he did not, I will take this opportunity to emphasize the urgency of learning from past mistakes and not repeating them. These mistakes include believing that we can allow corruption to continue without any repercussions, and believing that the Taliban will only be defeated by guns and tanks. The Taliban will be defeated if the Afghan people believe that, with time, they will discover hope once again, rebuild a democratic country and regain their freedom. The Afghan people have a history and a culture and they want to find their way back to it. That is what must not be forgotten. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 15,000 men and women in air force light blue are on duty every day, ensuring the sovereignty of our airspace over Canada's great land mass and well out over three oceans.</div>
    </p><a name="Para552994"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air force conducts dangerous search and rescue missions. It forms Canada's contribution to Norad's continental defence.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Billy Bishop's courage of the early morning in a Nieuport 17 to a C-17 Globemaster in the near future, Canada's air force slips the surly bonds of earth around the clock as a vital component of Canada's foreign and domestic policy.</div>

    </p><a name="Para553242"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member argued that clause 13(1) of the bill respecting the application of the definition of “SIFT trust”, which is a specified investment flow-through trust, is not in keeping with the practices and customs of this House. In his view, the provision represents an inappropriate delegation of subordinate law and the member has asked that the Speaker rule that the clause be struck from the bill and the bill ordered reprinted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553243"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Speaker has noted, this is a complex issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the expertise of the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78629,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78629&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Scarborough—Rouge River</A> on matters of subordinate law. However, I submit that this is not a valid point of order, as there are no procedural authorities that preclude the House from legislating in this manner. In short, this is a matter for debate, which would be better dealt with by members in the House and at committee, rather than a procedural question for the Speaker to resolve.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first briefly provide some background to this issue in order to assist the Chair.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision in question provides a rule for the application of the definition of “SIFT trust”. In particular, the provision sets out when a trust will be subject to the new rules pertaining to the taxation of income trusts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the bill, a new trust will become a SIFT trust and therefore subject to the new rules for the taxation year in which it first meets the definition. However, for an existing trust, the SIFT trust definition will not apply, and therefore the new rules will not apply until the earlier of the 2011 taxation year, and the taxation year in which the trust exceeds the normal growth guidelines issues by the Department of Finance on December 15, 2006, unless that excess arose as a result of a prescribed transaction. As you can see, Mr. Speaker, this is quite technical.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553248"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this, the provision in question contains an incorporation by reference of the normal growth guidelines issued by the Department of Finance, to which I just referred. Incorporation by reference is a proper and legal approach to enacting legislation. It is neither rare nor unusual in legislation. An examination of Canadian statutory law would reveal many instances where incorporation by reference has been used in just this fashion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553249"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, sections 181.3 and 190.13 of the Income Tax Act refer to the use of risk-weighting guidelines issued by the Superintendent of Financial Institutions in order to determine the amount of capital of an authorized foreign bank. These guidelines are defined in section 248 of the Income Tax Act and are issued pursuant to section 600 of the Bank Act. I could go on with other examples, but I am sure the Speaker would find that a tad tedious.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553250"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it is not uncommon for legislation to allow documents incorporated by reference in legislation to be changed from time to time. For example, section 11 of the Customs Tariff incorporate by reference the Compendium of Classification Opinions to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System published by the Customs Co-Operation Council, as amended from time to time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, it is not just in the Income Tax Act, but in other legislation as well that we see this same approach. As I said, we could go on at length, but I shall save us and save the House that lengthy example. I think the Speaker has ample precedent there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of procedural arguments, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78629,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78629&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Scarborough—Rouge River</A> essentially made three points. He has argued: first, that the provision is not in keeping with the practices and customs of this House; second, that the clause attempts to exempt itself from rules regarding parliamentary scrutiny of subordinate law; and third, that the clause does not comply with the government's own internal rules on legislative drafting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address each point in turn.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first point, the practices and customs of the House, the essence of the member's argument appears to be that the clause does not conform to the rules of the House. The government submits that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2801101,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2801101&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-52</A> and all of its provisions are properly before the House. The provision in question was included in a detailed notice of ways and means motion tabled on March 27, which was adopted by the House on March 28. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ways and means motion adopted by the House on March 28 included the identical provision that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78629,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78629&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Scarborough—Rouge River</A> questioned. Therefore, the provision in question is consistent with the rules governing financial procedures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I submit there are no procedural grounds for the clause to be ruled out of order. Rather, this is an issue that would be more appropriately considered by the Standing Committee on Finance in its review of the bill. Should the member wish to improve the text of the bill, he and his colleagues are free to propose amendments to the bill in committee. </div>

On the other hand, no substantive change may be made to the manner in which a bill was worded when it was introduced, or when a committee reported on it, otherwise than by an amendment passed by the House.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para553265"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There would appear, Mr. Speaker, to be only two circumstances where the Speaker can make alterations to a bill: first, where the Chair has ruled that amendments adopted by a committee are beyond the scope of the bill, as you had recently ruled with respect to committee amendments to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169666,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169666&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-257</A>, the replacement workers bill; or second, when there is a clear printing error. As you noted in a ruling on February 23, 2004, this is only done in rare cases where there is a manifest error in the printing of the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553266"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these limited instances, I submit that it is up to the House to decide whether or not to adopt a bill with our without amendment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553267"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you were, Mr. Speaker, to conclude that the provision of the bill as currently drafted is unacceptable, I would submit that the House and the committee should, first, have an opportunity to review the matter and consider possible amendments to improve the text of the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553268"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the provision in question remains in the bill at third reading, I submit that it is at that point when the Speaker should intervene on this matter in the unlikely case you think it is necessary.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553269"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is analogous to the procedure that we use with private members' bills when we have those flaws. Committee exists and represents an opportunity for the flaws to be cured. If this is a flaw, indeed, that would be the place at which it could happen. The Speaker, if faced by a change that is unacceptable, does not need to put the question on that clause at third reading.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553270"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the review of statutory instruments, the hon. member has also suggested that the provision of the bill exempts itself from the rules of the House regarding parliamentary scrutiny of delegated legislation. It is not uncommon for bills to establish forms of delegated legislation that are not subject to the Statutory Instruments Act. It is perfectly within the prerogatives of the House to pass legislation to that effect. As I have indicated earlier, it is not the role of the Speaker to decide whether such legislation is appropriation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553271"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is the government guide for drafting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member also suggested that the provision in question is not consistent with the government's “Guide to Making Federal Acts and Regulations”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553273"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guide sets out principles for making legislation and regulations, as well as government processes for ensuring that statutory and legislative changes are made in an effective way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553274"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the fact that this guide is by no means a procedural authority, I would also point out that the guide does not prevent the government from introducing legislation such as the provision in question, provided that the cabinet has authorized such legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553275"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would submit that clause 13(1) of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2801101,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2801101&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-52</A> is properly before the House. This is a matter for debate. The issue is properly in the hands of the House and the finance committee will be better placed to examine whether this section of the bill is appropriate or whether it can be improved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553276"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As always, I understand that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> is prepared to discuss this matter, and all matters related to the bill, further in committee.

    </p><a name="Para553281"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ethics Commissioner has concluded that I did not contravene the conflict of interest code for members of the House of Commons. I do not dispute this conclusion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I do take issue with the inquiry process and the content of the report.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge hon. members of the House to not concur in the report. Instead, I would urge the House to refer the entire matter to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for a full and thorough investigation, with recommendations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553284"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inquiry process and the report violated the principles of procedural fairness. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553285"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ethics Commissioner did not inform me that an inquiry had been resumed. This deprived me of my right to make representations at all appropriate stages throughout the process. The code provides that procedural right. In fact, I only learned of the existence of the report one hour prior to it being tabled, but two months after the report says the inquiry had resumed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553286"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report includes many personal details about my extended family that the Ethics Commissioner learned during the investigation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553287"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personal information about the unhappy circumstances of my sister-in-law's marriage surely was not required to support the conclusions. Nor was there any need to write about stupid and unfounded allegations against my family that had nothing to do with this inquiry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely the Ethics Commissioner is meant to exercise tact and discretion, like when he provides the report for public office holders. Surely he should limit his reports to such details as are necessary to support the conclusion, and no more. The code requires the Ethics Commissioner to conduct the inquiry in private and to provide relevant reasons for this conclusion. Why should all details from the private investigation be disclosed? </div>
    </p><a name="Para553289"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be asking the committee that personal details from the report that are not necessary to support the conclusion be removed from the report and from the Commissioner's website. The integrity of the code is at issue. All members of Parliament are at risk of such disclosures if the report stands as a precedent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553290"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure and House affairs committee will have to consider whether the way the Ethics Commissioner handled this report constitutes a further prima facie contempt of the House of Commons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553291"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 2005, the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs directed the Ethics Commissioner to suspend the inquiry. He did suspend it, but refused to do so because the committee asked him to. Instead, he suspended it because he had learned of an RCMP investigation into the matter, which went on to clear me of all allegations. In November 2005, the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs found the Ethics Commissioner in contempt of the House of Commons since he did not comply with the provisions of the code.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ethics Commissioner had full knowledge of the direction of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to suspend the inquiry, although he refused to accept this direction at that time. The Ethics Commissioner resumed the inquiry but did not advise me. He did not advise the House of Commons. He did not seek guidance from the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, which had directed him to suspend the inquiry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553293"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the report has been tabled without seeking the direction of the committee. The inquiry process and the report still suffer from the same kinds of problems that had concerned the committee when he was found in contempt. Once again, the Ethics Commissioner has shown no regard for procedural fairness and no regard for my family's privacy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By resuming the inquiry without informing me and by tabling the report, the Ethics Commissioner has defied the will of the committee. Therefore, his conduct, in my opinion, constitutes a further contempt.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Ethics Commissioner has chosen to ignore what the members of the House have said about the subject matter of this inquiry, about the need to respect the personal privacy of my family, and the principles of procedural fairness, then how can we accept the report?</div>
    </p><a name="Para553296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me quote what the committee said about its concerns: “The risks to Members, and the very integrity of the Code, demand nothing less”. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1520"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1520"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1520">(1520)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para553297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I will ask the House to refuse to concur in this report if a motion is brought before the House. I will take the matter to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for a thorough investigation and a review of the provisions of the code to ensure its integrity. This will help ensure that in the future hon. members will have the benefit of procedural fairness from the conflict of interest inquiry process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no objection if a new report is tabled after due regard to the concerns I have raised and the findings of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs in the 51st report, adopted on November 17 and tabled on November 18, 2005.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553299"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say one more thing. Despite my repeated requests not to get involved in a family dispute, this request was ignored. A life was lost through suicide. The privacy of my sister-in-law and her two sons has been violated through no fault of their own. They have no recourse. When this was pointed out to the Ethics Commissioner by my sister-in-law during Mr. Shapiro's visit to Calgary, he chose to ignore it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553300"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of this attitude, today the private details of my sister-in-law's life are published in the report tabled. Ethnic newspapers are now running articles on her life and the lives of her two sons. Is this fair? Also, I will ask women's rights groups this question: are they going to defend this woman's rights?</div>

I want to salute their courage and dedication. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553303"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the disagreements that members of the House of Commons may have regarding the mission in Afghanistan, we all have full confidence in our men and women in the field. There is also no question of an early withdrawal of our troops before 2009. Canada has a duty to inform its allies before withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan because the 2009 deadline is rapidly approaching. That is basically what this motion proposes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553304"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though we on this side of the House support the motion, we also propose a rebalancing of the operations in Afghanistan, particularly in regard to Canada’s strategy for supporting peace in Afghanistan and the mandate and methods of the Canadian armed forces. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553305"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people of Canada and Quebec are divided on the issue of our military presence in Afghanistan. The Quebec nation has values and interests of its own, and whenever the Bloc Québécois takes a position on a motion or a bill, it must always ask itself whether this is in the interests of Quebec. Am I for this or against it? Each time we try to decide what the government of a sovereign Quebec would do. That is why today’s debate is very important. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553306"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of what I have heard in the debates today, I believe that we need to rebalance the mission in Afghanistan. The basic objective of the international coalition and the NATO countries must be to rebuild the economy and democracy and make Afghanistan a viable country. To succeed in this, Canada must play a leadership role in delivering and distributing humanitarian aid for the reconstruction of Afghanistan. It is important to state very clearly, not only for the members of the coalition and the NATO countries but also for the people of Quebec and Canada, that the Canadian army in Afghanistan is going to rebalance its efforts in the field. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553307"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois has always supported sending troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO mission. The operation that Canada undertook was more or less a peace mission to stabilize the Kabul region and surrounding areas. Unfortunately, it has become a war operation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553308"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are the people of Canada and Quebec still so divided when it comes to the presence of the Canadian Forces in Afghanistan? The people have been told that the Taliban rebels have a fallback position in Pakistan and that they are getting stronger, not weaker. That is the situation. Moreover, according to NATO officials in charge of military deployment, there are not enough troops.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553309"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebeckers and Canadians must be given assurances that the government is capable of taking the Afghanistan situation to the next level after 2009. Right now, people think that the mission in Afghanistan is getting more and more dangerous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553310"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is getting a lot more dangerous, but there is still time to change the thrust of international intervention. Doing so is becoming more urgent. We will not win the support of the Afghan people by just fighting the Taliban with our weapons and chasing them around the mountains.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530">(1530)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para553311"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois is talking about bringing a new balance to the mission. If we continue doing what we are doing, more lives may be lost. Shifting the mission's focus in the following three areas is urgent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553312"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we must increase reconstruction assistance and do a better job of coordinating it. From 2001 to 2006, Canada spent $1.8 billion on military efforts and only $300 million on reconstruction. This is extremely unbalanced. Put simply, this is a ratio of $6 to $1. For every $6 spent on military activities and offensive action, $1 was spent on reconstruction and humanitarian aid.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553313"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the nature of our military activities must change. Everyone knows that we cannot provide assistance effectively without a minimum level of security. General Richards, the head of NATO forces there, is asking NATO countries for 2,500 more soldiers. Let me be clear: we will not succeed by repeatedly increasing the number of troops. We must remember that the priority in Afghanistan must be speeding up development and reconstruction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553314"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we must drastically change how we look at the opium problem. Afghanistan is the source of 90% of the world's heroin supply. While maintaining our efforts against drug traffickers, we must propose an alternative to Afghan farmers by helping them establish programs for new crops, to grow something other than poppies, and we must help them build infrastructures such as roads, wells, public markets and hospitals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553315"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social development in Afghanistan is appalling. In 2004, this country was ranked 173rd out of 178 countries listed on the human development index.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553316"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of today's debate is to clarify the situation with respect to the coalition member countries and NATO member countries, as well as Canada's role after 2009. Like the people of Canada and Quebec, those countries have the right to know the issues and repercussions involved in the active participation of the armed forces and to demand that, as quickly as possible, Canadian operations focus more on humanitarian aid, social development and peacekeeping. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553317"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the mandates and methods used by the armed forces, our soldiers must not be like warriors or vigilantes. Rather, they should be considered more as agents of peace and reconstruction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553318"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is to redefine the mandate of our soldiers in Afghanistan. We must be able to measure the progress made. From that perspective, if we cannot quantify the progress, it becomes clear that public opinion will focus only on the loss of human life we are suffering.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553319"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebeckers and Canadians are willing to send troops to Afghanistan, but only if their safety can be ensured. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553320"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the government must establish precise timeframes to rebalance the mission, and ensure that our soldiers have the resources they need to carry out reconstruction and security work in the field.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1535"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535">(1535)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para553321"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, on behalf of the Bloc Québécois, I would like to remind the House that, if the balance of this mission is not restored, we will no longer be able to support an operation that is doomed to failure.</div>

    </p><a name="Para553327"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mission has changed. As the hon. member from the government said, we are there to remove al-Qaeda. If we want to remove al-Qaeda, we should be dealing with Pakistan, the Horn of Africa and other areas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553328"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask my hon. colleague this. Why does the government ignore the components of the mission that are necessary for the mission's success? Why does the government not call on President Bush and Prime Minister Blair to stop the eradication program for poppies? Why is it not calling Loya Jirga to bring forth the groups that are disaffected in Afghanistan and need to be included in the decision making process of the government? Why is it not investing in the Afghan national police, the judicial system, and a penal system to allow security to occur?</div>
    </p><a name="Para553329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless we have an adequate, competent judicial system, then we are never going to have security. Why does the government not stop this ink blot strategy which is only putting our troops into a meat grinder that is going to cause them to lose their lives?

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the five points in the motion brought forward by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79018,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79018&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Bourassa</A>, the defence critic, there are two points I will focus on. I wish to read them both, so that members and Canadians from coast to coast to coast can appreciate what I am about to say. The first is:</div>
    </p><a name="Para553338"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(1) whereas all Members of this House, whatever their disagreements may be about the mission in Afghanistan, support the courageous men and women of the Canadian Forces;</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para553339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is:</div>
    </p><a name="Para553340"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(3) whereas it is incumbent upon Canada to provide adequate notice to the other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) of our intentions beyond that date;</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para553341"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first point, there is no question that each and every member in this honourable chamber and each and every Canadian support our military, not only our men and women who serve in missions abroad, for example in Afghanistan or other missions that they are engaged in today, but the men and women who do very important work here in Canada as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553342"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a member from whichever party asks a question, whether it be in committee or in this honourable House or outside, that any member would have the audacity to take the position that the member asking the question does not support our military is shameful and uncalled for. I would go as far as to say it is unpatriotic. We are asking them to make sure that in whatever is being undertaken, whether it is procurement of equipment, whether it is upholding our three D policy of defence, development and diplomacy, we are indeed doing the right thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sit on the defence committee. The committee invites various representatives to brief us on an ongoing basis to keep us up to date on what is happening, to make sure that the policy the government has laid out is being carried out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553344"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say to each and every member that even during question period when questions are asked, and I have heard it from my constituents and from Canadians in general, it is not wise to put up what have been described as Bush tactics. President Bush got away with it for six or seven years by using those tactics, but thank God the American people finally woke up and realized that that was not going to play out any more.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, on the second point in terms of our NATO commitment to Afghanistan, today the leader of the Liberal Party put it in perspective when he talked about clarity, and who better to talk about clarity than the person who brought clarity to this country and peace and harmony through his legislation. Today what he is asking and what I am asking and what I think the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79018,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79018&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Bourassa</A> is asking for is clarity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been frustrating to ask questions over and over again of the new Conservative government, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78765,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78765&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of National Defence</A>. The rebuttals have been so ambiguous that we are being asked by our constituents to get a straight answer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, recently the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78765,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78765&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of National Defence</A> was on <i>Question Period</i> on television. When he was asked a question, he talked about 2010. The military experts who have come before our committee know better than we do, and they have said repeatedly that this is not a four, five, seven or 10 year mission. This mission is going to be anywhere between 20 years to 25 years. Nobody is questioning that.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1545"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545">(1545)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para553348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go back to May 2006. Today Canadians are asking what the compelling reason was to bring forward and debate for six hours a motion to extend the mission for an additional two years when the mission as we will recall had just commenced. We were two months into that mission. It is the same as someone who buys a car, drives it for a month, and before it is even broken in, says that he is going to trade it in because it is no good when he has not even put 500 kilometres on it yet.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mission started. We had not even arrived there. We had not even set up yet and all of a sudden for no apparent reason, and we have not been told the reason to this very day, there was a proposal in the House to extend the mission for an additional two years. Fine, but I have a problem with that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553350"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister and the committee went to Slovenia to the NATO meeting. The minister went there and literally begged the NATO partners and all the allies to lift the so-called caveats. This is what is most upsetting because we committed our men and women to an extension to 2009 without setting the terms of engagement before that commitment. It was a bad deal. Had we known then what the terms of engagement were, who knows, maybe we would have committed our men and women for the additional two years, but there were no terms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After we made the commitment, all of a sudden we discovered there were these so-called caveats where other nations that are involved cannot move their troops. They say that the Canadians can take care of the hot spots, no problem. When we ask them for support they say, “There are these caveats. We cannot really go down. We cannot really participate”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier today the parliamentary secretary referred to conflicts in the past. The Conservative whip talked about the second world war and how we all engaged in the second world war. My father did as well. Many members' fathers and mothers participated in those major conflicts, but they engaged in those conflicts together. It was one collective effort. They did not stand up and say, “I am going to go fight over here”, or “I am going to stay over there”. That was not the strategy then. This is very upsetting to me. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> today in question period referred to it in answer to a question. He said that the people of Afghanistan want us to be there. Of course they want us to be there. In Cyprus they want us to be there. In Bosnia-Herzegovina they want us to be there. In Kosovo they want us to be there. In Darfur they want us to be there. They want Canadians to be in every trouble spot because we have an excellent reputation. But we cannot be everywhere. They also want the international community to do its fair share.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553354"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> said in answer to another question, “NATO is not asking us for a decision today”. That is a very good answer. NATO did not ask for a decision in May 2006. The big question Canadians have is who put that initiative forward. We are ordering equipment today for our military, tanks and helicopters for example, that are not to be delivered until 2009-10. Canadians are asking for clarity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553355"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the development side people have come before our committee. Today people talked about young men and women going to school. When I hear that it pleases me very much. We also heard President Karzai in an interview with Peter Mansbridge on television during his visit say in his own words that this year 200,000 fewer students are attending school. That is not coming from any politician. That is coming right from President Karzai.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553356"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development is not really where it should be. We must shut down that poppy growing area. We also found out in committee that President Karzai has apparently been negotiating with the Taliban. The Conservative Party says, “We are not going to deal with these terrorists. We are not going to deal with the Taliban”. President Karzai is dealing with them at the cost of Canadian blood, and I do not accept that. We have to get that straight.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Taliban has new equipment, ground to air missiles, we have been told in committee. Where is the Taliban finding the funds to buy this equipment? I believe that if we cut the head, the body will fall. We have to cut off the Taliban's ability to secure funds because it is through these funds that they are buying the equipment that is killing our men and women. We have to concentrate on that.</div>

I agree that there is a great need for clarity in this debate. It is important for Canadians to understand that it is possible to support the troops profoundly but not support this futile failing mission. That point needs to be made from the start.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553359"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would appreciate it if the member could clarify the Liberal position. It seems to me that the Liberals want to attack the government over the mismanagement of the war, and I would have to agree that it is being mismanaged by continuing to put our young soldiers into harm's way in a futile failing mission. Yet the Liberals are saying it is okay to continue for another two years in this futile failing effort rather than use the experience, the resources and the knowledge that we have as peace negotiators to bring parties together, to bring neighbouring countries together to look at how peace can be achieved. Even Chris Alexander, Canada's former ambassador to Afghanistan and now the leading UN official in Afghanistan, says it is the absence of peace that is fuelling further conflict. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We simply want to know if the government is going to keep that commitment, or if it is going to extend it beyond 2009.

    </p><a name="Para553368"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without repeating it, the motion very clearly specifies that we do support our troops. It is not a question of not supporting them. It is a question of clarity in terms of our disengagement from that mission, nothing more, nothing less. We support our military. We want to make sure our military has the right equipment. We are just asking for clarity in terms of exit time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553369"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of development, we all agree. It is not just Canada that is in Afghanistan. Before Canada went in to take its share of the burden, there were other players. Surely NATO does not work with overnight decisions. It knew after 2007 who was going in. There was a plan. We simply allowed it to extend that by extending our mission to 2009. If there is no planning right now as to what it is going to do post-2009, then NATO has a problem.</div>

The men and women of the Canadian Forces and our civilian personnel are continuing to earn our respect and pride. However, we are failing in our responsibilities to them. We do not constantly seek to evaluate the wider picture in terms of the current NATO policies and programs, as our parliamentary colleagues across the world are doing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553371"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that NATO's objective of building conditions so the Afghan people can enjoy a representative government and self-sustaining peace and security is honourable but we cannot shy away from the realities of the daunting tasks faced by our troops and personnel in Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553372"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, Canada sought to utilize the 3D model in Afghanistan: defence, diplomacy and development. Being the critic for CIDA, today I want to speak to the latter, development, and voice my concerns in common with legislatures from other forces and other nations about where we are with development assistance in Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553373"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know from committee testimony and from the antics in the House that the Conservative government is keen to distract attention and divert scrutiny when it comes to the Afghan mission. Members who dare to exhibit some concern, the Conservatives call them a Taliban lover.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553374"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot deny that there has been some progress in Afghanistan. Some roads, hospitals and schools have been built and more women are going to school. Education in the political process is taking place and security sector reform has helped in the process of reconstituting the army and the police force. NATO's and Canada's approach to providing long term security and stability requires a comprehensive strategy that encompasses reconstruction and development, as well as military operations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553375"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the coalition, Canada included, has taken on a mammoth task. We need to know that we have the equation correct in determining the proper mix between civilian and military activities. It is critical that we know that Canadian development aid is going to do the utmost before any possible pullout in 2009.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553376"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we need to be doing more to extend our developmental footprint before 2009 rolls around? Should we not look, at the very least, to match our military expenditures in Afghanistan with development assistance dollars?</div>
    </p><a name="Para553377"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former Afghan finance minister, now advisor to Karzai, has recently said that Afghanistan has reached a tipping point, warning that the population could turn against the international community if the economy and access to housing, employment and basic services are not improved. This sentiment has been echoed by Dr. Abdullah, a former Afghan foreign minister, saying that the Afghan people will not remain patient forever.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553378"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afghanistan remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Five years after the international community came to Afghanistan, only 6% of Afghans have electricity. It has been estimated by the UN Refugee Agency that there are 130,000 internally displaced people, although that figure may be higher given the food and security problems in the south at present. We have not been able to address essential needs, including sustainable health clinics, sustainable provision of clean water and sanitation across the board.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553379"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afghanistan is the largest recipient of Canadian development assistance at present, with nearly $1 billion pledged up to 2011, but we need to do the job before 2009. The government, in playing with smoke and mirrors, recently announced $200 million in reconstruction and development funds, which in reality were part of the existing pledge. However, the international community's spending per capita on development assistance is significantly lower than what was spent in Bosnia. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553380"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Afghan government is limited in its capability to spend this assistance and, of the vast majority of aid set aside for Afghanistan, nearly 83% is spent by the international community on its projects.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600">(1600)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para553381"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of donors chasing a variety of objectives, tying up aid and failing to coordinate, too often has a negative effect on a country's institutional capacity. It is even more negative when it is a fragile state like Afghanistan. Canada must pursue a strategy that is focused, with the real needs of the Afghan people in mind, and it must be coordinated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553382"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about the Kandahar province, which, in common with the other southern provinces, is teaching the international community that unless we can deliver services and provide protection to the civilian population, just the military operation alone will not suffice. It has also illustrated the major difficulty in the NATO mission tasking security cannot be achieved without development and yet development cannot be implemented without security. They go hand in hand.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553383"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where NATO has not been able to extend effective governance away from the major urban centres, such as Kabul and Kandahar, the threat of renewed violence will always be there. Southern Afghanistan continues to be affected by extreme poverty and has recently suffered from drought. The system of food aid distribution has been erratic at best.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553384"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a real concern that the local disillusionment with ISAF troops may help to fuel a grassroots insurgency. Mr. Seth Jones with Rand corps, after two weeks in Kandahar, has claimed that while Kandahar city and two other districts are seeing reconstruction, virtually nothing else is taking place in the rest of Kandahar province, mainly as a result of the security situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553385"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ensure that our troops' safety is not jeopardized by a lack of impact of Canada's broader aid development policies that must address the real needs of the Afghan people, nor that a weakness in the reconstruction effort prevents the consolidation of tactical gains, as recently pointed out by Dr. Rubin in the journal of the council on foreign relations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553386"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sterling work has been done by our PRT in Kandahar province but let us not forget that PRTs are military organizations, not development organizations. They are designed to deliver quick impact projects, not to replace sustained long term development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553387"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualifying efficiency in terms of the total amount of dollars spent and the number of projects completed has been problematic for some of the other PRT teams and we must be cautious not to fall into the same trap in deciding on the real impact of the work that we have already done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553388"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our developmental efforts in Afghanistan cannot be undertaken with just our own priorities and poll numbers in mind, as the government seems to believe. An effective developmental assistance program is about addressing Afghan's real needs, not what sells a story.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553389"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of work still needs to be done in Afghanistan before 2009 and Canadian troops have already demonstrated a thousand times over their dedication, professionalism and cool-headedness under the most difficult situations. It is time the government really ramped up Canada's developmental assistance program and ensured that the Canadian mission is 100% successful.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada and many countries learned this from the Marshall Plan after World War II.

Our government has been very clear that we are committed to that mission to February 2009. The reason we are committed to that mission in southern Afghanistan is because it is important for the stability of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, the government that President Karzai is heading. It is very important that we remain engaged in that theatre to ensure the stability of that government. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond that date, our government has also indicated that we have taken no decisions. In the fullness of time, based on debates like this in the House and on other debates, the government will take a decision. In the fullness of time, we will have a debate on this in the House.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is in Afghanistan, together with more than three dozen other countries, as part of the UN-authorized international security assistance force.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also securing the safety of Canadian citizens at home and abroad. After September 11, 2001, Canada acted in accordance with article 51 of the charter of the United Nations in the exercise of our individual and collective right of self-defence. The United Nations Security Council recognized this right in resolution 1368, passed on September 12, 2001. However, the Afghanistan mission is about much more than that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Canadian forces are in Afghanistan at the request of the Afghan government. We have a moral duty to support them. Life for ordinary citizens in Afghanistan is very difficult. In the south, they face the worst kind of hardships and lack the most basic government services. Their communities lack proper education and health care, and public infrastructure is damaged or non-existent. Moreover, they live under threat from groups of violent extremists. Social and economic development for Afghan people cannot be achieved while these conditions remain.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our troops, diplomats, police and development workers are working hard alongside our allies to help the Afghan people realize their hopes for a stable and secure future for themselves and for their families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553412"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of our Canadian Forces, an integrated and multidimensional approach, is something understood very well by our troops. As difficult as the job is, our men and women in uniform have met the people. They have seen the children. They know the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553413"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond security operations, they know that our objectives of development and reconstruction are vital to success. Our men and women in uniform see great promise for the future of these people, especially the children. They believe, as all Canadians should, that supporting the democratically-elected government of Afghanistan is the best way to ensure that all Afghans can enjoy the basic rights and freedoms that we enjoy in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553414"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to pay tribute to the men and women of our Canadian Forces, especially those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of our country and our mission in Afghanistan. They come from places like Owen Sound, New Glasgow, Dalmeny, Comox and Montreal; places just down the road; places a few hours away; and places easily found on a map.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553415"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were soldiers who believed in our mission, like all of the Canadian Forces members serving in Afghanistan. They made a difference in places like Panjwai, Daman, Spin Buldak, Ghorak, Khakrez and Kandahar City.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553416"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These soldiers helped in ensuring that Afghanistan never again slides into the clutches of the Taliban, or those like it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553417"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These soldiers gave their lives to stabilize and rebuild a country that has known nothing but war for more than 20 years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553418"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ensure that they did not die in vain.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553419"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They and their comrades in Kandahar today are leaving behind a proud legacy for the Afghan people: a legacy of hope and confidence in the future of Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553420"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roads, schools, a reliable police force, a sanitary waste management system, clean water, toys for the children are just a few examples of the numerous and many projects these men and women have helped to accomplish; all huge gifts to the Afghan people; all things many of us take for granted in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553421"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reconstruction and development in Afghanistan are Canada's fundamental goals and they remain a high priority for our government. Canadian troops are making it difficult for Taliban extremists to gain the upper hand. But all of this may be put at risk if Canada signals that it wants to withdraw from the military mission prematurely.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553422"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our military is supporting Afghan objectives by building a safe and secure environment which is essential for long-lasting development. Thanks to our troops and other committed Canadians, we are making significant progress in Afghanistan, but we are not finished yet.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615">(1615)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para553423"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our goals are simple. They have been outlined many times and they are consistent with the Afghanistan compact. When Afghanistan and its democratic government are stabilized and able to independently handle domestic security concerns, and when the terrorists and their local support networks are no longer a destabilizing threat to Afghanistan, we will know that we have succeeded.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553424"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are moving toward these goals. Canada has contributed greatly to Afghan progress so far and Canadians should be proud of our reconstruction efforts. We have truly broken new ground in our approach to development. Our provincial reconstruction team is helping to reinforce the authority of the Afghan government in Kandahar province. It is assisting in the stabilization and development of the region and it is monitoring security, promoting Afghan government policies and priorities with local authorities, and facilitating security sector reforms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553425"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the PRT cannot do its work without the security operations that are still being carried out to help stabilize the Kandahar region. Addressing the root conditions of instability is our focus. Our goal is to help the Afghan people rebuild their country so that they can govern and protect themselves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553426"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our progress in the Kandahar region over the last year has laid the groundwork for continued improvement. Our forces and their Afghan partners are now patrolling in areas previously considered Taliban sanctuaries, confronting the Taliban where it has not previously been challenged. Our operations in the Pashmull and Panjwai areas have also planted vital seeds of development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553427"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are building Afghanistan development zones in strategic areas, pockets of development from which future renewal can spread. We are helping to build up the Afghan national security forces through our work at the national training centre, through combined operations with the Afghan authorities, and through initiatives such as our operational mentoring and liaison teams.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553428"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily, Canadian men and women are meeting ordinary, hard-working and peace-loving Afghans. They are conducting meetings with elders, delivering development aid and making a difference in the everyday lives of Afghans. Importantly, they are building Afghan domestic capacity and helping us move closer to our ultimate objective of a fully independent and stable Afghanistan. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553429"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Foreign Affairs Canada is making a profound contribution in promoting Afghan governance. Our diplomats are providing Afghan officials with advice on a range of key issues such as promoting and protecting human rights, security sector reform, and building sound international institutions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553430"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CIDA is also working hard to assist the government of Afghanistan. It is continuing to deliver on Canada's aid commitments in Kandahar and across the country. Canadian police officers are building the capacity of their Afghan counterparts. They are monitoring, advising, mentoring and providing much needed training.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553431"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Canadian, I am very proud of all of our country's efforts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553432"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to conclude by reminding this House how, once again, our Canadian Forces have stepped to the forefront to protect Canadian interests, to promote our values and to help Afghanistan. Our soldiers are among the best in the world and they are making progress in one of the most volatile regions of Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553433"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the Canadian Forces finished with the job we have asked them to do in Afghanistan? The answer is: not yet. Will they be finished on February 28, 2009? It is too early to tell.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553434"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We brought forward a motion to the House of Commons to extend the current Afghan mission to February 2009. The government has been clear that, if it were to seek further extension, it would come to Parliament to do that, and that remains our position.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553435"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has invested much in this mission. We have another two years remaining in our commitment, two years of challenges, two years to make more progress, and two years of lighting beacons of renewal in the harsh landscape of a war-torn country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553436"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is not the time to turn tail and run. Now is the time to remember Canada's commitment and the reasons behind it.</div>

They certainly reflect the kind of dialogue that is coming out of the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553438"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to go back a little bit to after 9/11 when we originally went to Afghanistan. We went there to remove al-Qaeda. We went there to remove in part the Taliban. We were successful to a degree certainly in removing al-Qaeda.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553439"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that in the south where our troops are right now, in the area of Pashtun tribal lands, is an area that has never been able to be tamed by western forces. That is the concern that I have.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553440"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a military base in my riding and our hearts go out to the families as well as our deep appreciation to the Canadian Forces members who are doing an extraordinary job there and to the families who support them. They have our undying love, appreciation and gratitude for their courageous work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553441"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my fear is that what we have done is we have put our troops in an area that is very different from Kabul in the north. The Pashtun tribal lands that go into Pakistan, where in fact the Taliban's bases are, is a situation that we cannot win. We are fighting an insurgency that has its bases outside the country with which we are dealing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553442"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the insurgents are going to use and have been using to kill our troops are the IEDs, the suicide bombers and the snipers. We are fighting an unconventional war with conventional means. We will lose. We are putting our troops into a meat grinder without giving them the political component parts that are necessary for their success.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553443"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask the member this. Would a better solution not be to take our troops back, stop the ink blot strategy, put our troops in and just use them to remove Taliban forces if they are coming in en masse, while enabling an increased ability--</div>

    </p><a name="Para553446"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member, of course, is clearly coming from the Liberal perspective. To point it out and be clear, the Liberal perspective was to commit our troops to Afghanistan back in 2001 or 2002 and there have been several extensions from Liberal governments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553447"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many constituents came to me during the last election campaign and said it is unfortunate that our Canadian troops are in the southern part of Afghanistan. They said the reason they were in the southern part of Afghanistan is because when we had to go to renew, their suspicion was that the previous Prime Minister, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A> at the time, dithered, dodged and delayed. When it came time for the government to actually make a decision, it was not discussed in the House but just made. There was no vote, no debate on that particular issue. When that decision was made, all that was left was Kandahar. That is what my constituents are telling me.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553448"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they are also telling me is that it is not time to turn tail and run. The Liberals seem to think that falling back, along with all the other nations that are not willing to send their troops in and that have caveats on their troops, is the way to lead the way to a brighter future for the people of Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553449"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we would be fall back, retreat and lead from the sidelines and tell the others to go and we will stand back. We will not do anything. We will not take the lead on this. This is not the heritage--</div>

    </p><a name="Para553460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to start by reminding everyone that this government committed to remaining in Afghanistan until February 2009. We have not made any commitments beyond that. However, announcing a definite withdrawal date for our troops today would hurt the mission and the work we are doing to rebuild the country.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para553461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We brought a motion forward to the House of Commons to extend the current Afghan mission to February 2009. The government has been clear that if it were to seek a further extension it would come to Parliament to do that, and that remains our position.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the time comes to make a decision, the government will consider many factors. We will do just that, but this motion today from the opposition is in fact a reckless motion that encourages our foes and could lead to more intensive action against our troops.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553463"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to pick up on a few of the things that I have heard today. The leader of the official opposition said that this motion is about the good of Afghanistan and the good of Canada's troops. In fact, this motion puts exactly that good in jeopardy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this motion in fact would do is empower the Taliban and tell the people of Afghanistan that we will not be there for them in their most basic need: physical security. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard a member of the NDP quote Winston Churchill saying that it is better to jaw-jaw than to war-war, and I do not disagree. Churchill said many other insightful things. He also said that an appeaser is one who feeds an alligator hoping that it will eat him last. The Taliban is an alligator. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winston Churchill was also the leader who had the courage and determination to take on the alligator of Naziism, without time limit, until the mission was accomplished. What he certainly did not do was invite the enemy into the cabinet war rooms or telegraph allied strategy and timelines.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Chief Government Whip, was criticized for reminding the House about some of that history. The Liberals countered with talk about caveats. There are no caveats to evil. There is simply evil.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is only one way to deal with evil. That way is not the Pollyannaish approach to foreign policy and defence espoused by the NDP, which suggests that the Taliban may not really be evil at heart and we just do not understand them. That is right up there with the utterly idiotic soft power approach to foreign policy engaged in by former Liberal minister of foreign affairs Lloyd Axworthy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was that misguided ideology of soft power that resulted in the decade of darkness and decimation that the Canadian Forces underwent at the hands of the party opposite. This government is turning that situation around for the benefit of the people of Canada, the people of Afghanistan, our allies, and the brave men and women of the Canadian Forces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not doubt the sincerity of all members of the House. What I do question is their grasp of some of the realities of military and foreign affairs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have talked about many things today that are indeed important, such as reconstruction, development and so on. However, the essence of this motion is about the defence portion of this mission.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know there are members of the House who are well read on the subject of warfare through authors such as Sun Tzu and von Clausewitz. I am pretty sure the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78667,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78667&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Etobicoke—Lakeshore</A> is one of them. There are many quotes by the member that show he is well read in that area and that he cannot possibly support this motion in his heart.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that we do not do in warfare is telegraph our intentions to the enemy. No matter what the opposition wants to believe, that does empower the enemy and it does put our men and women at greater risk. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, there is planning happening. We have heard various dates tossed around. Planning is a constant in any military organization. In any government organization, planning is a constant. Any organization that fails to plan is in fact planning to fail.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP also talked about meaningful peace building, reconstruction and development and suggested that somehow this is not what is happening. That is what is happening.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is slower than we would like and it is painful, but it is happening, bearing in mind that we are in one of the toughest areas in the entire country, which has 34 provinces, in 28 of which, relatively speaking, we have peace, security, development and so on. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has drawn the tough job of doing that in Kandahar. We do that job because, frankly, our people are the best and our equipment is the best. Development is happening and it is happening only because of the defence component of the mission that Canada is contributing to so strongly. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind hon. members that everything that every member of the Canadian Forces does every single day is about peace. Members can call it what they want, but the ultimate aim of everything they do is peace.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Chief Government Whip, I was also privileged to spend Christmas outside the wire in the Panjwai district of Afghanistan. One of the most meaningful experiences of my life was sitting up on Christmas Eve with Chief of the Defence Staff General Rick Hillier at a place called Ma'sum Ghar, out where the Taliban roam, smoking a cigar and talking about war and peace and people in politics.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630">(1630)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para553480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that General Hillier and everybody there would rather have been at home with their families at Christmas. There is no question that everybody knew why they were there. They knew it was important and they were getting on with the job.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spent about 30 hours outside the wire, travelling the roads in convoy in LAV IIIs and Nyalas. We saw markets open. We saw children playing. We saw women going about their business. Markets are not like the Byward Market here, but for those Afghanis, that was a sense of normalcy. It was a bit of real life. It was only happening because our people were there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553482"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent a lot of time at the garrison in Edmonton. I spent a lot of time meeting flights coming back with wounded or just with people rotating back from the mission in Afghanistan. I have talked to families. I have talked to families who have lost people over there. They get it. They understand why the military part of the mission is so essential. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People talk about the emphasis on military versus reconstruction and so on, and they use simplistic numbers, saying there are 1,200 members of the battle group and only 350 members or whatever in the PRT. It is not as simple as a one for one for one split. There are jobs to be done and the jobs are getting done, but none of those jobs will get done without the basic defence and basic security part of the mission. We are making progress. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada also has a responsibility. At the United Nations, the former Liberal prime minister talked about the responsibility to protect and we agree with that. Countries like Canada do have a responsibility to protect other nations and other peoples that cannot protect themselves. They have a responsibility to join with other nations, as we have done in the 37 nation alliance that is in Afghanistan right now. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just point out to members that one of those 37 nations is in fact Croatia. It was not that long ago that we were helping Croatia out of a difficult situation. Maybe if we get this right, along with our allies, just maybe in five years or 10 years Afghanistan will be a member of an alliance that is helping another country to keep from becoming a failed state.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can guarantee success in any mission. No one can guarantee that any mission is going to be done by any date. We did not do that in 1914 or 1939 or in 1950 in Korea. We joined together with other peace-loving countries, other western liberal democracies, to get a job done for the benefit of people in another country who could not get the job done for themselves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada has always taken on these responsibilities and I am proud of that as a Canadian. That does not mean it is easy. Doing the right thing is never easy, but it is still the right thing to do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our personnel are playing an important role in Afghanistan. They are helping to ensure that the country becomes secure so that reconstruction and economic development can take place. The government is committed to remaining in southern Afghanistan until February 2009. We have not made any commitments beyond that date and it is premature to do so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553489"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, there are any number of plans out there on any number of shelves. It does not mean that the plans are going to be carried out, but we do have to plan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553490"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that to announce a departure date for our troops today would be detrimental to the mission. It would be detrimental to the welfare of our Canadian Forces men and women. It would certainly be detrimental to the benefit of the Afghan people we are trying to help.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex Morrison, president of the Canadian Institute of Strategic Studies, put it strongly when he said that “placing a definite withdrawal date would place the lives of our soldiers in danger”. At the appropriate time the government will decide whether to renew our military contribution to the multinational mission, whether to change it or whether to withdraw altogether, but it will come back to the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the essence of the motion: we cannot empower the enemy by saying that as of this date we are just going to close up shop from a very difficult mission and turn it over.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not going to do that. Canada will not abandon its responsibilities to Canadians and to people in countries around the world who are counting on us to live up to our responsibility to protect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553494"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion puts Canadians and Afghans at risk and should be defeated.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If everything was that definite, we probably would not get there in the first place, but we get there because of people like the Taliban and other terrorist organizations or national organizations around the world that prey on their own people.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002, therefore, Canada went to Afghanistan under a UN mandate with 31 of our allies. For six months, roughly 800 Canadian soldiers joined the international coalition in Afghanistan to defeat the Taliban. This mission had a clearly defined purpose and a clear exit strategy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Taliban was overthrown, the international community had an obligation to remain in Afghanistan to help stabilize and rebuild the country, one of the poorest countries in the world devastated by 30 years of foreign invasions and civil wars, and thus came Operation ATHENA.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 2003 Prime Minister Chrétien decided that Canada would lead the International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF, in Kabul for one year. This was a multinational force, involving many countries, whose mission was to provide security in the capital to assist the newly created Afghan transitional authority and to help set the appropriate conditions for presidential and parliamentary elections. The Afghan elections took place successfully and peacefully, thanks in part to the assistance provided by Canada, and resulted in the election of President Hamid Karzai.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553517"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 2,000 Canadian troops on the ground and General Hillier commanding the 6,000 strong ISAF force, Canada's effort was at the time our most significant mission in decades. Our soldiers did an outstanding job earning the praise and respect of our allies and of all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the outset, the Chrétien government worked hard to secure a replacement nation for Canada once the one year ISAF mission ended. Consequently, in 2004 Turkey replaced Canada as the lead nation in ISAF. We were able to reduce our presence on the ground, remaining engaged with about 750 troops as well as a major development assistance contribution. At this time, Canada's commitment to Afghanistan became our largest bilateral development program in our history.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553519"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in 2003, with the support of the Afghan government, UN-NATO assumed responsibility for the ISAF mission. Shortly thereafter, NATO again, with the full support of the Afghan government, decided to expand its presence outside of Kabul and gradually expanded its involvement for reconstruction and security throughout all Afghanistan. Thus were born the provincial reconstruction teams, or PRTs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553520"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the NATO expansion, the previous government, led by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A>, decided to establish a provincial reconstruction team of roughly 250 personnel in Kandahar province. Many countries have PRTs throughout Afghanistan. Their mandate is to establish the authority of the Afghan government throughout the country and to assist in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553521"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the PRT, the previous government committed a task force of about 1,000 troops to Kandahar for one year, from February 2006 to February 2007, to work with our allies to provide security in this dangerous region and to facilitate the transition from a U.S.-led mission to a NATO-led one.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553522"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key objective of this mission was first and foremost reconstruction and establishing security, recognizing that we would be undertaking this crucial work in a dangerous region. The government was under no illusion this mission would be more dangerous than our previous engagements in Afghanistan, as was said repeatedly by the then ministers of defence and foreign affairs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553523"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Canada, NATO and the Americans had not anticipated how violent and dangerous Kandahar would become in 2006. Between January and May 2006, eight soldiers and one diplomat were killed. That contrasted sharply with the seven fatalities the Canadian Forces sustained in Afghanistan over the previous four years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553524"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By May, a mere three months after Canada's combat force went into Kandahar, the current government knew that we were facing a significant and violent insurgency, well beyond anything NATO had experienced in the past or for which it had planned. Before too long we saw that the Canadian effort in Kandahar had shifted from the original overriding objective of reconstruction to fighting a violent insurgency.</div>

    </p><a name="Para553526"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government made no prior effort to obtain assurances from the government of Pakistan, for instance, to secure its border with Afghanistan, across which the insurgents move with impunity. It received no assurances from our NATO allies to replace Canada at the end of our mission. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553527"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> said that this mission would not hinder Canada's ability to undertake peace support missions elsewhere, such as in Darfur or Haiti.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing—and I do not necessarily blame the government for this—the main objective of our mission in Afghanistan, which is the development and reconstruction of Afghanistan, is being neglected and is not being met.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we as the government make decisions on behalf of Canadians, we have to consider what Canadians want.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the multilateral forces are concerned, the will of the previous government, just like—I hope—that of the current government, was to participate in multilateral missions. The responsibilities are shared by a number of countries. After seven years, including three in Kandahar, Canada will have done its share, in our opinion. It will therefore be time for another member of the NATO sponsored multilateral mission or of the UN to replace Canada in Kandahar, if the presence of a force is still necessary.</div>

    </p><a name="Para553552"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members on this side of the House are calling on the government to offer clarity and certainty to the Canadian people when it comes to our military mission in Afghanistan. There are Conservatives on that side of the House who will argue that to even raise this debate, to even ask these types of questions, is not to support the troops. Nothing could be further from the truth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My riding of Labrador is a military riding in two senses. We have a major defence installation, 5 Wing Goose Bay, which has served the needs of Canada and our allies on both sides of the Atlantic since 1941. We also have numerous men and women in uniform in all three branches of the Canadian armed forces and many who have served overseas in Afghanistan, the Balkans and other international deployments over the years. Our broader community has been directly affected by our commitment as Canadians to serving in military missions overseas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past two weeks, as we all know, have been difficult for all of us, with nine Canadian servicemen losing their lives in the line of duty in Afghanistan. One of those was Private Kevin Kennedy, whose mother is from Wabush, Labrador. He is one of five soldiers from our province who has paid the ultimate price in service for the defence of Canada during the Afghanistan mission. On behalf of all Labrador constituents, I would like to extend my deepest condolences to the Kennedy family and to all those whom Private Kevin Kennedy touched in his life.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say with full confidence that the people of Labrador, who I represent, support our troops and hold our Canadian armed forces in the highest regard. At the same time, Labradorians and indeed all Canadians demand and deserve an open and respectful debate on Afghanistan and our future role in that country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an important principle of military policy in Canada and in all democratic nations that our armed forces are under civilian political responsibility. This means that the policy questions of what we expect our armed forces to do and how we expect them to carry out the tasks that Canadians require them to do are separate from day to day military operations. We can and should discuss policy without any fear of being smeared as not supporting our troops.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever we send our Canadian armed forces in the world, whether to Afghanistan or the Balkans in the 1990s, or on humanitarian missions such as the relief operations in the wake of the Asian tsunami or hurricane Katrina, Canadians are proud of our men and women in uniform and support them fully. However, that is and must be separate from the policy questions of what we as a country and as a society want our armed forces to do on our behalf.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also some who will falsely allege that by raising these questions is to be soft on terrorism. Again, nothing could be further from the truth. I remember very well the morning of September 11, 2001. We all remember the horror of what became the worst single terrorist plot in human history, with nearly 3,000 dead, 9,000 injured and countless lives changed forever. We also remember that this plot was carried out by al-Qaeda, which at the time enjoyed the support and safe haven offered to it by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why Canada, under the leadership of our former prime minister, Jean Chrétien, joined with the United States and our allies in a multinational effort to dismantle the Taliban regime, bring order to Afghanistan and to ensure that the country would no longer be a haven for international terrorism. That was a decision of a Liberal government and it was the right decision.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will never let it be said that we are soft on terrorism. When the world needed us, we were there and our record will stand the test of history. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that being said, there is no reason why we should not now, six years later, engage in a respectful and intelligent debate on what our role in Afghanistan should be in the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553562"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has committed to remaining in Afghanistan until February 2009 and we support that, but we also take the position that Canada needs to set out a firm date for our rotation out of Afghanistan, with our place, after nearly a decade, to be taken up by one of our NATO partners.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553563"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not a question of abandoning Afghanistan. We are committed to a multi-pronged approach to achieving progress for the people of Afghanistan. That includes military operations for the duration of our involvement in the Afghanistan mission. It also includes diplomacy, development assistance and support for Canadian NGOs who are at work in the country, and by every means at our disposal to build a civil society.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we must not let the remnants of the Taliban dictate our policy or, even as the governing Conservatives suggest, dictate the terms of our political debate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our long-standing parliamentary tradition, our Charter of Rights and Freedoms and our human rights laws demand respect for free speech and respectful debate. This is fundamental to our democratic society. It is not a sign of weakness that we can have this debate. It is a sign of strength. It is everything that the Taliban has fought against.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid this discussion, to avoid this conversation because of what the Taliban might read into it, because of whatever false hope they might derive from it, is to let ourselves become their puppets. It cannot happen and it will not happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553567"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These open debates make our democratic institutions such powerful examples for the world and for our friends in the fledgling Afghan democracy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553568"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afghanistan, with international support, including that of the Government of Canada and with the Canadian armed forces, have made progress since the fall of 2001 and the fall of the Taliban regime. We are proud of our achievements and we stand in full support of what our Canadian armed forces have achieved on the ground in Afghanistan. We support them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553569"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continue to support them even as we begin the rational and constructive process of discussing how Canada will disengage, just as we have done so in our other overseas deployments since the second world war.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553570"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not weakness to begin this policy discussion. It is not softness. It is strength. It is the strength of our democracy and the image of Canada we seek to project around the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553571"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are proud of our record in Afghanistan and will remain proud, even as we work to transition our military responsibilities, and as we seek to ensure a robust continued Canadian involvement in Afghanistan through our other branches of the Canadian government and other instruments of foreign policy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives will try to score crass political points with this matter but they will fail, just as they have failed in their other shameful attempts to politicize our Canadian armed forces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553573"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last election campaign, for example, they made an astounding variety of political promises to Goose Bay in my riding, promises they are unable to provide and increasingly unwilling to keep.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553574"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not just Goose Bay. They made similar promises on the backs of the Canadian armed forces and the Department of National Defence in St. John's, Comox, Bagotville, Trenton, Gagetown, Cold Lake, Iqaluit and many other communities across this country. The Conservatives wrote political IOUs on DND's account which they cannot cash. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553575"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as in the Afghanistan debate, the Conservatives were shameful and shameless in their willingness to use the Canadian military as a political pawn. We cannot allow that to happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553576"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our discussions as a Parliament, as a government and as Canadians on military matters must be civil and respectful. It is not unpatriotic, it is not disrespectful of our troops and it is not failing to support them to engage in these debates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553577"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our democratic principles and the fundamental principle of civilian political responsibility for our military demand that we must engage in this debate. Again, we support our troops.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553578"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ask these questions and contemplate these decisions without fear that our patriotism or respect for the Canadian armed forces would ever be questioned. Anything less would be disrespectful of the freedom and liberty that 54 Canadians have died for in the line of duty and what they have died for in building and defending Afghanistan. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553579"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand in favour of this motion.</div>

They keep saying over and over that they support the troops and that is great. They are the ones who actually sent the troops over there in the first place. I suppose their willingness now to say that we are going to pull them out and give notice right now is a contradiction, at least in my mind.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553581"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Sunday I was at the Holocaust memorial remembrance. It impressed me to see the pain that those people are feeling a generation or two after the events of the Holocaust.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in Afghanistan right now are experiencing the same thing. I believe that we have an obligation and, indeed, even a privilege, as our troops did in World War II, to go there and to stand between victims and their oppressors. The tyrannical Taliban regime needs to be wiped out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the Liberals and that member in particular justify even contemplating pulling out until the job is done? We need to ensure we are focused on the task, not on some arbitrary date on which we are simply going to say that we are pulling out. That would be to admit defeat in advance. In fact, I believe it would be, in a sense, planning that defeat and we ought not to do that.</div>

It was the Conservatives who received the consent of the House to stay until February 2009. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553585"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the debate on that motion they made comments about why we should be there until 2009. It was definitive in their minds that we would be there until 2009. It was not until February 2010 or February 2011. The Conservatives put a motion before the House that said we want to extend the mission until February 2009.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will never forget standing on the tarmac in Kandahar surrounded by troops, courageous men and women, who are doing what they have been asked and assigned to do on behalf of Canadians as members of the Canadian armed forces. They continue to do what is being asked of them to this day. A very tragic number of them have lost their lives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me make it clear, as I once again issue a plea, that we understand we have to commit to participation in a comprehensive peace process. I issue the plea for the government to understand that if it continues to say that every Taliban is evil and the enemy and must be exterminated, it is going to continue to drive people into the arms of the Taliban as the loved ones of civilians, men, women and children, are killed in the attempt to defeat the Taliban. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case has been made again and again by many with much broader experience than I that we must launch a comprehensive peace process, understanding that we must reach out to the moderate Taliban. We must understand that we will drive people into the arms of the Taliban if we continue to kill civilians, if we continue to ignore the fact that babies die because they are starving because we are directing more and more of our resources into expensive military equipment. Instead we should understand that the way to rebuild the lives of people in Afghanistan, which surely is what our commitment is supposed to be about, is to do what needs to be done to improve life conditions in that country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are so out of balance and we have so lost sight of that needing to be the path to peace that I and my colleagues cannot possibly commit to what the Liberals are proposing today, that we continue with two years of the flawed failing strategy that is condemned to fail in the mission.</div>

Why did the minister wait for months before investigating these reports?</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para553628"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister had the gall to say:</div>
    </p><a name="Para553629"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>--all these various issues are under investigation. When the results come out, we will all learn the truth.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para553630"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my supplementary, I made it very clear that I did not ask “how many investigations there were”. I asked the minister “why it took him so long to start the investigations” when it was clear, under his department's policies, that he was informed that Canadian Forces had taken Afghan individuals, detained them, and had handed them over.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553631"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief of the Defence Staff submits reports directly to the minister about the transfer of Afghan detainees and about the health of these detainees. However, it took a complaint from an Ottawa professor to the Military Police Complaints Commission about the allegations of abuses allegedly suffered by Afghan detainees captured in 2006 to force an investigation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question, again, is why, having been briefed about the transfer of Afghan detainees and about the health of those detainees, did it take the minister so long before an investigation was launched? Why did it take a complaint from an Ottawa professor to the Military Police Complaints Commission before an investigation was launched? We all know that at one point DND attempted to block that investigation. There is a letter to that effect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot believe that the Conservative government, which prides itself on its so-called transparency and accountability, would not immediately institute an investigation as soon as the minister had received the report about the transfer of the Afghan detainees and about their health. That is the first thing. That is lesson A. That is A, B, C. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing is that we already know that the minister has had to apologize to this House for misleading it. He had to stand in this House for misleading the House. It is shameful behaviour for a minister to mislead the House. Thankfully, he had sufficient honour to acknowledge that he misled the House and to apologize for it and correct the record.</div>

This includes helping it improve its justice and security system as well as its detention system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553637"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with this, the Government of Canada supports the principle that the Afghan authority should be responsible for handling detainees captured in its sovereign territory. Canada's policy to transfer detainees captured in Afghanistan to Afghan authorities is consistent with this principle.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553638"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is Canadian policy to treat all detainees in accordance with the standards set out in the third Geneva convention, regardless of their status.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553639"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protection of human rights is a central value to all Canadians and our government's commitment is to ensure it is upheld no matter where our forces serve.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553640"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2005 Canada and the government of Afghanistan signed an arrangement which sets out general policy on the treatment and transfer of detainees, as well as notification procedures. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553641"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, the arrangement provides that the Afghan authorities will accept detainees who have been detained by the Canadian Forces and will be responsible for maintaining and safeguarding them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553642"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada and Afghanistan will treat detainees in accordance with the standards set out in the third Geneva convention which provides for humane treatment as well as protection against violence, intimidation, reprisals and other unlawful acts. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553643"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afghanistan and Canada will notify the International Committee of the Red Cross through appropriate national channels upon transferring a detainee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553644"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The International Committee of the Red Cross has the right to visit detainees at any time while they are in the custody of the Canadian Forces or Afghanistan. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553645"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once detainees are transferred to them, the Afghan authorities are responsible for maintaining and safeguarding detainees transferred to them and for ensuring the detainees are provided the protections of the humane treatment standards set out in the third Geneva convention. We fully expect the government of Afghanistan to live up to these expectations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553646"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being made aware of the allegations of abuse, the Canadian Forces launched a criminal investigation and a board of inquiry. Since then, two other investigations by the Military Police Complaints Commission have been opened. Therefore, there are three investigations and one inquiry into the treatment of detainees in Afghanistan ongoing at this time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553647"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the three investigations, one is an independent police investigation being conducted by the National Investigation Service, and two investigations are being conducted by the Military Police Complaints Commission, an independent oversight body. There is also an internal Canadian Forces board of inquiry. In addition, the matter is before the federal court.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553648"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigations and the inquiry are progressing. The Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces are fully cooperating with those conducting these investigations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553649"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with Canadian law, the results of these investigations and the inquiry will be made public when they are complete.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553650"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the December 2005 arrangement, which recognizes the legitimate role of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, in February 2007 this government formalized the relationship between Canada and the commission with regard to the transfer and monitoring of detainees.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553651"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this latter arrangement with the commission, the Canadian Forces notify the commission of any detainee transfers, and the commission undertakes to provide immediate notice to Canada should it learn that a transferred detainee has been mistreated.</div>

    </p><a name="Para553661"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This programs serves to help Atlantic Canadians acquire the business skills and capital they need to start, modernize and expand their businesses.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553662"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entrepreneurs are vital engines of growth in the Atlantic area. In addition to creating job opportunities in all sectors, local entrepreneurs further stimulate the economic performance of all Atlantic regions. However, we know that the ACOA continues to cut funding to these programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553663"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating one's own business certainly has its rewards, but also has its challenges. For a business to reach its full potential, a certain number of elements must be mastered, including planning, finances and marketing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553664"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurs in rural areas in the Atlantic region face the considerable challenge of funding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553665"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through ACOA programs, these people can get the funding they need for successful start-up. Many of them depend on ACOA's SEED capital program, which provides loans to start or improve a small business, as well as acquire business skills training. </div>
    </p><a name="Para553666"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005-06, the SEED capital program was a real success. It provided $6.3 million in loans— not grants, but repayable loans, and more than 469 of them—to New Brunswick entrepreneurs. Thanks to these loans and this funding, more than 663 jobs were created or maintained in New Brunswick. That is 663 jobs created or maintained in only one year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553667"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, ACOA recently reduced funding for this program and will only provide $1.5 million in loans for 2006-07. This amount represents less than 25% of the total loans for the preceding year under this same program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553668"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this government was elected, several projects have been refused or delayed simply because of funding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553669"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the second year in a row, the Conservatives did not even mention ACOA in their budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553670"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous Liberal government had invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the Atlantic region through ACOA programs. In the 2005 budget, my Liberal government devoted a complete section to the Atlantic region.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553671"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005, the Liberals increased funding for regional economic development organizations such as ACOA by $800 million.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553672"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking the government to ensure that communities in Atlantic Canada will not be penalized owing to a lack of leadership by this government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that small and medium-sized businesses are the lifeblood of Atlantic Canada. I am asking ACOA to take action in order to help Atlantic communities and business people whose development relies on funding programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553674"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the minister abandon entrepreneurs and job creation in New Brunswick?</div>
    </p><a name="Para553675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the minister continue to do so or will he restore the funding required for the seed capital program to continue providing assistance?</div>
    </p><a name="Para553676"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurs are not asking for charity. Entrepreneurs in Atlantic Canada and New Brunswick are demanding their fair share. They are not asking for grants. They are simply asking for loans to develop their businesses. But this government, this Conservative government, has completely destroyed this program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553677"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a disastrous situation and we need to restore the program. I hope the government will listen to the Liberals.</div>

    </p><a name="Para553679"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will no doubt interest the member that the Government of Canada, through ACOA, continues to focus on helping New Brunswickers succeed in business and in fact none of ACOA's programs have been cut.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553680"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government has recently approved $2.7 million in additional funding for the seed capital program in New Brunswick. As a result, this important initiative will continue to be delivered by community business development corporations and community economic development agencies across the province including, the hon. member will be interested to know, the CBDC Madawaska and CBDC Victoria-Madawaska-South.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553681"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might also interest the hon. member to know that funding under the seed capital is renewable. As funds are repaid, they return to the program allowing the community business development corporations and community economic development agencies to reinvest them in new and expanding businesses in their respective communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553682"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coupled with the $2.7 million in additional funding recently approved by our government, the seed capital program portfolio in New Brunswick today totals more than $14 million. What we are talking about here is clearly not a cut in seed capital funding, but rather sound financial management.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553683"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's new government is committed to accountability, and to getting things done for New Brunswickers and for all Canadians. We recognize clearly that small businesses have a major impact on our economy. In fact, small business has been responsible for 20% of all job gains in New Brunswick.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government understands that for these businesses to not only survive, but to thrive, they need an environment that encourages investment and innovation. Our government is committed to the creation of such an environment that will benefit generations of New Brunswickers to come.</div>

    </p><a name="Para553686"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2007 focuses on creating five key advantages which include: a fiscal advantage, by eliminating Canada's total government net debt in less than a generation; an infrastructure advantage, by building the modern infrastructure we need, and I am sure the hon. member supports that for New Brunswick; a knowledge advantage, by creating the best educated and most skilled workforce in the world; a tax advantage, by reducing taxes for all Canadians and establishing the lowest tax rate on new business investment in the G-7; and as the hon. member alluded to, an entrepreneurial advantage, by reducing unnecessary regulation and red tape, and increasing competition across the country. </div>

The parliamentary secretary says that there was an announcement that $2.7 million may be allocated over the coming year.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unacceptable for the government to provide so little money to Atlantic Canada entrepreneurs, to entrepreneurs in New Brunswick.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is unacceptable for entrepreneurs and it is unacceptable for workers. This is about creating jobs and work for our people, but this government has completely failed to understand that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's new government, through ACOA, and the member should listen carefully to this figure, has approved investments across New Brunswick of more than $105 million. These investments have leveraged more than $116 million in additional public and private sector funding, strengthening economic infrastructure and quality of life in communities across New Brunswick, including communities in his own riding of Madawaska—Restigouche and my riding of Fundy—Royal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para553693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a New Brunswicker, I am certainly proud of the record of this new government for restoring confidence in our communities and supporting innovation and investment in New Brunswick as well as all of Canada.</div>
