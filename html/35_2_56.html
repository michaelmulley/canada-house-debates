	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36(8), I have the honour to table, in 
both official languages, the government's response to 11 petitions.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">*  *  * </H4>

	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the occasion of the seventh 
anniversary of the tragic events of 1989 in Tiananmen Square to 
present to the House an update of the government's continuing 
efforts to engage Chinese leaders on these issues.
<P>
	Our long term relations with China are based on interlocking 
pillars: economic partnership, peace and security, sustainable 
development, human rights, good governance and the rule of law. 
With regard to economic partnership, systematic and wide ranging 
contact leads to calls for greater openness and freedom. Trade 
reduces isolationism. Trade also expands the scope of international 
law and generates the growth required to sustain social change and 
development. A society that depends little on trade and 
international investment is not open to the inflow of ideas and 
values.
<P>
	My recent meetings with regional leaders in China reviewed a 
sensitivity to the need for rule of law and a clear, fair, transparent, 
legal and regulatory framework. While there was a recognition that 
China had a long way to go, there was also serious intent.
<P>
	Respect for human rights and the rule of law in China are 
essential Canadian objectives. On the bilateral front, Canada is 
developing a constructive dialogue on human rights issues. 
Recently bilateral dialogue at the official  level was held in Beijing 
and we are assisting China in reform of its legal and judicial 
structures.
<P>
	Multilaterally we expressed concern about violations of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms in China. Canada uses every 
opportunity to discuss our concerns with the Chinese government.
<P>
	Good governance and the rule of law were major themes of the 
recent visit to Canada of the Chairman of the Standing Committee 
of the National People's Congress, Qiao Shi. Mr. Qiao and his 
delegation met many of the people embodying the rule of law in 
Canada and held in depth discussions with them.
<P>
	The Chinese delegation was quite interested in the workings of 
Canada's Parliament and legal systems. It is our hope we can build 
on this to assist China in creating an environment that is more 
respectful to the rule of law.
<P>
	My recent trade mission to China was also an excellent example 
of our government's approach toward China. While I helped 
Canadian firms meet face to face with key decision makers in 
booming regional markets, I also used this trip to raise human 
rights issues with Chinese officials in Beijing.
<P>
	For the first time we received assurance from Chinese officials 
that the 100,000 Canadians in Hong Kong can remain permanent 
residents there after 1997 and continue to receive Canadian 
consular protection.
<P>
	I also told Chinese officials that China's plans to install a 
temporary legislative counsel in Hong Kong is damaging the 
competence of the Hong Kong people as well as the international 
community.
<P>
	In meetings with foreign affairs minister Qian Qichen, I pressed 
the issue of human rights and the treatment of dissidents in China. I 
also met with the sister of imprisoned dissident Wei Jing Shang to 
discuss this case while she was in Canada.
<P>
	As I pointed out to the Chinese authorities on my recent trip, I 
agree there have been significant human rights improvements in 
the everyday lives of ordinary Chinese since 1989. Individuals now 
have a greater freedom of mobility within China. Food rationing 
has disappeared and people can seek their own employment.
<P>
	However, this does not excuse the fact that human rights leaders 
and pro democracy activists continue to receive swift and harsh 
punishment. Let me point out today that I disagree with those who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3384"> 3384 </A></B>
<P>
argue democracy is not appropriate in Asia because it is alien to 
Asian values such as Confucianism.
<P>
	The ruling class always elaborates this in its own self-interest. It 
manipulates Confucianism to support its own cause. As far as I am 
concerned, democracy and freedom of thought are well entrenched 
in Confucian thought.
<P>
	We will continue to point out to the Chinese government through 
both bilateral and multilateral channels that it still does not meet 
the basic requirements necessary to protect human rights.
<P>
	At the same time, we will continue assisting the Chinese in 
specific areas such as trade, regional security and improved 
bilateral projects to help create an environment in China that in the 
end respects basic human rights.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak this morning on behalf of 
the Bloc Quebecois to mark this 7th anniversary of the Tiananmen 
Square massacre on June 4, 1989, when thousands of students fell 
victim to the brutal repression of the Chinese regime, which 
savagely put down their democratic movement.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	As I said yesterday in this House, this great democratic 
movement had raised a great deal of hope, and yet today we are 
compelled to note that the situation in China is far from improved. 
Thousands of Chinese are still victims of repression and their rights 
are constantly being trampled.
<P>
	I was somewhat amazed to hear the Secretary of State for Asia 
and the Pacific's review of the so-called efforts of his government 
to bring the Chinese leaders to respect human rights. We need only 
recall the Prime Minister of Canada's response here in this very 
House on March 22, 1994, when the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. 
Bouchard, asked him to act to protect human rights in China. The 
Prime Minister replied: ``If I told the President of China, who 
represents 1.2 billion people, that the Prime Minister of Canada 
was telling him what to do, he would laugh in my face''. So much 
for what the leader of the Government of Canada thinks of the 
importance of human rights.
<P>
	What the secretary of state has said is barely credible, and the 
government's position is no more so, when it comes to the pillars 
upon which Canada's long term relationship with China rests, the 
fourth in particular: human rights, good governance and the rule of 
law. Quite a pillar. How could such a close link be made between 
good governance and the promotion of human rights? That takes 
some doing.
<P>
	In his statement on June 9, 1994 here in this House, the secretary 
of state reserved his fourth pillar for human rights and the rule of 
law. In 1996, he is adding good governance. What will be added in 
1997, I wonder. Concretely, all that the secretary of state sees fit to 
say is that, bilaterally, Canada is continuing a constructive dialogue 
on the question of human rights, while on the multilateral level, it 
is voicing its concerns. Quite an agenda, that.
<P>
	Even more surprising in the statement by the secretary of state is 
what he said after reporting that he raised the question of human 
rights with Chinese officials. He said that Chinese officials, we are 
not sure which ones exactly, apparently gave assurances for the 
first time it seems that the 100,000 Canadian nationals in Hong 
Kong will retain their right to permanent residence following the 
hand over in 1997.
<P>
	As late as yesterday, one of the Hong Kong papers mentioned a 
plan for the evacuation of Canadian nationals in the event of a 
crisis. It provided for their removal by air and by sea. I was also 
surprised to hear the secretary of state say that human rights had 
substantially, and nothing less than substantially, improved in the 
daily life of the Chinese since 1989. I do not know where the 
secretary of state's information comes from, but I would question 
it.
<P>
	Amnesty International's official reports paint a very different 
picture. Perhaps the secretary of state is prepared to contest their 
validity. From them we learn instead that hundreds of political 
dissidents and members of certain religious and ethnic groups are 
victims of arbitrary arrests and that many of them, including 
prisoners of conscience, are being held without charge or sentence 
or are condemned to prison terms at the end of unfair trials.
<P>
	Thousands of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience 
arrested a number of years ago remain incarcerated. Torture and 
poor treatment of prisoners are commonplace. At least 2,496 death 
sentences and 1,791 executions have been reported. This is a very 
brief summary of the situation in China in 1995, according to 
Amnesty International.
<P>
	I will close on an equally sombre note, in my opinion. The 
government's petty approach, a break with longstanding tradition, 
considerably undermines Canada's credibility abroad in promoting 
respect for human rights. Practically no country anymore gives any 
credibility to the words of the present government on this matter. 
The best example I have of this may be found in the treatment 
recently given Tran Trieu Quan by the Vietnamese government. He 
now has his feet chained every day from 3 p.m. until the following 
morning.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	All the Canadian government could muster in this matter was a 
slightly more strongly worded letter, according to a spokesperson 
for foreign affairs. This is shameful. The only real human rights 
spokesperson internationally is Craig Kielburger, a young man 14 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3385"> 3385 </A></B>
<P>
years of age from Toronto, who condemns the bad treatment given 
a number of different groups in the world.
<P>
	We therefore take this opportunity today to condemn the 
Canadian government whose foreign affairs practices are dictated 
by a human rights policy that is soft, insignificant and likely to 
precipitate human rights violations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very appropriate that 
we take today, the seventh anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre, 
to remember those who died and to speak out in support of 
democracy and human rights.
<P>
	The tragedy in Beijing that day was a black mark on human 
history. Peaceful protest for greater political freedom and 
democracy is a right that must transcend all borders and all 
cultures. That is why Canada must promote these values 
throughout the world.
<P>
	The kind of tragedy that occurred in Beijing unfortunately is not 
isolated to China alone. Therefore, promoting democratic 
principles throughout the world and reforming developing world 
legal institutions should be a priority area for Canadian foreign 
policy. By concentrating on these two areas we can help to increase 
political freedom and reduce the level of serious human rights 
abuses.
<P>
	To achieve this goal we would like to see the government take a 
two-pronged approach. On the one hand, Canada should support 
using our aid programs to promote the strengthening of democratic 
and legal institutions in the developing world. This would include 
things such as monitoring elections to make sure they are free and 
fair, providing legal expertise to reform the court systems and 
providing training for police so that they will serve and protect 
rather than intimidate and bully their populations. Of course this 
may not be relevant to our relations with China, but certainly there 
are countries where we could have real influence. It is our hope that 
through this type of policy we can help the people in the developing 
world to establish democratic and legal institutions which ordinary 
people trust.
<P>
	The other approach we suggest is to support international NGOs 
and the private sector in developing countries to build up civil 
society as a vehicle to improve human rights and democracy. As 
social and business groups emerge as legitimate political forces in 
developing countries, they will be able to assert themselves and 
work against corruption and government abuse.
<P>
	In the case of China it is vitally important that the Canadian 
government take a strong and constructive stand in support of 
human rights and democratic development. While we may be 
unable to get dramatic changes overnight, it is essential that we 
build for the  future to ensure that the events of Tiananmen may 
never be repeated.
<P>
	I urge the government to do everything possible to contribute to 
the improvement of human rights in China and in the rest of the 
world, and to maintain open and frank discussions with the Chinese 
authorities when abuses take place. If we can build a better, more 
democratic future for China, then we will honour those who died in 
Tiananmen seven years ago. That should be our goal. We must not 
fail for the sake of our children.

	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 34(1), I have the honour to present to 
the House, in both official languages, the report of the Canadian 
group of the Interparliamentary Union which represented Canada 
at the 95th Interparliamentary Conference held in Istanbul, Turkey 
from April 13 to 21.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	May I commend this report to members of the House for their 
information on a number of important issues being dealt with right 
here in Canada. In particular are the key roles we played in setting 
the directions for resolutions on the conservation of world fish 
stocks, on the move to a worldwide ban on land mines, on fighting 
the scourge of international terrorism and on the internal and 
external rights of minorities which have been so well addressed by 
all three parties this morning on the occasion of the memory of 
Tiananmen Square. I encourage those who are interested to read it.

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP)</B> 
moved for leave to introduce Bill C-295, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code (dangerous offenders).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this bill extends the category of dangerous 
offenders to include child sexual offenders. Indeed it requires the 
courts, rather than giving them the discretion, to find a person a 
dangerous offender in the event that the offender fails to show any 
ability to control his impulses and refuses to participate in 
programs which might assist him and the safety of the public.
<P>
	It is part of a general strategy which I think we all support to put 
our children first and to deal with dangerous offenders, in 
particular child sexual offenders, in a serious and committed way.

	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.)</B> moved for leave 
to introduce Bill C-296, an act to amend the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act (rehabilitation programs).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this private members' bill will require 
federal inmates to complete programs that will assist in their 
rehabilitation and make their parole request contingent upon their 
successful completion of such programs.
<P>
	Currently enrolment is voluntary. Inmates know that if they 
enrol in specific programs they will be looked upon much more 
favourably at their parole hearings.
<P>
	Another problem that exists is availability of such programs. 
There is no consistency in the corrections system. The program 
may be available at one penitentiary but not at another.
<P>
	The bill specifically seeks to make changes that would ensure 
that rehabilitation programs are available where needed, that 
inmates are counselled as to which programs they need most, and 
most important, that their parole request is dependent upon their 
successful completion of such appropriate programs.

conviction of Louis David Riel.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, it has been over 110 years since Riel was 
hanged following a trial tainted with irregularities. He was 
sacrificed by the then Prime Minister to the powerful Ontario 
lobbies. He was hanged because he was a Metis, because he was a 
francophone and because he stood up for a distinct society.
<P>
	This is the second time we introduce a bill to that end. It has been 
introduced before by several other members of this House. Louis 
Riel is one of the Fathers of Confederation. This must be 
recognized officially. It is not enough to pardon him posthumously. 
We must reverse the conviction against him.

transition back to private life.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure today to reintroduce this

<P>
	This bill is based on input from my constituents and represents 
what the average Canadian feels an MP's pension plan should look 
like. Unlike the current government bill on this issue, my bill 
would do away with the cash for life plan in favour of a privately 
controlled RRSP style fund with no contributions from the 
taxpayer.
<P>
	My bill would allow MPs to plan ahead for the future or provide 
them with funds for transition back into private life. This proposal 
is fair to all MPs and they will all be treated equally. There is none

Human Rights Act.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this bill is very similar to one I introduced 
in the last Parliament. It introduces a series of amendments to the 
human rights act recommended by the report of the human rights 
commissioner in 1989. It has taken some time for some of these 
recommendations to be acted upon. This is an attempt to speed up 
the process.
<P>
	In addition, in light of the most recent change to the human 
rights act, this bill also amends the human rights code to provide 
that in carrying out any special program, plan or arrangement 
designed to prevent disadvantages that are likely to be suffered by 
any group of individuals, when those disadvantages would or could 
be based on or related to sexual orientation, those will also be 
covered.
<P>
	It is a technical amendment that follows on the other. I believe 
all these amendments will commend themselves to all hon. 
members.

Question No. 42-<B>Ms. Meredith:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What was the total cost of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration's trip 
to Hong Kong and India in April 1996 and (<I>a</I>) who accompanied her on this trip; 
(<I>b</I>) if anyone from outside the Public Service of Canada did accompany her, 
what are their names and who paid for their expenses and provide details of 
these expenses; and (<I>c</I>) what was the minister's detailed itinerary during this 
visit?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration and Acting Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
The total cost of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration's trip 
to Hong Kong and India in April 1996 was $16,169.29, including 
the expenses of the minister's press secretary who was the only 
person who accompanied the minister.
<P>
	The Minister's itinerary during this visit was as follows:
<P>
	Montreal to New Delhi-April 8 (Monday). Depart Montreal 
(Mirabel) on British Airways Flt 94 at 21:45 hrs.
<P>
	April 9 (Tuesday). Arrive London (Heathrow) at 09:05 hrs. 
Flying time is 6 hours and 20 minutes. Transit time is 2 hours and 
40 minutes. Depart London (Heathrow) on Air Canada Flt 896 at 
11:45 hrs.
<P>
	April 10 (Wednesday). Arrive New Delhi at 00:40 hrs. Flying 
time is 8 hours and 25 minutes. Total travel time is 17 hours and 25 
minutes.
<P>
	April 10 (Wednesday) to April 13 (Saturday). In New Delhi, the 
minister addressed the Indo-Canada Business Council and met with 
officials of India's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As well, the 
minister personally observed for the first time our immigrant and 
visitor operations abroad.
<P>

minutes.
<P>
	April 14 (Sunday) to April 18 (Thursday). In Hong Kong, the 
minister's key objective was to get a better sense of the realities 
``on the ground'' before reaching crucial decisions which may 
impact on the flow of immigrants and visitors from Hong Kong. 
The minister met with Mr. Chris Patten, Governor of Hong Kong; 
Mr. Peter Lai, Secretary for Security and other officials. As well, 
the minister addressed the 7th Annual Board of Governors Dinner

minutes. Total travel time is 18 hours and 45 minutes.
<P>
Question No. 45-<B>Mr. Ringma:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to the provisions of the Canada-U.S.A. tax treaty, what has the 
Government of Canada determined to be the total amount of money withheld by 
the United States from resident Canadians receiving pensions from U.S. sources 
since changes were implemented in 1995?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> As of January 1, 1996, social security benefits paid 
by the United States government to residents of Canada ceased to 
be taxable in Canada. Instead, the benefits are subject to tax in the 
United States. This is presumably the change to which this question 
refers.
<P>
	The rate at which the United States taxes a particular benefit 
depends on several factors. The most important of these is the 
citizenship of the recipient. The U.S. taxes its citizens on their 
worldwide income. If a resident of Canada is a U.S. citizen, any 
U.S. social security benefits will be taxed at the same rate as they 
would be taxed domestically. That rate will vary according to the 
recipient's income and personal circumstances. Social security 
benefits paid to non-U.S. citizens who are U.S. resident aliens 
(``green card holders'') are taxed in the same manner.
<P>
	A resident of Canada who is neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. 
resident alien but who nonetheless receives U.S. social security 
benefits pays the standard 30 per cent U.S. withholding tax on 85 
per cent of the amount of the benefits, the equivalent of a 25.5 per 
cent tax on the whole benefit (.3 x .85 = .225).
<P>
	These variations among the tax rates paid by Canadians 
receiving U.S. benefits make it impossible for the Government of 
Canada to estimate with any accuracy the total amount of tax the 
United States will collect on this income.
<P>
Question No. 46-<B>Mr. Ringma:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to the 25 per cent withholding provision contained in the 
Canada-U.S.A. tax treaty on pensions paid by United States sources to 
Canadians, what has the Government of Canada determined to be (<I>a</I>) the total 
number of resident Canadians who are subject to the withholding provisions of 
this treaty, (<I>b</I>) the total number of resident native Canadians who are subject to 
the withholding provisions of this treaty, and (<I>c</I>) the section of the treaty which 
allows for different application of its provisions to native and non-native 
Canadians who are recipients of pensions from U.S. sources?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> This question is assumed to relate to the income 
tax treatment of cross-border social security benefits, rather than to 
the taxation of pensions generally.
<P>
	Based on figures provided by the United States Government, the 
total number of residents of Canada  receiving U.S. social security 
benefits is estimated to be about 81,000. It should be noted that this 
figure may include persons temporarily in Canada and others who 
would not be considered residents of Canada for income tax 
purposes. It also includes recipients who are U.S. citizens, and who 
are thus liable to U.S. tax on all of their income. The number of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3389"> 3389 </A></B>
<P>
recipients is thus significantly greater than the number who are 
subject to U.S. withholding tax.
<P>
	No information is available as to the number of native Canadians 
who receive U.S. social security benefits. The Canada-United 
States Income Tax Convention does not make any special provision 
for native Canadians. The convention would probably not preclude 
the United States from choosing, as a matter of internal policy, to 
provide more favourable treatment to native Canadians than to 
other Canadians. The Government of Canada is not aware of the 
United States having implemented any such policy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be 
allowed to stand.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CIVILAIRNAVIGATIONSERVICESCOMMERCIALIZATIONACT">CIVIL AIR NAVIGATION SERVICES 
COMMERCIALIZATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from Wednesday, May 29, consideration of 
the motion that Bill C-20, an act respecting the commercialization 
of civil air navigation services, be read the third time and passed, 
and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will use the last five minutes allotted to me to summarize what I 
said previously.
<P>
	My colleague's amendment will be dealt with by other members. 
As for me, I prefer to focus on Bill C-20 itself. I will address two 
questions: what will happen, and what I fear from this bill.
<P>
	For those who are not familiar with this bill, it concerns the 
privatization of air navigation services, which will imply additional 
costs. The users of air services and air navigation services will foot 
the bill.
<P>
	I am ready to admit that we must all tighten our belts, 
considering the state of public finances. However, I fear something 
that I will share with you.
<P>
	The Nav Canada committee was created to set a fee schedule for 
all types of carriers. What I fear is that small carriers will be 
forgotten. We know perfectly well that a  $1 increase in fares means 
a $1 loss in sales for small carriers.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	This could have a very negative impact on the regions. I am 
talking here about small carriers who employ mechanics, baggage 
handlers, receptionists and pilots who play an important part in a 
region's economy.
<P>
	Businessmen and women often have to go to Montreal or Quebec 
on business. I speak for my region of course, but it is the same in 
other remote regions in the rest of Canada. If ever they impose a fee 
structure that is too high for small carriers, I fear that some of them 
will not survive. I can tell you they already have a hard time, 
because of the small number of passengers.
<P>
	I will never try hard enough to convince the government that the 
Nav Canada committee must establish a good fee schedule so that 
big carriers will pay just as much as small ones, if not more, 
because they are probably in a better position to do so.
<P>
	This sums up my concerns and I think they are justified since 
there are no Quebecers on the Nav Canada committee. Time will 
tell if I am right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise this morning to speak to Bill C-20, an 
act respecting the commercialization of civil air navigation 
services, at third reading.
<P>
	Since 1994, the Bloc Quebecois' position has been pretty much 
the same. The principle of privatization has always been acceptable 
to us, but we question how it is being applied. With the creation of 
Nav Canada, a not for profit organization, profitability obviously 
becomes the main concern. The objective of the Bloc Quebecois is 
to put the safety of passengers, staff, air carriers and the public 
ahead of any other consideration when business decisions are made 
by Nav Canada.
<P>
	As I mentioned in the speech I gave in this House on this bill on 
May 17, this corporation bears a striking resemblance to ADM, a 
corporation which is not for profit and has no capital stock. For 
those who do not know it, ADM means Montreal airports, namely 
Mirabel and Dorval.
<P>
	On August 1, 1992, ADM signed a lease with Transport Canada 
giving it the mandate to manage, run and develop Dorval and 
Mirabel airports. ADM is headed by a board of seven directors 
representing businesses in metropolitan Montreal-when I say 
metropolitan Montreal, I should really be saying Montreal, because 
there is only one director from the Lower Laurentians on the 
board-and by a CEO appointed by the seven agencies making up 
SOPRAM, the body responsible for promoting Montreal airports.
<P>
	Mirabel airport is located in my riding, and I am very concerned 
by ADM's decision to transfer flights from Mirabel to Dorval. This 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3390"> 3390 </A></B>
<P>
decision is a source of grave concern for me as we are wondering 
about the safety of passengers, staff, air carriers and the public at 
large. The CESAMM, a wide coalition in support of 
Montreal-Mirabel airport, has voiced its opposition to ADM's 
decision to transfer international flights from Mirabel to Dorval.
<P>
	Even the Quebec transport minister, Jacques Brassard, 
disapproves of ADM's decision. He said that the arguments 
presented by ADM since it made this decision have many flaws.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	According to Mr. Brassard, the Quebec government noted ``no 
environmental impact assessment for the long and medium terms, 
making it impossible to judge this aspect of the issue''. Second, he 
points out how uncertain the new future reserved for Mirabel is. He 
says that ``a study conducted in 1994 by SNC-Lavalin for the 
Quebec transport department concluded that the lack of 
profitability of general freight services shows that the development 
of air freight strategies cannot be based on this sector. Analysis 
conducted by the MICST, the trade and industry department, 
yielded no decisive results regarding the impact in Canada of the 
free zone concept as suggested by ADM''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. I apologize for 
interrupting the hon. member, but I understand that what is being 
debated today is third reading of the transfer of Canada's air 
navigation system to Nav Canada.
<P>
	The hon. member has spent the last five minutes talking about a 
whole different issue, the Aéroports de Montreal and the operations 
of Mirabel and Dorval. Quite frankly it is not on topic.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My colleagues, as you know, it is always 
a problem for the Speaker if someone strays a little from the 
subject, but I am sure our colleague will get to the point very 
rapidly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dumas:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out to my 
colleague that I was making a comparison. I said so earlier.
<P>
	This company strangely looks like ADM and that is why, of 
course, I allowed myself to talk about it here when dealing with the 
problem caused by the transfer of Mirabel flights to Dorval.
<P>
	The distinction between regular and charter air services is 
diminishing so that a considerable reduction of charter activities at 
Mirabel cannot be excluded, which could put into question the 
airport's financial profitability. Several carriers that were consulted 
by the Department of Transportation pointed out they expected 
Mirabel to close sooner or later.
<P>
	As a result of the Quebec government's position on this issue, 
ADM's chief executive officer responded in an article released in 
<I>La Presse</I> on Wednesday, May 29, and I quote: ``May I suggest to 
you that public hearings on this issue are not necessary, since the 
area has long been waiting for these undertakings and there is a 
wide consensus on this''.
<P>
	Furthermore, Jacques Auger mentioned that the nature of the 
company's project was not subject to the assessment process 
provided for in each of the acts. Why? Because we are not 
enlarging Dorval airport, we will not increase its surface, we are 
not adding new runways, nor are we extending existing ones''.
<P>
	ADM's decision is a blatant lack of transparency, as would be 
the case for Nav Canada, because the people involved are still 
demanding public hearings. A second mistake should be avoided. 
The first one was made when the land around Mirabel was 
expropriated. Are we going to say once again to the people in my 
riding that it was another administrative error?
<P>
	Bill C-20 must not be adopted, because it does not take into 
account the safety of the people concerned. A report from the 
Transportation Safety Board of Canada lists the aeronautical 
incidents that occurred around Mirabel and Dorval between 
January 1, 1981 and May 10, 1996.
<P>
	This report also deals with safety matters. It points out that, 
during the same period, 89 reportable incidents occurred at Mirabel 
as opposed to 284 at Dorval. It concludes by demonstrating that the 
number of accidents is 13 times higher at Dorval than at Mirabel.
<P>
	Even if the percentage of fatal accidents is low, with over 60 
million passengers passing through Canadian airports every year, 
one must not forget the impact of transferring flights to Dorval.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	A group of citizens calling themselves ``Citizens for Quality of 
Life'' or CQV in French got together to oppose ADM's decision to 
transfer flights from Mirabel to Dorval, because it will increase the 
level of noise and pollution in neighbouring municipalities without 
really generating any economic benefits. These municipalities are 
Ville-Saint-Laurent, Dorval and Mount Royal.
<P>
	Furthermore, this group decided to intervene through the judicial 
process. It disclosed new environmental studies that raise many 
questions. One of these studies was carried out by the firm of 
D'Aragon, Desbiens, Halde et Associés, which maintains that the 
studies on air quality published by ADM are incomplete. Two other 
studies were done by Rowan, Williams, Davies &amp; Irwin, a 
Guelph-based engineering consulting firm with expertise-
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. We 
are talking about transfer of air navigation services to a not for 
profit corporation called Nav Canada, not air pollution and noise 
pollution studies going on at Mirabel and Dorval.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair is always grateful when a 
member on either side of this House stands up to point out that 
another member is out of order. I am asking for the co-operation of 
all hon. members, wherever they are sitting. It is the same problem 
on both sides. Could the hon. member please speak to the bill?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dumas:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will conclude on this. We must also 
ask ourselves questions about Nav Canada's goals. I would like to 
reiterate my position, and that of the Bloc Quebecois, which is that 
Bill C-20 should be defeated, as the sole purpose of establishing 
Nav Canada is profit and not public security.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to address the remarks made 
by the member for Lac-Saint-Jean, who I understand is a small 
aircraft pilot. He is aware of air navigation services and the level of 
safety that has always been priority one for Transport Canada.
<P>
	I want to address his remarks and the remarks made by the 
member who followed. Frankly, the fears of the member regarding 
the issue of regionality and regional representation are unfounded.
<P>
	The Bloc alleges small carriers will be forgotten when Canada's 
air navigation system moves to the not for profit corporation. There 
are no small carrier or major carrier seats on the Nav Canada board. 
There are four seats on the board that are appointed by the largest 
national association of Canadian air carriers, the Air Transportation 
Association of Canada, ATAC. ATAC draws its membership from 
carriers of all sizes, from Air Canada to the flying club the hon. 
member for Lac-Saint-Jean may represent.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that among the initial four directors 
appointed by the Air Transportation Association of Canada is Mr. 
Iain Harris, the former president and CEO of AirBC. AirBC is not a 
big carrier. It is a regional carrier.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If the member would resume his seat for a 
moment. I think it is unfair for a member to get up on questions or 
comments when we have moved on to another member. In this case 
the member for Lac-Saint-Jean has no opportunity to respond.
<P>
	I therefore ask the hon. member to confine his comments or 
questions to the remarks given by the member who is able to 
respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I only wish these Speaker's rulings 
were as stiff when we first rose on the point of order. I will address 
the direct concern of the hon. member who just spoke.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	Bloc members have presented this argument at every reading and 
have focused their concerns on this bill in those two specific areas, 
regional representation on the board of Nav Canada and aspects of 
safety. Therefore my remark made to the hon. member who spoke 
previously was really more of a collective remark. We will 
probably get the assurance of the hon. member who will get up in a 
moment that is precisely what their focus is on those specific areas.
<P>
	I have already addressed the small carrier-major carrier attitude 
the hon. member is putting forward vis-à-vis representation on the 
board, that there is representation. The hon. member is concerned 
about the small carrier and specific protection for the small carrier. 
Let us take a few examples of what is in Bill C-20 to protect the 
charging principles for small carriers.
<P>
	Paragraph 35(1)(d) prohibits discrimination among Canadian 
carriers in terms of charges. This would rule out the use of quality 
discounts, for example, which would give a price break to the large 
carriers.
<P>
	Paragraph 35(1)(e) requires a reasonable allocation of costs and 
a determination of charges for terminal and en route services. This 
would avoid any unjustified loading of costs into the cost base for 
terminal charges, which typically impact heavily on the smaller 
carriers making frequent landings and take-offs.
<P>
	The legislation in committee was addressed point by point. 
Regrettably the hon. member who just spoke was not at committee. 
I hope the hon. member feels reassured at this point. Given that the 
bill deals with the Aeronautics Act which looks after safety in this 
sector and with Nav Canada, and given the assurances of the large 
and small carrier representation on the board, I hope he would have 
no problem with the legislation before us today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dumas:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to address representation 
at this time, since my hon. colleague opposite raised the issue. We 
complained earlier about the fact that there were no representatives 
from Quebec on Nav Canada. I am now making the same complaint 
about ADM, or Aéroports de Montréal, including Dorval and 
Mirabel airports. On ADM's board, all members but one are from 
the Montreal business community, the only exception being a 
businessman from the Lower Laurentians region. That is why we 
are afraid that, when the time will come for these individuals to 
make a decision and choose one airport over another, it would only 
make sense that they would not go for Mirabel, the one in the 
Lower Laurentians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3392"> 3392 </A></B>
<P>
	At the time Mirabel was built, the intent was in fact to 
eventually all but close down Dorval. But then, in the 1980s, as 
a result of a certain lobby gaining great influence, flights were 
never transferred from Dorval to Mirabel, as originally planned, 
although Mirabel had been built for that very reason, after many 
West Island residents complained about the noise and pollution 
created around Dorval airport.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I first wish to commend my colleague from 
Argenteuil-Papineau for his speech, even if it was interrupted 
twice by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	The hon. member for Hamilton West is a seasoned and 
experienced parliamentarian, who was elected in 1988, and he 
knows the procedure better than I do, because I am still a rookie. I 
was elected only in 1993.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	I was very surprised to see the parliamentary secretary 
disturbing my colleague repeatedly during his speech, breaking his 
train of thought. I am astounded. Does this reflect the position of 
the government on this bill or on other bills? Is the government 
trying to deny opposition members their free and democratic right 
to express themselves in the House?
<P>
	I am astounded. But I am also disappointed and surprised by the 
attitude of the hon. member for Hamilton West, because when I 
knew him, during the two and a half years that I was a member of 
the committee on transport, which he chaired, he was always 
respectful of differences. I wonder if he was told to give us a hard 
time.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Back home, on île d'Orléans, this is called 
strong-arm tactics. Does the government want to use strong-arm 
tactics against the opposition?
<P>
	Today, I take part in the debate at third reading-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Stay on topic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, could you please call the member 
for Hamilton West to order? He felt my colleague talked a little bit 
too much about the decision to close Mirabel and reroute flights to 
Dorval. I will ask him real questions. I will ask him questions on 
Bill C-20 and Nav Canada. I will raise specific questions and you 
will see the attitude of government members. The best is yet to 
come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Good, come on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> So, I take part in the debate at third reading-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Oral question period started early today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, could you ask the member for 
Vaudreuil, the Chihuahua for Vaudreuil to go bark outside the 
House? I cannot concentrate, I cannot even hear myself.
<P>
	What I wanted to say-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, I ask you to listen more 
carefully to what members from both sides have to say, so that each 
of you can have his or her turn. The hon. member for Vaudreuil will 
have his turn presently.
<P>
	In fact, the hon. member for Vaudreuil can have the floor 
immediately after the member who is now talking, if he wishes so.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Excuse me, Mr. Speaker. I think I mentioned 
Hamilton East. There will probably be a member from another 
party after the byelection of June 17. I apologize to my colleague, 
the parliamentary secretary, whose riding is Hamilton West.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This legislative measure provides the legal framework to 
transfer Canada's air navigation services from Transport Canada to 
Nav Canada, a non profit corporation incorporated under part II of 
the Canada Corporations Act.
<P>
	I want to say from the outset that the official opposition is not 
opposed to the sale of air navigation services to Nav Cananada, for 
an amount of $1.5 billion. However, we are most concerned about 
safety. Through the amendment moved by the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, the Bloc Quebecois wants to 
ensure that the safety of passengers, airline personnel and the 
public has priority over all other considerations in business 
decisions made by Nav Canada.
<P>
	Those interested in this privatisation of ANS will not be 
surprised by the position of the Bloc today. Right from the start, 
members knew where we stood. As the official opposition, we do 
not have a reputation for flip-flopping like the government, which 
changes its position at every whim of the electorate. The Bloc 
Quebecois has always had a consistent position on this matter.
<P>
	Right from the start, official opposition members have tried to 
convince the government and Nav Canada that the security and the 
interest of the public should come before the commercial interest 
of Nav Canada. This will now be a private corporation which will 
not necessarily have the public interest as its top priority. Its first 
goal will be its own viability.
<P>
	Unfortunately, in our capitalist system, commercial interest 
sometimes takes precedence over other considerations, particularly 
in air navigation security.

<P>
	Amendments by the Bloc were discussed in committee and at 
report stage, and we tried to have this principle recognized. But the 
Liberal majority has stubbornly refused to move, and all our 
amendments have been rejected. Through the parliamentary 
secretary, this same Liberal majority wants to stifle our opposition 
and limit our excellent speeches.
<P>
	Today, we are leading a final attack against this bill to make sure 
the security of passengers, of air carriers and of the general public 
take precedence over any effort to better serve private interests. But 
the government is turning a deaf ear.
<P>
	On May 29, in the House, the Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Transport, the hon. member for Hamilton West, bluntly 
admitted that the sale of ANS to Nav Canada would bring in an 
amount of $1.5 billion to be applied to reduction of the federal 
deficit. That seemed to justify the swift passage of the bill.
<P>
	The Bloc does not challenge that amount, but I raise question for 
your consideration, Mr. Speaker. Is the air navigation system really 
worth $1.5 billion? It is part of the Canadian heritage, the heritage 
of Quebec's and Canada's taxpayers. Is this a botched up sale, a 
garage sale, a bankruptcy sale? To some extent, taxpayers' money 
is being squandered. As far as we know, this air navigation control 
system was paid for with the taxes of Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	Quebecers pay $30 billion in taxes to Canada every year. When 
the federal government invests money in our province, I hope it 
does not think it is giving us a gift. When senior citizens get their 
pension cheques with a maple leaf in the corner, they should not 
think the federal government is giving them a gift. This is their own 
money they are receiving.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary swept the safety issue under the rug 
when he said: ``Safety will continue to have the highest priority for 
Transport Canada'', said the parliamentary secretary and member 
for Hamilton West. ``Safety regulations will be in place before 
ANS is transferred. Transport Canada will monitor and enforce 
compliance with these regulations as it does now in the case of 
airlines''.
<P>
	I continue to quote: ``The Aeronautics Act which sets out the 
regulatory framework to maintain the safety and integrity of the 
aviation industry will continue to prevail. I point out to Bloc 
members, said the parliamentary secretary, that the Aeronautics 
Act will prevail over the ANS Act.''
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary answered ``by the book'', as we say 
back home. He urges us not to think that our safety is at risk. In 
other words, he implies that we tend to be a bit paranoid, since we 
always worry about accidents. But we have good reason to worry. I 
must tell the parliamentary secretary that he is known for his 
arrogance and his lack of understanding.
<P>
	I recall vividly the day the Coalition to save the Quebec City 
bridge came here to present its brief-the parliamentary secretary 
is about to rise to say that I am getting off the NavCan issue. I just 
want to remind him of what he said during the debate over the 
privatisation of CN Rail, when a request was made to exclude the 
Quebec City bridge, which is part of world heritage. He stated that 
the government was not about to start saving every small structure 
at the end of a country road.
<P>
	He compared the Quebec City bridge, something the residents of 
the Quebec region take pride in, to a small structure at the end of a 
country road. That is what the parliamentary secretary said when he 
was-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> A point of order, Mr. Speaker. For the record, I said 
no such thing.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think that is a point of debate. The hon. 
member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, we will speak of motion No. 15 
amending clause 32 of the bill so that charges may be imposed to 
the Department of National Defence or a user in respect of a state 
aircraft of a foreign country.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	We know that small air carriers have already proposed that 
charges be imposed to the National Defence. Is it normal, realistic 
or even acceptable that, in 1996, National Defence has a $10.8 
billion budget paid with taxpayers' money while there is no more 
war threat, the cold war is over, and there is detente all over the 
world? The generals, National Defence employees act like a 
government inside the government. Is it normal that National 
Defence does not have to pay for its aircraft? This would be a good 
point to develop when the parliamentary secretary speaks a little 
later. We will ask him if he finds that acceptable.
<P>
	Here is the position of the Bloc Quebecois. According to the 
Bloc, it is unfair that carriers pay for the services provided to 
National Defence; if clause 32(2) is not amended, it will still allow 
for hidden spending by National Defence. The Bloc Quebecois has 
always asked for the reduction of military spending. Therefore, it is 
important to know what the real cost of military spending.
<P>
	Moreover, and this is the ultimate argument, private air carriers 
should not have to pay for National Defence.
<P>
	I could also mention another example and ask for more 
information from the parliamentary secretary when he speaks on 
Bill C-20. Can the government guarantee that services in French 
will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3394"> 3394 </A></B>
<P>
maintained over the Quebec territory and the Ottawa territory, 
which is officially bilingual, when this bill is implemented?
<P>
	I already know what the parliamentary secretary will answer me. 
Later, when he comments, maybe he will say that, pursuant to the 
provisions of Bill C-20, the Official Languages Act will still be in 
force. We will have to see whether the provisions of this act will 
apply to Nav Canada's operations, to its corporate headquarters, its 
administrative services and the regional control centres. But can 
the parliamentary secretary ensure us that the Francophones in 
Quebec who, in 1975-1976, won the fight of the Association des 
Gens de l'Air du Québec, gained the right for a francophone pilot to 
speak to a francophone air traffic controller in the language they 
both choose?
<P>
	What I am explaining could look like an aberration and might 
seem stupid, but before the fight of these people in 1975, it was 
totally and specifically forbidden for Francophones to have a 
conversation in French, for instance between someone in the 
cockpit and someone in the control tower or at a regional control 
centre. It was an aberration.
<P>
	I would like to hear more about this, because this is one of the 
concerns of the Bloc Quebecois. With the cost-effectiveness 
requirements, maybe nothing would prevent the closure of all 
regional control centres and the transfer of their operations to a 
large commercial centre, for instance in Mississauga, in Ontario, 
which would control the entire air corridor in Canada. To make the 
operations cost-effective, maybe services in French would be 
reduced.
<P>
	It may seem like an aberration that two Francophones were not 
allowed to speak French in the field of aviation. But I would 
remind you that pilots flying over the lower North Shore and the 
Magdalen Islands, which are part of Quebec, cannot get services in 
French. Why not? Because the services are offered by the Moncton 
area control centre, which is officially bilingual, but cannot offer 
services in French.
<P>
	When an Air Alliance pilot is ready to take off at the end of the 
Magdalen Islands airstrip and asks for services in French, he gets 
this answer: ``Please wait, we will give you the services as soon as 
possible''. In the meantime, his engines are running and fuel is 
burned.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	The Air Alliance supervisor wants his pilot to think of cost 
effectiveness. The pilots of Air Alliance and Inter-Canadien, 
Quebec's regional carriers, as well as Air Satellite and others are 
conscientious and want their company to succeed. But when they 
are being asked to wait 5, 7 or 9 minutes and their engines are 
running, they know they are wasting fuel and adding to costs. I 
would like to know if, with this bill, we will be able to get services 
in French in the whole territory of Quebec, like the government 
promised.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are signalling me that my time has expired. I 
could also have mentioned that no one will represent the 
Association québécoise des transporteurs aériens on Nav Canada's 
board, but some of my colleagues will do so. Our colleague, the 
member for Lac-Saint-Jean, was trained as a pilot. He is not only 
young, he is a pilot, so he knows what he is talking about. I could 
have spoken about it, but unfortunately my time has expired.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I begin my remarks by 
congratulating the hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans. He has been a hard working 
member of the Standing Committee on Transport which I had the 
privilege to chair for the last two and half years. The member has 
moved on to another area and his energy and effervescence is 
certainly missed at the committee.
<P>
	The hon. member addressed three points on which I would like 
to touch. The first is safety. Safety has always been priority one for 
Transport Canada. It must be clear to members of the Bloc that Bill 
C-20 clearly establishes the supremacy of the Aeronautics Act and 
sets up appropriate linkages to that act.
<P>
	The Aeronautics Act, which looks after all the safety concerns of 
anything in that flies in this country, has demonstrated that it has 
been able to ensure the safe passage of men, women and children 
on aircraft.
<P>
	I do not think the hon. member can stand here and say that 
Canada has a disastrous policy on aeronautics which is resulting in 
crashes of aircraft. He must admit that the Aeronautics Act has 
done the job well for our country and for the air carriers.
<P>
	The member says that when Nav Canada takes over that 
Canada's air navigation system the role the government plays will 
somehow be unplugged from the process. Nothing could be farther 
from the truth, particularly when it comes to the safety of the 
system. The government has a number of other roles to play on an 
ongoing basis.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport is likely to be involved in the approval 
of charges during the first two years when NavCan introduces its 
full complement of user charges.
<P>
	The minister has the final say when there are disagreements 
among users, that is, provincial or territorial governments. 
Specifically, when it comes to safety, the economy and 
accountability, the government took great care to establish a 
framework with Nav Canada upfront. With Bill C-20 the 
contractual agreements that have been entered into with Nav 
Canada are there, transparent, open to the public through its bylaws 
and letters patent.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	If I had a question for the hon. member opposite after that 
comment it would be to ask him what specific measure would the 
Bloc suggest that would, if not already incorporated in the 
Aeronautics Act, be better or more clear than the Aeronautics Act 
itself which protects and ensures the safe passage of men, women 
and children in aircraft in this country?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the former chairman of the 
transport committee for his kind words. He asked what specific 
measures the Bloc would like to see included in the bill to 
guarantee the safety aspect. I repeat that if he reads motion number 
one carefully, he will notice that its sole purpose is to mention in 
the preamble that the safety of passengers, air carrier personnel and 
the public has priority over all other considerations in the decisions 
made by NAV CANADA.
<P>
	I will simply say to the parliamentary secretary that since he 
states that he and the government are devoted to safety, he should 
admit it is not superfluous to have legislative clauses that give 
supplementary guarantees in terms of air safety. If he considers that 
that aspect is covered by the Aeronautics Act, I do not see why the 
government opposes so categorically the fact that we want to 
reinforce safety and introduce a statement to that effect in the 
preamble of the bill. That does not represent a threat at all. 
Everybody here is in favour of the safety of passengers and 
personnel. Just include it in the preamble of the bill and there will 
be no problem.
<P>
	I wonder why the hon. members opposite are so afraid of us. 
There is no threat. Our motion would only confirm the safety 
considerations in the preamble of the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to put a question to my colleague, the member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, regarding his very eloquent 
remarks.
<P>
	Furthermore, I am 100 per cent in agreement with his thoughts 
on defence. Why should small carriers, who are struggling, have to 
foot the bill, when the Armed Forces, with their huge budgets, their 
hours of F-18 training sometimes estimated as costing $20,000 an 
hour, and I am not exaggerating, would not even be asked to pay for 
the air navigation services they use.
<P>
	I think my colleague raised a very good point here. Before 
asking my question, I would like to go back briefly over the earlier 
debate regarding ATAC. Earlier, we heard that small carriers were 
going to be very well represented on Nav Canada's board, because 
of the fact that ATAC represented Air Canada as well as the small 
carrier in my riding.
<P>
	The unfortunate fact of the matter is that we know that what 
drives the world nowadays is money. I would point out that ATAC, 
the Air Transport Association of  Canada, gets approximately 80 
per cent of its funding from large carriers. So if you think that the 
small carrier in my riding, when he wants to have his say, will ask 
the president of ATAC if he would mind lowering user charges, or 
keeping the DME or VOR service in his sector, or whatever, I am 
sceptical. The president of ATAC will wonder what his contribution 
to funding is. He will not say it out loud, of course, but he will think 
it. There is every reason to be worried.
<P>
	The other point that was also mentioned earlier was ATAC's 
interest in preserving the use of French. I could tell you that when 
people spoke to us about ATAC's use of French, all that was 
bilingual was the letterhead. That was all. Apart from that, all its 
articles of incorporation were in English.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	So I think we have good reason to have certain doubts about the 
quality of French or about bilingualism in this area.
<P>
	I would like to put a question to my colleague, with whom I was 
discussing this issue a few moments ago, about his concerns 
regarding French in aviation.
<P>
	I have over 1,000 hours flown as a professional pilot. When we 
talk about navigation assistance services, assistance is really the 
key word. When it is nice and sunny on a Sunday afternoon, it is 
not so bad because there is no problem. But when the ceiling gets 
low and weather conditions become difficult, when you start to 
worry and find yourself in trouble, that is when you really need 
navigation assistance. I can tell you that it is serious. That is where 
this issue becomes relevant. When you start to get nervous in the 
cockpit and you have to speak English on top of that, it becomes 
dangerous.
<P>
	I would like my colleague to talk about his concerns regarding 
the use of French in aviation in Quebec and in the Ottawa area.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond: </B>Mr. Speaker, before responding specifically to 
the question, I would like to simply reinforce what my colleague 
from Lac-Saint-Jean has said concerning National Defence.
<P>
	Often, the past is an indication of what the future holds. 
Reference is made to concerns about military spending. As you 
know, there was publicity over the case, a month and a half or two 
months ago, of an F-18 pilot based at Cold Lake using his aircraft 
at the taxpayers' expense to go see his fiancee in Phoenix, Arizona. 
Imagine, National Defence refuses to even pay for the air traffic 
control system, yet its pilots can fly around as they please. This one 
can go say hello to his fiancee at taxpayers' expense. What sheer 
nonsense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau: </B>She must be good looking!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond: </B>Yes she may be pretty, I have no idea.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Debien: </B>Love is blind.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3396"> 3396 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond: </B>Love is certainly blind.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Debien: </B>So is the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Yes, so is the government, as my colleague says.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau: </B>Love knows no borders.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond: </B>Second, as for small carriers, I have an example 
in mind. In Lac-Saint-Jean riding, there is a small but dynamic 
airline called Air Alma. It has a counter at Dorval and is capable of 
holding its own against any major charter carrier. And why is it 
able to be competitive? Because it is a flexible operation, one 
whose employees like the company, like their jobs, and are capable 
of giving something back in return.
<P>
	Yet, if they are deprived of revenue, it is like depriving them of 
oxygen. How then can small carriers like Air Alma survive in the 
marketplace?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but the hon. member's time is 
up.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent to extend the hon. member's time?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent to give the member more time to 
give his answer?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member has one more minute to 
speak, two minutes at the most.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	I might also have talked about the RAM radar tracking system. 
Will it be very effective when it is given over to Nav Canada? The 
RAM system was not effective, and I have an example for you. 
Twice last year, they lost the government's air ambulance, which 
was on a mercy flight in the North. They lost it on the radar screen.
<P>
	I could also give the example of the Bernières radar system in 
suburban Quebec City, which was tracking a plane. At one point, 
the screen indicated that the plane had made a sharp 180 degree 
turn. What happened? The RAM system had stopped following the 
plane it was tracking and had picked up a flock of geese flying 
10,000 feet below and in the opposite direction.
<P>
	Imagine how safe it is in tracking a plane.
<P>
	In closing, I have one final point to make about French in the air. 
I am very concerned that, as a cost cutting measure, they will say 
all pilots are bilingual and able to provide service in English, to the 
detriment of French.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
question the parliamentary secretary asked my colleague  for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans earlier could not have come at 
a better time. He asked him what steps the Bloc Québécois would 
suggest today for improving the Aeronautics Act in order to 
improve air safety. My speech also could not come at a better time 
because I am going to address air safety.
<P>
	Bill C-20, which we are debating today at third reading, provides 
for the creation of a business corporation called Nav Canada. This 
bill deals first and foremost with the commercialization of civil air 
navigation services.
<P>
	In other words, the government has decided to sell to Nav 
Canada the air navigation system and to entrust it with its 
management. As we repeatedly pointed out during this debate, the 
official opposition is not against selling the air navigation system 
to Nav Canada for an estimated $1.5 billion, apparently. This 
government decision, whose merits we recognize, is based on 
objectives of efficiency, cost effectiveness and less costly 
operations.
<P>
	However, we are dismayed by the fact that none of the 
amendments proposed by the opposition parties have been 
retained. Worse, an important amendment regarding the Privacy 
Act passed by the transport committee-where, as we know, the 
Liberals have a majority-has been eliminated from Bill C-20 by 
the same Liberal government. In other words, never mind the 
committees.
<P>
	As my colleague for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, critic for 
transports, put it so well, we swung like a pendulum, from one 
extreme to the other, not stopping in the middle. Yet, the 
government could have struck the appropriate balance, despite 
what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport 
might think, by conducting an objective review of the proposals 
and amendments presented by the members of his own party.
<P>
	Citizens who are interested in the privatization of navigation 
services will not be surprised to hear today the Bloc Quebecois 
remind the government of a basic aspect of this bill that, 
unfortunately, it neglected. Through the amendment of my 
colleague for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, the Bloc Quebecois 
would like the government to acknowledge the fact that security of 
passengers, personnel and the general public must take precedence 
at Nav Canada.
<P>
	We must not forget that, at the very beginning, the official 
opposition tried to have the government and Nav Canada recognize 
that public safety and interest take precedence over Nav Canada's 
financial interests.
<P>
	Several amendments of the Bloc were debated in committee and 
in this House at the report stage to have this principle recognized. 
Each time, we came up against the Liberal majority.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3397"> 3397 </A></B>
<P>
	Yet, in matters of air transport, security is certainly a number one 
consideration. The parliamentary secretary bluntly admitted, on 
May 29, that the sale of the air navigation system would be, and I 
quote, ``a $1.5 billion contribution to reducing the federal deficit''.
<P>
	Would this claim be sufficient to justify speedy passage of Bill 
C-20? The parliamentary secretary tried to reassure us by once 
again avoiding the safety issue. ``Safety will continue to have the 
highest priority for Transport Canada''. He repeated that earlier 
today.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Safety regulations will be in place before ANS is transferred. Transport 
Canada will monitor and enforce compliance with these regulations as it does 
now in the case of airlines. The Aeronautics Act which sets out the regulatory 
framework to maintain the safety and integrity of the aviation industry will 
prevail. I point out to members of the Bloc that it will prevail over the ANS Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	I listened with great interest to these words of the parliamentary 
secretary. I understand that Transport Canada established some 
safety rules and standards that will apply to the new corporation 
and that operations will be controlled so that these rules and 
standards are properly observed. The government statements might 
seem reassuring. But, in spite of the rhetoric and the good 
intentions of the parliamentary secretary, as far as I know, safety 
standards are not mentioned in the bill.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois considers that, given all the commercial 
decisions being made by Nav Canada, the only way to ensure safety 
would be to state, in the bill, that safety will remain priority 
number one. That is the principle we want to assert when we say 
that the public's safety comes before a private corporation's profits.
<P>
	Unfortunately, it seems the government has already decided 
what priority will be given to safety in air transport. Furthermore, I 
feel that it is just stone deaf to what we are saying. The only thing it 
hears is the ring of the deficit cash register. All we can hope is that 
it will not be awakened by some unfortunate event caused by its 
lack of responsibility.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to point out another aspect of the bill 
I find unfair. As my young colleague spoke about it at some length, 
I will be very brief. I believe that the new corporation, Nav Canada, 
must make sure that those who are poorly or not represented on the 
board, such as small carriers and the aviation sector as a whole, are 
not discriminated against.
<P>
	The newest children must not be put at a disadvantage. 
NAVCAN did not respect the wish of small carriers, and only major 
carriers have a representative on the board. For example, nobody 
will represent the Association québécoise des transporteurs 
aériens, as my new colleague from Lac-Saint-Jean so wisely 
pointed out. This is another sad reality endorsed by a government 
in a hurry to get rid of the Canadian air navigation system.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will not support this bill as it stands because 
of its many significant flaws including-as I stressed at some 
length-the one regarding safety. For these reasons, I will support 
the amendment moved by my colleague from 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my colleague from Laval East has emphasized, quite 
rightly so, the issue of safety in air transportation. I would like to 
come back to the issue that has just been dealt with two or three 
times in a row relating to the preamble we would have liked to see 
in the bill and which some say is unnecessary since there is the 
Aeronautics Act, on the one hand, and on the other, the government 
controls safety issues.
<P>
	In fact, would it not have been logical to express the very spirit 
of the legislation in its preamble? This is a private company that 
has to provide a public service, just like ADM. I find the 
explanations given by my colleague from Argenteuil-Papineau 
totally justified, because of this comparison.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	It is quite justified to express right at the very start the spirit of 
this legislation, the spirit in which it must be interpreted later on, in 
order to stress the public service role of this private company and 
the primacy of public services over mercantile interests. We do not 
see why the government refused to express this very legitimate 
concern in the preamble.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Debien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry, but I was busy giving a 
document to someone. I would like to know whether my colleague 
from Blainville-Deux-Montagnes asked a question or only made 
a comment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is not for me to answer. If the member 
for Blainville-Deux-Montagnes would like to repeat his question?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Debien: </B>The hon. member tells me it was a comment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have been following this debate to some degree this 
morning.
<P>
	I am a licensed private pilot. I recall very clearly the debate that 
raged around the use of French in air traffic navigation in Quebec 
which took place some years ago. Looking at it from an apolitical 
perspective it seemed to me it would made sense for persons in 
recreational flying in some aspects to be able to use unilingual 
French.
<P>
	However when we talk about safety in the sky, the international 
language of communication in the air is English. We should not 
lose sight of the fact that in all parts of the world the international 
language of communication in the air is English. While it makes 
sense for persons who are unilingual French speaking, unilingual 
Russian speaking or unilingual whatever language, Swahili or 
Chinese, to speak in their language, the international language of 
aviation for safety purposes is English. It has nothing to with 
whether English is a better language or any other reason. It just got 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3398"> 3398 </A></B>
<P>
started that way. There needs to be one common language in the air 
and it is English.
<P>
	We have these natural tensions within our country and many 
people have sympathy for the fact that people working and living in 
French in Quebec who are unilingual have the right to live and 
work unilingually in Quebec. However, there are some 
circumstances in life which require preconditions. If one wants to 
be a brain surgeon one has to understand and learn brain surgery. If 
one is going to be a pilot one has to be able to operate on an 
international basis in English because that is the language. It has 
nothing to do with superiority or inferiority of any particular 
language or group.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Debien: </B>Mr. Speaker, of course, I totally disagree with the 
member of the Reform Party.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to point out to him that, when passengers 
fly to India, the language of the country, Hindi, is spoken on the 
plane, and English is also spoken. I do not see where English has 
primacy. When you go to Spain, both Spanish and English are 
spoken on the plane.
<P>
	Wherever you go in the world and you take a national air carrier, 
it is always the national language that is used and English.
<P>
	I do not see why and how English would suddenly become the 
international language, when in practice, this is totally false in the 
case of most major countries in the world. It should be the same 
here in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would point out to my Reform colleague that although we 
sometimes talk about Reform measures, I have a feeling that we are 
dealing with Conservative measures from 20 years ago, when we 
discuss language in air navigation services. Moreover, my 
colleague is a private pilot and I find it fascinating to hear him say 
such things.
<P>
	I think that French has been used as a language in Quebec 
airspace since 1977 or 1980-I am too young to remember-and it 
has been demonstrated that safety is not threatened. It was proven a 
long time ago that, for example, if a pilot landing a 747 in Montreal 
exchanges traffic or flight information with the air traffic controller 
in Dorval or Mirabel in French, safety is not compromised. This 
was the subject of a debate several years ago. Some members of 
Parliament even said: ``If bilingualism ever comes into effect in 
Quebec, I will no longer want to fly in that province's airspace''. 
Come on. That is just another case of scaremongering. This is 
incredible. All this to tell him that I am a little  disappointed to see 
us get into this debate, which, in fact, is beside the point.
<P>
	I would like to put a question to my colleague, whose speech was 
full of praise. As a pilot, I, of course, see this whole matter from a 
certain angle while she, as a passenger, sees the potential 
commercial effect on safety. I would like to know how, as a 
passenger and user of air transportation services, my colleague 
feels about this bill, which might threaten the safety of airline 
passengers.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Debien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague 
from Lac-Saint-Jean for his question. Of course, whenever I board 
a plane as a passenger-and I think the same goes for most of us-I 
always feel a kind of natural fear. At least I do. I have not yet fully 
overcome my fear of flying, so this is a concern.
<P>
	Since the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean asked me personally 
to answer this question, I must say that I might be even more 
fearful knowing that the priority that should be given to safety is 
not clearly indicated in the bill, as the Bloc Quebecois had 
proposed to do by inserting a preamble. That is the answer I would 
like to give my colleague.
<P>
	In response to the parliamentary secretary, I think we are not 
asking the impossible. We asked him to write a few lines in a 
preamble showing how important it is for the government to make 
people like myself-I think I am not the only one-feel safer about 
the priority given to safety by a commercial company providing a 
public service.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are debating this bill in a somewhat special context, 
spanning a number of years, because the federal government has 
taken initiatives affecting the whole aviation industry. It all started 
in the 1960s. I am referring for instance to the development of the 
Mirabel airport, denounced from the start by local residents, who 
were strongly opposed to this project. Agricultural land was taken 
away from them. No compensation measures are planned either 
concerning any decision ADM could make today.
<P>
	This bill is being discussed in a context of deregulation, because 
Canada is involved of course in the economic globalization 
process. All air transportation corporations are also affected.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	But Canada's approach is more akin to the approach taken by the 
United States and Japan, the only two exceptions. I will come back 
to this later.
<P>
	Moreover, in a context that I would describe as totally off the 
cuff and very short-sighted, most countries favour having only one 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3399"> 3399 </A></B>
<P>
national carrier, while here, we now have Canadian Airlines, 
through generous outlays. We are competing among ourselves, 
with the result that we know: Canadian is practically owned by 
American  interests and, at this rate, Air Canada will not be able to 
withstand Canadian's competition and will also be taken over by 
American interests, leaving Canada without a national carrier.
<P>
	In this whole context of deregulation and privatization, the Bloc 
Quebecois has nothing against privatization, as we feel that the 
state is not necessarily the best able to handle certain things, which 
the private sector is much better equipped to handle. It is not the 
case in every area, but in this particular area and most trade areas, 
the private sector is in a better position to act than the state.
<P>
	In the past, we have taken a stand in favour of privatizing Air 
Canada, the same way we took a stand in favour of establishing 
regional organizations to control airports. I am thinking about 
ADM among other organizations, although in this particular case, 
we could have a debate about the mechanisms that should be 
imposed on these organizations to ensure that there is more 
transparency and public debate around the decisions being made. In 
a word, we have no problem with privatization.
<P>
	We do not have any problems either with the regions being able 
to make their own decisions and to administer their facilities in 
areas like air transportation. We do not object either to the fact that 
they will be non profit organizations, or that an organization could 
oversee all regional interventions following certain standards. At 
the beginning, it was thought that some standards applied as well to 
all regional airports and major airports.
<P>
	Obviously, it will not be so with this project, because the rules 
are not clear, especially where safety is concerned. When this 
whole deregulation phenomenon first came up, simultaneously 
with Open Skies, we agreed that air transport had to be within more 
people's reach and more competitive, so that customers would 
eventually benefit, but not at the expense of safety. We have seen 
what happened recently in the Everglades, in the United States, 
where deregulation and privatization are the watchword. The 
company, whose name I cannot recall, had already been the subject 
of seven or eight complaints. It never acted on them, and the 
tragedy happened.
<P>
	Deregulation must be done in a certain way. In this case, it is 
obvious to me that nothing is being done to ensure safety. We will 
tackle the problem of safety by evaluating investments which could 
be made in various regions, which means that the overseeing 
organization will determine the investments to be avoided in a 
particular region, or decide that, because of the market, the local 
organization cannot afford the best equipment. But, if an 
organization cannot afford the best equipment or has a difficult 
financial situation, it does not mean that the life of those who 
would use the equipment in regions or even in major airports is 
worth less than it would be if the organization could afford such an 
investment.
<P>
	I was about to say that the costs are the same for everybody, but 
it is far from being the case, because, where deregulation is 
concerned, there are such aberrations where the only factor 
considered is the number of clients. One often realizes that it is less 
expensive to fly Montreal-Paris than Montreal-Chicoutimi. 
This has a little impact on the economic development of these 
regions. It is a complete aberration. I remember once, at the 
Quebec City Airport, Air Atlantic, Air Alliance and Inter-Canadian 
all had flights at the same time, but I was the only passenger 
boarding the Air Alliance plane. I was given a private course on 
safety measures.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	This made no sense; it was improvised. We cannot play with 
people's safety. This is unacceptable. I find it hard to understand 
why the government would introduce a bill that leaves aside the 
issue of safety, on the ground that those in charge will make good 
decisions because they are responsible people.
<P>
	I am not saying those who will be appointed and who will 
manage the agency will be irresponsible. I am simply saying that it 
is the state's responsibility to provide safety measures, just like it 
does in the case of land and marine transportation. We had a debate 
on Coast Guard services. How can we not intervene in a fair and 
responsible manner when air safety is concerned?
<P>
	The language issue is the other reason why we oppose the bill. 
Again, the bill does not provide anything to ensure the use of both 
official languages. As I said earlier, this is reminiscent of a battle 
dating back to the sixties, a battle that resulted in a victory, around 
1976, for the Association des Gens de l'Air du Québec.
<P>
	The association argued that it was no more dangerous to fly an 
aircraft and to have an air traffic controller speak 
French-particularly when French is the controller and the pilot's 
mother tongue-than to have them communicate in English. It 
seems to me that, in tense situations, one can better communicate 
in his or her mother tongue than in a foreign language. Of course, 
this implies that everyone can speak English, the universal 
language in the aviation sector. But this should not prevent the use 
of French. I suppose that in Mexico they speak Spanish, in Portugal 
they speak Portuguese, and in Italy they speak Italian. Just try to 
convince Italians that it is dangerous to communicate in Italian in 
their country.
<P>
	The battle fought in the sixties and seventies is not over, as 
evidenced by the fact that the Magdalen Islands are still served by 
Moncton, where communications are in English. The islands are 
not served by Montreal. To this day, the situation remains 
unsettled. We are told that no efforts will be made to settle it and, in 
addition to this, there is no guarantee in the bill. We can only rely 
on the good faith and the good will of those who will manage the 
agency.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3400"> 3400 </A></B>
<P>
	We have had to rely on good faith for years and we now 
question the value of this approach. We no longer believe in it. 
We would rather have firm guarantees. It is clearly unacceptable 
that this bill contains no provision concerning the French 
language, yet the Prime Minister keeps talking about the rights 
of francophones and of minorities, and often uses them like pawns 
in his political games.
<P>
	How can they justify reverting to the situation we had in the 
past? How can they forget about that victory our air controllers won 
in 1975-76, and not include in the mandate of the agency that will 
control all air traffic in Canada an indication that francophones 
should be able to use their language in air transportation, just like 
all peoples in the world can use their own. This is a step backward. 
But maybe they are suggesting that using French is not dangerous 
in France, but would be in Quebec. This is the height of absurdity.
<P>
	I would now like to turn to the capacity of small airports. Is there 
any guarantee that, at these two levels, small airports will have 
access to services in French and will also abide by the usual 
security standards in order to meet the needs of the public and 
avoid the disasters experienced in countries which have undergone 
indiscriminate deregulation?
<P>
	The fact that small air carriers did not have a say in this bill 
means that de facto if not de jure the control over this agency will 
be completely in the hands of those who use it, who are financially 
stronger and have more influence. In other words, those in control 
will be the two big companies which are now experiencing 
difficulty because of deregulation, Canadian and Air Canada. We 
should not forget that American Airlines is the real owner of 
Canadian, and that Air Canada could very well meet with the same 
fate.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	This means the whole spirit of indiscriminate deregulation we 
saw in the United States might be imported here at our expense, 
through an agency set up by the government, without warning, 
even though we are warning the government there is danger at both 
levels.
<P>
	For small carriers too, regions will be in a position of 
dependence. Of course, we cannot expect the same air traffic at 
Chicoutimi as at Dorval, nor at Kapuskasing-if there is an airport 
there, but I guess there is one-as at Pearson. There are surely 
fewer scandals at Kapuskasing than at Pearson, so we will not have 
to debate over three years the issue of who benefited or not from 
the manoeuvring that went on about Pearson.
<P>
	Leaving things to unthinking market forces is not what the spirit 
of deregulation is all about. Government has to withdraw from 
certain areas, we agree, but government must not disappear; 
government has a regulatory role to play to see that things proceed 
in a civilized way and that people's needs are taken into account. 
People living in  remote regions should not have to pay more to 
travel than people living in large urban areas do. Some adjustments 
are to be expected, but surely they should not have to pay a higher 
cost to go from Montreal to Chicoutimi than to go from Montreal to 
Paris. That does not make any sense.
<P>
	It must be said also that the safety of passengers has as much 
value in the Magdalen Islands as at Pearson, and that francophones 
have as much rights as anglophones, otherwise we are only talking 
nonsense. We will hear fine speeches about national unity, about 
modernizing government, but the bottom line is that we will go 
back to where we were when government was not sufficiently 
involved. There is too much government interference now, but the 
solution does not lie in having the pendulum swing from one 
extreme to the other.
<P>
	In this case, the pendulum just swung back to the other extreme 
where we trust the market and people's good faith implicitly and 
where we do not have any standards, particularly in the areas of 
safety and language.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have two points I wish to put to 
the hon. member opposite.
<P>
	He says there are no protections for the French language, as 
others in the Bloc have said. He ignores the fact that article 20 of 
the Nav Canada bylaws requires the corporation to comply with the 
Department of Transport practices and procedures with respect to 
bilingualism with regard to the Canadian air navigation service in 
effect as of the date of incorporation, a year ago last month, and to 
comply with any provision of the Official Languages Act. There 
are respect and protections for the French language in Bill C-20. I 
assure the member of that.
<P>
	On a more important note, again the Bloc brings into question 
this issue of the Aéroport de Montréal and its role as the local 
authority, charged with the responsibility of operating the airports 
at Dorval and Mirabel.
<P>
	It is passing strange the raison d'être of Bloc Quebecois is to 
relegate to provincial authority as much control from the federal 
institution on matters of social and economic policy. When the 
federal authority transfers responsibility like the operation and 
management of the airports to local authorities, the ADM, the Bloc 
says ``no thank you, the local authority does not have the 
competence to handle the issue on these two airports and the 
federal government should step into this issue''.
<P>
	Which way does the Bloc want it? It cannot have it both ways.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, we want something concrete, 
besides the application of the Official  Languages Act. In fact, we 
could go on at length about the application of the Official 
Languages Act. Yes, we do have an act, but do French speaking 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3401"> 3401 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians outside Quebec control their schools? Do they have 
control over their schools? Do they have a budget?
<P>
	Some of the prairie provinces even received money from the 
federal government, pursuant to the Official Languages Act-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> The members opposite could have the courtesy to 
listen to me, Mr. Speaker, since I listened to them.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	Pursuant to the Official Languages Act, the federal government 
gave money to some of the prairie provinces, which used it for 
other purposes. Their French speaking residents are not getting any 
services. Where the Official Languages Act is concerned, if we do 
not provide for any concrete measure, we will end up with a 
situation like the one in Kingston, where the residents fought for 
three years to get a washroom installed in a high school.
<P>
	If the Official Languages Act is not respected in the education 
field, can you imagine what will happen when we go up in the air. 
We need more concrete measures.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> You are avoiding the ADM question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe: </B>Now, about ADM. We never questioned ADM's 
right to make a decision. Never. That is not what we said. The 
member should listen when we talk, but he never does, he is too 
busy talking at the same time as we are. If he were to listen, he 
would realize that the lease between ADM and the federal 
government specifies the decisions that can and should be made by 
organizations such as ADM, although for that to happen we need 
some kind of process for the information and the analyses to be 
released and a forum to discuss these issues.
<P>
	As for the role of government, first, the government should 
withdraw from the areas that do not concern it, but, second, it 
should not drop everything and then try to hide behind market 
forces. The government has to set a number of rules.
<P>
	Of course, as my hon. colleague said, we are asking the federal 
government to withdraw from a number of areas and we do not 
deny that. In a sovereign Quebec, I, for one, would not want the 
state to interfere and try to replace the private sector, but some 
rules have to be set and as long as we remain part of Canada, unless 
we are told that we no longer belong-in which case things could 
be settled pretty fast-we think that an issue as important as air 
safety, even among two sovereign countries, should be included in 
agreements signed by more than one country, because, as you well 
know, borders do not stop planes.
<P>
	The Prime Minister of Canada was the only one who had a 
problem with the high speed train. He said that the  train would 
have to stop at the border. I do not know if the Prime Minister has 
to stop at the borders when he travels by plane, but if he does travel 
a little bit, he must know that borders and customs issues are settled 
either on departure or on arrival, but not in the air or in the middle 
of the tracks.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I note 
that the member was quite concerned about maintaining air traffic 
safety in this country. I am glad to hear that because I hope we all 
are.
<P>
	My colleague from Edmonton Southwest meant that English is 
the language of aviation for safety purposes, not that English wants 
to dominate, but English was the language that was chosen. If we 
are going to allow any language such as French, Spanish, Italian, 
Greek, Russian, Chinese, Vietnamese, or whatever, how are we 
going to be able to communicate with each other and ensure safety 
which the member said he was concerned about?
<P>
	Has the member thought about that, or is he just trying to 
promote his line of thinking, which is that French has to be up there 
with English in every situation around the world? Has he thought 
about that or is he just trying to make some noise to get his point 
across?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Madam Speaker, my colleague is only late by 
some 30 years. We discussed it here and we passed the Official 
Languages Act. I would like him to go to Italy and explain to 
Italians that it is dangerous to speak Italian in Italy. Let him try that 
with the Russians. You know, languages other than English are 
spoken in these countries, not better nor worse, only different.
<P>
	There are countries where English is not spoken and aircraft still 
fly there. However, ICAO decided on a common language. When 
pilots who do not speak Italian arrive in Italy, they do not get a 
crash course in Italian while waiting to land. They use English as 
well as the Italian controller. This is part of the operating standards.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	Of course, we agree that English may serve as the common 
language in air transportation when the pilot does not speak the 
language of the country. But of course, it is another when pilot and 
controller both speak the same language. This is the norm in all 
countries except in the land of the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Madam Speaker, we 
are hearing absolutely incredible things in the House today. We are 
getting back at the linguistic debate. We wanted to talk about the 
issue of security, and we have taken for granted that French had its 
place in the air in Quebec, but our colleagues beside us want to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3402"> 3402 </A></B>
<P>
debate the linguistic question again and are saying that  French 
should be eliminated. I will not get into that debate because it is 
obsolete.
<P>
	I would prefer to point out the intervention of my colleague for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie, who was quite eloquent. He said 
something that I found interesting and really true. He said that, at 
some point in time, he was the only passenger aboard an Air 
Alliance plane, probably a DH-8 that can seat approximately 30 
people. That illustrates very clearly the problems of small carriers. 
You see, a big carrier servicing the Vancouver-Montréal line has no 
problem because its planes are 80 per cent full most of the time. 
They have big planes that cost a lot of money, but there are a lot of 
passengers. So, they are profitable.
<P>
	But, in regions, the reality is much different. The planes take off 
even if there are only one or fifteen passengers aboard. It does not 
mean that that sole passenger is not important. That passenger must 
be flown to Montreal. There is an air service between Montreal 
and, for example, Alma, which is also in my riding. This service is 
very important and very costly, in terms of privatization, because 
small carriers have very high costs even if they have only a few 
passengers. That explains the price of plane tickets. And this is my 
concern because small carriers are finding it hard to survive, due to 
the situation mentioned by my colleague and that small carriers 
experience every day. We will have to think seriously about it.
<P>
	Therefore, the question I put to my colleague concerns the fact 
that Nav Canada will not be accountable to the government, just 
like ADM is not. A board is set up and the government says that if a 
bad decision is made, it is not its problem because it was taken by 
the Nav Canada board. I would like our colleague to talk a little 
about the problems that that may cause, since he knows better than 
me ADM's situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Madam Speaker, there are two aspects that must 
be given special consideration when commercializing government 
services. First, the bureaucracy that characterizes so often the 
public sector must be eliminated. So, I do not think that there will 
be endless consultations. To avoid that, there needs to be a series of 
standards and the area, jurisdiction or issue that is transferred under 
private sector control must be regulated.
<P>
	There must be standards against which the decisions can be 
evaluated. There must also be a complaint or consultation 
mechanism to determine if those standards are adhered to. That is 
what I think is missing in the bill. There are no specific standards 
concerning the use of French and even less concerning air safety.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have accepted to take part in the third reading 
debate of Bill C-20 because it is a bill that I  am most interested in. 
One of the reasons is that it creates Nav Canada, a non-profit 
corporation, which will allow the government to apply $1,5 billion 
to deficit reduction. It is also because the Bloc Quebecois thinks it 
is a good idea to privatize air navigation and to have competent 
people to provide these services.
<P>
	However, we have some concerns about this bill. The most 
important one, I think, is the fact that we do not see in this bill a 
clear political will to give priority to passenger and crew member 
safety as well as to the safe transportation of goods. In my opinion, 
this is a rather important issue. Personally, even though I travel 
almost every weekend from Ottawa to my riding and back in small 
aircrafts, I have not yet gotten over my fear. So when I see that the 
government is creating such an organization without including 
explicitly in its mandate the requirement to ensure passenger 
safety, there is cause for concern. One of the things we can expect 
from a society is to protect the people.
<P>
	The official opposition also has a problem with the appointment 
of the 15 members of the board of directors. My colleague from 
Lac-Saint-Jean, with his experience, has underlined in his speech 
the importance of small air carriers and of the Association 
québécoise des transporteurs aériens, whose interests will not 
necessarily be taken into account by this board of directors.
<P>
	It is hard to think that the 15 members of this board, the majority 
of which will represent large carriers, will really care about small 
carriers. In establishing rates, who will they be thinking about? 
Normally, they will make decisions that are to their advantage and 
nobody will be there to defend the interests of small carriers.
<P>
	For instance, if the small carriers had been given equal footing, it 
would have been possible for the Association québécoise de 
transport aérien to be represented, so that the 15 people would have 
included someone with the mandate to see that the French language 
was well represented on the board and properly defended across 
Canada.
<P>
	The French language received a great deal of attention earlier. 
Several of my colleagues mentioned it in their speeches, and some 
of our colleagues across the way or beside us are surprised that we 
are raising the issue. Of course, the bill states clearly that Nav 
Canada will be subject to the Official Languages Act. But, Madam 
Speaker, you yourself are in a good position to know, coming from 
an officially bilingual province, that we do not always take the 
trouble, on a daily basis, to defend our rights and see that they are 
respected. There is a tendency, with the French language being the 
minority language in every group, to forget that French even exists 
and to begin speaking English and conducting all our affairs in 
English.

<P>
	It is not because Nav Canada releases all its proceedings, reports 
and press releases in both languages that it is a truly bilingual 
organization that really cares about respecting the language of the 
minority. In the current context-and since the past has a tendency 
to repeat itself-it seems pretty hard to believe that the French 
language is very safe with Nav Canada.
<P>
	Every year since that law came into effect 25 years ago, the 
Commissioner of Official Languages, who is always biased in 
favour of the English language, still manages to write several pages 
or paragraphs of his reports on the flaws in the implementation of 
that law with respect to French. He has done so every year for 25 
years.
<P>
	Since there is no guarantee in that regard, you can understand 
why, although we in the Bloc Quebecois basically agree with the 
creation of Nav Canada, we are opposed to this bill, which does not 
give us all the guarantees in that regard.
<P>
	We could go on discussing this problem for a very long time, but 
if we listen to some of the members in this House-for example, I 
read again with interest the comments made by the parliamentary 
secretary-I understand that Transport Canada will remain 
responsible for setting the safety regulations and standards 
applying to this new corporation and for monitoring operations to 
ensure compliance.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois wanted this bill to specify that safety had 
priority over all commercial decisions made by Nav Canada, but all 
the amendments proposed by the Bloc were rejected. One of our 
amendments had been accepted by the committee, but it 
disappeared as if by magic when we got to the vote at the 
committee report stage.
<P>
	Speaking of committee work, one may wonder why the House 
bothered to create these committees. Perhaps to give the illusion 
that this is a democracy. These committees can ask people to 
testify, hear witnesses and travel across the country. These 
committees can travel and meet people across the country or they 
can get people to testify at a hearing here in Ottawa, but when the 
government makes a decision, no one can change its mind because, 
with its large majority, all it has to do is vote against all the 
amendments proposed by the opposition, even if many of them 
were designed to improve the situation. They were not designed to 
undermine the bill. On the contrary, we wanted to make sure 
certain important elements would be included in the bill, but they 
were not.
<P>
	Once again, the government is turning a deaf ear to everything 
we propose. It seems important also to look at another bad habit 
this government has. It will become obvious with another bill 
coming up for debate in this House, but let me just say that the 
government has this  funny little way, every time it brings in a bill, 
of providing for exemptions in the legislation. This time, National 
Defence is exempted from the charges.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Given the number of DND aircraft that will fly in Canadian 
airspace and use our airports and the air navigation services they 
provide, by deciding to exempt the Department of National 
Defence from the application of this bill, the government itself is 
depriving Nav Canada of an important source of revenue. At the 
same time, the government is asking Nav Canada, this not for profit 
corporation, to balance its budget, while depriving it from the start 
of an important source of revenue. I wonder why the government is 
doing this.
<P>
	Required to act, it does away with a function by transferring it to 
a private sector corporation and tells this corporation it shall be a 
not for profit corporation, which in itself is excellent. For once, the 
government is not privatizing for the benefit of some friends of the 
government, but rather putting local stakeholders in charge of 
operating the air navigation system, which is already giving it half 
a chance of succeeding.
<P>
	However, the government is telling the new corporation it has to 
cough up $1.5 billion to start up. While the government may offer 
interesting terms and conditions, as a client, it will be exempt. The 
Canadian government's reasoning is really hard to follow, because 
one has to wonder how it will manage to make up for these massive 
revenues it will be forfeiting.
<P>
	In a different but related vein, the Bloc Quebecois suggested 
many amendments to the government right from the start. We 
requested changes regarding the corporation's board of directors. 
We asked that efforts be made to ensure safety and security. But 
each and every time, the government denied our requests. The 
result is that problems will surface for small carriers in the various 
regions of the country, including companies that fly tourists. These 
small carriers will find themselves in difficult situations.
<P>
	We seem to be the only ones interested in carrying on the debate 
but, believe me, we are not trying to kill time. We know we have a 
very important agenda involving other issues. However, we are 
using the few minutes at our disposal to tell the public, and to 
convince our fellow members, that the bill presents a danger, since 
it is not specified in Nav Can's mandate-the agency that will 
manage air navigation services in Canada-that the safety of 
passengers, airline personnel and the public must have priority.
<P>
	Be that as it may, I want to point out one aspect of the bill which 
may be somewhat unfair. New companies or newcomers relying on 
Nav Canada must not be adversely affected. Priority must also be 
given to regional development. I am thinking of a region like mine. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3404"> 3404 </A></B>
<P>
The  airport is currently managed by the federal government, but it 
will be transferred to the private sector.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Negotiations are ongoing which should help resolve this issue in 
the near future. However, since Nav Canada will be responsible for 
the control tower and another private corporation will be 
responsible for managing the Mont-Joli airport, if, for example, the 
board of directors of that corporation decides that it needs new 
equipment in the control tower to promote airport expansion and 
regional development, that decision will have to be approved by 
Nav Canada.
<P>
	Since Nav Canada's first concern will be to balance its budget, it 
is likely that both corporations will have conflicting objectives. 
Therefore, Nav Canada could say, for example, that unfortunately 
it cannot approve the acquisition of such equipment because the 
volume is not sufficient. That would have a direct negative impact 
on the development of our region.
<P>
	We will find ourselves in situations like that, where it will be 
difficult to make a decision because we will likely have a problem 
with regard to the number of passengers.
<P>
	My colleague who spoke before me mentioned that it happened 
to him to be the only passenger on a plane. Unfortunately, we know 
that, in the regions, Canadian carriers compete in a rather stupid 
way. For example, instead of having two flights in the morning at 
different times, they have two flights that leave within five minutes 
of each other just to try to compete. Very often, one of these flights 
leaves with very few passengers on board. I have travelled very 
often between Ottawa and Rimouski on flights that were half-full 
or half-empty, whichever you prefer.
<P>
	When the situation gets this bad, it means that things have to 
change if we want to have air transport in the regions once again. 
We need it but we have lost it, mainly because of the fares we have 
to pay to support trans-Atlantic flights. Studies have shown that, 
unfortunately, regional fares are very high to compensate for lower 
fares on trans-Atlantic flights.
<P>
	It is also known that all flights departing from or arriving in 
Ottawa are more expensive than others since the main purchaser of 
plane tickets is the Canadian government. Even when all carriers 
lower their fares, they make sure that these reductions do not apply 
to flights between Ottawa and the regions so that they can make as 
much money as they can.
<P>
	We will find ourselves in a somewhat difficult situation in terms 
of development. Unfortunately, we will have to see this new 
corporation in action but, as you already know, we will not support 
this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to quickly address a 
couple of concerns brought forward by the hon. member.
<P>
	The Bloc worries that a facility at a smaller airport could be 
closed down because it is not profitable. This concern is probably 
based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of Nav 
Canada.
<P>
	Nav Canada is a not for profit entity. Its focus will be on whether 
particular services are necessary for safety and wanted by the users, 
not on the profitability of such services. Financial consideration 
become relevant only in so far as the needs of the users are affected 
and their willingness to pay for these services.
<P>
	However, if a particular service is required in the interests of 
safety, and I heard the hon. member address this point too, it will be 
provided. It will be required regardless of the financial 
considerations.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	What about air navigation services at local airports? There are a 
number of air navigation services at existing airports that are not 
required under the criteria laid out by Transport Canada. It is 
reasonable to assume Nav Canada would try to rationalize some of 
those services, although it does not mean safety or even levels of 
service will suffer.
<P>
	With constantly improving technology it is possible to provide 
the same or even better levels of service from centralized facilities. 
In all such cases the corporation will be required to consult widely 
before acting. It has to provide due notice and it has to establish 
with Transport Canada regulators that the proposed change in 
service does not affect safety. These are all the provisions built into 
Bill C-20.
<P>
	Unfortunately I did not see the hon. member at committee. I 
understand we cannot attend all committees but we do have our 
concerns.
<P>
	Nav Canada is a not for profit corporation, not a company going 
out to take over the air navigation services from the government 
trying to make big money. That is not the object of Nav Canada. I 
hope with these assurances the hon. member will see fit to support 
the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to hear my hon. colleague continue to repeat, since 
this is not the first time that he says so in the House, that Nav 
Canada will have safety as its priority. It is clear to us. We said we 
approved the idea of creating a non profit agency. There was never 
any doubt about that. We think it an excellent idea.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3405"> 3405 </A></B>
<P>
	When people came before the committee to explain the bill in 
more detail, we asked them whether Nav Canada's mandate 
provided a guarantee or a clause giving safety priority over a 
balanced budget. The answer given in committee was the budget 
had to be balanced.
<P>
	According to the information I have obtained, Nav Canada's 
mandate gives priority to passenger, personnel and cargo safety. 
This fact was never mentioned in committee. If in fact it does, I 
wonder where it is set out, because we did not see it in the bill, and 
there was no mention in committee.
<P>
	Now, with regard to our concern that Nav Canada will hinder the 
development of certain regions, I have only to look at what is 
happening in my own riding. Air transport has dropped, and prices 
have risen. In order to spend a weekend in my riding, I have to pay 
twice the cost of a trip between Montreal and Paris. There are 
extras and conditions that block the development of an airport like 
that of Rimouski.
<P>
	On top of that there is the non profit organization that, in order to 
balance its budget, may forego buying certain equipment. 
Everything develops quickly. Today's high tech will perhaps give 
us the means to manage our control towers much more effectively 
than we do at the moment. As we know, however, the price of such 
things keeps going up. So perhaps Nav Canada will hinder the 
development of a region like mine-not only my region, but a lot 
of similar regions-where there are low traffic airports. Nav 
Canada is an operation whose prime concern may not necessarily 
be safety, and this is one of our basic concerns.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, my colleague from Rimouski-Témiscouata has 
rightfully pointed out the impact of language on safety. Before her, 
my parliamentary leader mentioned the airspace over Magdalen 
Islands, where pilots cannot receive services in French because 
these islands are served by a base in Moncton.
<P>
	I think my parliamentary leader does not have to go as far as the 
Magdalen Islands to find a case in which the Official Languages 
Act is not being complied with. All he has to do is stay here on 
Parliament Hill where, a few days ago, I received from the office of 
the clerk of the transport committee an eight-line text with five 
errors in French.
<P>
	How can we believe that French is respected in this country after 
receiving such texts?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that we may 
seem a tad touchy on the linguistic issue. There is no denying it can 
always be argued that there is the Official Languages Act. But as I 
and many of my hon. colleagues have said, and will keep repeating 
for as long  as we are in this place, the French language is in peril in 
Canada.
<P>
	Commendable efforts are made by everyone involved in 
transcribing speeches and committee proceedings, but still, all too 
often and in the case of some offices more than others, clearly a 
closer attention ought to be paid to language quality.
<P>
	As for the use of the French language in the air transportation 
industry, it can be a major problem. For instance, there are times 
when on a flight from Ottawa to Toronto, not a soul on the plane 
speaks French, including the captain, who may not even understand 
French. An absolutely brilliant solution was found. At the touch of 
a button-we can now have a perfectly bilingual person filling the 
job-a pre-recorded message is played in English or, at the touch of 
a button, a voice explains in good French how to fasten our seat 
belts, what the safety rules are, and so on. Pre-recorded messages 
are used onboard many planes now. The trouble is that, if 
something unforeseen happens, we cannot just push a button and 
hear: ``Take off has been aborted; we are going back to the airport.'' 
These explanations would then have to be given in English.
<P>
	Already, we notice in the transportation industry, and at Air 
Canada in particular, that since being privatized, the company has 
considerably lowered its standards regarding the use of the French 
language. There are now captains who speak English only. They 
would be in big trouble if they were flying an international flight 
and had to land in Paris for example.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate at third reading on Bill C-20, an 
Act respecting the commercialization of civil air navigation 
services.
<P>
	Let me first say a word about my personnel flying experience. I 
am not very brave when it comes to flying. I only do so out of 
obligation, not pleasure. If, in addition to my natural fear, I feel my 
personal safety is at risk when I board an aircraft, I might think 
twice before flying again.
<P>
	Nav Canada was just recently established. Incidentally, we have 
nothing against this non-profit corporation, which will manage 
services that are of public interest. It reminds me of a very similar 
corporation which I will tell you about, because it concerns people 
in my region.
<P>
	Not too long ago, a similar non-profit corporation was 
established to manage services that are of public interest. I am 
referring to ADM. ADM is the corporation managing the Montreal 
and Mirabel airports.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Lately, it made a decision which, personally as member for 
Laurentides, I find totally unacceptable. This corporation, which is 
made up of business persons, is not accountable to the public. Its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3406"> 3406 </A></B>
<P>
members made a decision; they decided to transfer flights to 
Dorval; they decided to invest millions of dollars to develop Dorval 
airport without any public consultation.
<P>
	ADM's decision to transfer flights was arrived at without public 
involvement. Social, economic and environmental impacts were 
not explained to decision makers as a whole, other stakeholders and 
people living in and around the areas concerned. This is funny, 
because this government is telling us about the fine well articulated 
pieces of legislation we have in this great country to ensure its 
prosperity, but it does not abide by them.
<P>
	Not very long ago, the environment minister tabled an 
environmental bill we just could not support. We voted against it, 
but it was passed anyway by the government and is now in force. It 
concerns environmental assessments and overlaps our own 
legislation, the BAPE. In Quebec, we already had something which 
worked very well, but the federal government insisted on passing a 
bill on environmental assessments. This is fine and dandy.
<P>
	And now, with ADM, our hands are tied. ADM goes ahead with 
its decision. We cannot demand that it shows us its assessments. 
We are not asking for new ones, it tells us it has already conducted 
assessments. All we want is to see the results, we want the process 
to be open. Same thing with the economic impact, and the social 
impact as well. What will happen in a region such as mine, the 
Laurentides region, and in the regions of Argenteuil-Papineau 
and Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, represented by two of my 
colleagues? What kind of impact will this have not only socially, 
on the community, but also on employment?
<P>
	Especially when we are told that, within 15 years, operations 
will have to move back to Mirabel. As far as I am concerned, this is 
a decision that does not make any sense. We want facts. Prove to us 
that this is indeed the right decision. Produce the documents we 
have requested, put them on the table so that we can take a good 
look at them, then maybe, we will be in a position to discuss. For 
the time being, there is nothing definite. There is nothing on the 
table and we cannot get our hands on any facts. ADM is seven 
individuals who have made a certain decision.
<P>
	I am not saying that a corporation like ADM or Nav Canada 
cannot make decisions, but I do think that, before creating a 
corporation like Nav Canada, which is already in existence, and 
passing this kind of legislation, in light of what ADM had done, we 
must make sure not to repeat our mistakes the second time around 
with this other not-for-profit corporation.
<P>
	We should take some of the mistakes made par ADM and use 
them as examples to ensure that the same mistakes are not made 
again with another not-for-profit corporation. In privatizing 
services and transferring them to corporations along with the 
decision-making authority, we always run the risk of having 
decisions  made behind closed doors, decisions that I personally 
find undemocratic, as I said earlier.
<P>
	Bill C-20 just created yet another not for profit management 
corporation, which could at any time make the same kind of 
decisions that ADM made, decisions that may not be desirable 
because of the waves they are bound to make and the controversy 
they will cause in the public. I wonder why the government is not 
consulting the public before, instead of having to mend the fences 
after.
<P>
	Here is one of many articles I have gathered on the subject. Let 
us say that, since ADM decided to sue, a flock of people have been 
writing on the subject. This paper on Mirabel reads as follows: 
``The future of Mirabel is closely connected to the future of the 
greater Montreal area, which will not do without its international 
airport''. That was written by Jean Cournoyer.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Mirabel is not bankrupt, on the contrary. Mirabel is profitable 
but remains incomplete because, while the work was under way, 
the conductor did not agree with the concert master on the piece to 
be played. It is still a bold enterprise which, for reasons that do not 
come under its responsibility, ran out of breath before getting to the 
finish line.
<P>
	In 1993, ADM, having done its homework, announced that the 
best solution to the problem of the two airports was to maintain the 
status quo. In 1993, it was the status quo. Three years later in 1996, 
ADM, after redoing its homework, announces that two airports are 
an impediment to traffic growth and proposes to allow regular 
international flights to land in Dorval.
<P>
	As a staunch defender of freedom, I really believe that the main 
concern of an airport is to meet the needs of its clients. But let us 
consider the price we will have to pay to meet the needs of a 
hypothetical clientele: $36.4 million to build a temporary 
international jetty and renovate the international arrival lounge, 
plus $185 million to build a permanent international jetty and 
expand the multi-level parking garage, for a total of $221 million, 
except for the cost of an underground terminal for regular trains 
from Ottawa and Montreal. When I see that this money is to be 
invested over a 15-year period only, I do not understand the 
decision that was made. The people in my region are very 
disappointed in ADM's approach.
<P>
	I now get back to Nav Canada, a non-profit organization. I 
sincerely believe that, in a case like this one-and, again, 
non-profit organizations are an excellent thing, but we must use 
both bad and good examples. Certainly, good things were achieved, 
but mistakes were also made by corporations like ADM. Before 
drafting a bill, we should at least ensure that public safety is 
mentioned in the preamble. That is a priority. Plane crashes are 
often fatal. I think the first thing we must do is to reassure the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3407"> 3407 </A></B>
<P>
people who fly-and who pay good money to do so-that their 
lives are not in danger.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to the comments of the 
hon. member for Laurentides regarding Mirabel airport and ADM. 
She was right on track, because there is an obvious similarity 
between ADM and Nav Canada, as we have been pointing out since 
this morning, and also in recent days. Both are private corporations 
with a mandate to provide services to the public. However, 
privatization has resulted in reduced services to the public. For 
example, ADM is not concerned by the Access to Information Act, 
while Nav Canada is not subject to the provisions of the Privacy 
Act.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member if this is how she sees things, and 
if she feels ADM's decision should be postponed, considering that 
it is not accountable to anyone, regardless of the statement to the 
effect that ADM is free to make its own decisions and is 
accountable to no one in that regard.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	So, my question is: Does the hon. member feel this measure 
should be postponed? Dorval was supposed to close five years after 
Mirabel opened. It did not happen because of a lack of political 
courage, with the result that we now find ourselves in this 
extremely complicated situation.
<P>
	Does the hon. member feel, as I do, that this decision should be 
postponed?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member 
for Blainville-Deux Montagnes. It goes without saying that this 
decision will have to be reviewed.
<P>
	It is totally unacceptable that only seven people make decisions. 
These people were probably influenced by air carriers. Air Canada 
played a role. Pressures were made. Why? Because the process was 
a secret one. Why do we not have the documents and why can we 
not take a clear look at the situation?
<P>
	Something incredible happened. We-the hon. members for 
Blainville-Deux Montagnes, Argenteuil-Papineau and 
myself-brought petitions signed by some 40,000 or 50,000 people 
to the transport minister, who was very nice to us, only to tell us the 
next day that Mirabel was being closed because of the separatists. 
This is some answer. It is very logical and articulate.
<P>
	It goes without saying that we must have access to all these 
documents to review them and to make sure ADM did indeed make 
the right decision. How did it reach its decision? We want to take a 
look at the whole process. Personally, I think Mirabel is the airport 
that should stay open. Sure, Mirabel is in my region, but it has all 
the necessary structures to expand and meet the future needs of 
Montreal and the surrounding regions. A brand new  airport in full 
expansion will be closed to transfer flights to Dorval.
<P>
	I would really like to know how ADM came to this decision. I 
would like to see all the documents and environmental studies. 
Environmental groups in the Dorval region are opposed to an 
increase in the number of flights to Dorval. ADM cannot even 
guarantee-as its spokesperson, Mr. Auger, said in an 
interview-that the number of flights to Dorval will increase. 
``There are X number of flights right now; as for later, time will 
tell''.
<P>
	This situation is very worrisome for people living around Dorval 
airport. Dorval cannot be further developed: it has reached its 
maximum capacity. What will happen? We definitely have to 
postpone, review, examine and analyze the decision to make sure it 
is the appropriate one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mercier:</B> Madam Speaker, since I have the opportunity, I 
would like to take it to point out to my hon. colleague, the 
parliamentary secretary, that this parallel between ADM and Nav 
Canada really is part of the debate, the similarity is so striking.
<P>
	The advantage we have is that, since ADM has been around for 
four years, we can see in advance what will happen with Nav 
Canada by looking at what is happening with ADM. What is 
happening with ADM is that a decision has been taken that is not in 
the public interest and we cannot even get any explanations.
<P>
	Do you know what will happen with Nav Canada? A few years 
down the road, you will see it take a decision dictated by financial 
interests, contrary to the public interest. Nav Canada will give the 
minimum notice required under law, since our amendments calling 
for more specific notice were rejected, and will take its decisions, 
without providing any explanations. And we will not have a leg to 
stand on, and, on that note, I will take my seat.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Madam Speaker, I would just like to conclude by 
saying that the comment made by my hon. colleague's is perfectly 
sound. That is what I was saying earlier: this should be used as an 
example for future reference, including as regards Nav Canada. We 
must therefore be able to examine what the same kind of not for 
profit corporations have done right and where they have gone 
wrong.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	We must also be sure that the individuals who sit on those boards 
are honest. We must ensure a good representation of all 
stakeholders in all regions. And when a decision is made that is 
inconsistent with the public interest, we must be able to turn things 
around, by reversing this decision or improving on it, something 
we cannot do at present. Nothing of the sort is provided for 
regarding ADM. There are obviously connections to be made 
between the two.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3408"> 3408 </A></B>
<P>
	I hope that public safety will take precedence so that everyone 
can take the plane safely and without fear. I often travel by plane 
and I am very worried. I hope that the government will support 
our amendment so that this aspect is covered.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I will go on in the same vein as my colleague from 
Blainville-Deux-Montagnes. ADM's decision to transfer flights 
from Mirabel to Dorval raises not only the issue of increasing 
pollution and air traffic but also that of public interest. The problem 
with Mirabel is that ADM decided it was worthwhile to invest 
hundreds of millions of dollars in order to improve Dorval, 
forgetting that Mirabel is still there, that a lot of money has been 
invested in that airport.
<P>
	As you know, it was the Liberal Party, under Mr. Trudeau's 
leadership, that saw to it that Mirabel got built. In transferring all 
flights to Dorval, ADM is forgetting that Mirabel is still a problem 
as that airport should also be developed. Negotiations about 
Mirabel must resume within eight to ten years. More money will 
have to be invested.
<P>
	The decision to transfer flights from Mirabel to Dorval is a bad 
decision that does not take into account the interests of the public 
and of the people of Montreal. In the very short term, it is simply a 
stopgap solution. The obvious solution would be to build a 
suspended high-speed train that can cover the distance between 
Mirabel and Dorval in 10 minutes. The technology already exists in 
Quebec, and it would be an obvious solution as it would allow us 
not only to link Mirabel and Dorval-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Order, please. 
The hon. parliamentary secretary on a point of order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We are 
trying to debate the movement of the air navigation system in 
Canada over to Nav Canada. The hon. member's question is 
completely off topic and way out of line.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> That is not a 
point of order. The hon. member has exactly 30 seconds left in the 
time to make questions or comments and then we are resuming 
debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Madam Speaker, I would reply to the hon. 
member that my comment is related to the issue under 
consideration because ADM is a very good example of 
mismanagement following the decision to put airport management 
and control back in the hands of private enterprise. ADM has no 
respect for Quebec's long term interests.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to this bill at the third 
reading stage. I have already had an opportunity to speak to it at the 
report state and I must state, regretfully, that there has not been 
much change in what I have to say, because most of the 
amendments proposed by the Bloc have been rejected. What I have 
to say has not, therefore, changed a great deal, nor has what I 
already said had very much influence on the debate. When in a 
minority position in a democratic system, we do what the others 
tell us to do, when they feel like it, when it suits them.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	That is the democratic principle for minorities, and a minority is 
what we are in this House. Now, where are we, exactly, with this 
bill? I want to give a quick overview of the key points. I will start 
by pointing out before I go any further that something is happening 
in Canada at this time which merits our attention. Canada is selling 
its ports, its airports, its bridges, its rail lines, its rail cars, its 
navigation systems. A close look indicates that we are perhaps in 
the process of holding a huge clearance sale.
<P>
	This legislation provides the legal framework for turning 
Transport Canada's navigation system over to Nav Canada, a not 
for profit corporation, as it has just been described, created under 
part II of the Canada Corporations Act. It is a follow up to the 
December 8, 1995 agreement in principle between Transports 
Canada and Nav Canada, selling the system for $1.5 billion.
<P>
	The key principles of Nav Canada-four points set out in the 
Act-are that it is to be operated as a legally constituted, 
self-regulated entity operating on a cost-recovery basis. The air 
transportation tax levied on passengers when they purchase tickets 
from or to a destination in Canada will be eliminated in two years. 
During that time, the federal government will make transitional 
payments to Nav Canada based on anticipated ATT revenues. Nav 
Canada will have a commercial mandate to run and manage its 
operations according to recognized commercial practices. Nav 
Canada will set the charges for its services so as to recover all its 
costs from users.
<P>
	My colleague from Rimouski-Témiscouata pointed out that 
military flights would not have to pay these charges and that Nav 
Canada would offer employees transferred from the public service 
the continuation of current collective agreements and the granting 
of successor rights to bargaining agents, as well as equivalent 
working conditions and benefits.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to privatize and commercialize air 
services in Canada by incorporating Nav Canada. Creating this 
organization is, of course, part of Transport Canada's overall 
strategy to modernize transport services in this country. The federal 
government tells us we must support the principles of greater 
effectiveness and lower prices.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3409"> 3409 </A></B>
<P>
	But it is easy to detect the real reason why the federal 
government wants to create Nav Canada. Its main concern is really 
to make air services profitable at the expense of safety and 
regional development. We emphasized this in our speeches 
throughout consideration of this bill.
<P>
	The previous Minister of Transport himself stated that the 
government could no longer afford to pay for adequate air services. 
We therefore wonder, because it has not been proven yet, if the new 
corporation will be able to do better. For the moment, they are busy 
selling off and privatizing, although they have no idea where this 
will take us at the end of the day.
<P>
	The government therefore must create an organization that will 
have on its board of directors representatives of all major airlines in 
Canada at the expense of small regional carriers, as my colleague 
from Lac-Saint-Jean pointed out a while ago, when he talked about 
the impact privatization will have on Air Alma, for example. We 
had hoped that this negative aspect of the bill would be reviewed 
and corrected along the way.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, it was not, in spite of the many representations 
made by small carriers. It is clear that only major carriers like 
Canadian and Air Canada will have a representative with any 
decision power of Nav Canada's board of directors, and this of 
course because our major carriers are in the majority. As my 
colleague, the hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata 
explained, they will probably make decisions based on their own 
interests and needs, at the expense of small carriers.
<P>
	But, as we know, the needs of major carriers are often quite 
different from those of smaller ones. For example, major carriers 
would like fly over fees to be lower than landing fees, while small 
carriers are calling for just the opposite. This tends to suggest that 
decisions on certain matters will require debate on conflicting 
interests on a board where small carriers will always be the 
minority.
<P>
	I am therefore concerned about the impact this will have on the 
economy, tourism and regional development, since small carriers 
operate mostly and for the most part at the regional level. As you 
know, the regions are mainly served by small regional carriers and 
the fact that these small carriers will not be represented adequately 
and that their voice will not be heard when decisions are made can 
only impede long term regional development.
<P>
	Nav Canada will have a monopoly on air navigation services. It 
will slap users with fees and have total control over the fee 
structure. How can we not predict or expect the financial interests 
of major carriers to take precedence over everything else in the 
long run, including public interest and safety? But the need remains 
to ensure that someone is still accountable for safety standards, 
which must be the top priority at all times.
<P>
	I cannot see how the government could oppose this motion 
tabled just recently, when the sponsor of the bill himself, a 
minister, stated in a speech that Transport Canada's top priority 
was to maintain and, whenever possible, to improve the safety and 
security of Canadians. Yet, there is not much said about safety in 
this bill. I do hope government members will stand by the 
statements made by one of their ministers, even though what we 
saw and heard in recent weeks about this bill might lead us to think 
otherwise.
<P>
	It must be understood that Nav Can's board of directors will be 
made up of people from the private sector. These people are, of 
course, interested in having a profitable venture, in making profits. 
When they sit on the board, their primary concern is the impact of 
the decisions on their own companies. This is only normal.
<P>
	It is obvious that this bill is primarily about financial 
considerations. This is why the Bloc Quebecois withholds its 
support for Bill C-20 until a reference is included about safety. This 
legislation favours financial security, instead of the safety of airline 
personnel, passengers and the general public.
<P>
	The air navigation sector does not allow for any mistake, 
because mistakes cost lives. This is an area regarding which the 
federal government can never elude its responsibilities. The 
government has an obligation to give priority to safety. Yet, there is 
no reference in this bill to such an obligation or to any commitment 
to this effect. This is why the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, seconded by the hon. member for 
Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, proposed an amendment, which I 
will read because it accurately reflects the Bloc's position: ``That 
this House declines to give third reading to Bill C-20, An Act 
respecting the commercialization of civil air navigation services, 
because the Bill does not give the safety of passengers, airline 
personnel and the public priority over all other considerations in 
business decisions made by Nav Canada''. Yet, we are at third 
reading stage now.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	For some months now, we have been seeing an increasing 
tendency to give overriding priority to financial considerations in 
all decisions, whether governmental or quasi-governmental. We 
see it in discussions about human rights violations in certain 
countries, when ministers and even our own Prime Minister 
regularly rise in their place to say that, in the final analysis, what 
matters is business law, and other interests will have to take a back 
seat.
<P>
	This makes us think that, in the bill before us, safety issues are of 
secondary importance. That is why we have a lot of trouble 
swallowing it.
<P>
	I would like to mention that we are in agreement with the actual 
principle of privatizing air navigation services, but that we will still 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3410"> 3410 </A></B>
<P>
vote against this bill, because it does  not take into account the 
safety principles that must override all else.
<P>
	We proposed amendments along these lines, amendments that 
we considered important and on which there was unanimous 
agreement, in principle at least, but which were nonetheless 
rejected. All we are asking is that these principles be clearly set out 
in the bill, that they be part of the preamble, and that they serve as 
guidelines for the operation of Nav Canada. Apparently we are not 
going to get this, and we will be voting against the bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it really troubles me that for 
nothing more than political partisan principles, this hon. member 
would come to the conclusion that the reasons why he cannot 
support the bill, and obviously the chief reason why he cannot 
support this bill, is because he feels that the transfer of the air 
navigation system to NavCan would be ``to the detriment of 
safety,'' or ``there is not much talk of safety in this bill,'' or ``the 
principles of safety have not been kept in mind''.
<P>
	Remarks like that from the hon. member opposite are totally 
irresponsible and bordering on fear mongering. I want to explain to 
the hon. member again why safety is a priority of the government 
and why safety regulations have been built into this bill to ensure 
that safety is the number one priority of the government and of 
NavCan, the not for profit agency that will take over air navigation 
services in this country.
<P>
	The supremacy of safety comes through references to the 
Aeronautics Act and regulations made pursuant to that act. I am not 
sure if the hon. member even knows what the Aeronautics Act is. If 
he did he would understand that the supremacy of the Aeronautics 
Act in this bill assures safety. Clause 5 of the bill states that 
``nothing in this act affects the application of the Aeronautics Act''. 
Again, it is a demonstration that safety is the number one concern 
of NavCan and the government when it struck the bill.
<P>
	Clause 14 states that any changes in services or facilities that 
Nav Canada wants to make must be subject to the Aeronautics Act 
and any regulations made under that act that relate to aviation 
safety or safety of the public are again subject to the Aeronautics 
Act, an act that has served this country well, an act that ensures 
safety for the travelling public in this country.
<P>
	Where it was determined that the Aeronautics Act could be 
strengthened, Bill C-20 provides for consequential amendments to 
the Aeronautics Act. Clause 101 of Bill C-20 provides for an 
amendment to the Aeronautics Act to give the minister authority to 
make orders directing ANS Corporation to maintain or increase the 
level of civil air navigation services it provides in accordance with 
such terms and conditions as may be specified in the orders. Clause 
103 provides for a significant maximum daily fine for conviction 
arising from a failure to implement a safety order.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	While Transport Canada was both the operator and the regulator 
of the air navigation system, safety of the system was largely 
governed by internal departmental standards, practices and 
procedures. These internal safety procedures, policies and practices 
are now being given legal effect through part eight of the Canadian 
aviation regulations. These regulations will be in effect prior to the 
transfer of ANS to Nav Canada.
<P>
	If the member wants more, the regulations will also require Nav 
Canada to establish a safety management program that provides for 
an internal system of oversight to ensure the safety provision of 
civil air navigation services.
<P>
	On top of all these safeguards, if that was not enough for the hon. 
member to stop this-I will not go on.
<P>
	ANS will remain subject to independent scrutiny by the 
Canadian Transportation Safety Board, the CTSB. The separation 
of operational responsibility and regulatory responsibility has the 
advantage of offering an arm's length relationship between the 
regulator and the regulated. This arrangement has served the public 
interest well in the case of the regulation of air carriers, aviation 
personnel, aircraft manufacturers and other commercial aviation.
<P>
	Part eight of the Canadian aviation regulations also give the 
minister the right to request the provider of civil air navigation 
services to conduct an aeronautical study when proposing to reduce 
a service. An aeronautical study is intended to demonstrate how 
aviation safety will be addressed. If the minister is not satisfied 
with the results of the study, the service provider can be directed to 
maintain the service.
<P>
	I am not sure if the hon. member opposite was aware of all these 
particulars in Bill C-20. I am sure that if he were, he would not get 
up and start talking about how the bill is to the detriment of safety 
or that there is not much talk of safety in the bill or that the 
principles of safety have not been kept in mind. I assure the hon. 
member opposite they have been.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Madam Speaker, the comment was a very good 
one. I am sure that Canada has legislation applicable to air 
navigation.
<P>
	What we would have liked to have seen done was for there to be 
included in the preamble to the bill a condition making safety a 
priority, so that Nav Canada's board of directors would never lose 
sight of it. This was not done.
<P>
	Earlier in the House we heard about a very specific case of what 
can happen with a private corporation looking after the public 
interest, the example being ADM, which is a body very similar to 
the one being considered. It is a not for profit, private corporation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3411"> 3411 </A></B>
<P>
that will, in fact, look after the public interest. We saw that ADM is 
the solution to a number of problems for the government. There is 
no access to information with ADM, while there would have been 
with the government.
<P>
	We can see, then, that the transfer to private corporations of 
responsibilities that, until now, belonged to the government places 
limits on a number of things. We would have liked to see the 
preamble to this bill include a statement, once and for all, to the 
effect that when Nav Canada's board of directors meets, priority 
will be given to safety of operation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this is more by way of an observation. If the member 
wishes to comment, I would welcome it.
<P>
	During his dissertation and that of most of the Bloc members 
preceding him, the word privatization was used over and over 
again. Also the government used the word privatization in 
connection with the commercialization of air traffic control. There 
is a very real difference between privatization and 
commercialization.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	This is commercialization which is putting the air navigation on 
a self-sustaining, commercial basis. It is not being privatized. The 
essence of privatization is the ability to fail. The air navigation 
system in Canada will not be put into a position where it may fail or 
go bankrupt. It will face no competition. It is being 
commercialized. The net result is the cost to Canadians will not 
necessarily be diminished. It will be taken off the government 
books and run as a private not for profit organization.
<P>
	It will not be allowed to fail. It will have the ability to raise 
prices to ensure it maintains its service, just as the post office has 
done.
<P>
	We need to make a clear distinction over the course of the next 
few years between privatization, which is devolving from the 
government to a private agency which can fail, which has the 
ability to fail, and commercialization, which is taking it off the 
government books and making it self-sustaining.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleague for presenting this analysis. It seems to me that 
throughout the debate we may have been over-using the term 
``privatization'' and there is an essential difference between 
``privatization'' and ``commercialization''. We ought to have used 
``commercialization'', because that is what is involved here, and I 
thank my colleague for making this clarification.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak for a second time on Bill C-20 respecting the 
commercialization of civil air navigation services. First of all, a 
number of Bloc Quebecois members have confirmed that the Bloc 
is not opposed to the principle of creating a quasi-governmental 
body to control air navigation.
<P>
	We cannot, however, merely be yes men and say that yes, the 
principle is a good one, we have no hesitation about it, it is a noble 
principle to ensure quality air service to all Canadians. It is, in my 
opinion, the role of the official opposition to ask questions. Mine 
are specifically related to the needs of the regions.
<P>
	One may wonder why the federal government is getting rid of its 
responsibilities for air navigation. One might conclude perhaps that 
the federal government is not doing a good job. I think there would 
be few members across the way who would dare to say that the 
federal government was not doing a good job. On the contrary, I 
believe that Canada had a very good reputation in connection with 
air control. There have not been large numbers of fatalities that can 
be blamed on negligence.
<P>
	If the government has been doing a good job, why then does it no 
longer want that job? Essentially, people will admit that, for about 
the last decade, the government's policy has been aimed at 
sloughing off its responsibilities toward Canadians onto the users.
<P>
	This is why the Bloc Quebecois has debated longer than the 
government would like, it having thought the bill would be adopted 
promptly. There is one simple reason for this bill, the simple desire 
to transfer to a quasi-private body the responsibility for controlling 
this industry and ensuring Canadian safety.
<P>
	The regions are afraid of those changes. Are they afraid of 
technology or of changes? The regions are not afraid to move 
forward. What they are afraid of is that every time there is a 
change, it results in a reduction of services for them. In Val-d'Or, 
there is a regional airport with certain services, slowly we have lost 
our air traffic controllers. They are no longer needed. Traffic can be 
controlled from Toronto, Montreal or maybe New York or 
Vancouver. It does not matter, everything is possible.
<P>
	We know that technology is far more advanced now than in the 
past, but human errors and instrument errors can still happen 
resulting in safety being of a lesser quality in the regions than in 
Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver or any major airport with services 
and modern and high performance instruments, but where men and 
women look after their quality .
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	In the regions, we are losing out on quality. We have also lost 
airport fire services. Airport firemen are supposedly not that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3412"> 3412 </A></B>
<P>
important since municipal firemen can do the job in case of an 
accident. But, as you know,  in small municipalities, firemen are 
not always on duty and by the time they are called, passengers 
might perish in the flames. To maintain the presence of firemen at 
the airport, as before, could have improved safety.
<P>
	Moreover, with all the changes, the regions lost their weather 
services. Technology might make it possible to call a 1-800 number 
in Montreal, Quebec City, or anywhere in the world to get a local 
weather report. Maybe it can be done in theory, but in practice, the 
weather can change within 15, 20 or 30 minutes and such changes 
can have a great impact on the security of airplane pilots and 
passengers. Therefore, in the regions, changes are frightening 
because they always mean reduced services.
<P>
	Changes also bring an increase in costs for the regions. They say 
we will have the same services, the same quality, but that is rarely 
the case and furthermore, they do not say if there will be an 
additional cost. For example, if pilots want a weather report, they 
have to dial a 1-800 number; we should say a 1-800-$$$ number, 
because it can cost from $4 to $8 to obtain information before 
making a flight plan.
<P>
	Is it logical to have a definition of the user pay principle? 
Nobody can be against that. Those who receive the services will 
have to pay. It was true also when they modified the CN services in 
the regions. The CN was privatized. There were changes and 
services were reduced and now some parts of it will even be closed. 
So any talk about change causes fear in the regions.
<P>
	The Canada Post Corporation is another example of 
privatization. A general outcry slowly rose under the Tories and it 
is still going on under the Liberals. They do not close local post 
offices any more; they wait for the postmaster to retire and they 
simply do not fill the vacancy. This is just like those green boxes 
they installed, saying that they were still providing the services. 
Therefore, in the regions, when they speak about change, we 
always dread some reduction in services.
<P>
	The federal government wants to shun its responsibilities and get 
rid of air traffic control services in order not to have to pay 
anymore. But will Nav Canada replace the government adequately? 
We are asking ourselves some questions. That is why members of 
the Bloc Quebecois are making many speeches on the subject. We 
do not believe the safety of Toronto, Montreal or other major 
airports will be reduced, because it is the role of Nav Canada to 
ensure this safety, but we are concerned that, in the regions, for 
instance, this safety may be overlooked.
<P>
	It is true that, theoretically, regional airports like the one in 
Val-d'Or have satellite or radar air control equipment that is as 
sophisticated as those in Montreal. But, in practice, if we consider 
that the services of firefighters, air control, radio and weather 
systems have been reduced, thus increasing the risk of accidents, it 
is  likely the regions' safety will be decreased. It is mathematical.
<P>
	Moreover, regions are concerned about the way the bill will be 
passed on to them. Just consider what happened in the past. There 
was always a bill, although not necessarily in the first or second 
year. But with limited revenues in the regions, there are not many 
flights. It is not like Mirabel or Dorval, where there are four, five or 
eight flights a day. With these revenues, few airports will afford 
new technologies and, consequently, better safety in the future.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	As I was saying, with a preamble stating that safety would have 
primacy over economy, we would have had a tool forcing Nav 
Canada to provide not necessarily high quality and costly tools 
such as those needed by airports like Montreal and Mirabel, but 
tools that are useful and necessary to ensure safety in the regions.
<P>
	I think the regions are able, because of the balance created by the 
fact that everyone pays taxes, to receive a fair minimum service. 
This is not written in the bill. We would have been in favour of the 
bill if we had been told this primacy would exist.
<P>
	Nav Canada will not endanger the safety of Montreal, Toronto or 
Vancouver airport. After losing the federally managed regional 
services acquired over the years, we now wonder if these services 
will ever come back; the chances are pretty slim.
<P>
	Will we lose the minimal snow removal services? There are 
many questions we could ask. Will our safety depend on the level 
of revenue? If the federal government wants to transfer ownership 
of airports throughout Quebec to the municipalities, will these 
municipalities, because of the costs, be able to assure us that 
runways will be cleared properly? Probably, but the level of service 
will be a little lower than at major airports.
<P>
	To the user pay policy I could oppose a true principle. If the 
regions could receive part of the taxes collected on the price of 
plane tickets, they could perhaps afford to pay for Nav Canada's 
future services. We could then talk about the user pay principle, but 
we would also collect some of the revenue. If the federal 
government can collect the tax revenue, I do not see why the 
regions could not collect part of it to look after their own airports.
<P>
	The regions feel shunted aside by Bill C-20; they feel the 
government is telling them: ``If you do not take control of your 
airports, we will close them''. And it closes them in two ways. The 
municipalities fear that, in the next two to three years, they will be 
forced to take over the regional airports to prevent the federal 
government from closing them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3413"> 3413 </A></B>
<P>
	Should they succeed in taking them over, they will have to pay 
the exorbitant maintenance bills that Nav Canada or another 
government organization will present them with. This would force 
them to close the airports. If, however, we specified in a preamble 
to the bill that safety is paramount, we could help regional airports 
to carry out safe operations. The regions-including my region 
of Abitibi, the North Shore, the Gaspé region, and all the northern 
regions in Ontario and Manitoba-would not have to pay higher 
bills because of the costs of providing services for relatively few 
people.
<P>
	The government was doing a good job in the regions 10 years 
ago, but things have been going downhill. There is a question mark. 
Will Nav Canada take over? We have our doubts. That is why we 
are asking questions and presenting arguments, and why some 
members are talking about regional problems. We talked about 
ADM, which is concerned not directly but indirectly, as it is true 
that there are similarities between Nav Canada and ADM. I think 
that some members are seizing the opportunity to address this 
issue.
<P>
	For the regions, the theory is there. History has a tendency to 
repeat itself. If Nav Canada is not based on the premise that safety 
if paramount, we feel that, sooner or later, our regions will lose 
their airports.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to address one more 
time the issue of safety, particularly the preamble the hon. member 
has been alluding to along with his colleagues in the Bloc.
<P>
	I will not go through it again. I stood after the last speaker and 
explained how safety is our first priority. It is in the bill. Clause 5 
clearly establishes the supremacy of the Aeronautics Act. Clause 
14 provides another example where it requires changes in services 
to be consistent with the Aeronautics Act and regulations made 
pursuant to that act.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	Let us talk for just one moment on the preamble, like the one 
proposed by the Bloc Quebecois in Motion No. 1. Let us first look 
at what that preamble states: ``Whereas the safety of passengers, 
personnel, air carriers and the public has priority over all other 
considerations in business decisions taken by Nav Canada''. That 
sounds pretty good. Why would we not have a motion like that off 
the top of a bill that talks about passengers, personnel, air carriers 
and the public having priority over all other considerations in 
business decisions?
<P>
	There is a reason and it is why the government had to vote down 
Motion No. 1 put forward by the Bloc. The one proposed here is 
silent. For example it does not say a word about the respect of 
safety of private and recreational aviation. It does state air carriers. 
By air  carriers we mean Air Canada, Canadian, the big guys, but it 
is silent on private and recreational aviation.
<P>
	How can anyone ask the government to put in a preamble to a 
bill when it is void of something as critical as private and 
recreational aviation? It is covered in the bill because the 
Aeronautics Act has supremacy. It is in the Aeronautics Act and 
therefore it is covered.
<P>
	Bill C-20 ensures that safety is our top priority. It ensures that 
Nav Canada will ensure that safety is its top priority. The question 
of a preamble is a good one but unfortunately this one was lacking 
and had to be voted against.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Deshaies:</B> I am delighted to see, Madam Speaker, that our 
friend opposite recognizes the need to define security requirements 
for Canadians. Perhaps the Bloc's proposed amendment is broad in 
scope, but that was the intent, to ensure that this matter of 
definition would be debated, since I am speaking basically on 
behalf of the regions-it may be true of other objectives as 
well-but as regards the price set on future security needs, the 
regions will wonder who will be expected to pay for all this.
<P>
	My colleague opposite suggested the airlines might be picking 
up the tab. If the costs were distributed among paying users, I 
would see no problem. The regions would be able to keep their 
airports. But will airport owners be made to pay?
<P>
	I think it is very important to discuss who will pay. I am sure that 
profitable airports like Dorval, Mirabel, Toronto and Vancouver 
might not have any problems adjusting to a new and safer 
technology. However, it may prove to be next to impossible for 
municipalities with zero money in the budget to operate the airport 
to find an additional $50,000 or $100,000 every five years to cover 
an occasional expense to acquire new and safer technology.
<P>
	I think that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Transport was right to point this out. Had debate been allowed on 
this amendement, I think all Canadians would have benefited.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TOBACCOPRODUCTSCONTROLACT">TOBACCO PRODUCTS CONTROL ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for Minister of Health, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-24, an act to amend the Tobacco Products Control Act, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure today to speak on 
second reading of Bill C-24 which will amend the Tobacco 
Products Control Act. Action on the proposed amendment is a key 
element of our strategy for reducing the consumption of tobacco 
products in Canada. Before I address the specifics of Bill C-24, I 
first want to take a few moments to touch on the historical and 
policy context of this legislation.
<P>
	When the Tobacco Products Control Act became law in 1989 it 
set a number of important public health precedents. It phased out 
tobacco advertising. It restricted the promotion of tobacco 
products. It required health warnings and toxic constituents 
information on packages. Finally, the act required manufacturers to 
report information on tobacco constituents and sales to the Minister 
of Health.
<P>
	In passing this legislation, Parliament acknowledged the hazards 
inherent in tobacco use. It acted to protect all Canadians but 
especially youth from inducements to the use of tobacco products. 
To this day Canada is recognized as a world leader for the action it 
took in 1989 to regulate tobacco marketing and promotion.
<P>
	Since the implementation of the Tobacco Products Control Act, 
Canada has been viewed as a model in terms of tobacco control 
measures. Australia, New Zealand, France and Thailand are among 
the countries which have used aspects of the Canadian model, 
including advertising bans, prominent health messages on 
packaging and increased health promotion activities. In some cases 
these countries have gone further than Canada with various 
components of their policies and legislation. Their non-smoking 
policies are based not only  on Canada's experience but also on the 
recommendations of international health organizations such as the 
World Health Organization.
<P>
	As countries co-operate on tobacco control, these international 
agencies have an increasing wealth of data and models to draw 
upon. The World Health Organization for instance recently 
released a report indicating that three million people a year now die 
prematurely from tobacco related causes. If the current trend 
continues, the body count would reach some 10 million deaths per 
year within one generation.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Last September the Supreme Court of Canada ruled Parliament 
had the power to control advertising and promotion of tobacco 
products under the criminal law power of the Constitution. The 
court also found unanimously that the purpose of the act, 
specifically to reduce tobacco consumption, was a valid and 
important health objective, one sufficiently important to warrant 
the limiting of the freedom of expression.
<P>
	However, the court was also of the view that the government had 
failed to demonstrate that some of the measures in the act, in 
particular the total ban on advertising, the restrictions on 
promotion and the inability to attribute health warnings to the 
government, were justified under the charter. As a consequence, 
the majority ruled that large portions of the act were without force 
and effect, including provisions requiring health warnings and 
toxic constituents information.
<P>
	The government accepts the responsibility conferred on it by the 
Supreme Court of Canada decision. It will not allow the 
unrestrained marketing and promotion of a product that kills so 
many Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> We will not hold it against you personally. I 
know there are some jobs a parliamentary secretary must do, 
however distasteful.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> I welcome the commentary of the hon. member 
opposite. It is favourable to the introduction I am presenting. 
Rarely has there been such a clear and compelling case for 
government action, as the member acknowledges.
<P>
	To put matters as simply as possible, smoking kills. The supreme 
court recognized this fact. The warning labels are entirely accurate, 
scientifically correct and vital to Canada's health strategy on 
smoking. They cannot, however, tell the entire story.
<P>
	Tobacco is the only consumer product that has absolutely no 
known benefits, none whatsoever. When used as intended, it can 
cause irreparable damage and can kill those who use it. A couple of 
my colleagues opposite in the medical profession will attest to that 
as well. They will also attest to the fact that research tells us a 
smoker's life expectancy decreases by some seven to eight minutes 
for each cigarette smoked. That is a terrible price to pay.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3415"> 3415 </A></B>
<P>
	Between one-third and one-half of Canadians who now smoke 
will die prematurely as a result of tobacco use. This means that 
over three million people will die an early death because of 
tobacco use. When the Tobacco Products Control Act was 
introduced in 1987 some 72 Canadians died each day of tobacco 
related causes. Today, as we debate some minor amendments to 
the act, the toll has risen appreciably. Today, tomorrow the next 
day and each day in this year on average 110 Canadians will die 
of tobacco related causes. Sadly, we have every reason to believe 
this toll will continue to increase for some time.
<P>
	Tobacco addiction does not take its toll immediately or quickly. 
It often takes some 20 to 30 years for the consequences of smoking 
to manifest themselves. That is why deaths attributable to smoking 
continue to escalate, even though fewer people are smoking now 
than 10 or 20 years ago. From 1989 to 1991 Canadian deaths 
attributed to smoking increased by some 8 per cent to more than 
41,400.
<P>
	Even those who do not smoke can be affected. The United States 
centre for disease prevention and control published some alarming 
findings recently about second hand smoke in a journal of the 
American Medical Association. I point to the study because the 
study is noteworthy for not only its findings but for its sample size 
and its methodology.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	It involved some 10,642 people over four years of age and older 
randomly selected at 81 different sites in 26 separate states. It was 
the first centre for disease prevention and control tobacco study to 
combine blood samples, physical examinations and questionnaires.
<P>
	Using the blood tests of the 10,642 people, the centres for 
disease prevention and control were able to confirm almost 
universal exposure to tobacco smoke even among young people 
and people who never smoked and who do not work or live around 
people who smoke.
<P>
	Their tests showed 87.9 per cent of non-smokers in the group had 
a blood chemistry that indicated exposure to cigarette smoke. Their 
blood tested positive for cotinine metabolic residue from the 
body's processing of inhaled nicotine. There is virtually no other 
source of that chemical than inhaled tobacco smoke.
<P>
	We know from other scientific studies that second hand smoke 
can have 20 to 30 times the carcinogens found in smoke inhaled 
directly through the filter by the smoker. This study confirms those 
carcinogens find their way into the lungs and bloodstream of 
almost everybody, including non-smokers.
<P>
	The centres for disease prevention and control estimated that in 
the United States second hand smoke caused 3,000 deaths annually 
among the non-smoking public and 150,000 to 300,000 cases of 
respiratory infections among children.
<P>
	This is generally consistent with the data available in Canada. 
Here it is estimated that about 330 people each year die from the 
effects of second hand smoke. Almost half of all Canadian children 
under the age 15, some 2.8 million, are exposed to second hand 
smoke on a regular basis.
<P>
	These data provide clear and compelling evidence that tobacco 
use is not a personal choice issue, as the tobacco industry would 
maintain. It is clearly and irreputably a public health issue.
<P>
	The American study clearly shows no one is safe from the effects 
of tobacco smoke. A smoker's decision to use tobacco products has 
demonstrable and negative impacts on the health of those with 
whom the smoker lives and works.
<P>
	This year about 50 billion cigarettes will be smoked in Canada 
with tragic consequences for public health. In addition to the 
human consequences I have already noted there are hidden costs. 
The health care costs of tobacco use are estimated at some $3 
billion per annum. Another $8 billion is lost in absenteeism and 
productivity loss. In short, the personal and public costs of this 
addiction are tragic, pervasive and wholly preventable.
<P>
	If this product were discovered today it would not be allowed for 
use in the marketplace. The government realizes, as did the 
Supreme Court of Canada, it would be impractical and unrealistic 
to ban a product that is part of the daily lives of almost 7 million 
Canadians.
<P>
	At the same time, it would be irresponsible and callous to allow 
unfettered marketing and promotion of such a lethal product. The 
government has an obligation to take appropriate action. The 
government is prepared to act, it is determined to act. It is 
determined to take action, although the solutions to this national 
public health problem are complicated and difficult.
<P>
	Tobacco use is an integral part of the daily life of almost 7 
million Canadians, roughly one-third of the population aged 15 and 
over. Each day in films, magazines and on television tobacco 
products are portrayed as normal consumer products associated 
with contemporary lifestyles. This benign portrayal of tobacco 
products ignores that tobacco is inherently hazardous and 
addictive.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	The length of time between initial experimentation and the onset 
of adverse health consequences is typically between 20 and 30 
years and results in the loss of immediacy that has prompted 
dramatic public reaction to other less threatening public health 
issues. Its addictive qualities make it difficult to quit even when 
smokers know the toll is exacting on their health. Many smokers 
would like to quit but are unable to.
<P>
	Government efforts to reduce tobacco use in Canada involve 
powerful and competing interests in a highly  complex social, legal 
and economic context. The debates on the various pieces of 
legislation regulating tobacco have elicited strong reaction from 
such diverse interest groups as tobacco farmers, manufacturers, 
retailers, printers, artists, cultural groups, health groups and 
average Canadians whose health or families have been affected by 
tobacco use.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3416"> 3416 </A></B>
<P>
	Because of tobacco's unique hazards, the enormous profits 
generated from selling it and the many competing interests 
involved, reducing tobacco consumption and its resulting adverse 
health effects is a challenging task indeed. It involves shared 
responsibilities among the various stakeholders and partners: the 
different levels of government; employers promoting smoke free 
environments among their employees; schools through the 
education of their students on the hazards of tobacco use; parents 
by encouraging their children not to start smoking; and of course 
the smokers themselves.

celebrate.
<P>
	Since the Liberal Party took office, Saint John has lost most of 
its transportation infrastructure. When the Conservative Party was 
in power, a new air traffic control tower was built. Now the 
Liberals have closed it and privatized the airport.
<P>

<P>
	When the Conservative Party was in power, it maintained VIA 
passenger rail service from Saint John to Sherbrooke and built a 
new VIA terminal in Saint John. The Liberals ended VIA service 
and the new terminal is now a hockey training centre.
<P>
	Planes and trains. What next? I guess it is the ports, of course. 
The government is privatizing ports with the idea of ending grants 
in lieu of municipal taxes and terminating the ports police, 
meaning more crime and less money to fight it. As well, ports must 
pay for navigational aids, dredging and ice breaking. This was all 
implemented before a full socioeconomic impact study was 
completed.

it should look at how it has undermined our essential transportation

throughout Italy, the monarchy was replaced by a republic.
<P>
	This marked the end of a war Italy had lost and which had 
destroyed one of the most magnificent countries in the world, but 
also the beginning of a new area for Italy, during which, thanks to a 
lot of hard work, perseverance and joie de vivre, Italians helped 
rebuild their country, which has now become one of the seven

	Canada was one of those countries. Italians found their promised 
land here. They were well accepted and were given an opportunity 
to provide for themselves and for those who depended on them.

	Today I would like to pay tribute to all those Italians who dared 
cross the ocean, and to Canada for giving them a new home. I am

blatantly broke that promise.
<P>

Board in selling that product and now know the support is as much

	The Canadian Wheat Board states it cannot find markets when 
world supplies are at an all time low, prices are at an all time high

not a continual parade of political hacks and political paybacks for

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Varennes tokamak research project has had an 
extremely positive impact to date on the Quebec economy.
<P>
	Announcement that the federal funding of $7.2 million yearly 
will be pulled seriously compromises the very nature of this project 
and is liable to have negative consequences for Quebec, which is 
already at a clear disadvantage when it comes to federal R and D 
investment.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Natural Resources. Last week, 
the minister promised to look into finding alternative sources of 
funding for this project within the federal administration. Can she 
tell us what steps she has taken to find the 7.2 million in funding for 
the Varennes project, so that its survival will not be threatened?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let me clarify for the hon. Leader of the Opposition 
what I said last week in committee.
<P>
	As the hon. leader probably knows, I indicated that the 
contribution agreement under which the federal government was 
funding research at Tokamak, there is the opportunity to terminate 
the agreement with one year's notice. We undertook to exercise 
that right. The one year's notice is in part to provide for an orderly 
transition.
<P>
	I indicate in response to a question from a member from the 
official opposition that during that one-year period I would do 
whatever I could to ensure that orderly transition took place. Make 
no mistake, the transition is to ensure that the federal government 
does not continue to fund the Tokamak project as it has in the past.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister refers to a transition period, but we are very 
much aware of how an announcement like this one by the minister 
about the future of the project can undermine not only the 
motivation of those working on the research project, but also all of 
the tokamak project's longstanding relationships, particularly with 
Quebec businesses.
<P>
	Can the minister commit today in this House to the federal 
government's not withdrawing from the tokamak project before 
finding the $7.2 million required for its survival somewhere else in 
the government's coffers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will not so commit myself. I have made it plain and 
the position of the federal government is consistent and clear.
<P>
	The government has exercised its right to terminate funding 
under the contribution agreement. That federal funding will be 
terminated.
<P>
	I promised that I would appoint someone from my department to 
work with other interested stakeholders to attempt to find 
alternative funding during the year of transition. I stand by that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, may I come to the assistance of the minister with a very 
modest suggestion?
<P>
	The former heritage minister had indicated that the flags and 
kites for Heritage Day would cost $7 million. Does the Minister of 
Natural Resources agree that Quebec needs federal R and D 
funding to generate employment far more than it needs flags or 
kites?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let me reconfirm and reiterate for the hon. Leader of 
the Opposition that my department provides approximately 25 per 
cent of its regional R and D funding to the province of Quebec. In 
fact, that is marginally greater than the population of Quebec.
<P>
	Across the federal government I believe that it provides 
approximately 25 per cent of its R and D funding to the province of 
Quebec. In fact, the federal government has nothing to apologize 
for in relation to its funding of R and D in the province of Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister, in endlessly repeating statistics, must remember that they 
do not apply to Ottawa and that she should perhaps correct her 
geography when she mentions them.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Natural Resources. Given the 
government's significant expenditures for all of its activities, 
Quebecers have a hard time understanding how $7.2 million could 
represent a stumbling block for the federal government, which is 
thus compromising a research and development project that creates 
jobs and is vital to Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3421"> 3421 </A></B>
<P>
	How does the minister explain that it was suddenly so difficult, 
indeed impossible, to come up with $7 million for Quebec's 
tokamak project, when her colleague, the Minister of Industry, 
only a few months ago increased federal funding for the federal 
TRIUMF project in British Columbia by $15 million a year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, we are always happy when members of the Bloc ask 
questions on research and development. It is rare, but sometimes 
they do.
<P>
	On the subject of the TRIUMF project, the former science and 
technology critic agreed with our decision to support TRIUMF. It is 
a totally different matter in the case of tokamak. The opposition 
should be asking about other aspects of science and technology 
matters and about our expenditures throughout the field of research 
and development. We have helped not only Quebec, but all regions 
of Canada.
<P>
	For example, I note we have just received a Quebec astronaut, 
who was in space as a Canadian astronaut. He works at our space 
agency, which is located where? In Saint-Hubert, Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we did 
indeed support the increase in funding for the TRIUMF project, but 
we had no idea then that you would be cutting in Quebec to make 
up for it. The president of the Canadian Association of Physicists, 
Mr. Vincett, has said that the tokamak project had a very high ratio 
of results to dollars invested and enjoyed an excellent reputation 
internationally.
<P>
	In these circumstances, how does the minister explain the 
sudden difficulty in finding $7 million for the tokamak project? Is 
it because it is a Quebec project?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I have said on a number of occasions in the House, 
government is about making choices. Because of the fiscal 
situation in which we find ourselves, the choices are very tough. 
They are not easy.
<P>
	As I have explained before to the hon. member, we had to 
determine our energy research priorities. Fusion is not one of those 
priorities. One, we do not know whether it will ever be 
commercially viable. Two, if it is, it is going to inure to the benefit 
of Quebec Hydro, Ontario Hydro and their customers.
<P>
	I would suggest to the hon. member that-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLellan:</B> Do you want to listen?

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	In grand Brian Mulroney style the federal government is 
planning a first ministers conference behind closed doors with only 
the federal government able to set the agenda. The premiers of 
Ontario and Quebec have said they do not want constitutional 
issues on the agenda and the premier of Alberta has said he will 
walk out if the Constitution is reopened.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	My question is very simple. Since there is no necessity of 
discussing the Constitution, little desire to discuss it and no 
possibility of agreement, will the minister simply agree that 
reopening the Constitution will not be on the first ministers' 
agenda?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the agenda is still under negotiation. We are

privilege to discuss it with the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me 
ask about another item that may be under discussion, the GST.
<P>
	Several premiers say they want to discuss the botched GST 
harmonization and the special payout of a billion dollars to the 
Liberal premiers in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Will the minister agree with several of the premiers that this 
should be put on the first ministers' agenda?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at 
the express request of the Minister of Finance of Alberta, the issue 
of taxation will be on the agenda for the finance ministers 
conference, including the issue of the GST.
<P>
	We also will be discussing the entire area of adjustment policy, 
the way in which the federal government must act when one region 
or another of the country is going through profound structural 
change. That there are differing tax levels, one region of the 
country versus another, is a historic fact. It is something that we 
will be examining at that meeting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we

premiers of Ontario and Quebec and others have asked that this be

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	A few days after he assumed his duties, the Minister of Justice 
met with RCMP investigators in order to provide them with 
information concerning Swiss bank accounts connected to the 
Conservative Party. This morning, the minister has denied being 
behind the Airbus purchase investigation.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us, if it was not he, who within his 
department or the government is behind that investigation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to set the record straight, it is true 
that after consulting with the solicitor general I met on his advice 
with members of the RCMP in late 1993. In early 1994 the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police wrote to me saying that after having 
looked at the information I had given them they had come to the 
conclusion that a further investigation was not warranted and they 
were not proceeding.
<P>
	As to the origins of the investigation into the so-called Airbus 
affair that is now ongoing, I have no idea how or why that began. 
The RCMP tell us according to public statements it commenced 
sometime in 1995. I can tell the hon. member that I did not initiate 
it. I do not know who did initiate it. I am sure the police have their 
sources and their reasons. It is up to the police to conduct police 
investigations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
can the Minister of Justice explain his allowing a letter to the Swiss 
authorities on the Airbus affair to go out over the signature of Ms. 
Kimberly Prost, a senior official in the department for which he is 
responsible, without a check of all of the pertinent information 
concerning this matter?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that matter is before the court. I do 
not think the subject matter of this question is necessarily before 
the court and therefore I feel at liberty to respond.
<P>
	It is a very important principle in the administration of justice 
that attorneys general ought not to be directly involved in police 
investigations. The reason the department wisely did not consult 
me and ask me to go over the letter to Switzerland or to review the 
state of the investigation, to decide whether it should proceed to the 
next step is that politicians and police investigations do not mix.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	Politicians should not run police investigations. That is an 
important principle of law. It is an important principle of 
government. It is fundamental. If I were directing police 
investigations, this House of Commons would be the first place to 
call me to account.
<P>
	That is the reason the Department of Justice wisely did not 
involve me. In fact, in documents that were made public under 
access to information late last year, it became clear from internal 
memoranda that the Department of Justice officials consciously 
decided not to involve me out of respect for that very important 
principle.

Speaker, since the federal government made known its intention to 
invade the securities sector, a sector under provincial jurisdiction, 
the Bloc Quebecois has strongly opposed Ottawa's centralist 
ambitions. This morning, the National Assembly unanimously 
confirmed that it too intends to stop the federal government from 
going ahead with the Canadian Securities Commission.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Will the government 
undertake immediately to respect the unanimous wish of the 
National Assembly and unconditionally drop its plans for a 
Canadian Securities Commission?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>First of all, Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate all the provinces that would 
like to go ahead with standardization in this area. But, it must be 
made very clear that the idea is not to have one, three or four 
commissions, but that it would be much better than having ten 
commissions.
<P>
	This is not a federal government project. In fact, it is being done 
at the request of a number of provinces. We are there to facilitate 
matters, if there is anything we can do to help.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the reality is that the federal government has no business 
in this sector. That is a fact.
<P>
	When you have the president of the Quebec Securities 
Commission, the president of the Montreal Stock Exchange, 
Quebec's chambers of commerce, and now the National Assembly 
all agreeing that the federal government should stay out of this 
sector, it is starting to look like there are very few people in Quebec 
who are in favour of the plan. When even Daniel Johnson rejects it 
out of hand, there is something wrong somewhere.
<P>
	So, I would like to ask the following supplementary: Does the 
minister realize that the creation of a Canadian Securities 
Commission, in addition to being completely ineffective and 
inappropriate, because the provinces can manage on their own, is 
pure interference in an exclusively provincial area of jurisdiction?
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
there is no interference, none whatsoever. Furthermore, nothing 
will be mandatory. If a province does not wish to participate, if it is 
not necessary for it to participate, that province is entirely free not 
to take part. That is very clear.
<P>
	Second, it was the Montreal business community, those who 
issue shares and belong to this group, le Canadien, who asked us to 
do this.
<P>
	Third, I think it would be completely ridiculous, and I am certain 
it is not within the jurisdiction the member is talking about, that if a 
critical mass of other provinces wish to have a national 
commission, Ottawa should refuse to do what the other provinces 
are asking us to do. Is that what the member is saying should 
happen? That would be completely ridiculous.

allocating more fish to the native fishery. Clearly the minister 
thought it was despicable that we could see through the smoke and

<P>
	I have a very simple question for the minister: Is it true that the 
size of the commercial fleet in British Columbia is being slashed

expanded? Yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I said yesterday the priority for salmon fishing is 
escapement, aboriginal requirement for food, ceremonial and 
social fisheries and that is being followed. There is an aboriginal 
fisheries strategy which I think is open to all concerned. There is 
nothing mysterious about it and that has been followed.

downsizing by half of the B.C. commercial fleet, then why is he 
radically increasing the size of the native fishery at the same time?

government policy, a policy that has been negotiated with all 
concerned.
<P>
	I have to remind the hon. member that the steps we are taking to 
revitalize the commercial salmon fishery are well under way and 
should be in place very soon. This will reassure the hon. member 
and his caucus colleagues when they meet on the west coast in a 
couple of days that everything is being done properly. They will 
find it hard to criticize it when the plan works as guaranteed.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	According to a study carried out by the Société québécoise de 
développement de la main-d'oeuvre and submitted to a Quebec 
parliamentary commission in early April, for the 1995-1996 
financial year, Quebec received from the federal government $1.1 
billion for all its training programs and labour adjustment 
initiatives. However, the proposal introduced by the minister only 
provides for $1.95 billion for all of the provinces.
<P>
	How does the minister explain that the proposal made to the 
province of Quebec involves payments way below what the federal 
government invested in 1995-1996 in training and labour 
adjustment programs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, when we address an issue as 
complex as the one the hon. member just raised, we realize that 
there will always be discussions about the money involved.
<P>
	We can talk about the $2 billion announced when the proposal 
was made to the provinces, but there is also the $500 million paid 
to passive recipients of employment insurance.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	There are also the programs financed by the consolidated fund. 
There is no doubt that in the weeks and months to come, if 
agreements are reached with the  provinces, the negotiations over 
the money to be transferred will be quite tricky.
<P>
	I believe that with some good will and transparency-because 
we will clearly indicate the money allocated to each program-not 
to mention that the provinces will insist upon it-we should be able 
to reach an agreement acceptable to all concerned.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
understand that the minister has admitted that the amount of 1.95 
billion does not include, for Quebec, all the money spent last year 
on training and labour adjustment. It does not include, for example, 
the money coming from the consolidated fund.
<P>
	I am glad to hear that because it means-and that will lead me to 
the question I want to ask-that the minister must bring money into 
the discussions.
<P>
	Does the minister not realize that, if he does not bring money 
into the discussions, he will have undertaken an unemployment 
insurance reform that drastically cuts UI benefits under the pretext 
of increasing employment benefits, when in fact workers would be 
doubly penalized because they will have access to fewer labour 
adjustment initiatives?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, from the question put by the 
hon. member, we can see how complex this whole issue is. We will 
have to work together and co-operate to find ways not only to spend 
the money allocated for these programs but also to determine how 
we are going to go about it.
<P>
	In the commitment made by the Prime Minister and the 
government and the proposal made to the provinces, our goal is to 
work in good faith to try and find ways to ensure that the money 
spent goes to help the clients, which is after all the whole purpose 
of this exercise.

	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Vancouver South, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Recently Vancouver proudly hosted a global conference 
sponsored by the International Centre on the Prevention of Crime. 
This conference gave rise to many excellent recommendations.
<P>
	Considering Canadians spend $10 billion on the criminal justice 
system, could the minister tell the House if he intends to pursue any 
of the recommendations made at this conference?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government has a deep 
commitment to crime prevention. We believe the way to have a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3425"> 3425 </A></B>
<P>
strong and effective justice system is to  have tough criminal laws 
that are enforced carefully and to respect the importance of crime 
prevention through early intervention.
<P>
	Some two years ago the solicitor general and I created the 
National Crime Prevention Council, which has been at work at our 
request developing a national strategy for crime prevention and 
preparing a catalogue of best practices in place throughout the 
country to share with municipalities wishing to start crime 
prevention programs.
<P>
	The conference in Vancouver attracted international participants 
and we learned a great deal from their experience.
<P>
	Crime prevention means recognizing the connection between 
social justice and criminal justice. That sometimes means spending 
money and doing things to intervene to get at the causes of crime to 
prevent it.
<P>
	I hope the day is not far off when the government will act on the 
recommendations of the Horner committee, an all-party committee 
of the House, which four years ago recommended we devote 1 per 
cent of our total federal budget for courts, police and corrections 
for crime prevention. We are working toward that goal. I hope the 
day will come in the not too distant future when we can announce 
it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1984 
there were 4,000 youth crimes reported in Canada. In 1994 there 
were 21,000. This is a 187 per cent increase since the 
implementation of the Young Offenders Act. Obviously it is not 
working. Every Canadian knows it is not working. Canadians are 
tired of hearing the minister is waiting for his committee.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	How many more young criminals have to get away scot free, 
how many more young people have to be terrorized before the 
minister makes youth pay a price for these terrible crimes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. member feels 
strongly about this. I respect his concern. I also respect the work he 
does in the justice committee in this connection.
<P>
	In terms of the increase in the number of crimes, one should 
approach those statistics with some caution. Yes, youth crime is up 
and, most troubling of all, violent youth crime is up. However, 
three-quarters of the so-called violent youth crime are level one 
common assaults, pushing and shoving and scuffling in the 
schoolyard which 15 or 20 years ago would never have come to the 
attention of police. Because of the change in the system, the 
reporting practices and zero tolerance they are turning up as 
statistics.
<P>
	There is a challenge to face. The hon. member is a hard working 
and respected member of the very  committee at work right now to
<P>
find ways to improve the Young Offenders Act so that we can better 
deal with that challenge. I urge the hon. member to continue in that 
important work so we can get on with improving the act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the minister for the butter up but it will not work.
<P>
	For three years the minister has recognized this as being a 
problem and he has done nothing. He is hiding behind the standing 
committee.
<P>
	On another thing he is hiding behind the standing committee. In 
August of this year child killer Clifford Olson will be applying for 
parole under the faint hope clause of section 745. Our last chance to 
abolish this clause is June 21.
<P>
	Will the minister continue to hide behind the committee or will 
he eliminate this clause before Clifford Olson can apply?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as far as buttering up is concerned, 
I am in trouble on both sides of the House. My colleagues thought I 
went too far but I courageously stand by my words. I want the hon. 
member to know that.
<P>
	Section 745, as the hon. member knows, has been discussed in 
the House and by the committee. We have taken note of the 
discussion, we have consulted broadly and we are now preparing 
proposals to bring forward to address this important question.

<P>
	These are issues we should concern ourselves with. It is exactly 
those issue that have caused the coast guard and my department 
to enter into a discussion with recreational organizations to make 
sure that things like life jackets and the material that smaller boats 
are made of are safetied, in particular in areas where we cannot 
provide the search and rescue facilities to respond to the well over 
10,000 incidents we have in Canada during the year.
<P>
	I understand where the hon. member is coming from but I have 
to tell him it is in response to serious business and it is for the 
protection of Canadians at large.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, will the minister 
not acknowledge that the objective of safety he is hiding behind is 
nothing more than a pretext, because his real aim is to impose a 
hidden tax on pleasure boaters in order to bring in $14 million?

There will be some fees which will be negotiated with the 
organizations that are calling for these increased safety standards.
<P>
	The name of the game is increased safety for Canadians. If this is 
the price, I think it is a good price to pay for the safety and the 
possible reduction in the loss of 250 lives, one being too many.

	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple

Minister for International Co-operation.
<P>
	Of the 20 top suppliers of service contracts to CIDA in 1995, 14, 
that is 70 per cent, had made donations in 1994 to the Liberal Party 
compared with less than 1 per cent of Canadian companies overall.
<P>
	For example, in 1994 SNC Lavalin, Tecsault Inc., Cooper's &amp; 
Lybrand and a few of their associates and subsidiaries collectively 
donated $137,000. In 1995 they snagged CIDA contracts with an 
aggregate value of $22.5 million. Is this a coincidence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International 
Cooperation and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we have worked very hard at CIDA in the last few 
years to build a very open bidding system for all Canadian 
companies.
<P>
	The member can be absolutely sure the companies that get the 
contracts are the companies that have really prepared the best bid 
for the Canadian taxpayer and the  countries that actually get them. 
Yesterday I had a question about the province they come from. 
They reflect exactly the number of requests and bids prepared from 
that region so that both will count either from the region and the 
companies.
<P>
	We always have this open system which is quite transparent. I 
will be devoting the end of June and the beginning of July to going 
across the country to explain that system to business people in 
other regions, western and eastern Canada, so they can make more 
bids and get more contracts because it is very important.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, no company can even bid 
without the minister's approval.
<P>
	Fifteen of the top CIDA contractors are based in Quebec. Clark 
Builders of Edmonton, with multimillion dollar contracts in 
Russia, China and Japan, does not even bother to submit its name 
anymore to what its president refers to as the Quebec international 
development agency.
<P>
	Does the minister believe that CIDA's regionally biased 
contracting policy is beneficial to his quest for national unity?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International 
Cooperation and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think this is absolutely ludicrous.
<P>
	If we look at the number of companies that submitted 
prequalification bids last year, 245 happen to be from Quebec and 
187 from Ontario. The number of contracts given to Quebec 
companies reflects the number of bids they have made. If more 
Quebec companies bid for contracts they end up having more.
<P>
	It is the responsibility of business people from all regions to bid 
for contracts. I can show the member the percentage which reflects 
perfectly the number of bids we received, and we are very proud of 
it.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-24, 
an act to amend the Tobacco Products Control Act, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The parliamentary secretary has 26 
minutes remaining in his intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to speak over the din of the 
crowd and proceed with the debate on Bill C-24.
<P>
	Just before question period I was addressing the shared 
responsibilities of the stakeholders and all interested parties in the 
control of tobacco consumption everywhere. I indicated that some 
of the areas involved different levels of government, schools, 
parents and smokers. I left off by indicating that the federal 
government is committed to providing leadership in this area. 
Perhaps I could resume the debate on that theme.
<P>
	I realize that all members' attention is riveted on the debate. The 
government will continue to participate in consultations and to 
collaborate with its partners in the national strategy to reduce 
tobacco use, along with the provincial and territorial governments 
and a wide range of health groups.
<P>
	Partners in the national strategy recognize that there is no simple 
or easy solution to the problem. To be effective, solutions will need 
to be multifaceted and will need to be based on collaboration. The 
proposed plan of action meets these criteria.
<P>
	On December 11, 1995, the government tabled Bill C-117 which 
was reintroduced in this session as Bill C-24. At that time we tabled 
a document entitled ``Tobacco Control-A Blueprint to Protect the 
Health of Canadians''. That document sets out the government's 
proposed approach to tobacco control in response to the Supreme 
Court decision.
<P>
	The overall objective is clearly stated in the blueprint, 
specifically, to reduce tobacco consumption among Canadians and 
the adverse health effects that it causes.  This objective is supported 
by three broad legislative goals.
<P>
	First, to protect the health of Canadians in light of conclusive 
evidence implicating tobacco use in the incidence of numerous 
debilitating and fatal diseases.
<P>
	Second, to protect young people and others to the extent it is 
reasonable in a free and democratic society from inducements to 
use tobacco products and consequent dependence on them.
<P>
	Third, to enhance public awareness of the hazards of tobacco use 
by ensuring effective communication of pertinent information 
about tobacco products and their use. The blueprint document 
reflects the government's recognition that because millions of 
Canadians are addicted to tobacco products, these products cannot 
simply be made illegal and banned from the marketplace.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	The Supreme Court recognized that a prohibition on the sale or 
consumption of tobacco would not be a practical, public policy 
option, given the addictive nature of tobacco products. Rather, the 
tobacco control measures under consideration must necessarily 
focus on reducing the demand for tobacco products.
<P>
	I can confirm that there is a consensus in the health community 
that, given the addictive nature of nicotine, it is better to 
concentrate our efforts on preventing experimentation and uptake 
rather than try to overcome that addiction. Because very few people 
start to smoke after their teenage years, tobacco control efforts 
must focus on dissuading youth from experimenting.
<P>
	The recent data that shows increases in youth smoking, as my 
colleague opposite wanted to indicate earlier, in various regions of 
Canada lend urgency to the development of a legislative response.
<P>
	Since the advertising and promotion of tobacco products 
influence not only brand choice but also the perceptions of the 
products and the disposition to using the product, there is clear 
need to counter the effective advertising and promotion that results 
in experimentation and addiction among youth who appear to be 
especially susceptible to product advertising and promotion. 
Furthermore, because the demand for tobacco products is 
influenced by other marketing activities like retail merchandising, 
packaging, product design, these areas must also be addressed in 
order to achieve the stated health goals.
<P>
	The complex social, economic and health issues surrounding 
tobacco use suggest the need for a comprehensive, mutually 
reinforcing set of strategies. It is important to ensure that any 
legislative initiative be consistent with and complementary to the 
ongoing public education and awareness programs that are part of 
the larger federal strategy as well as the broad policy thrusts in 
other areas of federal activity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3429"> 3429 </A></B>
<P>
	Similarly, the development and implementation of a 
comprehensive strategy must be consistent with related 
municipal-provincial-territorial activities and legislation. The 
tobacco control blueprint outlines a comprehensive set of 
measures that would establish the conditions and requirements 
under which tobacco products would be manufactured, sold and 
marketed in Canada.
<P>
	The measures under consideration include, first, the most 
comprehensive restrictions possible on advertising. The 
government is committed to providing the necessary information to 
support the most comprehensive prohibition on advertising 
possible, always taking into account the guidance of the Supreme 
Court and our concerns for protecting youth from the inducements 
to smoke. Second, it would include restrictions on other 
promotional activities, and third, a comprehensive set of ground 
rules for sponsorship promotion. I see that my colleague from 
Haldimand-Norfolk is in complete agreement.
<P>
	I want to make it clear that the government is not proposing to 
ban the sponsorship of cultural and support groups and 
philanthropic activities by tobacco companies, quite the contrary. 
Such companies can and should support cultural and sporting 
events that they consider to be worthwhile. What the government 
objects to is sponsorship promotion of tobacco products and their 
use.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	The measures set out in the blueprint document for sponsorship 
promotion include, among others, prohibiting the use of brand 
names and logos on non-tobacco items associated with an event or 
activity, prohibiting the incorporation of brands names or logos 
into the name of a sponsored activity or event, prohibiting 
testimonials and personal endorsements, and requiring health 
messages on all sponsorship advertising and signs.
<P>
	The blueprint document also proposes to further reduce the 
likelihood of easy access to tobacco products by minors by 
eliminating self-service tobacco product displays and mail order 
sales. It proposes to restrict point of sale promotional activities, 
such as in-store advertising, promotion and product display. It also 
proposes to require additional new packaging and labelling 
requirements that would control package information and prohibit 
false and misleading claims on that packaging. Finally, it proposes 
to expand reporting requirements for tobacco manufacturers, 
distributors and importers to regulate tobacco products, their 
constituents and tobacco smoke emissions.
<P>
	I might emphasize that consultation is continuing with interested 
parties on the impact of the blueprint measures on the health of 
Canadians and tobacco and collateral industries supported by 
tobacco funding.
<P>
	This legislation, together with the research and public education 
components of the tobacco demand reduction strategy, will 
strengthen efforts to counter the ill-effects of tobacco consumption 
in Canada.
<P>
	Given the unique problems associated with tobacco use, the 
government is developing tobacco specific legislation which will 
again make Canada a leader in the battle against the health effects 
of tobacco consumption. The bill before the House today is the 
government's first legislative response aimed at redressing the 
legal problems identified by the Supreme Court's ruling. It is the 
important first step in the overall action plan.
<P>
	The amendments to the Tobacco Products Control Act in Bill 
C-24 are straightforward and vital to the health goals. Through Bill 
C-24 the government is reinstating the requirement to display 
health messages on tobacco products and in accordance with the 
direction of the Supreme Court of Canada, is giving the tobacco 
companies the option of attributing health messages on tobacco 
packaging to Health Canada.
<P>
	We know from studies conducted by the Department of Health 
that despite an awareness of the general health affects of tobacco 
use, Canadians lack knowledge about the specific health 
consequences of that tobacco use. Knowledge about specific health 
consequences is important because it may result in a better 
appreciation of the harmful affects of smoking.
<P>
	I acknowledge that the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers 
Council released a voluntary packaging and advertising code in 
December 1995 that continues to use health messages with an 
attribution to Health Canada although in a different format than 
that set out in the regulations that were made inoperative by the 
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
	Tobacco companies want to return to the format of the health 
messages that were used prior to 1994 before it was improved to 
make messages more visible and readable. The code requires that 
health messages be on advertisements. Despite that, within days of 
the release of that code, advertisements without health warnings, 
whose art work and designs were obviously targeted to youth, were 
placed within 200 metres of schools, violating the code. That code 
is both insufficient and unenforceable. Its pre-clearance and review 
processes are not subject to public scrutiny. It does not impose any 
sanctions on those who fail to comply with it. It is clear that public, 
transparent and forcible regulatory controls are required if we are 
to meet our health goals. That is what Bill C-24 begins to put in 
place.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	What Canadians need is a legislative framework that will control 
the manufacture, sale and marketing of tobacco products in this 
country. They need legislative measures to protect youth from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3430"> 3430 </A></B>
<P>
inducements to using  tobacco products. This government intends 
to provide Canadians with that framework.
<P>
	Bill C-24 is a vital first step toward a safer and healthier country 
for all Canadians. I am sure all colleagues on both sides of the 
House will join with me in supporting the amendments listed under 
Bill C-24. I thank you for your attention and support.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Just a word of clarification. The Chair 
does not support any speaker. The Chair supports all speakers, none 
in particular.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> Mr. Speaker, knowing the rules of the House as I do, 
I did not want to implicate the Speaker in any of the urgings for 
support. I used the English generic ``you'' which applies to all 
members in the House who have the right to vote.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the parliamentary secretary's comments on tobacco. 
We share some opinions on this subject.
<P>
	Going back to my training in medical school, the very first 
patient assigned to me was a fellow in a veterans hospital. They 
would not turn us loose on just anyone and I was turned loose on 
this wonderful fellow who had emphysema. He and I became fairly 
close. I spent lots of time with him and even went in on the 
weekends to talk with him. He had been a heavy smoker and really 
had that disease directly as a result of tobacco.
<P>
	As we became closer and related one to the other, it was obvious 
he was coming close to death. During his last few lucid moments 
he said to me: ``Do not let the kids start to smoke''. I will never 
forget that. It had an impact on me throughout my medical career.
<P>
	I look at legislation and the efforts of the government in that 
light. What will those efforts do in relation to keeping the kids from 
smoking? Looking back at the record on smoking in Canada we see 
it is pretty good. The prevalence of smoking has been going down 
for about the past 25 years. It has been dropping at a nice steady 
rate. Almost 50 per cent of Canada's population used to smoke and 
it is now down to pretty close to 30 per cent.
<P>
	However, that nice smooth flow downward has had a tick 
upward. The tick upward can be directly related to a change in 
tobacco prices in Canada. I know the price was changed to try to 
cut down on smuggling. However, the price sensitivity for our 
youth caused them to smoke more. In one year, we lost five years of 
a drop in smoking prevalence. That is a record which I do not think 
my colleague across the way should be proud of. It is one he should 
hang his head on. I hope he can right that loss of five years of 
prevalence drop we had in one year.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-24 is designed to bring back the labelling that could have 
been lost with the change in the judicial action on the Tobacco 
Products Control Act. This bill is a  status quo bill except that the 
warnings will be attributed, if the tobacco companies agree, to 
Health Canada.
<P>
	What about the blueprint? The blueprint was presented to the 
Canadian public with a significant amount of fanfare. The previous 
health minister, not so long ago in December last year held a major 
press conference wherein she announced the blueprint. I remember 
well she said: ``I have new information that will withstand any 
court challenge, new information that will prove that advertising of 
tobacco products really is bad news''.
<P>
	I thought that was great. I wrote to the health minister literally 
that week asking for the new data. If I remember the words that I 
used, I said that I would like to become a slobbering supporter of 
the blueprint. Possibly my choice of words was a little flippant but 
what I wanted to say was that I would love to be an enthusiastic 
supporter of the blueprint.
<P>
	Nothing came. There was no reply. I could understand if the 
minister had said that she did not want this information to be used 
for political purposes and that she would release it at the 
appropriate time. I can understand the minister saying that it was in 
process, but I did not get a response.
<P>
	The new minister came along. I sent the new minister my 
congratulatory letter. It is polite in Parliament to write a letter to 
the new minister. I said: ``Congratulations for your new 
responsibilities. I hope we will have a long and productive life 
together and an interesting interchange. Please could you provide 
me with the new data that was suggested at the press conference, 
this exciting new data that will withstand a court challenge? I want 
to be an enthusiastic supporter of the blueprint''.
<P>
	I did get a response, after about three months. It was not 
immediate. I did not get the reaction I had hoped, but I did get a 
personal response from the minister who said: ``We can meet 
together possibly in late June to go over the data so that you can 
understand. This is complex.'' At least there has been some 
response.
<P>
	I read in press reports today that there is some problem with the 
blueprint while the government is finishing its homework. I am 
puzzled by this. Usually when there is a major press conference, 
usually when there is a big time announcement, usually they have 
done their homework first. The current minister said: ``It would be 
foolhardy to move forward without having done our homework. 
Unfortunately it was not done when I arrived''.
<P>
	I am puzzled. This is a government with massive resources, a 
government with research capabilities par excellence. I have gone 
into the data and cannot and have not yet found the information that 
was promised to me. I have done my own research. I do not have 
those huge  research capabilities. I wonder, going back to that press 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3431"> 3431 </A></B>
<P>
conference, was the homework really done or was it an 
announcement to make someone look better?
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary has eloquently talked about the 
health warnings, the addictive nature of smoking, the health 
problems and that it is highly complex. I wrote these words down 
as he was going through his address. There is a powerful lobby of 
printers, artists, the tobacco companies and the health interests. 
There are big bucks involved and lots of money involved with 
taxes. Indeed it is a complex subject. Still on tobacco products in 
Canada we warn of the health risks.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	I am also puzzled because recently Bill C-222, by the member 
for Mississauga South, was before the health committee. This bill 
was also about health warnings, different warnings on booze, on 
alcohol. I could go through the list of issues that are related to 
tobacco and apply them to alcohol: addictive nature, health 
problems, highly complex, powerful lobby, big bucks. I think those 
things fit with the alcohol industry.
<P>
	The member for Mississauga South put forth compelling 
evidence that fetal alcohol syndrome where there is an innocent 
bystander could well be affected by health warnings, yet the health 
warnings were scrubbed on alcohol. The previous minister in this 
case was strongly supportive. I do not know if the present minister 
caved in to pressures outside the health interests. I can only 
presume that. In the press release that came from the department 
the principle of this bill was supported but the mechanism was 
uncertain. It is a subtle change in wording but I am not convinced. 
If labels work for smokes, labels should work for booze.
<P>
	If Bill C-24 passes intellectual scrutiny as the parliamentary 
secretary so eloquently stated, then Bill C-222 concerning warning 
labels on alcohol in reference to fetal alcohol syndrome should 
also. I ask my colleagues across the way, where is the consistency?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me as the 
member of Parliament for Vancouver Centre and as a physician to 
speak in support of Bill C-24.
<P>
	Members have heard the hon. parliamentary secretary speak 
about the details of the bill. On the surface it might seem the bill is 
just about labelling and information but it is more than that. This 
bill is more than simple words on a piece of paper or on a bit of 
cardboard. It is about what those words say. It is about what those 
words mean and how important those words are to the user of this 
product.
<P>
	What those words describe is what I want to discuss during my 
time in this debate. Let me start with a short list: carbon monoxide, 
lead, hydrogen cyanide, benzene, arsenic. These are all deadly 
components. Each one of them can kill. They are just five of the 
more than 4,000 chemical compounds scientists have found in 
tobacco smoke. They are just five of the compounds that contribute 
to the over 40,000 deaths a year caused by tobacco use.
<P>
	How do these Canadians die? They die of lung cancer, bladder 
cancer, heart disease, aneurysms, pneumonia, emphysema, sudden 
infant death syndrome and fire. There are over 22 diseases 
associated with smoking and the effects of smoking know no age 
barrier. Health Canada estimates that the dangers of low birth 
weight and chronic respiratory illness show that smoking affects 
the fetus in utero. About 200 infants under the age of one died in 
1991 as a result of exposure to tobacco smoke, secondhand smoke. 
Death from cancer is no surprise because tobacco smoke contains 
more than 50 known carcinogens. Lung cancer has now overtaken 
breast cancer as the number one cause of death among women.
<P>
	The health impact goes further. Scientists have discovered that 
other chemical compounds found in tobacco smoke actually cause 
permanent changes to the genetic material of living cells and hence 
to the fetus. These compounds come from a variety of sources. 
About half of these compounds appear naturally in green tobacco 
leaves. The other half comes from the chemical reactions that come 
from combustion. Some compounds are produced as part of the 
curing of tobacco.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Smokers may not realize that when they look at the smoke 
curling up from their cigarettes what they see constitutes less than 
10 per cent of the output of that cigarette. What they do not see is 
more frightening, the gases and even liquids produced by the 
burning tobacco and the paper.
<P>
	We need to tell Canadians about the impact of these toxic 
compounds on their bodies. We need to tell them about the carbon 
monoxide produced when tobacco burns, this colourless, odourless 
gas that kills because it starves the body of oxygen.
<P>
	A cigarette is an incinerator producing hundreds of chemicals, 
including tar, cancer causing tar, as it should be rightly known. We 
need to tell Canadians that cancer causing tar in tobacco products 
contains hundreds of chemicals, some of which are actually 
hazardous waste. We need to inform Canadians their bodies are not 
and should not be toxic waste dumps.
<P>
	The list of toxic constituents in cigarettes goes on and on. We 
need to tell Canadians about ammonia. It may be great for 
household training but it could increase the odds of getting viral 
illness, and so it does with smokers. It can aggravate chronic 
respiratory conditions in both a smoker and those around a smoker 
breathing in that second hand smoke.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3432"> 3432 </A></B>
<P>
	We need to tell Canadians about hydrogen cyanide. This is 
among the most toxic of the components in the witch's brew that 
comes out of tobacco smoke. Short term exposure to hydrogen 
cyanide can lead to headaches, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, 
and yet we continue to do this in small amounts every day when 
we smoke cigarettes.
<P>
	We need to tell Canadians about lead. We know how much 
governments have tried to cut lead emissions because of the harm 
they can cause children. Lead is found in tobacco smoke to which 
children are exposed. As we have made laws and regulations as 
governments to get rid of lead in the environment, lesser known 
sources of lead become very important. One of these sources is 
cigarettes.
<P>
	Not only smokers but children living with smokers have shown 
to have elevated blood levels. Canadian children are being exposed 
daily to a substance that has been linked to sudden infant death 
syndrome, low birth weight, birth defects, allergies, learning 
problems, chronic respiratory disease and adult asthma.
<P>
	The information we now have on the toxic constituents of 
tobacco products is the result of a generation of research. We are 
learning every day more and more about the hazardous effects of 
this product. Research projects funded by the tobacco demand 
reduction strategy, which examined the trends over the last 25 
years of the nicotine content of cigarettes and in tobacco smoke 
using cigarette samples that have been collected and stored over the 
past two decades, have shown us that between 1968 and 1989 the 
level of nicotine in tobacco used in cigarettes has increased by 53 
per cent. The average amount of tobacco used in each cigarette has 
decreased by 14 per cent. The level of nicotine in tobacco smoke 
fluctuated significantly at several points during the study period.
<P>
	Other trends in the marketing of tobacco products have affected 
the level of exposure of smokers to other toxic substances. The 
cigarette filter was the first of these trends. Some of my hon. 
colleagues may remember a time when most cigarettes were 
unfiltered. It was hardly surprising that most people found them 
harsh and hard on the throat. Filters have been introduced, some 
with flavours such as menthol. However, we must not forget that 
tobacco smoke is harsh. It is a chemical soup that is bad for 
everyone.
<P>
	Another important trend in the growth of tobacco products is the 
so-called light or low yield cigarettes which reduce the amount of 
smoke inhaled by smokers. On the surface this would seem to be a 
terrific thing. The less smokers inhale, obviously the lower the risk. 
It is not that simple. These light cigarettes may encourage people to 
keep smoking and even to smoke more. They can appear to be 
healthier than other tobacco products. By picking up any American 
magazine we can see that light cigarettes are marketed in a manner 
that creates the  appearance the manufacturer is trying to address 
the concerns of smokers about health issues and to reach out to 
women. The recent books, articles and exposés about tobacco 
marketing point this out again and again, and yet this attempt to 
confuse the facts continues to this day.
<P>
	The survey of smoking in Canada funded by the Health Canada 
tobacco demand reduction strategy shows that smokers make 
certain assumptions about a cigarette that is labelled as light. The 
survey of smoking in Canada found that slightly less than 35 per 
cent of Canadian smokers assumed that light means less tar. About 
45 per cent believed that light means less nicotine. They may be 
right in some cases but they may not be in others. If there is any 
reduction it is marginal at best.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Smoking a light or mild cigarette is like jumping off a 20 storey 
building instead of a 30 storey building. The result is the same. 
Light and mild are just marketing subjective terms referring to 
taste and aroma and have no real meaning at all from a health 
perspective.
<P>
	The perception that mild cigarettes may be safer points out an 
important issue in the debate. How should we regulate tobacco 
products so they can say what they mean so the user is fully and 
objectively informed of the product itself?
<P>
	Some people have suggested we should bring in legislation that 
limits tobacco to certain amounts of tar and nicotine. In effect they 
want us to enforce a certain degree of lightness for all tobacco 
products. Research into smoking behaviour suggests regulating the 
lightness of cigarettes might have the opposite effect. It can lull 
smokers into believing they can take comfort from the fact that 
each cigarette would have a lower quantity of the bad stuff in it, 
they can smoke more and be no worse off than they are now. Some 
people might even take up smoking under the mistaken and 
potentially tragic belief it was now safe to do so because the 
cigarette is so light.
<P>
	A variety of methods will be needed if we as a society are to 
understand and address the reasons so many people smoke. We 
need to appreciate that people smoke for reasons that appear to be 
rooted in psychological and socio-environmental factors, as well as 
the physiological addiction to nicotine.
<P>
	However, product and outcome information is an important 
element in helping smokers stop smoking. That is the point of Bill 
C-24. Information is not always enough. It is only one part of a 
comprehensive public health approach to smoking cessation. It 
does and has helped many Canadians give up tobacco and deterred 
young Canadians from starting to smoke. Information will continue 
to help Canadians to understand the facts about tobacco disease. 
Understanding what they are smoking and what they are putting 
into their mouths is very important in understanding how it can 
harm them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3433"> 3433 </A></B>
<P>
	If the health warnings the bill makes possible encourage even 
a few people a day to follow through and quit smoking, they are 
achieving their purposes. We will do more research and gather 
more evidence about the impact of tobacco smoke on the human 
body. As we do this we can use the mechanisms set up in Bill 
C-24 in our warnings against users to improve and increase the 
kind of information on the packages. This bill is only the start.
<P>
	Under the blueprint for tobacco control the government has 
indicated a number of measures and approaches within a 
comprehensive strategy which are worth considering. Do not 
forget, looking at tobacco cessation is part of a general public 
health strategy. Public health strategies deal with prevention, 
education, awareness, information, treatment of disease, 
rehabilitation from the disease. This is part of a major 
comprehensive strategy to look at the use of tobacco. The toxic 
constituents of tobacco smoke will therefore continue to be part of 
that information arsenal we must employ.
<P>
	I know members will say the information may seem like the 
same old message. It is not. Health researchers have learned more 
and more about tobacco since the first time we put messages on the 
tobacco packages. We know far more about smoking and what it 
does to our health. We can now confirm that smoking is bad for the 
smoker but, even worse, smoking is just as bad for the non-smoker.
<P>
	It is very important to note that 350 non-smoking Canadians a 
year die due to diseases caused by second hand smoke. Every year 
over 40,000 Canadians, over 3 million smokers in the world, die as 
a result of tobacco smoking; 5,000 people a year in my province of 
British Columbia alone die as a result of smoking. We see all the 
morbidity and the disease which cost the health care substantial 
amounts as people are smoking more and more.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	Getting that information to the smoker and the non-smoker, the 
lethal negative issues of this product, is extremely important. One 
of the ways we can do it is through health warnings on cigarette 
packages. This would be a step in the right direction. Placing labels 
on and inserts in cigarette packages is an important public health 
initiative. It is an important part of education and prevention 
strategies. I urge all hon. members to support the bill and to help 
prevent the most preventable cause of death and disease in the 
world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I compliment the hon. member for her fine speech. 
Factually she is certainly correct. Being a physician, she 
understands very clearly, personally and scientifically the impact 
of smoking.
<P>
	However, I find it absolutely absurd that the government, after 
15 years of seeing a decrease in consumption in the country, has 
entertained legislative proposals that have destroyed the last 15 
years of our fight against smoking.
<P>
	The tobacco tax rollback was the single most important negative 
piece of legislation that has ever been done in the last 50 years 
against the health and welfare of Canadians.
<P>
	The hon. member, a physician, was there as the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Health at that time. I ask her how she 
can reconcile her obvious passionate knowledge that smoking is 
disastrous for people's health with the fact she supported the 
tobacco tax rollback.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that is an excellent question and I 
thank the hon. member for asking it.
<P>
	Before I came here, as a physician I was passionate about 
smoking cessation and anti-smoking legislation and used every 
single tool in the arsenal I could think of to stop smoking.
<P>
	What is interesting is that I saw this from the perspective of a 
physician. When I came to the House of Commons I realized there 
are many perspectives to legislation and to things we do as a 
government and as politicians. I realized what we had done by 
increasing our tobacco taxes to the extent that what we now had 
was a prohibition versus what was happening in the United States, 
was we were having the smuggling of cigarettes and young people 
were beginning to smoke not only because cigarettes were cheap 
but because they were now smoking something that was exciting. It 
was a smuggled product, something they should not be using. This 
presented a totally different perspective and point of view to the 
whole issue.
<P>
	We have to try in everything we do to balance effects and 
counterbalance negative effects. It is like when we push something 
on one side, we give on the other side. Every action has an equal 
and opposite reaction. Balancing those actions in the best interest 
of the health of Canadians is what we were talking about when we 
looked at bringing down the tobacco taxes.
<P>
	However, something very important, which the hon. member did 
not mention, is that it was the first time a country had slapped a 
health tax on a manufacturer and put the money back into health. 
That was one of the things I fought for as well before I came here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened to about an hour's worth of absolute 
balderdash, which is the nicest word I can use, coming from the 
opposite benches defending the indefensible. It is absolutely 
shameless. What can we do to shame these people? How do we go 
about doing it? I think it is impossible. What could be beyond it?
<P>
	After this Parliament commenced in the fall of 1993 we had,as members will recall, great lawlessness in the smuggling of 
tobacco. What does the government do? Does it say ``wait a
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3434"> 3434 </A></B>
<P>
minute, you cannot be breaking the law here, folks, and you will 
obey the law from coast to coast''? Because the government could 
not enforce it, it gave in to it. It reduced the price 50 per cent or 
more for a package of cigarettes. That broke the back of smuggling 
but I will tell you what it also did. Does any member opposite have 
any idea of the notion of price elasticity? The lower the price, the 
higher the demand. The higher price, the lower the demand. It is a 
law of marketing. It is there. It is a fact. It is irrefutable.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	What did the government opposite do? It lowered the price. 
What happened? Demand went up. Then what did it do? It said on 
its holiest of holy grails: ``We are going to change the packaging''. 
Did that happen? No.
<P>
	Then the government said it was going to gradually increase the 
price over the next couple of years. Did that happen? No. Prices 
stayed where they were. The federal government, through the 
Supreme Court, not only has the right, it has the responsibility to 
legislate advertising standards around the tobacco issue.
<P>
	Do members remember when tobacco companies, through a 
Supreme Court ruling, were allowed to advertise? The Supreme 
Court said it was up to the federal government to write legislation 
that would prevent it. It is not up to the Supreme Court to interpret 
legislation in a manner that prevents it.
<P>
	Where in this legislation about preventing tobacco advertising in 
a manner that will affect the most vulnerable which are, of course, 
children? Please show me where word one is in restricting tobacco 
advertising that could be used to influence children.
<P>
	I recognize that the member opposite, the Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism)(Status of Women) for Vancouver Centre, 
herself a medical doctor, understands and appreciates the necessity 
of reducing smoking. I am not suggesting for a moment that 
members opposite do not understand or appreciate it. I am saying 
that if they are going to be apologists for the tobacco industry, at 
least do it honestly and say there is nothing they can do about it.
<P>
	It is the hypocrisy of this that just drives me crazy. To listen to 
the members opposite talking about how bad cigarette advertising 
and tobacco are for the health of Canadians and do absolutely 
nothing about it is just beyond the pale.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is an interesting statement made by 
the hon. member. I do not know if he has been present for the last 
two and a half years around this place or not.
<P>
	If the hon. member would recall when the tax on tobacco was 
lowered, not by 50 per cent I might add, some other comprehensive 
things were done to mitigate  that. There was a health tax. It was the 
first time any country in the world put on a health tax on tobacco.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> How much are cigarettes outside of here?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Let me answer your question. If the hon. member 
would allow me to answer he might learn something.
<P>
	The government increased the tobacco health tax that went 
straight into health funding. That has been something for which 
anti-smoking advocates have asked for a long long time. We were 
the first people to do it.
<P>
	Legislation was also brought in that dealt with banning kiddy 
packs. Other legislation in effect banned the use of tobacco in 
vending machines so that tobacco was brought almost alongside 
alcohol in terms of where it could be bought. It cannot be sold 
anywhere unless the person is not a minor. So it would only be in 
bars where you cannot go until you are over 19.
<P>
	The age limit was increased for people bringing tobacco into the 
country. All of that was brought in when we brought in this 
legislation. It is a comprehensive set of strategies. It is interesting 
that we would only talk about this issue.
<P>
	Banning the advertising of cigarettes is something that Canada 
took the lead in. These are things that have been questioned by the 
tobacco industry. One of the things that we now know is that when 
we talked about sponsorship in terms of advertising we said that 
tobacco companies could not promote and sponsor tobacco because 
of course of the Supreme Court rulings. They could do it only as a 
corporate entity. The tobacco companies changed their corporate 
logo to their tobacco logo and got around that legislation.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	This is something that we have been moving forward on for 
years as a country. Every time we move forward, something comes 
up to block us in terms of legislation and the Supreme Court.
<P>
	We continue to keep struggling to move forward on this issue 
because of legalities. The will is there. The political will has been 
shown. There are legalities that we constantly have to move 
around. There is research that we are doing to help us to do this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this debate would be funny if it was not so tragic. I cannot 
believe the comments that have been made by members across the 
way which, to my mind, are absolute, sheer hypocrisy.
<P>
	They are irreconcilable. On one hand, they say that they believe 
that smoking is bad for people, that it is going to kill people and 
that they are committed to preventing, as the Minister of Health of 
the day said, even one youth from smoking. On the other hand they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3435"> 3435 </A></B>
<P>
bring in legislation that is the most important factor in  promoting 
smoking among youth. They are irreconcilable.
<P>
	I understand what was going on at the time of the tobacco 
rollback. I understand that smuggling was a problem, but that was 
not the solution. I will get back to that later.
<P>
	Reform members support Bill C-24 because it does something 
toward promoting education concerning this lethal product. This is 
very little compared to the larger picture. When we go to sleep 
tonight, 123 people will have died in this country. Over the course 
of the year, some 40,000 Canadians will die of cigarette related 
illnesses. It is the single most important preventable cause of death 
and illness in this country today.
<P>
	The legislation put forward by the government over the last two 
years has done nothing but increase that. The small measures that it 
has taken really beats around the bushes, around the outside.
<P>
	The profound effects that it has had have committed some 
40,000 to 60,000 youth to date to smoking. Half of them will die at 
least 10 to 15 years earlier than what they should have died. If there 
is one shameful legacy that the government has, this has to be it. I 
am embarrassed to say that I was part of the Parliament while this 
took place.
<P>
	We welcome again Bill C-24, particularly in view of the 
overturning by the Supreme Court of the ban on tobacco 
advertising, an unbelievably myopic and absurd decision by the 
highest court in the country. It is unbelievable to me how justices 
could consciously do that, understanding full well the impact on 
the health of Canadians and as my colleague mentioned, 
particularly on the health of youth.
<P>
	The other action, the tobacco tax rollback I mentioned, was done 
because of the smuggling that was taking place. There is no doubt 
that we had to do something to address that problem.
<P>
	Reform members presented to the government an alternative 
solution that would not have entailed a decrease in cost. Members 
know that cost is the single most important determining factor in 
cigarette smoking, particularly among youth. Our proposal was to 
put an export tax on cigarettes. Why do we know this works? It is 
because in 1992 the Conservative government of the day had a 
similar problem with smuggling and it put on an export tax of $8 a 
carton.
<P>
	Within six weeks, the amount of smuggling went down 
dramatically, in the order of 60 per cent. What did the Conservative 
government of the day do? It removed the export tax. Why did it do 
that? The tobacco companies threatened to leave the country. The 
tax was working but the government failed. That is why there was a 
rollback in the taxes. That is why today cartons of cigarettes cost 50 
per cent less than they did when we were elected two years ago. At 
that time cartons of cigarettes in Ontario  cost $50, today they cost 
$25. What do people do? They smoke more. We do not need a 
tobacco reduction strategy to tell us that. We just need to walk into 
a store to see that or speak to the youth on the street.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Our alternative was to remove the tobacco tax rollback, bring the 
cost of cigarettes back to where they were, put the $8 export tax on 
cartons and enforce the law. At the time the smuggling was taking 
place, the police officers in the area were told to turn a blind eye. 
The government did not want to confront the smugglers, 
particularly because a lot of the smuggling was taking place on 
aboriginal land in the Kahnawake and Kanesatake reserves. It did 
not want to start up another Oka.
<P>
	We have one law in this country and that law must be applied 
equally to all of the people who live inside Canada. It was not done 
deliberately.
<P>
	The government should bring the export tax back, bring the costs 
back to where they were for tobacco, and enforce the law. We 
would not have a smuggling problem and the increase in 
consumption that we have today. In fact we would see a decrease in 
consumption.
<P>
	The cost of the tobacco rollback has not been minor. The costs 
will be an increase in deaths, in morbidity and a decrease in gross 
domestic product, because people fall sick after smoking. These 
are hidden costs that the government is not taking into 
consideration and it is not informing the Canadian public.
<P>
	The costs in my province of British Columbia are in the order of 
hundreds of millions of dollars in losses in gross domestic product. 
The cost in health care across the country is estimated to be in the 
tens of billions of dollars.
<P>
	That is what the government has done to save face with the 
tobacco companies. That is really what all this is about. It is trying 
to do something without disturbing the tobacco companies, the 
purveyors of these products of death, mayhem, sadness, sickness 
and untold human suffering.
<P>
	I challenge the members across the way who voted for that. I 
know many of them know people in their own families who have 
died of smoking related illnesses. I ask them to put themselves 
again in that mindset and think what would happen if their children 
too were going to suffer from those same terrible diseases.
<P>
	The increasing consumption, particularly among the young, has 
been enormous. Just in the last couple of years it has gone from 21 
per cent up to 30 per cent. It is going to continue to rise.
<P>
	I put forward a private member's motion shortly after the 
tobacco tax rollback took place. The motion dealt with the rollback. 
Did the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs make 
this a votable motion? No, it did not. It did not want the
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3436"> 3436 </A></B>
<P>
overnment to be embarrassed over this issue. Sadly, my private 
member's motion asking for the tobacco tax to be put back on died 
on the Order Paper. I challenge the government once again to bring 
back those taxes.
<P>
	Second, members across the way have proudly talked about the 
tobacco demand reduction strategy. What did this government do? 
It cut the funding for it. I would like to know from government 
members what has happened to the tobacco demand reduction 
strategy.
<P>
	When people are trying to educate youth about tobacco, do they 
not tell them that they were going to die of lung cancer or that they 
were going to suffer from emphysema or chronic constructive lung 
disease? We have to argue on the basis of narcissism, believe it not, 
and tell them that their breath is going to smell foul, that it is lousy 
for their dating and their personal lives, that their skin is going to 
become sallow and that physically they are not going to look as 
good as they did before. Then we will have an effect on them. To 
tell them about all the terrible diseases they will get simply will not 
work because they have a sense, as we know, of immortality at that 
age.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	As I mentioned, the supreme court decision shot down the ban on 
advertising on tobacco. That happened eight months ago. The 
government has had eight months to do something about it but has 
done absolutely nothing, although it promised it would. If that is 
how long it takes, the minister and the ministry of health should be 
ashamed of themselves.
<P>
	It is absurd when we think about what this ban means. It means 
we can advertise for Rothmans, we can advertise for Craven As, we 
can advertise for Camels, but we are forbidden to advertise for the 
Nicoderm patches used to prevent people from smoking. That is the 
absurd situation we have today.
<P>
	I have some solutions. Put tobacco in the Food and Drugs Act. 
This would give the government regulatory authority over tobacco. 
It would enable it to put standards on product quality, composition, 
packaging, sale and advertising. It would empower it to do what it 
has failed to do over the last three years. It is particularly important 
because a few years ago tobacco companies were found to be 
spiking cigarettes with nicotine in order to increase their addictive 
potential. This would prevent that in Canada. It would not require a 
legislative change either.
<P>
	Put back the export tax. Enforce the laws against smuggling. 
Bring back the legislative ban on cigarette advertising. Increase 
education for children.
<P>
	We need to get back to basics. We have a health care crisis in 
Canada today, the increase in consumption of cigarettes 
particularly among youth. The Liberal government and the 
previous Conservative government caved in to pressure from the 
cigarette companies.
<P>
	Solutions exist to balance out the needs of the government to 
stop smuggling, which has to be done, while enabling us to 
preserve the health and welfare of Canadians and prevent the 
sickness, the tragedy, the mortality and the morbidity that will 
affect Canadians.
<P>
	I ask every member in the House who has children to look at 
their children carefully when they go home tonight and ask 
themselves if they want to compromise their children's lives. Do 
they want to compromise their children and their friends' lives by 
allowing the embarrassing situation we have today with the 
tobacco tax rollback?
<P>
	If the government is truly committed to preventing cigarette 
consumption, the single most important thing it can do is increase 
the cost of cigarettes to Canadians. By doing this it will decrease 
consumption and improve the health and welfare of all Canadians. 
It will be the single most important legacy for the health and 
welfare of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member, the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism, the 
parliamentary secretary and other speakers have clearly laid out the 
public health issue related to tobacco. I do not think there is much 
disagreement as to the priority and importance of dealing with it.
<P>
	We also know there are some things going on among 
parliamentarians and the courts, the supreme court. There have 
been studies with regard to changing labelling and plain packaging, 
supreme court decisions on the advertising permissibility and 
actions by lobbyists. This is an area of particular interest to me as a 
result of the experience I had with labelling containers of alcoholic 
beverages.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The member has raised some good points in terms of additional 
strategy. However, Bill C-24 gives the distributor of the tobacco 
product the option of attributing the health messages on the product 
to an entity specified in the regulations, in part.
<P>
	I simply ask the member, notwithstanding this in itself is not a 
comprehensive strategy, whether he would agree that attributing 
the health warning message on the packages of cigarettes to a body 
such as Health Canada or the Parliament of Canada or the 
Government of Canada would not enhance the credibility of the 
message, simply by sourcing it to some reference body. That it is a 
positive step, although I am sure not the conclusive solution the 
member would like to see.
<P>
	Would he not agree that is probably still a positive step which 
should be supported?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3437"> 3437 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question 
is do we want to look good or do we want to do good?
<P>
	Bill C-24 is a welcome addition. However, do we beat around the 
bush on this issue or do we cut to the chase and get to what really 
counts? When we are weighing legislative initiatives, there is no 
proof plain packaging works. Do we deal with legislative 
initiatives which will have little or no effect or should we be 
dealing with something which will have a profound effect?
<P>
	The number one, most important factor in tobacco consumption, 
which is what we are addressing, is cost. The cost factor is most 
important for youth, less important for adults, but nonetheless 
important in both areas.
<P>
	The elasticity of price and demand is so important that it 
overshadows virtually every other initiative the government can 
take.
<P>
	To answer the hon. member, we certainly support Bill C-24 but 
for heaven's sake, deal with the big issues. Bring back the tobacco 
taxes to what they were before and raise the cost of cigarettes to 
where it was two years ago and then we will truly have a profound 
effect on consumption in Canada, which is what all members what 
to see.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, like others in the room, I compliment 
all members who have as the base of their interventions the 
altruistic and sincere desire to ensure the health of all Canadians is 
safeguarded.
<P>
	The member does a great discredit to the initiatives the 
government has taken over the last couple of years, specifically the 
question of the tobacco tax he referred to on a couple of occasions. 
That was not an isolated initiative. He pointed out this is a complex 
problem that requires a comprehensive approach. Much of what he 
addressed is already in place and not working.
<P>
	Export controls and taxes were causing problems in many places 
in Canada and had to be addressed as well. He is conveniently 
putting to one side the fact that other initiatives were put forward 
by the government to specifically address consumption of tobacco 
products by young people. It is very easy to put them to one side 
and pretend they do not exist. The government initiatives are in 
place and they are working.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	Finally, it is important as well to appreciate that in the context of 
some of those initiatives it was a supreme court decision that did 
away with some of the initiatives which were already in place.
<P>
	If the member opposite is impatient because the appropriate 
legislation has yet to be presented before the House, it is only 
because the government wants to make sure the legislation, when it 
is presented, will withstand  the challenges that will surely come 
forward from interested parties.
<P>
	If he is as sincere as he has demonstrated in the House, he would 
encourage the Minister of Health and all his colleagues in cabinet 
to ensure the safeguards are in place and that all the checks and 
balances are looked at carefully so that we not repeat the scenario 
which we saw in the supreme court some eight months ago.
<P>
	The member is correct to bring these issues forward in the 
House, but let him make an acknowledgement that Bill C-24 is a 
very important and good first step. He can bring his suggestions 
forward when the legislation goes to committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
brought these ideas forward two years ago.
<P>
	We support Bill C-24 as a first step. However, I take issue with 
the hon. member when he said the initiatives of the government 
have worked.
<P>
	As we have mentioned before in the House, tobacco 
consumption among youth has increased dramatically since the 
tobacco tax rollback. Statistics from the ministry of health showed 
conclusively six months after the tobacco tax rollback that 
consumption by youth was increasing alarmingly. That proves the 
tobacco tax rollback has had a terrible effect on consumption by 
youth.
<P>
	I will acknowledge that the hon. member was correct when he 
said that previous initiatives did work. In the 15 years before May 
of 1994 tobacco consumption had been progressively decreasing. 
However, as soon as the tobacco tax rollback took place 
consumption skyrocketed. They are directly related.
<P>
	While I say Bill C-24 is a welcome initiative, why is the 
government pursuing little initiatives which are to have little 
effect? Why does it not pursue the big issues and the big initiatives 
which will have a big effect on the health of Canadians? As we 
stand here and pussy foot around the issue, every single day more 
youth are taking up smoking and more people are consuming of 
this lethal product.
<P>
	Tomorrow if the government wishes, it could bring back those 
tobacco taxes. It would not find disagreement in the House. Also, it 
should put tobacco in the Food and Drugs Act. Then the 
government would have the legislative ability to do the things it 
ought to be doing.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the

	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and

moved that Bill C-32, an act to amend the Copyright Act be read 
the second time and sent to committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, the reform of the Copyright Act, which 
has been on the agenda for more than ten years, has now become a 
necessity. It is crucial that our legislation conforms to reality so 
that we can prepare the way to the future.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	The amendments that the government is proposing today will put 
our cultural industries on the same wavelength as the other 
industrialized countries of the West and the G7 countries. They will 
enable us to better meet the challenges presented by the new 
distribution technologies.
<P>
	These amendments are the expression of the government's 
commitment to the cultural sector. We stated that we had two 
objectives in promoting the cultural industries: to bolster Canadian 
identity and to encourage job creation.
<P>
	Let me begin by reminding you how important the cultural 
sector is to the affirmation of Canadian identity. Culture is 
expressed through the voices, words and gestures of talented men 
and women. Their works are the manifestation of that culture. They 
forge the image that a country creates of itself and offer it to the 
entire world. They are at the heart of our national identity. They are 
the creators who shape our world view.
<P>
	Our culture is the thousand and one signs through which we see 
ourselves as individuals belonging to a country. Culture is the vital 
link that unites us all. Culture also provides work for 670,000 
people, including creators and producers, who inject $16 billion 
into our economy and attract foreign capital.
<P>
	Canada's cultural sector is one of the fastest-growing segments 
of our economy. Since 1981, it has grown by 32 per cent, compared 
with 12 per cent for other sectors. There is no doubt that the arts 
and culture sector-the ninth largest in Canada-must be 
strengthened if it is to continue to contribute to economic growth 
and the vitality of our cultural identity. That is precisely what we 
intend to do with Bill C-32.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Government of Canada is proud of this series of fair and 
carefully developed amendments. The new act establishes a fair 
balance between the rights of creators to  be compensated for their 
work and the need for users to have access to those works. We have 
taken everybody's interests into consideration and have made sure 
that everyone gets their due.
<P>
	Some elements included in the bill are: the rights of performers 
and producers of sound recordings; a compensation system for 
private copying; limited exceptions for schools, libraries, 
museums, archives and people with visual disabilities; protection 
for exclusive book distributors in Canada; and measures to improve 
public management and legal recourse. I will now summarize the 
main features of each of these amendments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	First, let us look at performers' and producers' rights. At 
present, you can hear singers on the radio anywhere in the country, 
and they receive no compensation for their performance. As it is 
currently worded, the Copyright Act entitles only authors-that is, 
lyricists and composers-to payment for the public use of their 
works.
<P>
	From now on, performers and producers will be able to receive a 
royalty from those who perform their works in public or broadcast 
them. Thanks to this measure, performers, who often live in 
impoverished circumstances, will, at least, be able to count on this 
income. I will remind you that Canadian performers have the right 
to be remunerated for their work.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	One thing is clear, however: it is not a question of correcting the 
injustices done to artists and producers by penalizing those who use 
their sound recordings. Of course, the broadcasting industry, which 
is the primary user of sound recordings, will pay the levy. But the 
industry's financial situation will be taken into account.
<P>
	All radio stations will pay a fixed rate of $100 on the first $1.25 
million in advertising revenues. Based on the 1994 data, 65 per 
cent of private broadcasters will pay only this amount. Moreover, 
as a result of generous transitional measures, the tariff on 
advertising revenues over $1.25 million will be phased in over a 
five-year period. The Copyright Board will set the tariff after 
hearing from the various stakeholders.
<P>
	Adopting this bill will allow Canada to adhere to the Rome 
Convention, an international agreement already ratified by 50 
countries, including France, Great Britain and Japan. The result of 
this will be that Convention member states in which the sound 
recordings of Canadian performers and producers are performed in 
public will pay them royalties. These will be added to the royalties 
they receive for the public performance of their works in this 
country.
<P>
	The new measures governing private copying are also intended 
to give due justice to Canadian creators. We all know that 
consumers make taped copies of sound  recordings for their own 
use. In Canada alone, according to the Report of the Task Force on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3439"> 3439 </A></B>
<P>
the Future of the Canadian Music Industry, almost 40 million blank 
tapes were used for this purpose last year.
<P>
	What people seem to forget is that this deprives composers, 
singers, producers and performers of the royalties to which they are 
entitled. In the past thirty years, artists and the sound-recording 
industry have incurred considerable losses because of private 
copying.
<P>
	It is impossible to control private copying and pay the rights 
holders each time their works are reproduced. That is why a levy 
will be charged on all blank media, such as tapes and cassettes, in 
order to compensate rights holders for their losses. The Copyright 
Board will establish the amount of the levy, which will be paid by 
the importer or manufacturer.
<P>
	It is important to point out that the government does not receive 
the royalty. The Copyright Board will establish the mechanism for 
dividing the royalty among composers, lyricists, performers and 
producers of sound recordings, and the professional associations or 
collectives will distribute it.
<P>
	I want to reiterate one of the main reservations of Bill C-32. In 
the wording of the proposed amendments, we were careful to 
protect the interests of both creators and users. I would like to add 
that we are fully aware that in the public interest, exceptions 
limiting the enforcement of copyright are sometimes necessary. It 
is a question, once again, of finding a balance between users' needs 
and those of copyright owners.
<P>
	The Act therefore provides that, in some situations, a work can 
be used without authorization and without any obligation to pay a 
royalty. Non-profit educational institutions, libraries, archives and 
museums will benefit from this type of exception.
<P>
	There are also special measures that apply to individuals with 
visual disabilities. This improvement to the Copyright Act is proof 
of the government's desire to make culture accessible to the 
greatest possible number of people.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	It marks a significant step in the legal recognition of the needs of 
people with perceptual disabilities and the need to guarantee them 
access to cultural works on substitute media.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The bill focuses on other major components of the cultural 
sector. Canadian publishers and book distributors spend a great 
deal of money and energy negotiating with copyright holders and 
original publishers for the exclusive right to sell their books in 
Canada. Some institutional buyers however circumvent the 
exclusive Canadian distributors by ordering directly from foreign 
suppliers. It is called parallel importation.
<P>
	When bookstores, wholesalers, universities and libraries order 
books from distributors outside Canada and thus circumvent the 
authorized Canadian distributor, new provisions of the Copyright 
Act will restrict the importation of books to Canada when an 
exclusive distributor, regardless of nationality, already occupies 
part of the Canadian market. In return, the distributors and their 
clients will negotiate tenders of performance which will be 
included in the regulations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The final component of the amendments is vital if we are to 
modernize an act that was established in the 1920s. In order to 
more effectively halt ongoing infringements of the Copyright Act, 
the amendments provide civil and criminal remedies, and 
modernize the wording of the Act. For example, because the extent 
of infringement is difficult to prove, copyright owners are often 
prevented from being fully compensated for their losses. As a 
result, we are proposing a system of statutory damages that would 
guarantee a minimum award once infringement is proven and serve 
to deter future infringements.
<P>
	There are some who will say that the current amendments do not 
go far enough because they do not include copyright issues related 
to the information highway and new technologies. We had several 
good reasons for excluding these issues from the current phase of 
copyright reform. First, there is the question of internal 
administration. Our priority was to settle the unfinished business of 
the previous administration. After almost ten years of neglect by 
our predecessors, and at the repeated request of Canada's cultural 
sector, we had to adapt the legislation to the realities of the 
marketplace and the major international conventions in effect, 
while responding to the most urgent concerns of the cultural sector. 
Once these necessary amendments have been adopted, we will be 
able to move on to the advent of the information highway and the 
new distribution technologies.
<P>
	As you can see, this bill is a step forward. It gives those in the 
cultural sector their due. Culture is the essence of our national 
identity, the expression of our pride. It allows each and every one 
of us to participate in the building of our collective history. The 
amendments to the Copyright Act were drafted with that in mind. 
Bill C-32 will strengthen the heart and soul of the Canadian 
cultural sector, as well as providing a more solid economic basis. I 
urge my colleagues to support the government in this crucial 
undertaking.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am torn 
between joy and fear as regards this bill. I am pleased of course as 
regards neighbouring rights, but extremely concerned about the list 
of exceptions that is being added.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3440"> 3440 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me first put the issue in its proper context. The first phase 
of this exercise was Bill C-60, which was passed in June 1988 
and which is now followed by Bill C-32, to add or remove certain 
rights to authors.
<P>
	As we know, copyrights apply to any literary, dramatic, musical 
or artistic work that is original. This legislation applies to a slew of 
works, including books, dictionaries, maps, sculptures, paintings 
and related works such as translations, summaries and adaptations. 
It applies to both published and unpublished works.
<P>
	The bill creates two types of rights. Moral rights recognize the 
author as the owner of the work and, consequently, his or her right 
to authorize its use in conditions deemed appropriate. There are 
also economic rights, which can be divided into two major 
categories: those dealing with reproductions and those dealing with 
public performances.
<P>
	As we know, copyrights usually apply for a period of 50 years 
after the death of an author. The act provides for some exceptions, 
the most important one being the fair use of a work for private 
studies or research. I will elaborate on these exceptions later on.
<P>
	Phase I of the review of the copyright legislation resulted in Bill 
C-60, passed in June 1988, which extended copyrights to computer 
programs, extended moral rights of creators over their works, 
granted the right to exhibit visual arts, abolished compulsory 
licensing-the so-called K-tel clause, which allowed the 
reproduction of acoustic works for a payment of 2 cents for the 
recording-replaced the Copyright Appeal Board by the Copyright 
Board, and recognized collectives.
<P>
	A collective is a group of copyright holders, such as SOCAN. 
However, the first phase, which resulted in Bill C-60 being passed 
in 1988, did not solve the issue of private copying, or home 
recording, and did not include the recognition of neighbouring 
rights.
<P>
	As well, Bill C-60 did not recognize other creators' rights, such 
as those claimed by the copyright coalition. Between 1988 and 
1994, four series of amendments were made to the act, following 
the commitments Canada made in the Free Trade Agreement, 
NAFTA or treaties signed with the World Trade Organization.
<P>
	The copyright legislation has been in force for about fifty years. 
It was amended in June 1988 and now this amending legislation, 
Bill C-32, has five major goals. It sets up neighbouring rights for 
performers and record producers. We commend this decision. A 
regime is established in relation to the private copying of sound 
recordings. It provides for a levy on blank audio cassettes 
manufacturers. That is also a step in the right direction.
<P>
	It protects the exclusive markets of Canadian book distributors, 
what we call the right of distribution. It has some weaknesses but it 
is still acceptable. It increases the exceptions where no royalties or 
no neighbouring rights can be claimed. We are shocked to see that 
the list of  exceptions has gone from one page to 12 pages. That is 
unacceptable and goes against all the progress made in Canada and 
all the legislation passed throughout the world.
<P>
	Five, the bill amends the current legislation in order to improve 
collective administration and civil remedies. In that area, it 
provides for the usual process.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	First of all, I will talk about neighbouring rights. I will remind 
members that these are rights given to performers and producers of 
sound recordings. For example, when Renée Claude performed a 
song, she did not have any rights. Now she will have what are 
called neighbouring rights, and so will the recording company.
<P>
	At the present time, when radio stations play the recordings of 
these performers, the authors and composers receive royalty 
payments, but not the performers or the producers. So it is a step in 
the right direction. However, there is a problem on which I will 
elaborate a little later on.
<P>
	Members will recall that neighbouring rights are recognized in 
50 countries. However, they are not recognized in the United 
States. Therefore it was important for Canada to adhere to the 
Rome Convention. It is essentially radio stations that will have to 
make payments under the neighbouring rights system. However, 
and this is where the problem is, there is a $1.25 million exception, 
which means that if a radio station's advertising revenues are less 
than $1.25 million, it will pay only $100 in royalty payments. Since 
when can one take somebody else's rights and decide how much 
that person will receive in compensation? Why not let the free 
market play its role since we have a tribunal and people who could 
established the amount that should be paid by users?
<P>
	Do you use your neighbour's car without his permission and tell 
him afterwards that you will give him $10? No. You negotiate 
before using it. It is as simple as that. This amount of $1.25 million 
seems very high, especially that this system would be in place for a 
trial period of five years.
<P>
	I understand that broadcasters wish to be exempted from paying 
neighbouring rights. In 1993, AM stations lost $59 million, while 
FM stations made profits of $20 million. They are claiming that the 
introduction of a neighbouring rights system would shut down 
radio stations and result in lost jobs.
<P>
	Like ADISQ, the Bloc Quebecois feels that the raw material is 
the talent of artists and producers, and that the use of this talent 
must be recognized. The Copyright Board has the mandate of 
setting the neighbouring rights tariff, taking into account users' 
ability to pay. So let us let the Board do its work, instead of setting 
$1.25 million in advertising revenue as the cutoff, under which 
only $100 would be payable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3441"> 3441 </A></B>
<P>
	The other major argument of broadcasters against neighbouring 
rights is that the introduction of such a system would see Canada 
losing money. We know that clause 15 of the bill provides that 
Canada will pay neighbouring rights to Canadian holders of 
neighbouring rights and to those who are signatories to the Rome 
Convention. SOCAN receives payments from abroad, and it duly 
makes its own payments. A balance can therefore easily be struck 
between money coming into and going out of Canada.
<P>
	Finally, according to the Donner report, neighbouring rights are 
an important tool for the future, especially with the advent of cable 
digital broadcasting, which will distribute digital quality music 
without interruptions from a announcer or any advertising. This 
distribution represents a source of revenue or important losses for 
performing artists and producers of sound recordings if the 
neighbouring rights regime is not introduced.
<P>
	With respect to neighbouring rights, this is exactly the position 
adopted by the Bloc Quebecois. The Bloc made a firm commitment 
to support the introduction of neighbouring rights during the last 
election campaign. We are therefore consistent with what we 
promised during the campaign. In addition, since it was elected, the 
Bloc Quebecois has, on many occasions in the House and before 
the heritage committee, called for neighbouring rights legislation.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois feels that by finally granting neighbouring 
rights to our performers and producers of sound recordings, Canada 
is making up for some very embarrassing lost time. It is 
regrettable, however, that the government limited itself to sound 
recordings and has not extended this right to audiovisual 
recordings. The Bloc Quebecois feels that exempting the first one 
and a quarter million in revenue from the payment of neighbouring 
rights is a large concession, too large, to the radio broadcasting 
industry. We will be making the necessary representations in order 
to lower this unacceptable cutoff substantially.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	It is in fact the responsibility of the Copyright Board, not the 
legislators, to see that fees charged are compatible with the users' 
ability to pay. I must point out as well that no one wants to see any 
radio stations disappear, so the Board will take the stations' ability 
to pay into consideration.
<P>
	Finally, the Bloc Quebecois would like to offer assurance that 
the creation of a new copyright scheme will not interfere with 
copyrights. To that end, section 90 ought perhaps to be 
strengthened to ensure that copyrights will be protected.
<P>
	Neighbouring rights are an indispensable tool for bolstering our 
recording industry, whose Achilles' heel is underfunding. The 
recording industry is, moreover, dominated by multinationals. In 
Canada,  Canadian-controlled businesses have marketed 71 per 
cent of Canadian content recordings. In Quebec, independent labels 
account for 31 per cent of the market, as compared to 10 per cent in 
Canada.
<P>
	What is more, although foreign-owned recording companies are 
profitable, Canadian-owned ones are just beginning to be. As for 
the smaller ones, with annual earnings of under $100,000 and 
essentially Canadian-controlled, these have never been profitable, 
but they do play an important role in the development of Canadian 
talent, as the Donner report states on page 4. As far as neighbouring 
rights are concerned, yes, although the million and a quarter figure 
strikes us as completely exaggerated.
<P>
	As for private copying, for which charges would be collected 
from manufacturers and importers of blank audiotapes, essentially 
cassette tapes, and then distributed among actors, composers, 
performers and producers of sound recordings, we know that 25 
countries have adopted regimes that provide for collecting charges 
to compensate for incurred losses.
<P>
	Last year, nearly 44 million of these blank tapes were sold. It is 
estimated that 39 million of them were used by consumers to 
privately copy sound recordings made by composers and artists 
who must earn a living from the sale of these recordings.
<P>
	The Canadian sound recording industry loses significant revenue 
estimated at $324 million a year as a result of home copying. The 
Bloc also has a very clear position on this issue, which we 
expressed during the election campaign. We made a commitment 
to support charges on private copying. We also were in favour of 
collecting such charges on videotapes. We are therefore 
disappointed to see that the government went only halfway.
<P>
	The Bloc is also happy to see that charges will not be set by 
legislators but by the Copyright Board. We would have liked the 
same thing for neighbouring rights.
<P>
	As for distribution rights, we know that this bill will prevent 
parallel imports. The Bloc Quebecois therefore supports such a 
measure because it would strengthen the Canadian publishing 
industry, although it would have more of an impact in English 
Canada than in Quebec.
<P>
	On the exceptions, however, we totally disagree with the 
government and we intend to work hard in this area when the bill is 
reviewed in committee. The current Copyright Act already 
provides for some exceptions. It provides for the use of works for 
the purpose of research and private study without having to pay 
royalties.
<P>
	It provides for the use of works for the purpose of criticism, 
review or news summary preparation, if the source is mentioned. It 
provides for the public representation or publication of paintings 
and drawings of a work. The publication of short passages from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3442"> 3442 </A></B>
<P>
literary works in which copyright subsists in a collection, mainly  
composed of non-copyright matter, intended for the use of 
educational institutions is also allowed provided certain conditions 
are met. The list of exceptions goes on; it is about a page long, but 
these are the four main ones.
<P>
	Bill C-32 considerably broadens these exceptions as they apply 
to educational institutions, libraries, archives and museums. To 
existing exceptions, it adds-and this is no small thing-the 
permission to use and reproduce works for the purpose of giving an 
assignment, test or examination; the permission to reproduce 
works that are not available in a medium of suitable quality.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	The bill gives the right to perform in public and to broadcast 
sound recordings and television or radio programs in educational 
institutions. It also allows the reproduction of current affairs and 
other programs, and broadcasting in educational institutions. It 
allows libraries, museums and archives to reproduce works for 
management and conservation purposes, and to make photocopies 
of newspaper and magazine articles, under certain conditions, for 
their clients. It also allows these institutions to do authorized work.
<P>
	It exempts libraries, museums, schools and archive services 
from their responsibility regarding production made by individuals 
on their photocopying machines. It recognizes the ``no fault'' 
principle when copyrights are violated incidentally and 
unintentionally. It recognizes the right to adapt works for the 
visually handicapped. Finally, the bill confirms the right of 
educational institutions and agricultural or industrial fairs to use 
works if the event is a non profit event.
<P>
	You will understand that creators, particularly in Quebec, were 
stunned by the scope of the exceptions introduced as part of the 
copyright review. This exercise was meant to improve things, but 
the result is 12 pages of exceptions. This is unacceptable to authors 
and composers. Generally speaking, creators feel these exceptions 
violate the spirit of the act, which seeks to protect their rights, not 
deprive owners of their due. They also feel Parliament should have 
left users and collectives negotiate the use of their works, as is done 
with the Quebec education department and the federal government, 
and that these exceptions will create a jurisdictional nightmare. 
The terms used lend themselves to such interpretation that the door 
is wide open for users to refuse to pay their fees, until the courts 
clarify the provisions of the bill.
<P>
	We believe that the exceptions are so convoluted as to be 
unmanageable, that they leave the door open to confusion, that they 
legalize delinquent behaviour by large institutions, that, under the 
pretext of balancing everyone's interests, they favour large 
government institutions to the detriment of much less powerful 
management companies.
<P>
	The position of the Bloc Quebecois in this regard is also very 
clear. The Bloc Quebecois strongly protests this tactic by the 
government, which is taking advantage of the reopening of the 
copyright legislation to increase from one to 12 the number of 
pages devoted to exceptions. The Bloc Quebecois feels that these 
exceptions are to the detriment of authors and sees no reason why 
museums, libraries, schools and archives, which pay their 
employees, their oil and their electricity bills, should cheat authors, 
composers, performers and producers of their economic rights.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois intends to show how these exceptions 
invalidate agreements that already exist between these large 
institutions and management companies. The Bloc also intends to 
show how these exceptions, in their present form, will lead to 
confusion and will pave the way for schools, museums, archives 
and libraries not to pay creators their due.
<P>
	I would like to give some examples of these unacceptable 
exceptions. In clause 29.5 the following exception is described: it 
gives educational institutions the right to perform a work live or in 
public, to broadcast in public a sound recording or a performer's 
performance that is embodied in a sound recording, on condition 
that this is done on the premises of an educational institution, for 
educational purposes and not for profit, before an audience 
consisting primarily of students of the educational institution, 
instructors of the institution, or any person directly responsible for 
this institution. That is clause 29.5.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Now to the questions we in the Bloc are asking and, of necessity, 
they will be the questions asked by the creators as well. Why is 
such an authorization being given to educational institutions? Is an 
auditorium part of an educational institution's premises? That is 
not determined. Who will determine whether the event was held for 
educational purposes or to raise money? Who will determine 
whether the entrance fees were collected to generate profit or to 
meet the costs of holding the event?
<P>
	Who will be stationed at the door to ensure that the audience are 
indeed students and staff of the educational institution? Will their 
parents be considered persons directly responsible for setting a 
curriculum for the educational institution? Do you see all the 
questions that just one of these exceptions prompts us to ask?
<P>
	Now, for another exception in clauses 29.6 and 29.7. The 
purpose of this exception is to allow educational institutions to 
make a copy of a news or other radio or television program for 
educational purposes, to be replayed for the students of the 
institution. Copies may be retained for one year in the case of news 
broadcasts, and 30 days for other recordings, without copyright, in 
order to evaluate the educational suitability of such a program. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3443"> 3443 </A></B>
<P>
Then the royalties must be paid and the  program may then be 
retained in keeping with the arrangements entered into with the 
collective society. The educational institutions must keep a log of 
their copies.
<P>
	Imagine the complexity of such a disposition. It prompts us to 
ask a number of questions. How will the collective societies be able 
to administer this administrative muddle? Will programs such as 
serials, for example, be considered by a group of teachers in an 
effort to decide whether it is really a practical teaching tool? Why 
did the government not let educational institutions negotiate these 
points with collective societies as is done in other areas?
<P>
	Let us consider clause 30, which allows the staff of libraries, 
museums and archives to make copies of works for clients for 
personal research purposes, on the condition that the individual 
satisfies the library, museum or archive that they will be used only 
for private study or research. Dream on. More questions arise about 
this clause. What criteria determine for library, museum or archive 
personnel that the copy requested is for personal ends? Here again, 
we have a practical example of the crazy limits of the exception.
<P>
	Clause 30.3 provides that libraries, museums and archives will 
be cleared of responsibility for the use of their photocopiers, 
through the affixing of a notice above the photocopier asking users 
not to contravene the Copyright Act. What about the deals 
negociated by UNEQ and CANCOPY, which grant licenses to some 
education institutions in order to allow reproduction by their users 
for research purposes? Does this mean that, if someone infringes 
the Copyright Act by phocopying a book, for instance, the school 
authorities are going to shut their eyes and will not be held 
responsible?
<P>
	Since when is an institution not responsible for its reproduction 
equipment? Photocopiers have become like coat racks with signs 
posted saying: ``We are not responsible for photocopied material''. 
That is what this section is saying. Clause 30.7 also says: ``It is not 
an infringement of copyright to incidentally and not deliberately'' 
use a work. Are there any other laws which state that a person who 
does something incidentally and not deliberately is not 
responsible? The guy who gets in his car after drinking and kills 
someone did not do it deliberately and therefore is not responsible. 
It is the same thing. That what is said here respecting copyright.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the position of the Bloc is clear regarding the 
exceptions: they are unacceptable and far too many. The existing 
list was sufficient.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	As for civil remedies, the last point I want to address, we know 
that copyright owners claim the present legislation does not protect 
their works because remedies provided are inappropriate, 
time-consuming and expensive. The measures proposed to rectify 
those  irritants are simplified legal procedures that ease the process 
and lessen the potential costs of a lawsuit.
<P>
	As for statutory damages, when infringement of copyright has 
been proven, the claimant can choose to have the amount of 
damages determined according to a schedule provided by the act.
<P>
	Measures are proposed to prevent through injunctions 
experienced infringers from circumventing remedies, and to 
facilitate the granting of such injunctions. The Bloc essentially 
agrees with the part of the bill dealing with civil remedies.
<P>
	I will conclude my remarks on the bill as a whole. Part II of Bill 
C-32 represents two steps forward, some sidesteps and many steps 
backwards. The steps forward are the recognition of neighbouring 
rights and levies on blank cassettes. The sidesteps are the 
exemption granted to broadcasters on the first $1.25 million in 
advertising revenue, and the steps backwards are unequivocally the 
exceptions added to the list.
<P>
	This uneasiness is probably caused by the fact that the legislative 
aspect of copyright is the responsibility of Industry Canada not of 
Heritage Canada, which would have better defended creators' 
rights and would have been more impervious to the lobbying of the 
broadcasting industry and government agencies.
<P>
	As a result, Part II leaves a bitter sweet taste, a mixture of 
emotions going from happiness, since new rights are recognized, to 
disappointment, as in the same breath we can wonder to what 
extent they really are recognized, and because copyright is being 
limited in a very real and concrete manner, without any valid 
reason.
<P>
	Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois intends to work very hard on the 
heritage committee to analyze this bill after second reading, to 
improve, modernize and amend this bill which is an essential tool 
of policies promoting the cultural development in Canada and 
Quebec; this will have to be done with the greater respect for 
creators who are the very basis, the raw material, of this whole 
industry.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to Bill C-32.
<P>
	I must start by declaring my bias on this piece of legislation. I 
am a broadcaster by trade and it is important that I say that right 
away. In declaring that, perhaps I should take a couple of moments 
to explain why I think it is very important from the perspective of 
someone who has been in the broadcast industry that this 
legislation not come into place, not necessarily because it hurts 
broadcasters, although it does, but because it will hurt Canadian 
culture in general. I will expand on those remarks over the course 
of the next several minutes.
<P>
	I should start by acknowledging the work of the hon. member for 
Kootenay East who now sits on the Canadian  heritage committee, 
my colleague in the Reform Party, our heritage critic who has done 
a lot of work on this particular issue. He has many concerns and has 
provided me with some information.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3444"> 3444 </A></B>
<P>
	I certainly was aware of the issue and I think hon. members in all 
parties were aware of it as well. There was a rather intense lobby 
from all sides with respect to this legislation and there is a good 
reason for that. The reason is this legislation will profoundly affect 
the various industries it touches.
<P>
	I want to talk for a moment about the broadcast industry. The 
minister said a few minutes ago that the bill will strengthen 
Canadian culture. I am going to challenge that assertion. It will 
strengthen some aspects of Canadian culture but at the expense of 
other players in Canadian culture. I speak primarily of people in the 
broadcast industry.
<P>
	I want to make the argument that hundreds of broadcasters in the 
big and small radio stations around the country are as much a part 
of Canadian culture as are the recording artists. Absolutely. I will 
give my personal perspective on this.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	I ran a little radio station in Brooks, Alberta. I did that for 10 
years. Prior to that I worked at radio stations throughout western 
Canada, some quite small, some a little larger in medium size 
markets. It is important to point out the value these little radio 
stations have in their communities. They are the glue that hold 
those communities together in so many ways.
<P>
	The community of Brooks relied on my radio station for the 
local weather report which is something we take for granted. If we 
stop to think about it, it makes absolute sense that if we could not 
support that radio station because of yet another imposition of 
some kind of a tax, a levy or in this case, neighbouring rights which 
cause the radio station to go out of business, people who relied on 
the local weather report would be lost. We are talking about 
farmers, ranchers and those types of people. People wait to hear 
whether or not the school bus will be running because of a storm. 
They simply would not have that local information.
<P>
	Another example of how radio stations hold communities 
together is the local news aspect. Many local communities have 
weekly newspapers but they do not have daily information. That is 
very important. I talked about the weather. If my memory serves 
me, the number one reason people listen to the radio is to hear the 
weather report. The second most important reason is local news. 
People want to hear what is going on in their community on a day 
to day basis. If because of government legislation some radio 
stations are knocked off the map and people cannot get the local 
information, the sense of community will be lost in a very real way.
<P>
	I come from Brooks, Alberta which has a population of 10,000. 
It is quite far from any other major centre. There are many 
communities in that type of situation around the country. If those 
communities lost their local radio station it would be a tremendous 
loss because there would be no other radio station or TV station to 
jump in to fill the gap. It would be a terrible loss.
<P>
	I know many hon. members opposite feel the same way. I hope I 
am not putting anyone on the spot when I read the following letter. 
That is certainly not my intent. I have a letter which was signed by 
the hon. member for Essex-Kent. It was sent to the former 
heritage minister. The letter states: ``Neighbouring rights will add 
dramatically to this local programming loss across our country. 
Border communities such as Windsor and Sarnia are in a 
competitive market with the U.S.A. Added cost to the Canadian 
broadcasters will place them in a less competitive position. It is 
truly troubling to me to pass legislation that would place the radio 
broadcast industry in Canada at a disadvantage to their U.S. 
counterparts''.
<P>
	It is an excellent letter and the hon. member made some very 
good points in it. That is one huge reason the legislation is bad. 
Overall this legislation will cost Canadian broadcasters somewhere 
in the range of $30 million. That comes at a time when over half of 
the radio stations in the country are losing money, especially AM 
radio which is under tremendous strain because of fragmentation in 
the marketplace and new technologies. Suffice it to say that at the 
present time there are no technologies which can replace what 
radio is doing around the country.
<P>
	This is an extremely important issue. Again I say to the minister 
that she is proposing legislation which will strengthen one aspect of 
Canadian culture, but it will greatly weaken another.
<P>
	Another point is that there is really no reason to bring this 
legislation forward right now. That really bothers me. I do not 
understand where the minister is coming from. There is a 
longstanding historical understanding between the record industry 
and radio with respect to how record companies are compensated 
when radio stations play their music. If someone's music is played 
on the radio, obviously it will have an impact on record sales.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	The broadcasters recently had Angus Reid conduct a study. It 
was discovered that about 45 per cent of music purchasers 
identified radio as the most important influence in their most recent 
music purchase. It outranked all other factors by a ratio of three to 
one. Overall, nearly nine in ten or about 88 per cent of Canadian 
music buyers rated radio to have been a somewhat to a very 
influential factor in their music purchase over the last year or two.
<P>
	I get the sense that the minister is setting out to kill the goose 
that has laid the golden egg. The Canadian music  industry and its 
artists are doing extremely well around the world. Not only are they 
popular in Canada but they are popular in the United States and 
Europe as well. There are many obvious examples. Therefore, the 
question is: If the present system is working extremely well, why 
are we engaging on a new course that could potentially undermine 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3445"> 3445 </A></B>
<P>
the broadcasting industry, which is precisely the industry that has 
given many of these artists their start?
<P>
	Many radio stations in order to help them get their licence tell 
the CRTC when they apply for their licence that they will commit 
to spending a portion of their profits on promoting new artists who 
do not yet have a record. They will help them record a song so that 
the artists can get some air play. In many instances the group, for 
example the one I belong to, CHUM Limited, a big chain across the 
country, would say that they would give the new artists free 
advertising of their records on their air waves.
<P>
	This is seen as an important way to help fulfil the 30 per cent 
Canadian content rule, by ensuring that there are lots of good 
quality Canadian artists out there. A lot of time is spent coming up 
with ads to promote Canadian recording artists. What we are doing 
here is undermining the radio industry and therefore jeopardizing 
precisely the same artists the minister is intent on promoting.
<P>
	Those arguments are good enough, but there are many other 
important arguments against this legislation. I want to make 
another right now with help from the member for Essex-Kent and 
his letter.
<P>
	What we are proposing to do seems insane in many ways. We 
want to set upon a course that will provide neighbouring rights 
legislation which in effect will ensure that Canadian artists who 
receive a lot of air play in the United States will not benefit. In fact, 
they may be ultimately penalized-and I will get to that in a 
moment-by virtue of the government bringing in this 
neighbouring rights legislation. At the same time, we are providing 
a perverse incentive for Canadian broadcasters to play more 
American music. Let me explain how this works.
<P>
	Neighbouring rights legislation will extend the current copyright 
legislation that applies to the composers of music on to the artists 
and the record producers. In other words, the producers and artists 
will enjoy the protection of copyright legislation. They do not 
enjoy it right now. The radio stations will pay for that. In Canada 
there will be a monetary incentive to play more American music 
because it is exempt from the copyright legislation. It is a crazy 
incentive to put in place if someone wants to promote Canadian 
music. It does not make any sense at all.
<P>
	On the other hand, we are treating the Americans differently in 
Canada. They will not be subject to the new copyright legislation. 
We are treating American artists differently. That will make us 
subject to a challenge  under NAFTA or under the WTO, which 
would quite possibly mean that the Americans could challenge us. 
It could mean that some of our artists will be ultimately denied 
from receiving air play in the United States.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	The point with respect to this issue was extremely well made by 
the hon. member for Essex-Kent. I will read from the letter he 
sent to the heritage minister:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On Wednesday, November 1st, the U.S. government passed its Digital 
Performance Rights Act of 1995. This U.S. legislation excludes current radio 
stations, as well as future digital radio stations, from any form of neighbouring 
rights royalty payments. There is grave concern in the industry that any 
introduction of a neighbouring rights royalty in Canada will be detrimental to 
the radio industry which is already experiencing financial difficulties. Of equal 
concern is that Canada would have a different system than in the U.S.</BLOCKQUOTE>
The U.S. obviously is the big market for the majority of Canadian 
artists and also is our biggest trading partner. The letter goes on to 
state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For example, if Canada were to have a neighbouring rights regime, which 
includes Canadians but excludes U.S. entertainers, it would be challenged under 
the WTO. The effect of a successful U.S. position is that approximately 70 per 
cent of the royalties paid by Canadian radio stations would be paid to foreigners, 
with no such return of revenue from the U.S. due to their exclusion. In any 
event, the U.S. has indicated that it would consider this system under the 
national treatment rules. This means that the U.S. will simply demand the same 
treatment for U.S. performers and record companies as given to Canadian 
performers and record companies.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, because the Americans are excluded, we are 
going to send our people down there. They will not receive any 
royalties from the Americans because the Americans do not have 
this legislation. Radio is exempt under U.S. copyright rules. 
However, in Canada we will have the situation of a reverse 
incentive to actually play more American music because 
broadcasters will see a monetary benefit from it. It makes 
absolutely no sense. Not only that, we will possibly be subject to a 
NAFTA challenge or a WTO challenge. We have no idea of what 
the consequences of that could be. Suffice it to say the country 
music channel dispute shows us that the Americans are determined 
to play hardball when it comes to cultural industries.
<P>
	One of the other concerns I have is with respect to how certain 
performers are going to benefit from this legislation while other 
performers are penalized. In relative terms, neighbouring rights 
legislation most benefits those Canadian artists who tend to receive 
more air play in Europe where neighbouring rights apply to private 
radio than in the U.S. where they do not. In practical terms this 
means that certain genres of music and music recorded in certain 
languages will benefit at the expense of others.
<P>
	What is rather obvious, if I can state the obvious here, is that 
recording artists from Quebec are going to receive  far more benefit 
from this than Canadian artists outside of Quebec. The reason is 
that most of the people who have signed on to the Berne convention 
are from Europe. Therefore, Quebec artists who sing in the French 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3446"> 3446 </A></B>
<P>
language for instance are going to be the beneficiaries of this. 
However people who perform in English and have their primary 
market in the United States are not going to receive the royalties 
because, as I mentioned several times before, the U.S. excludes 
neighbouring rights from applying to private radio.
<P>
	The legislation provides a benefit to francophone artists in 
particular, but also to other artists who perform in different 
languages and receive a lot of air play in Europe. Meanwhile, it 
does not help and most likely will hurt those Canadian artists who 
perform in the United States. The real situation is that the minister 
is pitting one group of artists against another. We are headed for 
trouble if we do that because it is wrong.
<P>
	Another point I want to make is a little more complicated. 
Actually Europeans do much better with this deal than do 
Canadians overall because of our broadcasting system. In Canada 
literally hundreds of radio stations across the country broadcast to 
30 million people. In Europe a fraction of that number of radio 
stations broadcast to 300 million people.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	By virtue of how the neighbouring rights legislation is designed, 
what is important is how many spins of the record occur over the 
course of a year and not how many people it reaches. That is how 
the legislation is designed. In relative terms we will be sending a 
lot more money to Europe than Europe will be sending to Canada 
for our artists because of the way the broadcast system is designed.
<P>
	We have a situation where European performers will actually do 
better than Canadian performers. It does not make any sense that 
our government would be promoting that. To me it is ridiculous and 
counterintuitive. Nonetheless that is precisely what is being 
proposed.
<P>
	I will not belabour this point as there are people who would like 
to discuss other pieces of legislation. I sum up by saying that there 
is no support for the legislation across the way, as far as I can 
determine. There is certainly no support for it in my party or, I 
would argue, across the country.
<P>
	I would argue that Canadians are very supportive of their local 
radio stations. People feel that Canadian performers are doing 
extremely well today. We see them all the time: Shania Twain and 
Michelle Wright. Many Quebec artists are doing extremely well 
around the world. To tinker with the current system is to invite 
disaster, to invite killing the goose that laid the golden egg. All this 
occurs at a time when private broadcasters are facing serious 
financial problems.
<P>
	I cannot understand the motivation for the legislation given all 
the arguments against it. I encourage hon. members across the way, 
members of the Bloc Quebecois and certainly members of my own 
party, to go after the legislation.
<P>
	I encourage the minister to justify why she is taking this course. I 
remind her that for every argument she puts forward in favour of 
the legislation there are three or four against it. I encourage her to 
think about that and to remember that the broadcast industry, 
speaking as someone who comes from it, is a very important part of 
Canadian culture. Steps should be taken not necessarily to promote 
it but certainly to stop the erosion of it that the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage is proposing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty to inform the House that the 
question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as 
follows: the hon. member for Davenport-Law of the Sea 
Convention.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
his remarks just now the hon. member of the Reform Party made 
repeated reference to a letter from my colleague, the hon. member 
for Essex-Kent.
<P>
	Bill C-32 was first introduced in the House on April 25. Before 
that date absolutely no one knew what would be in the bill. The 
letter to which the member opposite refers, the letter from the 
member for Essex-Kent, was written well before April 25. It is 
fair to say that Bill C-32 very adequately addresses and satisfies the 
concerns expressed in that letter.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	I regard it not as a duty but as a privilege and a pleasure to speak 
to Bill C-32. I am genuinely pleased to have the opportunity of 
saying good things about a manifestly good piece of legislation.
<P>
	It is with pride that I express my support for a cause so timely 
and just, so attentive to the principles of fairness and equity, so 
responsive to the exigencies of our modern age and so ultimately 
beneficial to Canadian culture.
<P>
	I use this latter term somewhat guardedly. I am well aware of the 
dangers inherent in seeming to speak too annoyingly about culture 
with a capital <I>c</I>. Therefore, unless someone asks me to define the 
concept, a task that has defeated many a scholarly mind, allow me 
to resort to terms that most of us can more readily understand.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Here in Canada, the arts and cultural industries give work to 
more than half a million persons and put $16 billion annually into 
our national economy. Whatever our opinion might be on culture 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3447"> 3447 </A></B>
<P>
with a capital ``C'', it is evident that, from a purely financial point 
of view, culture plays an important role in our country. Any  
measure supporting the livelihood of workers and the prosperity of 
their sector is ultimately supporting all of our economy and also 
our identity and our sovereignty.
<P>
	Bill C-32 is one such measure. In fact, it is a whole series of 
measures applicable to copyright, an essential element for artistic 
creators of this country. Copyright is the legal framework whereby 
creators of works like movies, books, songs, information products 
and computer programs, receive some financial compensation 
whenever their work is used by other people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Prominent among the bill's provisions is its so-called <I>p</I> and <I>p</I> 
component, which stands for performers and producers rights.
<P>
	I heard a comment earlier asking whether I was reading my 
remarks. Yes, I am reading some remarks, but I can tell hon. 
members of the Reform Party that I have spent considerable 
months working on the issue with other members of my caucus. I 
am extremely well informed on the bill. I sit on the Canadian 
heritage committee as the vice-chair. I welcome the hon. member 
who made the comment or any others who come before the 
committee to address it. It is important legislation that we are quite 
prepared to examine in detail.
<P>
	These <I>p</I> and <I>p</I> provisions will in effect extend royalty payments 
to producers and the performers of sound recordings. One might 
well ask whether royalties do not already ensue whenever 
recordings are broadcast over the air waves or performed in public. 
They do indeed, but under the current rights regime royalties in 
such cases go only to composers and lyricists of the songs in 
question.
<P>
	In other words, when a radio station uses the latest recording by 
Céline Dion or Anne Murray of a song that happens to have been 
written by someone else, the songwriter gets duly paid for the use 
of the piece. However the company that made the recording and the 
song's performer and interpreter, Céline or Anne, do not. That is 
fundamentally unfair.
<P>
	With this proposed legislation Canada will join the ranks of 
some 50 other countries that have already accepted the principle of 
performers and producers rights. Like them, we will at last 
recognize in law that those whose recording artistry and expertise 
bring a work into prominence are as deserving of royalties as 
composers or lyricists.
<P>
	Some may look at the illustrious names I have just cited and 
suggest that I have not chosen the best examples to garner support 
for performers and producers rights.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	Céline Dion and Anne Murray are, after all, fabulously 
successful and prosperous performers and have been so for some 
time. As such it may appear that they have little  need for <I>p</I> and <I>p</I> 
royalties. To such a suggestion I would respond in two ways.
<P>
	First, the Céline Dions and the Anne Murrays of the Canadian 
music industry are the exceptions, individuals who have reached 
the pinnacle of their profession. Below them, less visible but no 
less remarkable, lies a far faster preponderance of Canadian 
performers, musicians and recording artists, talented and dedicated 
professionals all but whose acquaintance with popular success may 
have proved at best fleeting, sporadic and far more modest.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadian artists are collectively among the least paid 
professionals in the country. For those who work in the sound 
recording industry, the prospect of sometimes getting performers 
and producers rights or a small fraction of the new royalty on blank 
audio cassettes could be valuable.
<P>
	Second, whether rich or poor, famous or unknown, it does not 
matter what kind of person receives the performers and producers 
rights, because they are rights, not privileges, and these rights are 
theirs. They are based on the unquestionable principle of fair 
payment for work done.
<P>
	If someone uses the product of my work, I am entitled to expect 
and to receive a fair payment from him, no matter who I am and 
what my achievements are, whether I am already rich or not, 
whether I do not particularly need money at the time or need it. If 
someone benefits from my works, if he exploits the product of the 
work I have done, I am entitled to expect a payment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I realize that user pay approaches are far easier to defend in the 
abstract than in practice. In developing these legislative proposals 
we realized full well that we had little to gain by assisting one 
group and creating hardship elsewhere. That is why we were so 
careful to take account of the financial situation of broadcasters in 
establishing the new performers and producers regime.
<P>
	Therefore members will not be surprised to learn that I am 
somewhat taken aback and disappointed with the vociferous stance 
against the bill being taken by certain broadcasters. They would 
have us believe that Bill C-32 will mean disaster for them, that it 
will push hundreds of financially beleaguered radio stations over 
the brink.
<P>
	How can this be? How is it possible for the broadcasting industry 
to argue its interests have been irreparably damaged when we have 
taken such pains to minimize any potential adverse consequences, 
when they have been so careful to ensure that <I>p</I> and <I>p</I> royalty 
payments will accord with the ability to pay?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3448"> 3448 </A></B>
<P>
	There are some 487 commercial radio stations in Canada. Of 
these approximately 65 per cent or well over 300 will be required to 
pay only a nominal flat fee of  $100 per year, hardly a sum that is 
likely to push any station, beleaguered or not, over any brink.
<P>
	This virtual exemption will apply to smaller stations right across 
Canada, those that take in annual advertising revenues of less than 
$1.25 million. This seems by any account a generous limit. Some 
are even saying it is too generous. It will in effect shelter $400 
million, a full 55 per cent of all radio advertising revenue in the 
country.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	As for the remainder of the country's radio stations the larger 
ones, the richer ones, those that take in advertising revenues in 
excess of $1.25 million, they will naturally be expected to pay 
more than the minimum $100 in keeping with their greater income.
<P>
	Even so, the fees that are set will be phased in gradually over 
five years. Moreover, these fees will apply only to that portion of 
advertising revenues in excess of $1.25 million. As an additional 
measure of prediction the amount of the fee will be established by 
the copyright board after an open consultative process and after 
hearing from interested parties on the subject.
<P>
	The bill will go to the committee on Canadian heritage, of which 
I am vice-chair. It is a very technical bill. We are certainly open to 
hearing input from all members. We believe the bill will stand on 
its merits and will bear careful scrutiny.

	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Mississauga East, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-274, an act to amend the Criminal Code and the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act (cumulative sentences), be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, volume discounts for rapists and murders 
is the law in Canada today. It is called concurrent sentencing. It 
means that serial predators can serve penalties for multiple crimes 
at the same time and be out on the streets in only a fraction of the 
total sentencing.
<P>
	Concurrent sentencing cheapens life. The lives of individual 
victims are erased from the sentencing equation. The suffering, the 
pain and the death of the second, third or eleventh victim is of no 
consequence to the courts. The minimum penalty always applies 
for even the most prolific killers.
<P>
	Canadians cannot forget the spectacle of Denis Lortie after he 
machine gunned three people to death in Quebec City. It would 
have been hard to imagine at the time that he could be back on the 
street today after serving only three and a half years for each person 
he killed. That is the bargain basement price of life in our courts 
and parole system.
<P>
	Denis Lortie is an unusual case, not because he is a multiple 
murderer or because he was released after a wrist slap of a prison 
term. Denis Lortie's case is unusual because the public is aware of 
it.
<P>
	The majority of murderers and serial sex offenders are returned 
to neighbourhoods without publicity or warning. Trials and 
convictions do attract publicity and attention and the public is 
always lulled by the hoax of a life sentence they read in the 
morning paper. But 10 years later they really hear the truth. The 
parole board has short changed justice, written off the victims as 
yesterday's news and freed up a bunk bed for the next killer.
<P>
	But Canadians are gradually catching on to the deception of life 
imprisonment. Half of all those convicted of second degree murder 
and sentenced to life are released after less than 12 years. For first 
degree murder the median has historically been 14 years. Life only 
means life for the murder victim who is not there to protest his or 
her sentence and is never eligible for parole.
<P>
	The predator has also dealt a life sentence to the victim's family. 
For them the comforting illusion of safety in our society has been 
shattered. They have to live with the stark truth that the only law 
that protects them is the law of averages, the chance that none of 
the predators roaming our communities will get around to you 
today.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	Sharon Rosenfeldt had the courage to recall her personal tragedy 
in support of my bill. She writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Concurrent sentencing is appalling. My son was one of the eleven children 
murdered by serial child killer Clifford Olson. The fact that he is serving eleven 
concurrent life sentences is ludicrous. As the mother of one of Olson's victims, I 
have difficulty in dealing with the reality that he is serving the equivalent of one 
life sentence instead of the eleven life sentences he should be serving.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Why is it justice for Clifford Olson to serve no additional penalty 
for murdering 10 additional children? Why can the victim's 
families not have peace of mind and never have to hear from 
Clifford Olson again?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3451"> 3451 </A></B>
<P>
	My bill would have spared them the revictimization of having 
even the slightest concern that Clifford Olson would be paroled 
as his combined parole ineligibility would have and should have 
been 275 years, not the 25-year bargain given by our current 
system. How can a civilized society be so tolerant and generous 
toward the savagery of a Clifford Olson and be so dismissive of 
the death sentences forever served by his victims.
<P>
	The justice minister not long ago observed that victims have 
been the orphans of the justice system and how right he was. That is 
why so many victims groups exist. Among those who support my 
bill are Debbie Mahaffy's Taking Action for Victims, CAVEAT, 
Victims of Violence, Citizens United for Safety and Justice, the 
Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime and the Canadian 
Police Association.
<P>
	But our institutions are mostly responsive to lawyers, lobbyists, 
inmate advocates. Criminals can rely on the system that orphaned 
their victims. The murder victim has no representative, no lobbyist 
and no lawyer because the victim is dead. The only argument we 
will hear about the victim's lost rights will come from family and 
from people who recognize the injustice and obscenity of the 
current system.
<P>
	Let us face it, the predator protection industry is part of our 
modern economy. Justice cannot compete with currency. But the 
victims of Canadian justice, though unpaid, refuse to be unheard.
<P>
	Priscilla de Villiers writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is an absolute insult to victims of violent crime that each murder, 
subsequent to the first murder of an offender is considered to be free.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Why is it that the second murder victim does not count? Very 
simply, Canadian justice offers a bulk rate to murderers and rapists. 
One 25 year so-called life sentence is the penalty for premeditated 
murder no matter how many victims, and a mere seven years in 
prison is the maximum parole ineligibility for a rapist, again no 
matter how many victims.
<P>
	But columnists advocating inmates' rights will argue that 
nothing is served by revenge, that we should have to prove that 
each predator is a continuing risk to society and not waste the lives 
of reformed carnivores.
<P>
	It has become groupthink these days that we should be generous 
to murderers who only killed an abusive husband or smothered an 
infant child in a domestic dispute. My bill is not focused on these 
much pitied murderers. It deals only with multiple killers and 
rapists, criminals like Clifford Olson, people who plan, stalk and 
destroy young lives.
<P>
	There are no mitigating circumstances for a predator. There is no 
need to rehabilitate a predator. No predator is a safe addition to any 
neighbourhood no matter what his therapist might say.
<P>
	One of my constituents is a teacher in Brampton. One day some 
years ago the rehabilitation poster boy, Joseph Fredericks, was 
invited to his school, a shining example of a reformed sex offender. 
This devastating product of rehabilitation went on to attack and kill 
Christopher Stephenson.
<P>
	By being convicted, serial predators have identified themselves 
as threats to society. No term in prison, no therapy, no treatment 
can make a predator an acceptable risk. Yet parole boards will 
continue to gamble with the lives of children and others by letting 
predators loose on the buffet of victims in Canadian communities.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	Why is it that parole boards can take such risks so liberally? 
There is no risk to the parole board. For every 100 sex offenders 
released, 30 women and children are victimized. That is not just a 
stat. It is a guarantee. Parole does save a few dollars admittedly, but 
it ruins many lives.
<P>
	The Metro Toronto Zoo is currently suffering budgetary 
difficulties. One might ask why it does not save money by 
emptying its cages and letting its untamed animals loose on the 
streets of Toronto. Why not? They are not the parole board and they 
can be sued for recklessly endangering citizens.
<P>
	Prisons represent less than 1 per cent of federal spending. 
Protecting the public from predators would hardly bankrupt the 
nation. We can afford a little more justice.
<P>
	Collette writes in support my bill:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This issue is very dear to me and my family. In 1991, four members of our 
family, Maurice, Susan, Islay and Janello Mandin were murdered by young 
offender Gavin Mandin. He was tried in adult court, and received a sentence of 
life with parole eligibility at ten years. One sentence, one parole eligibility.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Four lives erased, 10 years in prison. Oh, but wait. The murderer 
can change in prison. He can become a better citizen, get an 
education and even start a family through the conjugal visits of the 
jailhouse Jenny program. As always, resources are showered on the 
criminal, now called a client, but precious little is done to support 
the victimized families.
<P>
	As with all other victims, and victims groups who support my 
bill, Collette Mandin-Kossowan asked to know the result of my 
vote.
<P>
	But Debbie Mahaffy, the mother of Leslie Mahaffy, who died at 
the hands of Paul Bernardo, was more cautious, having had more 
experience with how justice can be obstructed, how justice is too 
rarely a votable item. She is used to the lip service, the feigned 
support, the photo ops and then the secret opposition that thwarts it 
all. Mrs. Mahaffy writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3452"> 3452 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I fear there will be too much opposition because consecutive sentencing is so 
sensible, so no-nonsense, so uncomplicated, it may be too simple for some to 
understand.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I owe the groups that have supported this bill a reason for why it 
was thwarted by the subcommittee on Private Members' Business. 
The committee does not give reasons. It operates in secret, each 
member swearing silence except to the press when convenient. The 
transcripts of my presentation to the committee should lend some 
insight.
<P>
	The committee offered not a single question about Bill C-274. 
They rendered no opposing comments, no objections, no rationale 
for the bill not being votable. At the time, I recalled the words of 
the Minister of Justice who said in the House that ``too often, 
through insensitivity the interests and personal stake of the victim 
are overlooked''.
<P>
	How each of the four members of this committee voted is not a 
closely guarded secret. Only the public and the victims groups are 
denied the truth. They are used to that. Victims groups once again 
have reason to conclude that Parliament is not a trustworthy ally in 
their pursuit of justice.
<P>
	Consecutive sentencing is uncomplicated. It would restore a 
degree of truth in sentencing. It recognizes that each sentence 
applies to a specific crime, an individual victim, a personal horror. 
It insists that the price for rape and murder must not be marked 
down.
<P>
	Under my bill, Denis Lortie would have had to serve 10 years for 
each life he took and Debbie Mahaffy would never have to plead 
with any parole board to keep Paul Bernardo in jail where he 
belongs.
<P>
	As life sentences are a hoax, the only meaningful part of a 
sentence is the period of parole ineligibility, the period for which 
the murderer is guaranteed to be behind bars, the period before the 
victim's family must relive a nightmare. That is the only sentence 
that is remotely real, remotely believable.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	For Paul Bernardo and Clifford Olson that is 15 years. The rest 
of their sentences are just an option, an option our system allows to 
revictimize the parents of the victims, potentially to force them to 
join countless other victims in having to dredge up some gruesome 
memories just to provide victim impact statements and petitions to 
keep a cage between the predator and the prey.
<P>
	However, the quality of mercy is not strained. Parliament still 
has an opportunity to narrow the gap between the justice system 
and justice. Does any member here stand in support of volume 
discounts for serial rapists and murderers? I would like those who 
think a second murder victim does not count to stand up and be 
counted. I would like to restore Mrs. Mahaffy's faith in this 
institution by asking for unanimous consent in the House to make 
Bill C-274 a votable motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the motion from the hon. member for Mississauga East. Is 
there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-274 put forward by the hon. member for 
Mississauga East.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I did not 
hear any objection to the unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> With the greatest of respect, 
I put the motion to the floor. I heard some naysayers, and so I can 
resume debate, which is what I intend to do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, for the sake of consistency, I shall 
take it from the top. I am pleased to speak on Bill C-274 put 
forward by the hon. member for Mississauga East. If I may, I would 
like to start by setting the record straight because the hon. member, 
acting in all good faith I am sure, has questioned the procedure 
currently used by the sub-committee on private members' 
business.
<P>
	Along with the hon. members for Mississauga West, Edmonton 
North and Okanagan-Shuswap, I sit on this committee, which, for 
obvious reasons, meets in camera to hold proceedings and only 
under these circumstances. That is because the House has seen fit 
for the committee responsible for looking into private members' 
business to be sheltered from outside pressure. What better way to 
elude pressure than to sit in camera, where we can discuss freely 
and frankly, without having people watching over our shoulders as 
we draw our conclusions.
<P>
	Without compromising the secrecy of in camera meetings, I was 
able to assure the hon. member that no vote was taken on his bill in 
our committee. In fact, the sub-committee on private members' 
business very seldom takes votes. We usually report to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs after reaching a 
consensus. I would say that, in 95 per cent of cases, we 
unanimously agree on the bills referred to us.
<P>
	That is why I was taken aback, to some extent, by the remarks 
made by the hon. member for Mississauga East, as reported in the 
<I>Hill Times</I>. This is probably due to a lack of knowledge of the 
system, a system which has shown that we can have good bills and 
good motions in this House, provided there is an appropriate 
process and it is complied with.
<P>
	This being said, even though the bill before us is not a votable 
item, it raises important issues including, of course, the whole 
matter of cumulative sentences. Under our system, when a judge 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3453"> 3453 </A></B>
<P>
imposes sentences for various offences, he has a duty to state 
whether these sentences are cumulative or concurrent.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	According to our tradition, a judge usually imposes a sentence 
for the most serious offence and includes in it the other sentences 
for lesser offences. So, generally speaking, sentences are 
concurrent.
<P>
	The fact is that, under our criminal laws, including the Criminal 
code, judges already have the power to impose consecutive 
sentences when they deem appropriate to do so. It might be a good 
idea, during a debate on a motion to this effect, to look at the issue 
of sentencing. Do we want judges to make greater use of their 
power to impose consecutive sentences? Perhaps.
<P>
	Perhaps the judiciary itself could deal with the fact that, in some 
cases, the imposition of consecutive sentences is justified. 
However, imposing consecutive sentences does not settle all the 
situations better than if it was ordered by legislation.
<P>
	Inevitably, we will find ourselves in a situation where the 
compulsory imposition of consecutive sentences would become 
inappropriate. What can a judge do if he has no discretion? He will 
have to impose sentences that will prove to be an excessive burden 
for the individual who has been found guilty or has admitted his 
guilt.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mississauga East also mentioned some 
people, notorious criminals, who were sentenced to one life 
sentence only. Contrary to the U.S. system, we do not have in our 
system convicted people sentenced to 200 or 300 years of 
imprisonment. Generally, one life sentence is enough.
<P>
	In the case in question, as in the Bernardo case, since a charge 
was laid, the judge had no other choice but to pass sentence. It is up 
to the crown to follow up on the other charges or to lay new charges 
on additional offenses to try to get additional sentences for the 
criminal. But fortunately enough, according to a tradition we have 
here, in our country, an individual cannot be convicted before he or 
she has been tried.
<P>
	If Ontario crown attorneys think it would be appropriate to 
prosecute an individual already convicted for first degree murder, it 
is up to them to decide what to do. The accounts we have heard are 
in fact very unsettling. That a person who has committed such 
crimes as those reported in the media-and I am thinking in 
particular of the Bernardo trial-can be released after serving only 
15 years in prison, pursuant to section 745 of the Criminal Code, is 
quite disgusting.
<P>
	The same thing goes for all the cases mentioned by the hon. 
member. It would be easy to jump to a general conclusion, but that 
is something we should not do before carrying out a more detailed 
study.
<P>
	This bill also raises the issue of the victim's rights. I must say 
that the hon. member did a better job of getting  my attention on 
that issue, because it is true that our system tends to forget about 
the victims. Their voice is not heard at sentencing hearings. When 
the parole board makes a decision, their statements are hardly, if at 
all, taken into consideration. These people are just left out of the 
process.
<P>
	Attorneys are generally overburdened, and when a Crown 
attorney is put in charge of a case, he must do his work as quickly 
as possible, and he does not get all the resources he needs. 
Obviously, it is important that justice be done, but not always 
expeditiously. These are two points I wanted to deal with, the rights 
of the victims, consecutive sentencing and the right of society to 
protect itself.
<P>
	Just because I do not approve of all the provisions in Bill C-274 
does not mean I do not recognize that the society has a right to 
protect itself. It is a fundamental right for Canadians to see people 
who pose a threat to society forced to reflect in isolation on what 
they did. If this is not enough, they will be given longer sentences 
and they will not be eligible for parole.
<P>
	When we heard from members of the Parole Board, I realized 
that there has been a very big improvement lately in the way the 
board deals with releases.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	There is still much to be done but progress was made. Obviously, 
we do not now have cases as worrisome as some we had a few years 
ago. The watchfulness of parliamentarians surely has something to 
do with it as it is our duty to point out, on occasion, flaws in the 
system.
<P>
	Bill C-274, which is before us today, warrants more reflection 
than a gut reaction. All the issues raised by the hon. member for 
Mississauga East are emotional, and give rise to such gut reactions. 
If we were to let our emotions colour our judgment, we would 
always pass stricter sentences and forget about the guidelines that 
insure a good administration of justice.
<P>
	Since this is not a votable bill, I do not have to indicate whether I 
will vote for or against it, but the issues raised by the hon. member 
certainly give us food for thought.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find 
the bill quite unique in that it is coming from the government side.
<P>
	I would like to review Bill C-274. The bill provides for the 
imposition of consecutive sentences on a person who commits 
sexual assault and another offence arising out of the same event or 
where a person already serving another sentence commits sexual 
assault.
<P>
	The bill also provides that a person sentenced to life 
imprisonment for first or second degree murder is not eligible for 
parole until that person has served, in addition to the portion of 
sentence the person must serve for murder, one third or a maximum 
of seven 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3454"> 3454 </A></B>
<P>
years of  any other sentence imposed in respect of an offence 
arising out of the same event or that the person is already serving.
<P>
	If I were to present a bill it would go a lot further than this bill 
does. However, this appears to be too much for the parliamentary 
secretary to the justice minister, who voted no to the motion put 
forward by the member who presented the bill.
<P>
	The government through cabinet and the parliamentary 
secretaries refuses to deal effectively with crime. The member, a 
backbencher, has experienced it firsthand with the introduction of 
this bill which went through committee to have it made votable. 
The member presenting the bill made comments to that effect.
<P>
	I will read some of the comments by the member for 
Mississauga East: ``We supposedly have open government, but we 
have secret committees. I guarantee that no member of that 
committee would oppose the bill openly. They were just 
encouraged in secret. I am not suggesting it is a kangaroo court. It 
is more like a cockroach court. You cannot see them at work, but 
they run''.
<P>
	The hon. member is also quoted in the <I>Hill Times</I>: ``If I had a bill 
on lawn care, I bet I would have success in getting it through the 
committee. If I had a bill that offered better treatment for criminals, 
it would race through the place in a week. But if I have a bill that 
wants to side with victims or correct an obscene injustice in our 
justice system, you can expect resistance and many years of effort 
and debate''. This member is experiencing firsthand what the 
cabinet, the justice minister, the solicitor general and the 
parliamentary secretaries across the way are doing in reference to 
criminal justice
<P>
	The member who introduced the bill wants to see consecutive 
sentences. I find that totally acceptable, as do most people in the 
country. They do not want to see criminals running around lose 
after serving a portion of their sentence, recommitting an offence 
and then serving another portion of the sentence. It goes on and on; 
it is a revolving door.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	I would respectfully submit that the member has made a very 
simple request to the House. Yet one member, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Justice, voted down her motion to 
make it a votable motion.
<P>
	Let us look at some facts. An offender in Canada who has served 
one-third or seven years, whichever is less, of his or her sentence of 
incarceration for a violent or serious offence becomes eligible for 
full parole. Inmates who have not been released on parole after 
serving two-thirds of their sentence are released by law to serve the 
final one-third of their sentence in the community. My suggestion 
is that if required they should be serving 90 per cent of their 
sentences, especially for violent and serious offenders.
<P>
	The National Parole Board confirmed that even the most violent 
and serious offenders serve on average only one-half of their prison 
sentence. Attempted murderers, for example, serve an average of 
48 months where the court has ordered the sentence to be 94 
months. They have served only one-half of their sentence, even for 
attempted murderer. In the case of manslaughter the actual time 
served by an offender averaged 44 months when the original 
sentence was 84 months.
<P>
	The member across the way clearly understands the problem of 
violent crime. The justice minister, the solicitor general and the 
parliamentary secretary who voted against her motion do not. They 
are not concerned about violent criminals repeating their offences.
<P>
	What exactly is the economic impact of crime on our society? A 
recent study by the Fraser Institute identifies some of the economic 
factors of crime. It mentions victimization, policing, private 
security, court and legal proceedings, corrections and shattered 
lives. The price tag placed on this type of criminal activity is $37 
billion and much of that cost is for repeat offenders.
<P>
	I realize that the member across the way has only targeted two 
particular crimes: rape or sexual assault and first and second degree 
murder. The cost of shattered lives because of murder and repeat 
offenders in those two violent areas is very significant and would 
certainly make up a portion of this $37 billion annually.
<P>
	Reform's position in its operation crime strike discussion paper 
is that it would like to see truth in sentencing. That is what the 
member is talking about. She wants to move toward truth in 
sentencing. Truth in sentencing is clear and simple. If a rapist is 
handed a sentence of 12 years then the rapist must serve 12 years. If 
a murderer or attempted murderer is handed a sentence of 25 years 
then he or she serves 25 years. It is a very simple concept.
<P>
	The member across the way, even though she is in agreement 
with parole, states that if a second violent offence is committed 
then that sentence should be served consecutive to the sentence that 
has already been served.
<P>
	Reform would carry that one step further. Reform would say that 
once persons have committed a second violent strike they are out of 
the picture completely. They had their chance after the first time. 
After the second time they would do life, and life would mean life.
<P>
	In support of the member across the way who introduced this 
private member's bill, I too submit a motion asking for unanimous 
consent to make this a votable motion.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the motion of the hon. member for Calgary Northeast. Is 
there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3455"> 3455 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
the hon. member for Mississauga East had the intestinal fortitude 
and courage to listen to her constituents, her heart and her mind on 
a matter of fundamental importance which I believe is at the base 
of what we should be doing in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Previous speakers have alluded to the fact that the process by 
which we determine whether an item is votable is fair. The place 
where we ought to make that decision is in the House of Commons. 
We should do it in an open fashion as transparency is extremely 
important.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am perfectly comfortable with the presentation made by the 
hon. member who moved the motion and by the hon. member who 
seconded it, and who is the other member for Mississauga.<B></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is unfortunate the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Justice would not provide concurrence to make this a votable item. 
That being the case, it is important for us to understand what the 
bill is about. If the bill is not allowed to proceed today, I can assure 
the House that the bill and bills like it will come again before the 
House of Commons and we will have a day where openness will 
once again prevail.
<P>
	A person who commits a crime must serve the full time. Too 
much evidence in the past has supported the excuse that serial 
rapists or serial murderers should only serve one sentence for all 
their crimes. Justice does not fit the crime. For that reason it is 
extremely imperative that we try, at the very least as an open 
Parliament, to provide justice not for those who have been accused 
and tried before a fair court of law but for those who are the 
victims. We owe it to them. We owe it to their families. We owe it 
to safe streets and safe communities, a commitment in our red book 
of 1993.
<P>
	That is why as a Liberal I am proud to say that the bill speaks to 
the heart of the Liberal Party as I understand it and as many 
Canadians understood it when they voted Liberal in the last 
election.
<P>
	Canada's criminal justice system has to be transformed. 
Convicted multiple murderers and serial rapists must know they 
will not get away from serving the full time for all their actions and 
will not have their sentencing behind bars reduced by concurrent 
sentencing. Concurrent sentencing for murder and sexual assault 
serves no purpose but to let convicted individuals escape the full 
weight of society's repulsion for their acts.
<P>
	Our government is committed to safe homes and safe streets. It 
is my belief and the belief of most ordinary Canadians that 
consecutive sentencing falls within the commitment stated in our 
red book in terms of the safety and security of all Canadians.
<P>
	The hon. member alluded to the fact that the bill acknowledges 
what is a debate and what is currently acceptable discourse in the 
homes and among many people in the learned societies of the 
country. Far from being stifled it is my view that the bill should be 
allowed to see the open and fresh air of debate.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the legislation only reached second reading. 
I can assure the member who had the courage of her convictions to 
bring forward Bill C-274 that her words today will not be forgotten 
in her constituency or in mine. As a member representing one of 
the larger ridings not just in metro Toronto but in all of Canada, I 
know the member has the support of thousands of Canadians for 
her courage to do this in the face of adversity.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is easy for me to explain the different ideologies of the 
criminal justice system, but one must understand that, in the end, 
the victims must benefit from a good justice system. The forms of 
justice we have today do not work. The bill is legitimized by what 
people said and also by the emotions created by people like 
Clifford Olson and Bernardo.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The bill is important in and of itself. It is important for the 
Parliament of Canada to be able to debate a matter of substantial 
importance to all Canadians. We cannot wait until another election 
to hem and haw about what we will do.
<P>
	While it is important to bring in all sorts of theories and 
ideologies on how to get to the question of the root causes of severe 
criminal behaviour, we owe an obligation to Canadians to mete out 
important, significant and fundamental justice to those who 
commit serious crimes against ordinary honest victims who happen 
to be our constituents.
<P>
	I do not believe I should shirk or cower from the notion that the 
House must consider the bill in a much more serious manner. There 
was an overwhelming desire to ram through Bill C-33 in record 
time. It took nine days. It took us longer to join the second world 
war in the fight against the Nazis than it did to get that bill through 
the House of Commons. Perhaps a bit of levity today might allow 
us to reconfirm the importance of the bill.
<P>
	I seek unanimous consent of the House, notwithstanding the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice, to have it made 
a votable item.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous consent 
to make this item votable?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I add my comments to those of the hon. 
member for Mississauga East who introduced this private 
member's bill dealing with consecutive sentences.
<P>
	For some time now Canadians have been very concerned about 
what they see as a lack of justice in Canada. They are concerned 
that individuals who commit one, two or three crimes end up 
getting a sentence that is compacted in a concurrent sentence rather 
than getting three different sentences.
<P>
	I am not saying everything is perfect south of the border but we 
see sentences that are consecutive. Individuals get sentences added 
to the first sentence. In Canada we see sentences packed into one 
sentence so that individuals who may have committed three or four 
serious sexual assaults end up getting a three or six year sentence as 
opposed to a three or six year sentence for each and every victim.
<P>
	Basically that says to Canadians that only the first victim has any 
worth or value, that each consecutive victim has no value or worth, 
and that there is not a price to pay for having been a victim. I think 
Canadians have difficulty with that.
<P>
	The attempt of the hon. member for Mississauga East to bring in 
consecutive sentences recognizes that Canadians want to see from 
their justice system that an individual who has committed a series 
of crimes is penalized for committing a series of crimes and not 
just for one crime.
<P>
	The hon. member has good intentions. Her amendments add 
sections 2.1 and 2.2 to first and second degree murder. Canadians 
are concerned when they see people who have been given life 
sentences for committing either first or second degree murder 
ending up on parole. In some cases it is relatively early in their 
sentences, be it seven years or ten years.
<P>
	When an individual in the circumstance commits a crime, 
whether aggravated assault or in very serious cases a second 
murder, they fail to understand the way the courts calculate the 
time spent before eligibility for parole. It does not seem to 
recognize the seriousness of the crimes committed.
<P>
<B>(1845 )</B>
<P>
	Canadians are asking themselves how somebody can go out and 
murder an individual, get a life sentence without eligibility for 
parole after 10 years or 25 years, get out on parole, go out and 
murder again and not be given a life sentence that means life 
without parole.
<P>
	I agree with my hon. colleague from Calgary Northeast that 
Canadians want certainty of sentence. They want to know 
specifically what the judge is talking about. They  want to know 
that when somebody is given a sentence of five years they will 
spend five years of incarceration.
<P>
	If judges were to say to Canadians that in certainty of sentencing 
they will incarcerate an individual for five years for having 
committed this crime, then they will give them two or three years 
of parole, and if need be in some situations they might even tack on 
a period of community supervision outside of parole, people would 
understand clearly what the penalty is of the crime.
<P>
	However, when a judge gives a five year sentence and Canadians 
see this individual wandering the streets in two years or in eighteen 
months, they fail to see where justice is being served. If we are to 
have confidence in, faith in and support for our justice system, 
justice must be seen to be served. We do not have that today.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mississauga East is trying to make some 
amendments to the conditional release act that show a certainty in 
sentencing, that do not leave it to some obscure calculation to 
determine when a person will be eligible for parole, that when a 
person is given a sentence for more than one conviction there is 
more than one sentence, that sentences are consecutive, that they 
are added on. The member for Mississauga East has attempted a 
very honourable thing. I commend her for her attempts to amend 
the conditional release act.
<P>
	I ask that this private member's bill be given unanimous consent 
to become a votable bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
request from the hon. member for Surrey-White Rock-South 
Langley with regard to making this motion a votable item. Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There is no unanimous 
consent. Resuming debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to 
commend the hon. member for Mississauga East for her efforts in 
tackling these criminal justice issues that are of concern to us and 
indeed to all Canadians. My comments will be directed to those 
provisions in this bill aimed at changing the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act.
<P>
	The proposals would alter section 120 of that act, which in large 
part sets out the current sentence calculation scheme. Specifically, 
the proposed amendments relating to section 120 would provide 
two things. First, that offenders sentenced for first or second degree 
murder would serve the full parole ineligibility period on that 
sentence, which is a maximum of 25 years, plus one-third or a 
maximum of seven years of a sentence, whichever is less, for an 
offence arising out of the same event or series of events.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3457"> 3457 </A></B>
<P>
	For an offender already serving a sentence when the sentence 
for murder is imposed, he or she would serve one-third or seven 
years of that sentence, again whichever is less.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The second point is that offenders would serve consecutively all 
the full parole ineligibility periods for sentences for multiple first 
or second degree murder convictions not arising of the same event 
or series of events.
<P>
	The thrust of the hon. member's proposals is to deal more 
stringently with repeat offenders, especially those convicted of first 
or second degree murder.
<P>
<B>(1850 )</B>
<P>
	Who could not agree with the notion that a new sentence for first 
or second degree murder and for offences arising out of the same 
event or series of events committed by an offender, including an 
offender who is already under sentence, should result in a clear, 
meaningful consequence? The government agrees with the intent 
of these proposals. That is why we have already moved to provide 
an effective and balanced remedy to this problem.
<P>
	Last January Bill C-45, an act to amend the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act and related statutes, came into force. The 
sentence calculation reforms brought about by Bill C-45 were 
devout with the intent of ensuring that offenders who get new 
sentences feel the effect of those sentences.
<P>
	It is important at this point to outline the main elements of the 
reforms which will help restore confidence in the sentence 
calculation process.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the case of a consecutive sentence, the offender will have to 
serve the parole ineligibility portion of the new sentence before 
becoming eligible again for parole. This means a third of the new 
sentence, or one-half of the sentence in cases where the court has 
made an order that this would have to be served. However, except 
in cases of murder, an offender's parole eligibility date cannot be 
later than 15 years from the date the last sentence was imposed.
<P>
	In addition, the sentence calculation reforms brought about by 
Bill C-45 include the principle of adding parole ineligibility 
periods, where a lifer receives an additional definite sentence.
<P>
	For example, a lifer with 10 years of parole ineligibility who 
receives an additional 15 year sentence will have five years of 
ineligibility added on, for a total of 15 years.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the exception to this 15 year rule are sentences 
imposed as a result of a first or second degree murder conviction. 
In such cases, the maximum parole ineligibility period is 25 years.
<P>
	The sentence calculation reforms brought about by Bill C-45 
were developed on the basis of extensive consultations with a broad 
range of groups and individuals. The reforms in Bill C-45 were 
developed after a long process of consultation and scrutiny by the 
standing committee during both the last and the current 
Parliaments. The standing committee heard from over 60 witnesses 
representing 32 different organizations. During its clause-by-clause 
review, the committee debated the sentence calculation reforms set 
out in Bill C-45, and endorsed them in their entirety.
<P>
	The amendments in Bill C-45 strike a fair and reasonable 
balance between punishment, respect for the court-imposed 
sentence, and effective rehabilitation and reintegration of 
offenders.
<P>
	Striking such a crucial balance is achieved through a 
combination of basic automatic features, such as the automatic 
return to custody of a parolee who receives a new sentence, and 
discretionary measures that allow individual circumstances to be 
taken into consideration so that once the punitive portion of the 
sentence has been served, the offender is not kept in custody 
beyond the point when he or she can be safely released under 
community supervision. This is what the current sentence 
calculation scheme is designed to do.
<P>
	While I believe that the hon. member's proposals are 
well-intentioned, I am also concerned that they fall short of the 
impact intended by Bill C-45. The amendments proposed by the 
hon. member would maximize punishment, and no one disagrees 
with this objective. But they would also reduce the discretion of the 
courts and the Parole Board and make the system more arbitrary 
and no more effective in terms of public safety.
<P>
	The proposals could introduce new anomalous situations that 
could lead to serious Charter challenges. For example, the 
proposals would have a retroactive effect on concurrent sentences 
an offender is serving when convicted of murder. For all intents and 
purposes, sentences that were initially concurrent would become 
consecutive because the ineligibility period on each and every 
sentence would be added.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	Not only would this rule undermine the role of the sentencing 
court and render sentence calculation uncertain and difficult to 
administer, but its impact on the amount of time to be served, and 
particularly its retroactive application, would certainly give rise to 
serious charter challenges.
<P>
	Another difficulty posed by this bill is the rule regarding the 
addition of all of the full parole ineligibility periods sentences for 
additional first or second degree murder convictions not arising out 
of the same event or series of events.
<P>
	Not only would this further reduce the scope of the National 
Parole Board's discretion, but it would also  mean that offenders 
who could safely be released would remain in costly custody well 
beyond the point that is necessary or in society's interest, and this 
at great public expense.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3458"> 3458 </A></B>
<P>
	Lengthy incarceration beyond the point that is necessary for 
public safety is not the answer. We cannot afford to lose sight of the 
other important objectives of the C-45 reforms, particularly with 
respect to the courts' and the National Parole Board's discretion 
and the offender's rehabilitation and safe reintegration into society.
<P>
	This governement supports the principle that repeat criminal 
behavior should be dealt with more stringently, and that is precisely 
why the mandatory 25 year parole ineligibility period for 
additional murder conviction is provided for in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I would also point out to the members of this House that being 
eligible for parole does not mean that a lifer will automatically be 
released. It is up to the National Parole Board to grant parole only 
after careful consideration of all relevant information, including 
the level of risk to the community.
<P>
	The reforms brought about by Bill C-45, which was passed in 
January of this year, provide a comprehensive response that is 
proportionate to the sentence handed down by the court in any 
individual case.
<P>
	The government has brought in a tough, fair, and balanced 
sentence calculation scheme that makes sure offenders feel the 
effect of their repeat offences, respects the sentences imposed by 
the courts and limits but still allows for discretionary conditional 
release when safe to do so in the judgement of the National Parole 
Board.
<P>
	I submit that the issue raised by the hon. member is a worthy 
one. The sentence calculation reforms recently introduced by the 
government address this and other concerns of Canadians in the 
most effective and efficient manner, particularly with respect to 
public safety.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Having been

<P>
	I ask the parliamentary secretaries to the attorney general and the 
justice minister to confer with each other prior to making their 
vote.
<P>
	We have heard many motions to have this deemed votable. We 
also know there is another option to keep the subject matter of Bill 
C-274 alive, referring it to the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal Affairs.
<P>
	I ask for unanimous consent to refer the subject matter of Bill 
C-274 to the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs on

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-32, 
an act to amend the Copyright Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in a rare exception for me in this House, I am particularly 
pleased to speak to the second reading of Bill C-32, an act to amend 
the Copyright Act.
<P>
	I will begin with just a little comment on the cover page. This 
bill was introduced by ``la ministre du Patrimoine'' and not ``le 
ministre''. It was the Deputy Prime Minister who was Minister of 
Heritage at that time. What is more, it was introduced here in the 
House this afternoon by another woman, ``la ministre par intérim 
du Patrimoine'', the acting heritage minister. Dare I hope that the 
House will take note of the difference, for in French there is a 
grammatical distinction made between male and female ministers.
<P>
	Having said this, we and all of the artistic community have been 
hopefully waiting a long time for this bill, since it was promised a 
very long time ago. Since the start of this 35th Parliament, eight 
questions by six different Bloc Quebecois members have been 
asked between April 29, 1994 and March 28, 1996. Those eight 
questions have been asked, one after the other, of the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, each time in order to attempt to discover 
whether there was any chance that this bill would be introduced 
soon, since it had been promised to us session after session. We had 
also raised a ninth question on distribution rights.
<P>
	On examining the bill as a whole, there are a number of reasons 
to be pleased. Neighbouring rights have finally been recognized; 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3459"> 3459 </A></B>
<P>
there are the beginnings of a system to protect private copies and to 
monitor them to some extent and to further protect our artists' 
rights and, finally, distribution rights. One note of discord, 
however: a highly disagreeable aspect of the bill-and I will come  
back to this if I have time a little later-involving the increase in 
the number of exceptions.
<P>
	For the benefit of those watching, if anybody still is at this hour, 
I would first like to clarify the meaning of copyright. It is a legal 
framework in which the creators of literary, artistic or other works 
such as films, books, sound recordings, information products or 
computer programs to request compensation when use is made of 
their work.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	Copyright therefore establishes the economic and moral right of 
the author to control the publication of his work, to be compensated 
and to protect the integrity of his artistic achievements.
<P>
	Copyright is vital to creators. In 1994, $44 million was collected 
in royalties by author-composers for the public performance of 
their musical works. In all, the cultural world represents a $16 
billion industry employing over 600,000 people. So, as we have 
said for a very long time, it is no small job sector in our country.
<P>
	What about neighbouring rights, what do they add? 
Neighbouring rights add recognition of the work now done by 
performers and producers. For example, when a song was played 
on the radio, only the author and the composer were entitled to 
royalties. Now, the performer and the producer will be also, thanks 
to the neighbouring rights, be entitled to royalties, will be able to 
be paid for their work in a way.
<P>
	When all this process is over, we will be able to join the 50 
countries, which are parties to the Rome Convention, 50 countries 
excluding the United States. Earlier this afternoon, our colleague 
for Medicine Hat, speaking for the Reform Party, seemed to me not 
to really understand the advantage of the neighbouring rights for 
our artists. Culture is what defines a country, what characterizes it. 
It is what characterizes a people. It is what differentiates it from its 
neighbour. That is one definition of culture. Maybe those are not 
the exact terms, but it is the message given early this afternoon by 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage in her speech. When she gave 
her definition of culture, she made it clear that it was something 
which identified us as Canadians.
<P>
	This is why we are somewhat inclined, unfortunately, we, 
sovereignists, Quebec separatists, to think that we recognize 
ourselves and define ourselves better in the Quebec culture than in 
the Canadian culture, because many things differentiate us from 
each other. However, since the whole of Canada does not seem to 
recognize this fundamental fact, we will skip that issue tonight 
because it is not the object of my speech.
<P>
	Nevertheless, it is not because we have now introduced 
neighbouring rights that we are going to send more money to the 
Americans. Not at all. If Americans are now collecting a lot of 
money, if we are sending them money, we will no longer do so 
under neighbouring  rights, since the U.U. did not sign the Rome 
Convention. Neighbouring rights cannot be exchanged between 
countries which are not signatory states. Accordingly, 
neighbouring rights are paid only to member countries, so this will 
not add to the wealth of Americans.
<P>
	However, one thing could be very important to Canadians. Up to 
now, except for certain performers like Céline Dion, René Simard, 
Roch Voisine and a few young ones who have succeeded in making 
a career in the States, most Quebec artists worked mostly in 
Quebec. A few made a name for themselves in France, Belgium 
and the Francophonie, but it is very seldom that Quebec performers 
achieve an international career, especially singers. In the field of 
jazz or instrumental music, it is something else altogether. But 
when French culture is opposed to the English one, it is harder to 
reach fame.
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	As for English Canada, it is an excellent opportunity and a great 
challenge for our anglophone performers and artists to settle an 
agreement with the Rome Convention countries. They will be faced 
with an extraordinary challenge because they will have 50 
countries in which to take their chance. For instance, instead of 
singing in the United States where there will be no exchange of 
neighbouring rights, they could go to England or other signatory 
states to try to launch a career. This could be a great opportunity for 
our performers to make themselves known. Introduction of 
neighbouring rights in this bill must be seen as a great step forward, 
a great success for the Canadian artistic community, something that 
will really change their working conditions. Undoubtedly, it will 
lead to a considerable increase in incomes. Studies show this is a 
step forward.
<P>
	It is obvious that our colleague from Medecine Hat, with whom I 
have already sat on the heritage committee, does not agree, and I 
have the feeling that the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois do 
not see eye to eye when it comes to culture; we believe in a kind of 
protectionism in favour of Canadian and Quebec culture in order to 
prevent the American bulldozer from invading Canada and further 
ploughing under our culture.
<P>
	Americans do not share our conception of copyright. They 
support copyright per se and we are in favour of neighbouring 
rights. Our approach is much more European, more modern. 
Americans want to use their money to buy rights and make more 
money by treating culture the same way they do shoes. They see 
culture as entertainment, not as something which defines and 
characterizes us.
<P>
	Obviously, if one sees culture as they do, one will think that the 
government is making a mistake by recognizing neighbouring 
rights. But if one finds self-respect and self-definition in culture, 
then it is obvious that neighbouring rights were the way to go.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3460"> 3460 </A></B>
<P>
	In this area, there is just one small hesitation on the Bloc side; 
we think the broadcasting lobby was too efficient with the industry 
minister and that Heritage did not put up sufficient resistance 
when they discussed the royalties that radio stations would have 
to pay. They set the limit for annual advertising revenues at 
$1,250,000. They said nothing about total annual revenues, but 
considered only the advertising revenues. So they decided to set 
the limit high enough, at $1,200,000. All those making less will 
only pay $100 a year in royalties. It is clear we find that amount 
too high and we would want it reduced considerably; we would 
prefer a figure in the area of one million dollars instead of 
$1,250,000.
<P>
	Therefore, except for that reservation, the Bloc Quebecois agrees 
with the neighbouring right. Now, in the area of private copies, it 
was high time something was done. I am sure there is not one 
Canadian or one Quebecer who has never used a blank tape to 
record something. We listen to programs like La petite vie, which I 
find very interesting, or to the debates of the House, and we make 
private copies. Sometimes we hear something interesting on the 
radio and we quickly press a button to record the wonderful music 
that is playing. Meanwhile, we are not buying the original works of 
our artists.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	So, it was high time that the government got involved in this area 
and decided to give a royalty for private copying. We wished it had 
done so also for video tapes. We know change is very difficult. 
There is much resistance to change, so we hope the government 
will be able in the near future to add a small amendment to this bill. 
This would not cost the government much, but it would allow our 
artists to make up for all the losses they may incur because of the 
bad habits we have acquired.
<P>
	We will work very hard in the heritage committee and within the 
confines of parliamentary procedure to ensure that the government 
will consider introducing now a small royalty, even though it could 
take a number of years for us to get used to that kind of thing. We 
should come back to these royalties on video tapes and not abandon 
this sector.
<P>
	As for the distribution right, we are particularly pleased in the 
Bloc Quebecois that the government did not overlook it. I 
remember in committee that David Peterson came to make us 
aware of the urgency of this problem, which is much more acute in 
English Canada than in Quebec. Once again, because of the 
language barrier and the different ways in which publishing houses 
operate, Quebec was much less vulnerable than English Canada to 
the invasion of the mega book publishers, which, if this distribution 
right had not been introduced, could easily have seriously 
jeopardized English Canada's publishing sector.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is therefore very pleased with this measure, 
which will make it possible to strengthen the Canadian book 
industry, and will have an extremely interesting impact on 
publishing.
<P>
	This brings me to what is disastrous about the bill. We would 
really have liked to see the government for once take a strongly 
positive position right across the board, we would have liked to see 
that, but the government would have had to refrain from adding to 
the list of exceptions. There were even, in certain cases, 
agreements with organizations in the university sector, for 
example, that were already doing a very good job of managing the 
full range of use of audiovisual documents or newspaper articles, 
articles from scientific reviews or chapters of books. In any event, 
agreements had been reached. Once again, I think the government 
unfortunately gave in a bit too much to pressure from lobbies.
<P>
	There is one curious thing, as well, and that is the liberty the 
government is taking in almost all areas in exempting itself from 
charges. We saw it this morning, in another bill, where the 
government is allowing the Department of National Defence not to 
pay user charges to the new corporation being created to manage 
air navigation services, and, here again, we see an exhaustive list 
taking up several pages in the bill-I believe it is 12 pages in the 
bill-that is concerned strictly with exceptions to this bill.
<P>
	I think that this was really going too far. It is as though everyone 
wanted to see his contribution included. It is far too extensive. It is 
as though the government was deciding to no longer pay the 
electricity or telephone bills, as though it was exempting itself in 
all categories.
<P>
	Maybe it is necessary in order to reduce the size of the budget 
and the deficit significantly. But they are doing it at the expense of 
others, at the expense of authors, composers and artists. 
Unfortunately, as we know, these people's average income is well 
below the poverty level.
<P>
	The committee will work very hard, first of all to get an 
explanation from the government as to how all of this can be 
justified, and secondly to see what could be eliminated so as to 
reduce the exemptions to a minimum.
<P>
<B>(1920)</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, this Bill takes us a few steps forward, a couple of 
baby steps sideways, and then a giant step backward with all the 
exceptions there are in it. We are rather uncomfortable with all this, 
and it leaves a bit of a bad taste in our mouths. Personally, and this 
is a great rarity for me, I would have liked to have been totally 
happy with this, but I am a bit confused, torn between happiness 
and sadness.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will be working very hard, in the House, on 
the Heritage Committee, and elsewhere. We will call witnesses, we 
will take as much time as required to improve this bill. We hope 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3461"> 3461 </A></B>
<P>
that a government which has worked so well to date will continue 
to have an  attentive ear for the minimal changes that will have to 
be made if the bill is to end up being more of a forward step than it 
is at present. It is perfectible, and I hope that the government will 
be open to improvements.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured today to talk specifically to this bill.
<P>
	I was on the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage for a 
time and, a few years ago, I was involved in artistic creation in 
Quebec as the director of a body promoting Quebec films. I thus 
was made aware of the importance of the cultural industry for 
society as a whole, and for Quebec society in particular. It is 
therefore with great pleasure that I rise today in this debate on Bill 
C-32 on copyright.
<P>
	Copyright is the bread and butter, as we say, of our artists. The 
diet has remained unchanged since 1924, and it is high time it was 
revitalized, which is what the government is attempting to do after 
long years of pussyfooting around.
<P>
	I hope you will allow me to stress the importance of copyright 
for artists. As we know, the artistic community does not work from 
nine to five with iron clad working conditions and a pension plan to 
boot. Quite the opposite is true. Artists have no job security. They 
depend solely on their talent and on the prevailing economic 
situation. We can easily assume that most of them often have lean 
years. It is unfortunate to have to describe our artists' financial 
situation in such terms.
<P>
	Statistics confirm our impressions, however. According to data 
from the Canadian Conference on the Arts, average incomes for 
1991 were as follows: fine arts painters, $15,650; craftspeople, 
$13,156; dancers, $13,757; actors, $21,800; musicians and singers, 
$13,799.
<P>
	No life of Riley here. It is easy to see these incomes do not 
provide enough for a family to live on. We are certainly getting 
close to the poverty line. In fact, artists are now the least paid 
workers in Canada.
<P>
	I think it is important to put these elements in context and, before 
debating copyright, to reflect upon the financial situation of these 
people and the importance their work has for society's 
development.
<P>
	Having established that artists are not in a privileged financial 
situation, far from it, I would now like to turn to Bill C-32. This bill 
makes major changes to the present law.
<P>
	It establishes neighbouring rights for performers and producers 
of records. I know that the Bloc québécois has spoken in favour of 
neighbouring rights and has the firm intention of supporting them. 
It establishes a remuneration regime allowing fir the copying, for 
private use, of sound recordings; it establishes a protection of 
exclusive markets for book distributors in Canada; it  changes the 
copyright and, finally, it changes the law to improve the collective 
administration and civil remedies.
<P>
	Much has been written about this bill, which has given rise to a 
heated debate.
<P>
<B>(1925 )</B>
<P>
	Before going into details, I would like to ask members to 
remember the very concrete importance of copyright in the life of 
every artist. This leads me to the loud protests of broadcasters with 
respect to the new neighbouring rights.
<P>
	Arguing that they help artists and producers by playing their 
records on the air, broadcasters have demanded to be exempted 
from paying compensation to performers and producers. Their 
logic is strange. One could take it to the ridiculous extreme and say 
that an artist who performs in public should not be paid since it 
gives him or her the opportunity of making himself or herself 
known and then of selling more records.
<P>
	Broadcasters' concerns deserve to be examined, as those of any 
other interested party. However, we must not forget that the first 
purpose of this legislative reform is to allow artists to participate in 
the economic success of their works. Moreover, future 
beneficiaries of neighbouring rights, that is performers and record 
producers, publicly indicated they understood the concerns of 
broadcasters and were ready to show some flexibility in the 
implementation of the new system. In such conditions, the goal of 
the legislation can be reached quite harmoniously while our artists 
will be protected.
<P>
	I now wish to address another important aspect of the bill, that is 
exceptions to copyrights. That is where the shoe pinches, as we say. 
This aspect is generating a lot of questions and fears. Why? 
Because the present Copyright Act already contains exceptions to 
adapt to the needs of users. The general idea behind these 
exceptions is to achieve a reasonable balance between the rights of 
creators and the needs of users through exceptions made in the 
public interest.
<P>
	For starters, it should be pointed at that existing exceptions are 
not unanimously accepted. In fact copyright comprises two kinds 
of complementary rights. The first kind, namely moral rights, 
recognizes that the author is the owner of the work and 
consequently of the right to authorize its use under conditions set 
by the author.
<P>
	The second kind, economic rights, deals with the right to 
monitor the economic life of a given work. An exception to 
copyright is therefore tantamount to expropriation. For the good of 
the community, the government may decide that, under certain 
circumstances, an author will not benefit from his work.
<P>
	Such expropriation is the reason why the SOCAN, the UNEQ, 
the Union des écrivaines et écrivains québécois, the Canadian 
Conference of the Arts, and the Coalition des créateurs et des 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3462"> 3462 </A></B>
<P>
titulaires de droits d'auteur, a Quebec group, have been asking for 
the abolition of these exceptions for a long time.
<P>
	Their reasoning is quite simple. I will quote UNEQ which said: 
``It is always the same thing. Why should creators be the only ones 
to give up their revenues?'' You must remember the numbers I gave 
you a moment ago, they are not astronomical. When you live 
around the poverty line, you have every right to worry about your 
future.
<P>
	And why should they give up their revenues on behalf of 
schools, libraries, archives, without even being entitled to a 
charitable donation receipt? Why not require Xerox to supply 
copiers to schools free of charge and ask Petro Canada to supply 
them with free heating oil? Why would creators not be entitled to 
earn a living? Why? The question is very relevant, particularly if 
you think about the actual income of artists.
<P>
	Instead of abolishing the exceptions as requested, the 
government intends to multiply them, almost ad infinitum. There 
will be 15 pages of exceptions, at the expense of artists. For whose 
benefit? We ask ourselves what pressures made the government 
yield, what lobby intervened, because the government is now ready 
to penalize the artists it claims it wants to protect.
<P>
<B>(1930)</B>
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage said today that she wanted to 
protect the livelihood of artists and to make sure they get some 
compensation for their work. I do not think the new bill is in line 
with that statement. There is reason to question that. The reaction 
to Bill C-32 in this regard was quite strong, and appropriately so. 
My colleagues and I will come back to the details of these 
exceptions during subsequent debates.
<P>
	For now, however, I am asking the government: What is the 
reason for all those exceptions? Why is the government introducing 
a bill with 15 pages of exemptions in it if, like the Canadian 
Conference of the Arts has said, respect for the principle of free 
negotiation inherent to copyright involves the elimination of all 
exemptions in the protection of works?
<P>
	I urge the government to bear in mind the arguments of the 
artists, who are the main stakeholders. This bill must meet their 
needs, both financial and moral. If artists do not survive, our 
cultural industry will not either.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House of the position of UNEQ, a 
member of the Coalition of Creators and Copyright Owners. It said 
it will not introduce more exemptions. This organization is asking 
the government to eliminate all exemptions. It believes that having 
more exemptions for educational institutions in this bill is a direct 
threat to the group licenses already agreed upon by UNEQ.
<P>
	I would like to give a few examples of what I have just said. 
Talking about licenses, I know UNEQ has had negotiations about
<P>
photocopies made by the government. My colleague was telling us 
a moment ago that it may be a way for the government to avoid 
paying certain royalties to creators. The licence negotiated by the 
federal government for its newspaper clipping service and copies 
represents a total of $80,750 in royalties that are distributed to 
journalists. The proposed bill would take away these royalties from 
artists and creators. The government would no longer pay these 
royalties. And that is just one example. I know several other 
licences were issued and will adversely affect authors and creators.
<P>
	Therefore, I ask the government to be receptive to the unanimous 
point of view expressed by the Union des écrivains et des 
écrivaines, UQAM, SOCAM and all the stakeholders from the 
artistic community, regarding these exceptions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, about a 
year ago, when the House had to vote on the bill to implement the 
WTO agreements, we had to look, among other things, at the 
federal Copyright Act. At the time, we were stunned to see how 
obsolete and outdated the legislation was.
<P>
	If I am not mistaken, it had been almost 50 years since the act 
had been last reviewed. It is a good thing the government, through 
its heritage minister, proposes to update this legislation, to provide 
better protection to authors and performers, so that the artists who 
make culture a central element in our country, particularly in 
Quebec, can finally get a return on their work.
<P>
<B>(1935)</B>
<P>
	We must not think that Canada is an innovator, since at least fifty 
countries have already granted their creators the recognition of 
these neighbouring rights. Of course-and I will have something to 
say about exceptions-every time a government introduces a piece 
of legislation granting rights or recognizing new rights for a class 
of workers, it has to be understood that there are reactions from 
people from which some privileges are removed.
<P>
	I totally agree with my colleague from Québec that there should 
be no exception to this rule. I think that artists, through the sacrifice 
they made of the rights they should have recovered over the last 
years, have already done more than their fair share for economic 
development.
<P>
	My colleague from Québec mentioned broadcasters, 
universities, colleges, schools, municipalities, people writing to 
complain that now they will have to pay. Of course they will have 
to pay; they did not pay for 50 years, so it is only normal that they 
pay now.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member the following question: Why 
should the government not apply in this case the sacrosanct 
principle this government has been  advocating for a number of 
years, the user pay principle? All of a sudden, we find that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3463"> 3463 </A></B>
<P>
government, which pays lip service to this fine principle, is 
introducing all kinds of exceptions. Earlier today, we passed Bill 
C-20 on the privatization of air navigation control services. We saw 
the government go against its own user pay principle when it said 
that National Defence should not pay for using these services. Now 
it is coming up with a series of exceptions.
<P>
	As soon as we open up exceptions, we can add indefinitely to the 
list. That is why I ask: Why does the government not apply the user 
pay principle in this case?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Québec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
his question. In fact, I also wonder why the government does not 
follow suit and set an example. If we know the living conditions of 
our artists, if we wish to recognize their efforts and their work, as 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage stated so well today, why does 
the government not set an example and exclude itself from these 
exemptions? Considering that the federal government uses $80,000 
worth of press clippings, artists and authors will thus be deprived 
of the royalties which they are owed. I totally agree with my 
colleague.
<P>
	Women will also pay for the federal deficit, as we have learned 
in the UI bill, and artists could have to pay too.
<P>
	So, if the government is sincere with its bill, before passing it, it 
will listent to the various stakeholders. It may listen to a special 
interest group, but it could lend an ear to the main stakeholders, 
such as the artists, and for once be attentive to their demands.
<P>
	Given that an artist earns from $13,000 to $20,000 at most, it 
cannot be said that he makes a decent living out of his work. Our 
artists reflect all our society. They talk about our culture, celebrate 
our culture, and give plays about our culture, so we could perhaps 
encourage them by passing a good bill and prevent such expensive 
exemptions. Given these 15 pages of exemptions, the bill is full of 
loopholes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, to the 
astonishment of the whip of the Liberal Party, the Bloc members 
still have some things to say about this bill, because it deals with 
culture.
<P>
<B>(1940)</B>
<P>
	As sovereignist Quebecers, we believe that culture plays an 
important role in the development of Quebec society. Even if the 
bill before us was introduced by the federal government, we still 
find it relevant. As the hon. member for Louis-Hébert reminded us, 
the time had come to follow up on the demands of the authors, 
creators, performers, all those who work on the cultural scene, the 
theatre people, the musicians, the writers.
<P>
	It is extremely important for us, Quebecers, to have a legislation 
better suited to today's situation. This is also very important to us 
because our market is quite small.  Quebec's territory may be large, 
but it is not always densely populated. That is why performers who 
become professional have the right, I think, to get the most from 
their high quality work, which is why, as a member of the Bloc 
Quebecois, I insisted on taking part in this debate.
<P>
	I also noticed the interest shown by the hon. member for 
Louis-Hébert and, before him, by the hon. member for Quebec. 
They all come from the Quebec capital region, which is recognized 
and renowned for its cultural talents but which often loses its artists 
to other regions because of a poor standard of living or meagre 
retribution. We are all proud of Céline Dion, but not all artists are 
lucky enough to make a break on such a big market.
<P>
	Therefore, this legislation is welcome. However, it has flaws that 
were mentioned by those who spoke before me. It must be said, 
however, that Bill C-32 is the second step of a review of the 
Copyright Act, which is almost 50 years old and which was 
amended in 1988. It had its shortcomings then and it still does.
<P>
	We must remember that this bill provides a way to protect 
performers' and producers' neighbouring rights. A remuneration 
regime is also established in relation to the private copying of 
sound recordings and charges are imposed to manufacturers of 
blank cassettes. Exclusive distributors of books in Canada will be 
protected. A number of exceptions are added where no royalties or 
neighbouring rights can be claimed. And this is an aspect on which 
we have serious doubts, not enough, however, to vote against the 
bill, but enough for the Bloc Quebecois to argue in committee in 
favour of several amendments. We also want to propose 
amendments to existing legislation for improved collective 
management and civil remedies.
<P>
	Neighbouring rights are rights that are recognized for recording 
artists and producers of sound recordings. Now, when radio 
stations air the works of these artists, the authors and composers 
receive royalties, but not the artists and producers.
<P>
	In this bill, it is also provided that every radio station will benefit 
from a preferential rate of $100 on the first $1,250,000 of 
promotional sales. This means that, up to this amount, small radio 
stations will pay only $100. We think this is not enough.
<P>
	Now there is the issue of exceptions. It is true that some 
community organizations made a case and that we cannot remain 
insensitive to their claims.
<P>
<B>(1945)</B>
<P>
	But as it is presently written, the bill provides for new 
exceptions. It does not provides for limitations, it adds exceptions. 
In this sense, it is not a step in the right direction. We will have to 
make adjustments here. The Copyright Act already provides for a 
few exceptions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3464"> 3464 </A></B>
<P>
	At present, there are exceptions concerning the use of any work 
for the purposes of private study or research; for the purposes of 
criticism, review or newspaper summary, if the source is 
mentioned; for the making or publishing of paintings and 
drawings; for publication in a collection, mainly composed of 
non-copyright matter, intended for use in schools, of short 
passages from published literary works in which copyright 
subsists. Bill C-32 adds many more exceptions for schools, 
libraries, museums and archive services.
<P>
	To the exceptions already in existence, the bill adds, among 
others, the permission to use or make a copy of a work for the 
purposes of assignments or examinations; to make a copy of a work 
if its support is not of an adequate quality; to perform in public; to 
transmit sound recordings, television or radio programs by 
telecommunications within an educational institution; to make a 
copy of news programs; to make a copy of different programs and 
to retransmit them in educational institutions; the reproduction by 
libraries, museums, archives of works for the purposes of 
conservation; the permission for museums, archives and libraries 
to photocopy newspapers and magazines under certain conditions 
for their clients; the permission for museums, archives and 
libraries to do the above authorized work for other institutions.
<P>
	It releases libraries, museums, schools and archives from their 
responsability for the reproduction of works made by individuals 
with their photocopiers. This means that a small sign will be put on 
photocopiers to ask people not to infringe on copyright.
<P>
	It is like saying to someone in a library: ``Please do not steal that 
bookM''. I saw that once in a municipal library, and I was 
impressed. Well intentioned people, no doubt, had written, as a first 
rule: ``Stealing is strictly forbidden''. I found that extraordinary. 
This measure is similar.
<P>
	We are saying to people that they can use the books and the 
photocopier, but that they should not use them in any way that 
would infringe upon copyright, of writers in this case. This shows 
how far the law goes. It shows the intent to legislate, but it also 
shows that we do not have the means to enforce the legislation.
<P>
	An act can be very good, but if it is unenforceable and comes to 
rely exclusively on self-discipline, what use is it? That clause 
appears unbelievable to me. We should really amend it to avoid 
losing credibility.
<P>
	What do Quebec writers and artists say? They were very 
disappointed by the exceptions provided. They say these 
exceptions are contrary to the spirit of the legislation, which is to 
protect copyrights and not deprive their owners of what 
legitimately belongs to them. They think that the legislator should 
have left users and collective societies negotiate the use of works, 
as is done with the Quebec Ministry of Education and the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	Since liberalization is pretty much in the air these days-no, 
dear colleague, not in the partisan meaning of the word-why not 
let people negotiate according to the market value principle? Those 
in favour of that principle should apply it to everybody, including 
artists.
<P>
	I repeat, the great majority of artists do not earn millions. 
Sometimes people see Céline Dion or other big international stars 
and think that all artists are rich. Some have a few good years but 
like in the National Hockey League, careers are short. It is the same 
thing with the Liberal federal members-for example the 
government whip-whose career could very well be short. But that 
is another story.
<P>
<B>(1950)</B>
<P>
	In the interest of artists in Quebec and in Canada-I am 
sometimes told to stir up emotions in this House-we must 
reiterate our commitment and our sense of responsibility towards 
artists and writers.
<P>
	Again, and I will conclude on this note, it is also important for 
francophones in Ontario. When I worked in that province with the 
Association canadienne-française de l'Ontario, I met excellent 
artists who will be very happy with the objectives of this bill. As 
for the means to achieve these objectives, this bill lacks teeth.
<P>
	Before somebody breaks my neck, I will stop and make myself 
available for questions.

	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.) </B>moved that Bill C-6, an Act to amend the 
Yukon Quartz Mining Act and the Yukon Placer Mining Act, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to address the House on Bill C-6, an act to amend the Yukon 
Quartz Mining Act and the Yukon Placer Mining Act.
<P>
	I am extremely pleased to be introducing this legislation in the 
House. Bill C-6 is a made-in-the-Yukon solution to a circumstance 
that is unique to the Yukon, but that is of concern to all Canadians. 
It is a model of compromise and reason, and a major step forward 
in this government's efforts to foster sustainable development in 
the north.
<P>
<B>(1955)</B>
<P>
	By way of background, the Yukon Placer Mining Act and the 
Yukon Quartz Mining Act were enacted in 1906 and 1924 
respectively. These acts provide for the administration of crown 
mineral rights and the collection of royalties in the Yukon. While 
they have effectively supported mining as the Yukon's number one 
industry for most of this century, the two acts contain no provisions 
to protect the environment. This situation is unacceptable to this 
government, to the vast majority of Yukon residents and to 
Canadians in general.
<P>
	The integration of economic and environmental considerations 
in decision making is a guiding principle for this government. We 
are committed to protecting the environment while supporting the 
development of our resources in a way that will create jobs and 
economic prosperity for Yukoners and all Canadians.
<P>
	Bill C-6 rectifies a long recognized gap in federal legislation for 
the Yukon. It authorizes the government of Canada to establish 
mining land use regulations for projects in the Yukon.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This legislation must be viewed as a major accomplishment for a 
number of reasons. Not the least of these is that it represents a 
compromise between divergent points of view held by different 
groups, views  that have been reconciled to the point where we can 
proceed. This compromise did not come about overnight. It is the 
result of extensive consultations involving the industry, First 
Nations, environmental groups, the federal and territorial 
governments, and the general public.
<P>
	As a result of these consultations, Bill C-6 is acknowledged by 
stakeholders to be the best legislation that could be developed. The 
Yukon Mining Advisory Committee, or YMAC, deserves special 
mention for its central role in the process of developing this 
legislation, consulting Yukoners and arriving at a consensus that 
allows us to proceed at this time.
<P>
	YMAC was formed in 1990 to report to the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development on how best to amend the 
legislation affecting mining activities in Yukon. It is comprised of 
representatives of the Klondike Placer Mining Association, the 
Yukon Chamber of Mines, the Yukon Conservation Society and the 
Council for Yukon First Nations, the Government of Yukon and the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	The involvement of all these groups reflects the importance of 
mining to the Yukon economy as well as the respect Yukoners have 
for the land and the life it supports. Despite the wide range of views 
brought to the table, YMAC was able to reach consensus on all but 
two provisions of this lengthy and technical bill. I will have more 
to say on those issues in a few minutes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-6 must also be viewed as a major accomplishment 
because it will reinforce the government's commitment to 
sustainable development by providing for environmentally sound 
mining practices. By applying land use regulations for the first 
time to the early activities on mineral claims, the rules in the Yukon 
will become consistent with all other jurisdictions in Canada.
<P>
	Within the context of sustainable development, this legislation is 
an important part of the ongoing process to create a more 
conducive environment for mining and to support economic 
development in the Yukon. This process complements the process 
of legislative reform required for implementing land claims 
settlements for Yukon First Nations.
<P>
	As hon. members are aware, land claims final agreements have 
been signed with four Yukon First Nations. Hon. members will 
recall our consideration and passing of three bills to give effect to 
these agreements. Land claim negotiations are well-advanced with 
a number of others. In addition, some of these First Nations have 
already signed benefits agreements with mining companies.
<P>
<B>(2000)</B>
<P>
	Concerns that First Nations have about environmental protection 
on crown lands are addressed through Bill C-6. Yukon First Nations 
were involved in the work of the Yukon Mining Advisory
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3466"> 3466 </A></B>
<P>
Committee and continue to be consulted on the regulations that will 
accompany this legislation.
<P>
	The need to extend environmental regulations to all mining 
activities in the Yukon has long been recognized. The coming into 
force of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act in 1994 has 
underlined this need.
<P>
	As well, on December 29, 1995, the deficiencies in the current 
regime were made abundantly clear when the Federal Court of 
Canada ruled that the Yukon Quartz Mining Act and the Yukon 
Placer Mining Act were not subject to federal requirements for 
environmental assessment.
<P>
	As I stated earlier, Bill C-6 strikes the compromises that are 
needed to rectify this situation and to avoid further court 
challenges. In addition to ensuring protection of the environment, it 
gives the industry an important measure of certainty on which to 
base their decisions and seek investment dollars.
<P>
	I want to assure all hon. members that this legislation does not in 
any way affect the underlying rights of individuals or companies to 
acquire and hold mineral rights.
<P>
	In fact, the existing two mining acts remain unchanged except 
for a few minor amendments related to environmental issues. Upon 
proclamation of Bill C-6, the original acts will become part I of the 
acts, and the environmental protection requirements we are 
considering today will become part II.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Hon. members can appreciate that this is a very complex and 
technical bill. I do not intend to discuss all of the provisions in 
detail today. However, I would like to review the key elements of 
the land use regime that will be put in place in Yukon.
<P>
	Bill C-6 provides the necessary authorities for this regime, 
including the authority for the governor in council to make 
regulations. The details of the new regime will be contained in 
these regulations which are now being developed by the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development in 
consultation with all affected stakeholders in Yukon. In particular, 
special efforts are being made to involve Yukon First Nations in the 
consultation process.
<P>
	Currently two sets of regulations are being developed: one for 
hard rock exploration and one for placer exploration and 
production. At a later date a third set of regulations under the 
Yukon Quartz Mining Act will be devised for hard rock 
development, production and mine site reclamation.
<P>
	In addition to establishing the authority to regulate, Bill C-6 sets 
out the powers of the chief of mining land use who will be 
responsible for implementing the new regime in Yukon. It provides 
for the appointment of inspectors and gives them enforcement 
powers. It also includes a mechanism for appealing decisions, a 
process for the crown to recover any costs incurred in undertaking 
remedial work, provisions for requiring security deposits and for 
imposing penalties for non-compliance with the regulations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	One of the most important elements of this proposed legislation 
is the system of approvals it will establish for various levels of 
mining activities. Hardrock exploration and placer exploration and 
production activities will each be divided into four classes, ranging 
from those that will cause minor environmental disturbances to 
those that will have significant impacts. Separate licensing 
provisions are set out for producing quartz mines.
<P>
	For both the Yukon Placer Mining Act and the Yukon Quartz 
Mining Act, the first class of activity will be for projects that create 
a minimum of environmental disturbance. An operator who 
decides that his activity falls into class 1 will not require approval 
before the project begins. However, the activity must conform to 
operating conditions that will be set out in the appendices to the 
land use regulations for both quartz and placer activities.
<P>
<B>(2005)</B>
<P>
	Such mining projects will be regularly inspected to ensure they 
fall within Class I and that they comply with the prescribed 
operating conditions. An example of a Class I activity set out in the 
draft regulations is the use of a mining camp by not more than five 
persons at any one time of for not more than a total of 150 person 
days in one year.
<P>
	Class II mining projects willl involve a more intense level of 
activity that may require mitigative measures that go beyond the 
basic conditions set out for Class I projects. In this case, the 
operator is required to notify the Chief of Mining Land Use of the 
measures that will be taken to minimize any adverse environmental 
impacts. In recognition of the short exploration and placer season 
in Yukon, my department will have 25 days to respond to this 
notification. If no response is made, the operation may proceed 
without further administrative requirements.
<P>
	Class III activities are those that will have significant potential 
to cause environmental impacts. A complete plan of the entire 
operation must be submitted to my department before work begins, 
including details on how the operator intends to mitigate the 
environmental impact. In this case, my department will have 25 
days to respond to the applicant, but may during that time secure an 
extension of no more than 42 days to conduct its assessment.
<P>
	The fourth and final class of activities will require the same 
approval process as Class III projects. However,  public notifica-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3467"> 3467 </A></B>
<P>
tion of the proposed activity must also be given, and public 
consultation may be required. My department will have 42 days to 
respond to the application, with a potential extension period of an 
additional 42 days. A Class IV approval will also be needed when a 
placer project requires a water licence under the <I>Yukon Waters Act</I>.
<P>
	Projects ranked as Class II, III or IV activities will fall under the 
provisions of the <I>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act</I>. The 
processing times I have just described can be extended where 
additional time is required to comply with the federal 
environmental assessment legislation. This will ensure that the 
impact of the mining activity on other land users will be considered 
during the assessment process.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, YMAC was unable to reach agreement 
on only two issues of this bill: those dealing with penalties and 
levels of security. On these two issues the government has taken a 
middle of the road approach that has been endorsed by the majority 
of YMAC members. The security provisions, for example, strike a 
balance between the opposing views held by environmental groups, 
which were seeking large security deposits, and the mining 
industry, which felt that the deposits were unnecessary.
<P>
	Bill C-6 gives the federal government the authority to require a 
security deposit up to the estimated cost of site reclamation when 
there is the potential for a significant environmental impact or 
there is a risk that another operator may not comply with the 
requirements of the approval. This fund will be returned to the 
operator when reclamation is completed to the government's 
satisfaction.
<P>
	In addition, the government may require that remedial work be 
done and if the security is not sufficient to cover necessary costs 
the balance may be collected by civil action.
<P>
	On the issues of penalties, these amendments will allow for fines 
of up to $100,000 for failing to comply with the terms of a project 
approval each day an infraction continues being a separate offence. 
This is consistent with the fines that can be laid in relation to 
similar land use activities in the north and I am convinced it will 
deter non-compliance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-6 also provides a time frame for bringing the new land use 
regulations into effect. For quartz operations, there will be a six 
month phase-in period during which operators will be able to 
prepare and submit applications for their projects.
<P>
<B>(2010)</B>
<P>
	The land use regulations under the <I>Yukon Placer Mining Act</I> will 
come into effect after a full placer season has passed. The season is 
usually seven months.
<P>
	During these phase-in periods, environmental standards will 
apply and inspectors will have the authority to issue orders to 
correct serious environmental, health or safety problems at mining 
operations. At the end of the phase-in, operators will be prohibited 
from undertaking Class II, III or IV activities without approval 
from the Chief of Mining Land Use.
<P>
	The regulations now being developed will set out what lands will 
be subject to the new regime. Although Bill C-6 allows for the 
application of these amendments to all lands in Yukon, we will not 
unilaterally apply the regulations to lands on which the Crown does 
not own both the surface and subsurface. In other words, these 
regulations will NOT apply to lands on which the Yukon Territorial 
Government or First Nations administer the surface IF they have a 
management regime in place which meets or exceeds the 
regulations proposed under this bill. Hon. members should also be 
aware that this legislation is not retroactive.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The importance of this legislation cannot be overstated from 
either an environmental or an economic viewpoint. By establishing 
environmental protection requirements for mining projects in 
Yukon, Bill C-6 will fill the regulatory gap that does not exist in 
any other jurisdiction in Canada.
<P>
	The environmental requirements in this bill are not excessive 
and will not impede the industry. They are generally considered to 
be consistent with good mining practices by ensuring that every 
planned mineral operation, except the low impact class one 
activities, will be environmentally scanned before they are allowed 
to commence.
<P>
	From an economic perspective, Bill C-6 will help ensure the 
long term viability of mining in Yukon by establishing clear rules 
of operation and putting Yukon on a level playing field with other 
jurisdictions in Canada.
<P>
	This bill will give First Nations the assurance of environmental 
protection that may encourage them to open their lands to mining 
exploration and development where beneficial. This in turn will 
generate revenues for First Nations as well as jobs for aboriginal 
and non-aboriginal northerners alike.
<P>
	Bill C-6 would also ensure that taxpayers are not burdened with 
the cost of clean-ups and mine site reclamation. In future all 
mining industries will be more vigilant about preventing 
unnecessary damage to the environment and will be clearly 
responsible for corrective measures.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3468"> 3468 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These are critical amendments that deserve the support of this 
House. We must take advantage of this important window of 
opportunity to establish environmental requirements for mining 
projects in Yukon. With that in mind, I urge hon. members to join 
me in supporting this legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it can be 
seen from the number of people present that aboriginal and 
northern questions are extremely exciting. I hope that our viewers 
exceed the number of members in the House.
<P>
	At any rate, since aboriginal issues are always characterized by 
their technicalities, I think that the Bill we have before us today is 
also characterized by its technicalities, the first one probably being 
that one may well wonder why the parliamentary secretary to the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the 
official opposition critic for Indian affairs are discussing a bill on 
natural resources like gold and quartz in the Yukon.
<P>
	The two would appear to be irreconcilable at first glance, unless 
one takes a minute to think about the department name, which I 
would remind you, Mr. Speaker, includes the words Northern 
Development. So, automatically, everything north of the 49th 
parallel falls under that department's jurisdiction. That is why 
today the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development, and myself as critic find ourselves the 
key figures in the debate.
<P>
<B>(2015)</B>
<P>
	But the bill is also characterized by other technical details such 
as the environment and natural resources. A consensus and 
compromise were, moreover reached on this by my colleagues in 
the Bloc Quebecois who sit on the environment and natural 
resources committees. Finally, I am admitting to you that we will 
support the bill, but I shall return to that in my conclusion.
<P>
	I am particularly interested in what is going on in the Yukon. As 
you know, there are several ways to manage a portfolio like Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development. Personally, I subscribe to 
hands on experience; like many others, I love to go there and share 
people's experiences.
<P>
	When any bill is introduced on a given part of the country, you 
will have a better sense of things if you have travelled and seen the 
people and the countryside. I think the bill before us imposes a few 
more environmental constraints on open pit or underground 
mining. I think I am in a position today to describe what I saw 
there.
<P>
	Since 1994, since we arrived in this House, we have passed bills 
on the Yukon dealing with, among other things, government 
autonomy and territorial claims. I made friends at the time and I 
was pleased to see them  again in the Yukon a few weeks after these 
bills were passed. I must say the trip to the Yukon was absolutely 
extraordinary.
<P>
	An effort should be made to manage the environmental issue 
there a little better. Not only are there flora and fauna I have never 
seen, but nature is still wild there. I went out on the Yukon River 
and caught a 20-pound salmon there. And no this is no fisherman's 
tale. The native people really took me fishing. We even ate our 
catch that evening. It was an absolutely sensational traditional 
native meal with moose and caribou in addition to the salmon we 
caught.
<P>
	I have a lot of friends in the Yukon. The countryside is 
astounding. You have to see the river. There is almost no pollution, 
because places are so far away that there is no ever present 
pollution like on the St. Lawrence, for example. The river water is 
from glaciers and is both crystalline and deep green.
<P>
	We must strive to protect those parts of the country that make it 
rich, not only because of the landscape and the wildlife, but above 
all because of the people who live there. I was pleased to meet them 
and I am better able to speak about Bill C-6 and to express what I 
feel because I have been there and made friends there.
<P>
	I took some notes since it is always important to have reference 
points. The Yukon covers an area greater than that of France. Onle 
28,000 people live there, so you can imagine the open spaces. I 
admire immensely the people who took part in the gold rush in the 
Yukon in the Klondike days. Once, I took off from Whitehorse and 
flew two hours due north. That was the Klondike, that was Dawson 
City.
<P>
	One must recognize the merit of people who went there in order 
to become rich, to find millions of dollars in gold. It was physically 
very demanding and it deserves to be recognized.
<P>
	When we remember that the Yukon is as big as France, and 
compare France's population to the Yukon's, we soon realize how 
big it is and how few inhabitants there are per square kilometre.
<P>
	In 1898, the Yukon became a separate territory. The 
commissioner as well as six members of the Commission were 
appointed by the government. It is only in 1908 that all these 
people became elected representatives. The end of World War II 
also meant the end of the gold rush. The rush to the Klondike really 
happened around the turn of the century and fizzled out toward the 
end of the war.
<P>
<B>(2020)</B>
<P>
	At that time, thousands of immigrants went to the Yukon. Native 
people were a majority then, but with the influx of immigrants in 
the mid 1940s, at the end of the war, they became a minority.
<P>
	Today, as we speak, native people account for only 23 per cent of 
the population. It is still a lot. I do not want to  overlook that, 
especially as I noticed that native people and white people get 
along well there. Mind you, on a territory that big, you do not meet 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3469"> 3469 </A></B>
<P>
your neighbour every day, and you do not step on each other's toes 
every time you go out the door. On such a vast territory, chances are 
the neighbour will be far away.
<P>
	However, from what I saw in Whitehorse, relations between the 
white people and the natives are very good; after all, there are 
28,000 people in the Yukon Territory, which is not many given the 
size of the area.
<P>
	So there is a territorial administration. Naturally, the federal 
government kept some fiduciary responsibilities toward the native 
people but there is a Yukon government which manages social 
services, the development of small and medium size businesses, 
education, tourism and renewable resources.
<P>
	The federal government is responsible for the native people 
themselves and for nonrenewable resources. Therefore, mines, oil 
and gas remain under federal jurisdiction. Furthermore, almost 60 
per cent of the transfers and grants forming the territory's budget 
come from Ottawa. Thus, the participation of Ottawa is extremely 
important.
<P>
	What is Bill C-6, which is before the House today, meant to do? 
It seeks to amend both the Yukon Quartz Mining Act, dating from 
1924 and concerning rock mining, of course, and the Yukon Placer 
Mining Act, which has been in force since 1906.
<P>
	When I started reading the summary of the bill, I looked for the 
Translation of placer and realized that we have the same word in 
French. I was very happy to add the word to my vocabulary. The 
French word ``placer'' means a gold deposit. Expanding one's 
vocabulary is always interesting.
<P>
	One must understand that, in those days, environmental issues 
came far behind economic concerns. At the time, prospecting for 
gold was closer to an art than a science. People would head for the 
streams with their sifter. They would keep the little gold nuggets 
and throw away the rocks. The scenery is extraordinary up there. 
The midnight sun is something incredible. I had never seen it. I 
went to Dawson City, the Klondike town, and was taken to the 
mountain called Midnight Dome. From there the midnight sun is 
truly an incredible sight.
<P>
	However, when you look down you also see a lunar landscape 
around the Midnight Dome. It was caused by reckless 
development. Piles of earth were left there and completely spoil the 
scenery.
<P>
	It is easy to see that, at the time, the environment was not at all a 
concern, unlike today. The bill before us seeks to promote a 
behaviour that is more respectful of nature than in those days. At 
the time, people were just not concerned about the environment. 
They were concerned about finding gold. The land was so vast and 
so sparsely  populated that people did not care. Today, we have to 
care.
<P>
	These two acts do not include environmental protection 
measures. However, the requirements regarding development are 
such that they are tantamount to environmental protection 
measures.
<P>
	One of the main features of the act is the establishment of a link 
between the previous acts and the Yukon Waters Act. In the past, 
several acts were implemented in an attempt to control 
development in the Yukon, including the Yukon Waters Act.
<P>
<B>(2025)</B>
<P>
	All the changes that will be introduced through Bill C-6 will now 
come under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. Thus we 
see that the intent is good on the part of the legislator. That is why 
that after the consultations we had, we might receive some slight 
recriminations or grievances that we will try to review with my 
colleague in the standing committee. But we would certainly say 
that on the whole, this piece of legislation is a worthwhile effort. 
There is a system to approve various classes.
<P>
	I mentioned that there was no environmental protection, but 
there are indeed now various classes, and my colleague listed them 
earlier, which will require some approval and which will help 
discipline the operation as such for a better protection of the 
environment.
<P>
	Thus, class I activities require no preliminary approval but must 
comply with existing regulation. So there is a first small problem. 
The regulation was explained to us yesterday through a briefing 
held by the Indian affairs department, and of course we did not 
have time to get into it in depth today. We worked at it for part of 
the day, but the regulation is rather complex and moreover 
somewhat random and arbitrary. Let me explain.
<P>
	Among other things, about class I activities, the bill says that a 
class I program may include activities going beyond the parameters 
set out above. A camp can be used throughout the calendar year, 
but never by more than five people at a time, for a total of 150 days 
per person. If this condition is met, no approval will have to be 
requested, and the regulations will have been complied with.
<P>
	But why five people? Why not six or ten? Eventually, we will 
have to do our homework a little bit more seriously, and scrutinize 
the regulations, because the bill before us simply says that a class I 
program will have to comply with the regulation. But the 
regulation has not been made yet. It is being prepared. As we could 
see yesterday, 13 drafts have been prepared. We have been given 
the most recent one, which was completed last week. So there is 
still a bit of work to be done on the regulations, and we will 
examine this further later on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3470"> 3470 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to give you one more example. It is about the 
construction and permanent use of storage facilities for no more 
than 5,000 litres of petroleum fuels. For a single container of 
petroleum fuels, the volume is 2,000 litres. Here again, we have 
specifications, but I would like to know why 5,000 and not 10,000 
or 3,000. This seems to be rather arbitrary, and we did not have 
time to look at the rationale. I think we will have time to dig a 
little deeper during the coming weeks, both in committee and at 
third reading.
<P>
	Class I activities also include the deforestation of a strip of land 
not exceeding 1.5 metres in width, the development of a corridor 
not exceeding 5 metres in width, the excavation of a volume not 
exceeding 400 metres per placer per year. I just wanted to give you 
an idea of what is included in each category, because the principle 
is the following: when you go from class I to class II, the 
regulations get a little stricter. Also, class II activities require prior 
notification being given to a federal authority. Class III activities 
require the advance submission and approval of an operating plan. 
So, as you can see, the bigger the operations are, the stricter the 
regulations become.
<P>
	The regulations in relation to class IV activities are certainly the 
most demanding because they require the advance submission and 
approval of an operating plan and also public consultation. For 
those who are more interested in the economic issues than in the 
environmental issues, public consultations have become a pet 
peeve, because it only takes three or four people who object for the 
project to be questioned. So, class IV activities certainly involve 
large scale projects requiring public consultation, which means a 
lot more preparation work for the people who develop the resources 
to be able to provide the required information to the environmental 
groups and all those who would want to take a critical look at the 
class IV activities.
<P>
<B>(2030)</B>
<P>
	The bill before us did not appear overnight like magic. In fact, 
we checked and found that consultations were made. In 1990, an 
advisory committee on the Yukon mining industry was created.
<P>
	As you know, the issue was a concern to developers as well as to 
natives and environmentalists in the Yukon. For them, the issue 
was theirs. There was no way Ottawa or the Yukon government 
could tell them what to do.
<P>
	Since they wanted a purely Yukon solution, they gathered 
together a certain number of interesting people, including the 
president of the advisory committee, a businessman. The Chamber 
of Mines was part of the advisory committee. There was also the 
Klondike Placer Mining Operators Association, the First Nations 
Council which represents, as you know, 14 communities. A nation 
and a community are not the same thing, because a nation is often 
composed of many communities.
<P>
	This time, it was 14 communities of Yukon native peoples 
represented by one tribal council, and there are 14 communities in 
the Yukon. Another member of the advisory committee was the 
Conserver Society. The Yukon government was there, naturally, as 
well as the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development.
<P>
	Consultations were held. It always difficult for us to determine if 
the consultations were adequate. Even with all the people I just 
mentioned, were there enough consultations? Did we take all the 
necessary steps to let them all have their say?
<P>
	Maybe not. Indeed, representatives of the Yukon first nations 
made representations and came to meet me about two weeks ago. 
They told me that they had some difficulty in following the 
process. They did not participate in all of the meetings, not because 
they did not want to, but because, as they told me, they were not 
given all the necessary support to do so. The meetings did not 
always take place in the delegated chief's community. I will 
enumerate the 14 Yukon nations in a few moments.
<P>
	Some come from Northern Yukon, others from Southern Yukon. 
When the meetings were scheduled in Whitehorse, as was often the 
case because most of the people I mentioned have their 
headquarters in that city, the Yukon's capital, it was not easy for 
people from the North to be there. The natives told us that, 
unfortunately, they received little support from the governments to 
facilitate their presence in the consultative committee meetings.
<P>
	We were also assured by Indian Affairs officials that the bill is 
consistent with the land claims in the Yukon and with the 
self-government clauses that have been signed or will be signed.
<P>
	Government officials reassured us by saying that, in terms of the 
environment, in terms of the categories and in terms of 
development, there was no contradiction with what was given to 
the Yukon First Nations as far as self-government or land claims 
were concerned.
<P>
	We still have some checking to do because, as my colleague 
mentioned, this exercise has not been completed yet. Four native 
communities in the Yukon have signed land claims and 
self-government agreements.
<P>
	They are the Gwitchin Vuntut, the Champagne and Aishihik, the 
Nacho Nyak Dun and the Tlingits from the Teslin area, who signed 
in 1994. They were all here in the gallery and I was happy to salute 
them at the time. They had been negotiating for 21 years.
<P>
<B>(2035)</B>
<P>
	They told us that their fathers and their grandfathers had started 
these negotiations, and I recall that applause was prohibited in the 
gallery. I think that the guards at the time were understanding and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3471"> 3471 </A></B>
<P>
allowed these people to  express their happiness at a settlement 
after 21 years of negotiations.
<P>
	We must now see not only whether Bill C-6 before us today is in 
their interests, but also whether it will have an impact on them. And 
I would also remind you that negotiations are still outstanding in 
ten cases. I do not know the size or date of a final settlement for 
these nations, but they are still awaiting a final settlement on their 
land claims and their right to self-government.
<P>
	Among others, I see that Dawson First Nation is in Dawson City, 
which used to be the capital of the Klondike. I mentioned it earlier, 
and I also told you about the Midnight Dome, but I could also tell 
you about the casino that used to feature the Folies Bergères back 
then. I do not know whether my colleague had the chance to visit, 
but it is truly a glimpse into the past. The streets are unpaved and 
the casino is a very popular place. The hotels are also authentic. I 
myself had a drink with my native friends in the local saloon. It is 
just as it was at the beginning of the century, really something.
<P>
	Half of the city belongs to Heritage Canada, which is anxious to 
preserve this considerable heritage. There is even a wonderful 
theatre, which is rather like today's versions. There are even boxes 
for those who had been more successful in their prospecting than 
others and could afford to rent a box for the whole year, close to the 
stage, while the poor devil who had had bad luck finding gold had 
to settle for being way at the back. The same values applied in 
Dawson City at the turn of the century. There was also a First 
Nation there, one which would certainly have to be consulted first 
of all, in order to determine the impact of Bill C-6, for it is on their 
land that nature has been the most ravaged by gold and quartz 
mining.
<P>
	As well there were other First Nations: Kwanlin Dun and Silkirk, 
Carmacks-Little Salmon, Ta'an Kwach'an, Ross River, Carcross, 
White River, Liard, the Kluane Council, all of whom are on the 
path to self government and are involved in as yet incompletely 
settled land claims.
<P>
	So, even though we are aware of the legislator's intent, which is 
to put a little more discipline in place on the mining industry in 
order to protect the environment, I think that the Bloc Quebecois 
will make it its duty to keep a watchful eye and to check with all 
those people on the true impact of Bill C-6. If necessary, we will 
look at the regulations and ensure that everything is done properly.
<P>
	We also have environmental concerns. We are in contact with the 
Yukon Fish and Wildlife Board, which is in the Yukon and is 
primarily concerned that the bill will provide for costs in the event 
of bad land management. If, in category II or III, for example, a 
plan was not followed and damage has been done to nature, the 
people will eventually have to pay.
<P>
	The bill provides that people deposit a certain sum of money in 
advance, so it is available in the event of damage. In the past, 
companies left the environment in a terrible state when they left. 
The Yukon Fish and Wildlife Board does not think the money 
operators are required to put down before they start is enough.
<P>
<B>(2040)</B>
<P>
	The board recommends that operators in activity category (e) put 
down a security deposit equal to the cost of returning the site to its 
original state. This is what I wanted to say not just for category I 
but for all the other categories. They are not asking for a sum 
equivalent to the danger involved, but they are asking for a little 
more than the bill provides, or at least a chunk of it, so that, if 
disaster happens, the money provided by private enterprise, rather 
than society, is used for the clean up or for the damage caused.
<P>
	I am briefly summarizing the bill. We consider it a significant 
improvement over existing laws, particularly as concerns 
environmental regulations. I believe I dealt with it extensively.
<P>
	At the time, shameful exploitation was going on. The 
environment was not a concern then, it did not matter. Nowadays, it 
does. The intent of the legislator is to improve the situation, we do 
agree.
<P>
	As I said, this bill did not come out of the blue. The result before 
us today is the result of a consultation process conducted by a 
committee whose membership I mentioned. Some members 
complained, probably for not having being able to attend as often 
as they would have liked.
<P>
	However, one must admit that on the face of it, the result seems 
to be the result of a compromise. I say it again, the intent of the 
legislator was to have a consultation process, which can be 
criticized, but for the time being we see the result as a compromise.
<P>
	Environmental and native groups seem to think that we did not 
consult sufficiently. This cannot be checked easily. We still have 
more consultations to do. There could have been some deficiencies 
regarding the consultation process, but would that justify 
questioning the whole bill? Today, we answer no. We feel that, as 
the intent is to protect the environment a little more, it is important 
to let the bill progress.
<P>
	In committee and during third reading, we could propose 
amendments to satisfy all the interested parties from the Yukon.
<P>
	The Standing committee must hear the representative groups to 
ensure an adequate legislation. Up to now, about ten groups have 
requested to appear before the committee, I think. I am not one of 
those who say right away that everyone will be heard. We may have 
to pay more attention to those who already have grievances. As for 
placers and mining companies, we have already  received letters of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3472"> 3472 </A></B>
<P>
support saying: ``As far as we are concerned, the bill is perfectly 
adequate''.
<P>
	Where there are problems, we will listen to what people have to 
say and, if necessary, we will make changes. This is what the 
legislative process is about. This is the purpose of the three 
readings. This is why standing committees review legislation. The 
purpose of the process is precisely to improve the bills before us. 
We have to take the time and use the resources to make these 
people welcome and listen to what they have to say.
<P>
	As far as consultations are concerned, if there is a need for 
further consultations in committee or otherwise, the limited 
financial resources of First Nations should be taken into account. It 
is always a problem.
<P>
	It is not easy to tell people from the Yukon: ``Come before the 
Indian affairs committee in two or three weeks''. It costs money 
and, usually, these expenses are not entirely paid for by the 
committee. The native people have some difficulty and, after 
listening to them, we realized that maybe that is what caused a 
problem with consultations in the Yukon. It required so much time 
and such financial resources that these people had difficulty 
following the tempo of the consultation committee.
<P>
	In the next stages, namely the committee and third reading 
stages, we will have an opportunity to hear from them and we will 
see what they have to say.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois will vote in favour of Bill C-6 
at second reading stage, but we still want to hear representations 
from all the groups that wish to appear before the standing 
committee.
<P>
	I think that once we have heard these people, fulfilled our duty as 
legislators, taken into account all of the representations, complaints 
and recommendations and we made all appropriate efforts to 
improve the bill as necessary, it must be remembered that Bill C-6 
shows the government's good intentions. The Bloc Quebecois 
supports Bill C-6 for now, except for the small reservations we 
mentioned. At second reading stage, the Bloc Quebecois will 
endorse Bill C-6.
<P>
<B>(2045 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise at this hour and speak to Bill C-6. I do not have 
as many lively stories about dancing girls and entertainment in the 
far north, but from the member's comments it sounds like a good 
place to visit and I had best get there as soon as possible.
<P>
	On behalf of the Reform Party, I am pleased to support second 
reading and referral to committee of Bill C-6, an act to amend the 
Yukon Quartz Mining Act and the Yukon Placer Mining Act which 
are old acts, 1924 and 1906 respectively. We will be recommending 
acceptance of the bill with no amendments.
<P>
	To reiterate one problem with the bill, both our mining critic and 
our aboriginal affairs critic had hoped that the bill would be 
referred to the natural resources committee. The bill deals 
exclusively with mining activity but I understand it is within the 
prerogative of DIAND because of the location of the activity north 
of 60.
<P>
	The natural resources committee has dealt extensively with 
mining regulations. It has just gone through a major review of 
Canada's mining regulations with a report to Parliament on the 
mining activity within our country. It seems a shame not to take 
advantage of referring this bill to that committee since the bill is 
about mining and not about aboriginal people. It seems to us that 
we are not taking the best advantage of the expertise in committees. 
We had hoped that since there is no other bill before the natural 
resources committee it could have dealt with this one.
<P>
	I realize the bill does deal solely with mining. Of course, mining 
is extremely important to Yukon. About 30 per cent of the entire 
economy of Yukon is mining related. By far it is the biggest 
industrial activity in that territory. The importance of this bill to 
that industry cannot be overstated.
<P>
	A bigger part of Yukon territory's economy is the federal 
government. At a time when the federal government is being forced 
to cut back in all areas by billions of dollars, transfers to provinces 
specifically by some $7 billion, health care, education and other 
former untouchables seem to be on the chopping block, we must 
ensure that we support whatever industries we have in any part of 
the country.
<P>
	It is important that the mining industry not be damaged by this 
bill. One of our first considerations when we looked at the bill was 
to see if any of the proposed changes would harm the mining 
industry in Yukon and if the legislative framework was similar to 
that in which the mining industry was accustomed to functioning. I 
am glad to say the bill will do the job for the industry in that area.
<P>
	Although the mining industry is important, the people of Yukon 
and elsewhere in Canada would say that the protection of the 
environment is of primary importance. The mining industry has 
taken a lot of bad raps, some them deserved, for its activities in 
times past, but the industry is making a very conscientious effort to 
clean up its act and its mining sites.
<P>
<B>(2050 )</B>
<P>
	In that sense it is important that the people in Yukon and in all of 
Canada be reassured that this bill will not result in a lowering of 
environmental standards. In this day and age it is just not going to 
be accepted, nor should it be accepted, nor, to give the mining 
companies credit, do they want a lowering of the environmental 
standards. The environmental protection aspect of the bill is also 
important.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3473"> 3473 </A></B>
<P>
	There is a misconception about what has been going on in 
Yukon prior to the passing of Bill C-6. Many people wrongly 
believe that few or no environmental controls are in place 
regarding placer and hard rock mining in Yukon territory. That 
simply is not true. This act will supplement many pieces of 
existing territorial and federal legislation enforcing the 
environmental concerns on Yukon miners, including the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act. Any activity that involves federal 
moneys, federal land or federal permission can and does trigger 
a Canadian environmental protection assessment on that activity. 
Anything that happens up there already comes under that purview.
<P>
	In addition to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 
Yukon mining is also subject to the following acts: the Fisheries 
Act, with fines ranging up to $1 million; the Yukon Waters Act, 
with fines of up to $100,000 if they foul up; the Arctic Waters 
Pollution Prevention Act; the Territorial Lands Act; the Dangerous 
Goods Transportation Act, with fines of $100,000 if they botch it; 
the existing provisions of the original Yukon Quartz Mining Act 
and Yukon Placer Mining Act; and several Yukon statutes, 
including fire and forest prevention, gasoline handling, the Miners 
Lien Act and the Occupational Health and Safety Act, and on and 
on.
<P>
	Yukon mining is well regulated already. We needed to modernize 
it and bring it under one umbrella, under one piece of legislation. 
We needed to fill the gaps and to make both the regulations and the 
enforcement regime easier to understand and more consistent 
throughout all of those different acts I have just referred to.
<P>
	I mentioned that the mining industry across Canada is on record 
through the Mining Association of Canada and certainly in my 
speaking with them, as being in favour of strict environmental 
controls. As long as this legislation is clear, timely and orderly and 
it is based on science rather than politics, the mining association 
will have no trouble with it.
<P>
	One of the main things which has been a very productive part of 
Bill C-6 is the way in which the bill has arrived at this stage. The 
legislation was developed through five years of consultation with 
all stakeholders in Yukon. All of us like to see things happen in a 
hurry but in this case the go slow process was very productive. 
Many pages of accompanying regulations are still to be drafted and 
there are concerns that will have to be addressed as we try to 
enforce this legislation.
<P>
	The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
has been engaged for some time in consulting with the Yukon First 
Nations regarding proposed regulations. There have been quite a 
number of drafts, 13 drafts as has been mentioned, just to reflect 
the various viewpoints of all the groups involved to date. The facts 
appear to indicate that DIAND representatives in Yukon are 
making a sincere effort to ensure that once  again all stakeholders 
are involved in finalizing the new regulations.
<P>
	The new regulations will be extensive. They are not included in 
the bill itself. Except for the generic headings under which the 
government will now have to make up those regulations, we are 
going to have to look at the regulations separately from the bill to 
make sure that they are workable and so on.
<P>
	I have heard people nitpicking about certain regulations or 
concerns about the bill. I am nervous that people who sit on other 
House committees and have not watched this process go through 
for several years are going to propose nitpicking amendments and 
changes to the bill as we go through second reading.
<P>
<B>(2055 )</B>
<P>
	We in the Reform Party are convinced that there have been 
extensive consultations on this bill with all of the stakeholders, 
with aboriginal people and non-aboriginal people in the area, with 
the mining association, with the Yukon self-government people and 
so on. They have all had input and are satisfied that Bill C-6 is as 
good a piece of legislation as we can get to bring together all of the 
disparate groups. All of them have been involved throughout the 
five years.
<P>
	We will not be proposing amendments at this stage because of 
the extensive consultations. As long as the grassroots have been 
consulted properly, when they come to a consensus with that many 
viewpoints then we had best go along with it. We are not going to 
suggest to people who have put that much time and effort into it to 
get a consensus that now is the time for someone sitting in Ottawa 
to pull a word out from here and there to try to improve it.
<P>
	Certainly some concerns remain with both environmentalists 
and some of the prospectors. There are concerns which have been 
brought to our attention from some prospectors who fear that new 
regulations may have a negative impact on some very small, hard 
rock operations. They feel that those small operations may have to 
jump through so many hoops and go through so much costly and 
time consuming bureaucracy that the small operations may no 
longer be viable. Again, we will be watching those regulations. We 
hope there will be ways to ensure they will be able to do their work.
<P>
	Although we will be supporting the bill, it is worthwhile to note 
again that on the greater issue of mining regulation in Canada we 
have been promised things and deadlines have come and gone. 
Deadlines have been set by the Liberal government which have 
come and gone on the streamlining of the regulatory process. The 
industry minister promised regulatory reform by last December 
and it has not happened. The natural resources minister promised 
regulatory harmony between the provinces and the federal 
government and that has not happened. The government must 
ensure that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3474"> 3474 </A></B>
<P>
it goes  beyond the good promises and the good talk. We have to 
start walking the walk.
<P>
	This bill will work in Yukon, but south of 60 we need some 
regulatory streamlining. It has to happen. The mining association is 
no longer thanking the minister for her good comments, it is 
demanding action.
<P>
	In this bill a delicate balance has been struck which the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development states 
will not have a negative impact on mining. Mining is the most 
important private sector contributor to the Yukon economy. We 
want to register our strong belief that the House should act to fulfil 
the local expectations of the people of Yukon who have helped to 
put this together by passing this bill as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak this evening on Bill C-6, which represents 
amendments to the Yukon Quartz Mining Act of 1924 and the 
Yukon Placer Mining Act of 1906. Both pieces of legislation have 
not been substantively amended since the time of regional 
enactment.
<P>
	I would like to preface my remarks by saying that Yukon, which 
has a geographic land mass the same size as Sweden and a 
population of 32,000, is undergoing a number of processes which 
have been referred to by other speakers this evening. One of them 
is the land claims and self-government process approved by the 
House last year. At the same time the resource activities are 
undergoing a lot of scrutiny in Yukon.
<P>
	I am pleased to say that in this case mining does represent a very 
large proportion, about 30 per cent, of Yukon's economy. It has 
been a very significant part of the economy since the days of the 
gold rush and it continues to be today. In fact, mining activities in 
Yukon today are on the increase.
<P>
<B>(2100)</B>
<P>
	One of the challenges in a territory the size of Yukon, which has 
in many ways the characteristics of the last frontier, is how we 
preserve the environment, ensure the wilderness is preserved and 
enhanced, as wilderness tourism is a large part of our economy, and 
ensure mining activity can responsibly take place.
<P>
	I have never believed the issue is mining versus environment. I 
believe we are able to come to a conclusion, an agreement, a 
balance between those two. We can have responsible mining 
activity and legitimate, realistic environmental regulations that do 
not undermine the industry and the environment. I think the 
process that took place to come to these amendments in Bill C-6 
goes some way to achieving that.
<P>
	As mentioned by the previous speaker, the whole issue of 
streamlining regulations in support of the mining industry is a very 
complex regulatory regime in Canada.  In Yukon I address 
specifically a very complex regulatory machine for the mining 
industry. I had hoped these amendments would help substantively 
not to reduce regulation but to streamline it. This legislation does 
not meet that test. It does not significantly streamline the process, 
as we could do while not undermining the sector and not 
undermining environmental regulation.
<P>
	The bill is intended to bring in Yukon mining legislation and 
particularly exploration. It is not that there is not any 
environmental regulation at the moment, but particularly in the 
exploration sector there has not been an environmental regime of 
any strength. This bill will bring much of the environmental 
regulation in conformity with other jurisdictions and federal 
legislation.
<P>
	As other speakers have mentioned, the amendments are the 
result of a process which I would like to refer to because I think it is 
very important. It began in 1990. It was a process that involved 
stakeholders of the industry, the territorial government, the federal 
government, the department of fisheries, the Department of Indian 
and Northern Affairs, Yukon First Nations. A committee was 
established with an independent chair. That was particularly 
important in terms of the process because it meant that no one 
stakeholder, no one government department was in control of this. 
It truly was a body made up of all interested parties chaired by a 
person independent of any one group. Much of the success of this 
process must be given to the establishment of that form of 
independence and grassroots development.
<P>
	It is not a process without problems. During the time this 
committee was established in 1990 the federal government 
changed, the territorial government changed and there were certain 
changes to federal legislation. For example, the waters act used to 
be the federal inland waters act. It became the Yukon Waters Act. 
All of these changes obviously brought about changes in the 
working of the committee.
<P>
	Unfortunately the committee did not have staff resources 
dedicated specifically to that committee. There was a certain lack 
of ability to follow up and implement both consultation processes 
and other processes related to the technical aspects that had to be 
done by the various departments and stakeholders.
<P>
	In general it was a good process, one that could really be looked 
at in other resource sectors. At the moment I am looking at this in 
terms of the forest resource sector in Yukon because it was an 
attempt to involve everyone and to come to some kind of made in 
Yukon solution which would address industry, environmental and 
public policy concerns in this sector.
<P>
	It was also hoped that would streamline the process and it 
probably has not done a lot of that, but there is some integration of 
various processes, not probably going nearly as far as we should go 
in this area, but there is some of that.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3475"> 3475 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2105)</B>
<P>
	The challenge was to find a consensus and a balance between 
industry and governmental and public views. It proved very 
difficult because of the many changes taking place at the time. 
There were governmental changes in jurisdiction of legislation and 
the land claims and self-government processes.
<P>
	There is no legislation currently that requires the mitigation of 
environmental effects of mining activities on claims until the 
operator has applied for a licence from the Yukon Water Board. Up 
to that point there is no environmental requirement. This addresses 
the exploration stage and not necessarily the development and 
working stage.
<P>
	At the point of applying for a licence to operate from the Yukon 
Water Board, the assessment processes under the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act take place, but it was clear 
provisions needed to be instituted for exploration in order to 
conform to general environmental principles.
<P>
	This act attempts to address this. Mining activities are further 
regulated by other federal acts such as the Fisheries Act, the Yukon 
Waters Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.
<P>
	Bill C-6 sets out four categories or classes as identified in the 
legislation related to exploration, class one, class two, class three 
and class four.
<P>
	There is at the moment no legislation in place to regulate land 
use activities on mining claims during exploration. Each mining 
activity now, pursuant to this legislation, will come under one of 
the classes.
<P>
	It is proposed that there will be a six month phase-in for the 
provisions on the Yukon Quartz Mining Act and a 12 month 
phase-in for amendments to the Placer Mining Act. That is why it is 
quite important. We have already missed this year's mining season, 
which is in full swing now. It is important that we try to deal 
thoughtfully but expeditiously with this legislation so that it can 
begin to be put in place for the coming months and mining season.
<P>
	One of the things that is extremely important about this 
legislation, a very positive point, is there is provision for a two year 
review after implementation of this act. This is important because 
often when laws and regulations are made in Ottawa and even by 
the territory in operation they may not prove to attain the objectives 
intended. It is a very positive part of this act that the two year 
review period is incorporated to ensure the act is meeting the 
objectives for which it was intended.
<P>
	In its present form Bill C-6 has the support from both the hard 
rock and placer mining industry, noting that this was intended to be 
a consensus. Last summer, as recently as two weeks ago and 
certainly for the nine years I have been member of Parliament I 
have attended many  meetings. I visited many mines, both 
underground and placer. There is a real anxiety in the mining 
industry that regulations will become so onerous that especially the 
small operators will not be able to function.
<P>
	The committee was extremely sensitive to this because in Yukon 
placer mining in particular is often a family run business. I often 
compare it to Saskatchewan family farms because that is really 
what it is like. One does have to be sensitive that in small 
operations regulations can be conformed with in a way that it is 
commensurate with ensuring that business can continue.
<P>
	There was a lot of suspicion and concern. In the end, the 
consensus making process certainly produced no winners. People 
in the mining industry were not necessarily happy with some of the 
provisions and, as I will mention later, other participants had some 
real concerns as well.
<P>
<B>(2110 )</B>
<P>
	Letters I have received indicate that members of the industry, 
including the Yukon Chamber of Mines and the Klondike Placer 
Miners Association, are totally in support of this legislation in its 
present form and would like to see it passed in its present form.
<P>
	Other groups have some concerns. As legislators, as federal 
parliamentarians, it is important to listen to those concerns in the 
committee process. The Yukon Conservation Society, which was a 
member of the Yukon Mining Advisory Committee, has withdrawn 
its support for this legislation.
<P>
	The Council for Yukon First Nations has some concerns on 
specific issues but also regarding the fact that there was some 
difficulty with a lack of resources in being able to fully do a 
consultation with all the 14 First Nations. In support of the 
department, DIAND has made a special effort to do that 
consultation with the First Nations, although there was a 
representative on the Yukon Mining Advisory Committee. These 
are real concerns about this process.
<P>
	The Yukon Fish and Wildlife Management Board, established 
under the land claims agreement, also has some reservations. 
While I am generally supportive of the legislation and I would like 
to see it supported by the House and go to committee I believe 
those expressing these concerns have some valid points which we 
must seriously consider in committee. Some of the recommended 
amendments must be addressed by committee members.
<P>
	I will briefly outline some of the concerns which will come 
before the committee. Perhaps one of the most consistent concerns 
is that related to class one activities. Class one activities do not 
require notification to the public, to the government in either case 
of quartz or placer mining. This is opposed to the other three 
classes, which do.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3476"> 3476 </A></B>
<P>
	Mining activity can impact on sensitive wildlife habitats. I have 
a case now which is interesting. In the city of Whitehorse staking 
is taking place on a greenbelt which is basically a park in a 
residential area. This is occurring three feet from people's 
backyards.
<P>
	These greenbelts were established in a densely populated area to 
represent a buffer area. This is of considerable concern to 
homeowners, although it is perfectly legal under these acts and that 
would not necessarily be changed by Bill C-6. Members of the 
House might think about how they would react if they looked out in 
their backyards and someone was slashing trees and putting up 
stakes for a mining claim.
<P>
	This can be resolved because under the act it is possible for the 
city of Whitehorse to make requests to the federal government to 
withdraw these lands from staking. The city has been doing this, 
and I am in support of this. It is one of those things that obviously 
strikes people as the kind of challenge that occurs with regard to 
mining. It is related to the second issue and concern raised by 
several groups, which is in many ways the same issue, free entry.
<P>
	In other words, it is quite legitimate under the law to go into any 
area and stake, as in the above example. Exploration can take place 
on any public land. Some groups make the point, which I think is a 
serious one, that the principle of free entry is incompatible with 
long term conservation of fish and wildlife habitat. If they do not 
have to do any kind of study, if anyone can go without first 
establishing whether it is a sensitive area, clearly there may be a 
real conflict about the free entry principle.
<P>
	The Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society states that by having 
the free entry principle the ability of the government is limited to 
place terms and conditions on mining exploration in sensitive 
areas, an issue that does have to be considered by the committee. I 
am sure that the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society will want 
to put its point of view before the committee.
<P>
<B>(2115)</B>
<P>
	A third issue mentioned by several groups is the requirement for 
security which must be posted by operators. Bill C-6 states that 
security can be requested where the risk of significant impacts are 
likely or where the operator has a poor track record. The amount of 
security, according to the bill, is limited by reasonable cost to 
perform the required mitigation of any damage that is caused by the 
mining activity.
<P>
	The concern is really rooted in the experience of the past. I agree 
with my colleagues who have said that the mining industry's 
reaction and the Mining Association of Canada are very strong in 
their support for environmental regulation. In some ways we are 
dealing with concerns about what has happened in the past, 
although I have to say that in my very recent experience I  have 
seen situations where mining companies have left or gone bankrupt 
and the taxpayer has been left with the bill for clean-up. The point 
that various groups are trying to make is that this should not be the 
responsibility of the taxpayer but should be the responsibility of the 
industry.
<P>
	An example of that right now is in an area near Carcross, Yukon 
where there was a mine. It was discovered a couple of years ago 
that arsenic was leaking into the water, into the land, into the 
berries and into all of the flora around that area and affecting the 
animals. The owners, Venus Mines, have long since disappeared. It 
is estimated that the cost to the taxpayer of the clean-up will be 
minimally $800,000. This is a relatively small mine site so one can 
appreciate the concern that is expressed here about the discretion of 
the security and whether there might not be a better requirement for 
security to be placed.
<P>
	Such impacts of mining should be, as the Canadian Parks and 
Wilderness Society states, a cost of doing business and not an 
infinite liability to the taxpayer.
<P>
	Therefore, the issue of posted security must be reviewed under 
Bill C-6. I agree that we do not want to make extensive 
amendments to this bill. It is a result of a consensus process. At the 
same time there are substantive issues that must be thoroughly 
reviewed, heard and considered by the committee.
<P>
	In summary, the general principles of this bill are supportable. 
The process had some flaws but in general it was a positive attempt 
to reach a consensus on a very contentious issue. I would say that 
all participants and, in particular, the chair, must be commended for 
their efforts and various governments, both the previous and the 
current one, for their support of this process.
<P>
	It is recognized by all participants that there were no clear 
winners in this, that everyone had to give up something. I suppose 
that is a model we might look at in Canada and as usual it seems to 
me the Yukon is setting a good model for the rest of Canada.
<P>
	I would interject in summary one cautionary note. This 
legislation will only be effective if the Government of Canada is 
prepared to put in place the resources to enforce the legislation. I 
am very concerned that with federal cutbacks we will not have 
those resources. I hope the government will make a clear 
commitment that there will be sufficient resources for enforcement 
of the legislation. I must say that if there are not, it will simply 
increase in the public the suspicion of government making laws 
which it either cannot enforce or does not intend to enforce.
<P>
	On that cautionary note I would urge the government to consider 
this. The House has a responsibility to carefully consider the views 
of all interested parties. I urge a careful review by the committee of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3477"> 3477 </A></B>
<P>
the points I  have raised and I urge passage at second reading so we 
can get to the discussion of these issues.
<P>
<B>(2120 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate the member for Yukon for making such an 
interesting presentation and for giving us a firsthand account of 
mining in her riding. It comes from someone who knows of what 
she speaks, whereas in my case I go into that magnificent area only 
every three or four years and gather impressions without being able 
to get into greater depths on some of the mining issues.
<P>
	The member for Yukon indicated in her speech, if I understood 
her correctly, that the bill does not streamline the regulatory regime 
enough. I would be interested if she could briefly elaborate on what 
kind of regulatory regime she would like to see.
<P>
	I would also like to ask her what, in her view, considering all the 
interested parties she described in her speech, would be a 
sustainable mining policy for her region. Does she think that the 
Whitehorse declaration is adequate as a document? If I remember 
correctly, it was announced a couple of years ago. Is it being 
implemented or has it remained a declaration on paper? Does she 
see evidence that the document has become part of the mining 
activities in that area?
<P>
	I was glad to hear the member refer to the fact that there are 
some reservations on the part of certain organizations. She referred 
to the Yukon Conservation Society which apparently has 
withdrawn its support.
<P>
	To conclude, I recall some of the mines in northern British 
Columbia on the border of Yukon where the mining tails are left in 
a very undesirable condition. The landscape, the condition of the 
soil and the surface are left in a degraded state. It makes one 
wonder if the mining community takes no responsibility for taking 
care of the surface and the water conditions after a mine closes.
<P>
	I am sure the member for Yukon has experience in matters 
related to mining closures. I would be very grateful if she would 
give us her views on these aspects which relate to her region.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, those are a number of issues but 
I will try to address them all.
<P>
	First is the streamlined regulatory regime. Please note that by 
streamlined, I do not mean fewer regulations or undermining 
environmental regulation. At one time there were approximately 10 
pieces of legislation to which a small mining outfit would have to 
adhere. Unless there are adequate resources from both the 
Government of Yukon and the federal government to implement 
this, it causes the small operator a tremendous problem. I am quite 
empathetic for streamlining.
<P>
	There is some streamlining in the bill. Through the Yukon waters 
act there has been an attempt to ensure that when operators go 
through that process, they will also be dealing with approvals in 
other pieces of legislation.
<P>
	I certainly am empathetic to the small mining operations when 
they talk about how difficult this can be. Sometimes it is just a lack 
of personnel and staff resources to deal expeditiously with a mining 
outfit because they have to go into the field which is sometimes 
geographically difficult to reach.
<P>
	I would like to reinforce the point I made in my remarks that the 
federal government must be committed to facilitate and process the 
enforcement of any such amendment that is passed, such as Bill 
C-6.
<P>
<B>(2125 )</B>
<P>
	Sustainability is a huge issue. I know the member for Davenport 
has a very extensive knowledge and interest in this. In the 17 years 
that I have lived in the Yukon there have been constant discussions 
about how to balance the resource activities and the preservation of 
the wilderness.
<P>
	Some people think that wilderness is just a bunch of trees sitting 
around waiting for something to happen. However, others actually 
believe that it has a tangible value. For example, fur trapping, 
which is always a very contentious issue, is something which is 
environmentally sustainable. It is one of the environmentally 
sustainable, non-intrusive forms of economic development in 
wilderness areas.
<P>
	We need a mix and a balance. The process that took place with 
the Yukon Mining Advisory Committee, because it did include 
environmental groups, was an attempt at that kind of balance. It is 
never easy and that is why no winners came out of this, but there 
was an expression of goodwill by all of the stakeholders.
<P>
	While I have mentioned some of the changes that the 
environmental community, including the Yukon Conservation 
Society and the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, would like 
to see, they are definitely not saying they do not want to see mining 
or improvement, they just want to see a greater degree of 
improvement in this legislation.
<P>
	As to the Whitehorse initiative on mining, the general view 
seems to be that it is proceeding. I do not think that it has lapsed 
into a complete vacuum, as sometimes happens with these things. 
In general, there is support for what is happening, certainly in the 
industry. Again, it is trying to come to grips with the various values 
that are represented. In the Yukon it is the First Nations who have 
an interest in economic development and in some cases now have 
shares in mining companies and see this as part of their economic 
development.
<P>
	Finally, on the responsibility of mining companies in 
reclamation and abandonment of sites, there have been extremely 
negative examples of that, particularly in hard rock mining but also 
in placer mining. As I mentioned in  my remarks, the taxpayers had 
to pick up the bill. These are questions that I have challenged when 
I have 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3478"> 3478 </A></B>
<P>
met with the mining industry. We have to look at this as a cost of 
doing business.
<P>
	As the member knows, there have been changes in the legislation 
that mining companies have to put up front environmental deposits 
for reclamation. Here we are talking about exploration and saying 
we should be doing the same thing.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and referred to a 
committee.)

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LAWOFTHESEA">LAW OF THE SEA</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
question for discussion tonight is when will Canada ratify the law 
of the sea convention. The convention is designed to protect the 
world's fisheries, stop the pollution of oceans and advance the idea 
that ocean resources belong to humanity and all of humanity is 
entitled to share in their benefit and use.
<P>
	In the late seventies and early eighties, Canada was a leader in 
preparing this convention and among the first to sign it. To come 
into effect, the law of the sea convention needs to be signed and 
ratified by 60 countries. This was accomplished on November 16, 
1994. In total 92 states have ratified the convention. China has 
recently stated its intention to ratify and Spain is expected to do the 
same by the end of June.
<P>
<B>(2130)</B>
<P>
	In Canada the speech from the throne restated the government's 
intent to ratify the law of the sea, but this has yet to occur despite a 
commitment in the red book, despite a recommendation in the 1994 
report of the special joint committee of the House of Commons and 
the Senate reviewing Canadian foreign policy, and despite two 
commitments in the House by the former minister of foreign 
affairs. Twice the former minister said ratification by Canada was 
imminent.
<P>
	On April 29 of this year the present minister linked the 
ratification of the law of the sea convention to the importance of 
ratifying another convention, the convention on straddling stocks, 
which also deals with the protection of fisheries and oceans. 
However, there seems to be a reluctance within government to 
understand that ratifying the law of the sea is a necessary first step 
in protecting Canada's fisheries and oceans. Once the law of the sea 
is ratified Canada will gain the necessary credibility to help ensure 
the straddling stocks convention is ratified by a sufficient number 
of states so as to be brought into force.
<P>
	The lack of understanding does not seem to rest with the 
Department of Foreign Affairs. It seems to rest with the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans for some strange reason. In 
other words, there seems to be an impasse between these two 
departments which is damaging and embarrassing to Canada 
abroad.
<P>
	Tonight I ask the parliamentary secretary to the minister when 
this impasse will be broken. Surely now that 92 nations have 
ratified the law of the sea, including Australia and France, Canada 
should act. Ratification is long overdue. Our absence from the 
international community is damaging. A red book and a throne 
speech promise has been made. What are we waiting for?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure 
tonight to respond on behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs to 
my colleague from Davenport, a great environmentalist and a 
person who is concerned by and large about the quality of life for 
all human beings on the planet.
<P>
	Canada was one of the most active participants in the 
negotiations of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the 
Sea, which it signed in 1982. Canada's participation in the 
convention stemmed from its general support for the rule of law 
and multilateral process and its extensive coastlines and substantial 
continental shelf.
<P>
	For many years Canada did not ratify the convention due to 
problems with the provisions on the exploitation of the deep sea 
bed. These problems were resolved by an agreement signed by 
Canada on July 29, 1994.
<P>
	While the convention recognizes the exclusive authority of the 
coastal state to manage and conserve living resources in the 
exclusive economic zone, its provisions on the conservation and 
management of high seas fish stocks were vague and incomplete. 
From 1993 to 1995 Canada played a key role in the development of 
the UN agreement on straddling fish stocks and highly migratory 
fish stocks. This agreement, signed by Canada on December 4, 
1995, strengthens and supplements the high sea fisheries 
provisions of the convention.
<P>
	The government is committed to the ratification of the 
convention, which will enable Canada to continue to defend its 
interests in future developments in the law of the sea, in particular 
through participation in the institutions created by the convention.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3479"> 3479 </A></B>
<P>
	It is a longstanding Canadian practice before proceeding with 
ratification to first to put in place legislation needed to implement 
the terms of an international agreement. This is to avoid a situation 
in which Canada would be in breach of its obligations under the 
agreement upon ratification.
<P>
	On February 27, 1996 the government announced in the speech 
from the throne that the legislation to ratify both the convention 
and the agreement will be presented to Parliament.
<P>
	The Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, in 
consultation with the Department of Justice and other affected 
departments, is actively engaged in the preparation of draft 
legislation which will enable Canada to ratify the convention. 
Officials are currently working to resolve the outstanding issues. 
We anticipate the tabling of the bill to implement the convention in 
the coming months.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. The House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 2.00 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 9.35 p.m.)
