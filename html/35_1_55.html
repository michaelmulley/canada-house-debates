<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CROWNLIABILITYANDPROCEEDINGSACT">CROWN LIABILITY AND PROCEEDINGS ACT</A></H3>
	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-4, an act 
to amend the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, as reported 
(without amendment) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (for the Minister of Justice)</B> 
moved that the bill be concurred in.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud (for the Minister of Justice)</B> moved that the 
bill be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to rise 
today to participate in the third reading debate on this bill, an act 
to amend the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act.
<P>
	This legislation ensures that trade sanctions cannot be taken 
against Canada under the North American free trade agreement 
on environmental co-operation or the North American 
agreement on labour co-operation.
<P>
	Bill C-4 is the only legislative measure necessary for Canada 
to fulfil our obligations under these agreements.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These agreements improve the NAFTA provisions on the 
environment and labour. They guarantee that our objective to 
increase trade is not achieved at the expense of our environment 
and our workers.
<P>
	If adopted, this legislation would guarantee that trade 
sanctions cannot be taken against Canada in connection with 
environmental or labour matters covered by NAFTA.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Thanks to this bill, any potential fines made against Canada 
by a panel will be enforced by our own domestic courts.
<P>
	If Canada, the United States or Mexico fail to enforce their 
environmental and labour laws, the agreements contain an 
effective dispute settlement mechanism. It allows for the 
establishment of a panel to investigate and make a 
determination.
<P>
	If a panel determines a country has demonstrated a persistent 
pattern of failure to enforce its law, it may require the offending 
country to adopt an action plan to correct the problems. If the 
country fails to do so, the panel could also impose a fine or what 
the agreement terms a monetary enforcement assessment.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	The legislation before us today will permit the Federal Court 
of Canada to enforce any panel determination which may be 
made against Canada if, and only if we persistently fail to 
effectively enforce our environmental and labour laws. Of 
course that is not something we expect to ever happen.
<P>
	If a dispute settlement panel levies fines against the United 
States or Mexico for failure to correct their enforcement 
problems, those countries will face a suspension of NAFTA 
benefit or trade sanctions equivalent to the size of the unpaid 
penalty.
<P>
	Canada views such trade sanctions would constitute barriers 
of the very kind that the NAFTA was designed to eliminate.
<P>
	These agreements protect Canada's environmental and labour 
interests in relation to the North American free trade agreement. 
They effectively strengthen and expand important commitments 
made by Canada, the United States and Mexico.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are committed to helping to promote environmentally 
sustainable growth and to promoting workers' rights throughout 
North America.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Through the North American agreement on environmental 
co-operation we have created a commission to effect close and 
ongoing co-operation. For example, on March 23 the Minister 
of the Environment participated in the inaugural meeting of the 
commission in Vancouver with her counterparts from the United 
States and Mexico.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3380"> 3380 </A></B>
<P>
	The ministers at that time approved a process to establish the 
commission and the co-operative work program for the first 
year. They agreed that the commission's activities will be 
conducted in an open and transparent manner.
<P>
	The environment ministers from Canada, the United States 
and Mexico will oversee the work of the commission to ensure it 
meets its goals; to promote sustainable development, to develop 
and enforce environmental regulations and to resolve disputes if 
laws are not upheld.
<P>
	The commission will promote a work plan based on areas of 
priority. They include limits on specific pollutants, assessments 
of projects with transboundary implications and reciprocal court 
access. As well, the commission will work with the free trade 
commission to achieve the environmental goals of the NAFTA 
agreement.
<P>
	Steady progress has been made on the establishment of the 
labour commission formed under the North American 
agreement on labour co-operation. Also on March 21 in 
Washington the Minister of Human Resources Development met 
with his American and Mexican counterparts to establish the 
co-operative work plan of the labour commission.
<P>
	The ministers discussed how they intend to achieve the 
objectives of the labour agreement and reviewed a number of 
practical measures related to the establishment of the 
commission's organizational structure. At that time they 
reiterated their commitment to work together on a program of 
trilateral co-operative activities.
<P>
	The labour commission will give effect to the promise in the 
preamble to the North American free trade agreement to 
``improve conditions and living standards'' and as well ``to 
protect, enhance and enforce basic workers' rights''. The 
agreement, founded on close and ongoing co-operation among 
the three countries, ensures that laws governing health and 
safety, child labour and minimum wage standards are upheld.
<P>
	They go well beyond co-operation. They commit each 
country to the domestic enforcement of domestic environmental 
and labour laws. This means that no country may use lax 
enforcement of its laws to gain an unfair arrangement or trade 
advantage.
<P>
	I can report that negotiations to work out federal-provincial 
arrangements on implementing the environment and labour 
agreements in Canada are proceeding on a co-operative and 
constructive footing.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	These agreements are designed to protect the environment 
and workers' rights, important issues for the provinces. Canada 
will submit to its NAFTA partners a list of provinces 
participating in the agreement when negotiations with the 
provinces have been completed.
<P>
	It is my firm belief that the North American free trade 
agreement has been considerably strengthened and improved as 
a result of the precedent setting side agreement. The government 
is satisfied that the NAFTA will advance Canadian trade policy 
objectives.
<P>
	As well the agreement will provide a valuable incentive for 
Canadian producers, exporters and investors to look beyond 
their traditional backyards to Mexico and the rest of Latin 
America as well as to the markets of Europe and Asia.
<P>
	The agreement as strengthened and improved illustrates that 
international trade agreements can be multifaceted and more 
attuned to the realities of the 1990s.
<P>
	It is in Canada's best interests to proceed with the passage of 
this bill. Not only will it protect Canada's international trade 
interest but also our environmental goals and the rights of our 
workers.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to rise in the House today to speak to 
Bill C-4, an act to amend the Crown Liability and Proceedings 
Act. Notwithstanding its vague and somewhat misleading title, 
this is a relatively simple bill. It refers to the so-called side 
agreements to the North American free trade agreement.
<P>
	On March 15, in the debate on the Canadian foreign policy 
review process, I commented as follows, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is important to point out that this globalization is an inescapable 
phenomenon. It is a tendency which affects the economy of all countries, 
whether they are G-7 members or developing nations. To try to escape this 
reality would be like ignoring the emergence of new means of communication 
and production; in other words, it would be tantamount to ignoring the changes 
that have occurred in our economic environment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I also stated the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-trade liberalization and market globalization seem to be a trend, an 
irreversible phenomenon. The prosperity of nations will depend more and more 
on international trade. It is a fact that will be part of Canada's economic reality 
from now on.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is therefore not surprising that developments took us so 
quickly from the initial signing of the free trade agreement 
between Canada and the United States to the signing of the 
North American free trade agreement.
<P>
	I was in Washington yesterday with several Canadian 
colleagues to meet members of the U.S. steel caucus and to 
discuss the need for our governments to provide formal 
recognition of the fact that the North American steel market is 
already well on its way to being integrated.
<P>
	We also had an opportunity to meet representatives of the 
Canadian and U.S. steel industry who shared with us their 
concerns and expectations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3381"> 3381 </A></B>
<P>
	Representatives of the American Iron and Steel Institute, 
which includes most Canadian, American and Mexican steel 
mills, gave us, for our information, a press release published 
on July 8, 1992, in which the North American Steel Council, 
which is a member of the American Iron and Steel Institute, 
explained its position on NAFTA.
<P>
	One paragraph of this press release was about the concerns 
shared by all members of the American Iron and Steel Institute, 
and I would like to read this very briefly, if I may, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``On the interplay between the NAFTA and the environment 
the NASC's Canadian, Mexican and U.S. members share 
common concerns. We support continued parallel talks by our 
governments on environmental standards and enforcement 
levels, as well as on other so-called social issues as worker 
health and safety standards''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Reflecting the concerns shared by a substantial part of the 
U.S. public, U.S. President Bill Clinton made a commitment to 
negotiate and conclude side agreements on these two items 
before NAFTA was passed by Congress. After hasty 
negotiations, the three partners on September 14, 1993, signed 
two parallel agreements to NAFTA: the North American 
agreement on environmental co-operation between the 
governments of Canada, the United States and Mexico, and the 
North American agreement on labor co-operation, between the 
same three governments.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	These side agreements gave rise to two new international 
institutions, namely the commission for environmental 
co-operation and the commission for labor co-operation.
<P>
	Incidentally, several days ago, the government announced 
that the NAFTA commission for environmental co-operation 
would be established in Montreal. The English-language media 
and some other interested parties immediately criticized the 
government's choice, although it was quite logical and justified.
<P>
	Need we repeat that Quebec is the only Canadian province 
which has promised to endorse the parallel accords on labour 
and the environment-but only, I wish to point out-after 
serious negotiations between Quebec and Ottawa?
<P>
	The reasons that Quebec wants so much to be at the leading 
edge of international trade practices could not be more obvious: 
Quebec exports almost 16 per cent of its $160 billion GDP and 
these exports account for 30 per cent of our jobs. Furthermore, 
76 per cent of Quebec's exports go to the United States.
<P>
	Establishing the commission in a place that is hostile to its 
purpose would certainly not make for efficient operation. In 
addition, the government's choice is justified because Montreal 
is an international city which is already home to some 30 
international organizations, including ICAO and IATA. The 
various levels of government have made great efforts to attract 
international organizations to Montreal.
<P>
	Finally, Montreal is a cosmopolitan city which has the 
infrastructure needed for such organizations. It has a large 
English-speaking community and Spanish is increasingly 
spoken there every day by a rapidly growing Hispanic 
community.
<P>
	For all these reasons and many more, Quebec's business 
community and politicians were right to lobby hard to have the 
commission for environmental co-operation located in 
Montreal.
<P>
	That said, I do not intend to say any more on the commission 
for environmental co-operation and the commission for labor 
co-operation than Bill C-4 itself does.
<P>
	To see what this bill is all about, it is first of all necessary to 
put it in perspective. It then becomes apparent that it partially 
meets some very worthy overall objectives, since it ultimately 
seeks to protect the rights of our working people as well as our 
natural sites and our environment.
<P>
	As I said earlier, Bill C-4 seeks to make effective in Canada 
the provisions contained in the parallel accords concluded by 
the three NAFTA signatory countries on labour and the 
environment. As a document prepared by the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade for members of the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
says, these parallel accords encourage cooperation between 
Canada, the United States and Mexico on the environment and 
labour; commit the parties to promote compliance with and 
enforcement of their environmental and labour laws and 
regulations; and advocate higher standards in these two areas.
<P>
	For at least two centuries, workers in Quebec and Canada 
have fought for laws to protect themselves from abuse by 
employers and governments. These struggles were hard and at 
times bitter. Nevertheless, workers succeeded in having their 
rights entrenched in laws which, in a sense, are now an integral 
part of life in Quebec and Canada; however, such is not the case 
in all countries. For social or historic reasons, workers' rights 
have not advanced at the same rate and in the same way 
everywhere.
<P>
	Need we add that this is also true of the environment, where 
the gains made are even more fragile? Indeed, although the 
progress made in labour relations is fairly well established, this 
is certainly not true of environmental protection, where too 
often and even recently we have seen governments bow to the 
laws of the market, to the detriment of the laws of nature.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3382"> 3382 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	At any rate, at the 1992 earth summit, there was certainly no 
great show of unfailing willingness on the part of NAFTA 
partners to work together to solve their environmental 
problems. Under no circumstances must trade agreements 
between countries, however substantial they may be, adversely 
affect either the vested rights of our workers or our 
environment.
<P>
	I am convinced however that certain fly-by-night businesses 
have tried to use the elimination of trade barriers to explain to 
their workers and the authorities the relaxation of labour and 
biophysical environment protection standards.
<P>
	That is why the NAFTA side deals provide for mechanisms 
ultimately intended, on the one hand, to prevent businesses from 
taking advantage of legal differences between countries and, on 
the other hand, to force governments to maintain and enforce 
existing legislation and, ideally, encourage the various 
countries to pass legislation that is yet more progressive and 
stringent. Any downgrading of working conditions and labour 
standards will not be tolerated by the Bloc Quebecois, nor by the 
people of Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	Of course, the temptation is there to restore a number of trade 
barriers or at least to adopt once again a negative attitude toward 
free trade as an easy way to solve the problem. And some 
provincial governments seem to like the idea. However, neither 
the current federal government nor the Bloc Quebecois, nor the 
government of Quebec for that matter, consider that approach to 
be realistic or beneficial.
<P>
	For now, Bill C-4 appears to be a step toward the ultimate 
goal of preventing environmental and social ``dumping'' in 
cases where trading partners are on a very unequal footing in 
economic and legislative terms. Note that such an approach has 
created pitfalls that governments must avoid at all costs, but I 
will comment on that later on.
<P>
	Bill C-4 enables a panel, an arbitration panel convened under 
article 24 of the environmental co-operation agreement or 
article 29 of the labor co-operation agreement to require either 
partner to effectively enforce its own environmental or labour 
laws.
<P>
	Panel determinations will have the same status as an order of 
the Federal Court. As indicated in the explanatory notes, the 
enactment of Bill C-4 ``amends the Crown Liability and 
Proceedings Act so as to permit domestic enforcement by the 
Federal Court of Canada of any panel determination that is 
addressed to the Crown in right of Canada'', should the latter 
fail to enforce its environmental or labour legislation.
<P>
	In other words, Bill C-4 is a step in the right direction in that 
it prevents the legislative gap between the three NAFTA 
signatories from widening further. If Canadian businesses 
decide to set up abroad, it will not be in hope of benefiting from 
some relaxation of environmental standards or of being able to 
exploit a poorly protected labour force. The contrary is also 
possible, but the chances of that happening are much slimmer, 
believe me.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as you can see, the disparity between our three 
countries' social and environmental standards is in no way 
expected to increase as a result of such a measure. On the 
contrary, under article 3 of each side deal, the three signatory 
states agree to improve and strengthen existing legislation. In 
the event of non-compliance, the panel may assess the party in 
default, through an order of the Federal Court, a fine of up to $20 
million US. The United States and Mexico could even have trade 
sanctions taken against them, while no such sanctions can be 
taken against Canada or any of its provinces under the 
agreement.
<P>
	All in all, however, I would say that the positive aspects of 
this bill tend to eclipse the less positive ones. The first of these 
not-so-positive aspects of this middle-of-the-road solution 
that Canada has given its support to is no doubt the fact that the 
side deals have achieved no significant reduction in the 
observable legislative differences between the three NAFTA 
partners with respect to environment and labour.
<P>
	This means that businesses could be tempted to take 
advantage of the fact that, in many cases, our trading partners' 
standards are more flexible than ours.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	Admittedly, all parties expressed their willingness to improve 
their legislation, but this expression of faith, although noted in 
the agreement and seemingly sincere, is no guarantee 
whatsoever that positive changes will in fact occur.
<P>
	Moreover, we are all becoming better acquainted with the 
legendary propensity of our neighbours to the South to turn to 
the courts at the slightest little thing. Following the signing of 
the free trade agreement, Canadians were surprised indeed to 
see the Americans rush to the trade tribunals, apparently to tie 
them up with business as quickly as possible. Since they have 
not been shy about doing so since the implementation of the free 
trade agreement, there is reason to think that they will adopt the 
same course of action, if at all possible, in the case of the 
NAFTA and its side agreements.
<P>
	Therefore, it is vitally important that we make our partners 
understand that this kind of practice is totally unacceptable. 
Special groups that hand down binding decisions must not 
become, quite involuntarily at that, institutions at the service of 
one NAFTA partner or another.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3383"> 3383 </A></B>
<P>
	Another of the problems caused by these side agreements has 
to do with the unique features of Canadian federalism. 
Regardless of what this centralist government may believe, 
labour and environment are largely areas of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	While Ottawa disregarded Quebec's willingness to negotiate 
agreements in the case of the free trade agreement, it is hardly in 
a position here to take a similar approach in the case of side 
agreements. Discussions are in progress right now between 
federal and Quebec officials. According to the information we 
have received thus far, these discussions appear to be moving 
along well.
<P>
	The same apparently cannot be said for the other provinces. 
From the very beginning, Ontario and British Columbia have 
made no secret of their opposition to all side agreements. To 
show its discontent, Ontario has threatened on several occasions 
to ask the Supreme Court to declare the government's actions in 
this matter unconstitutional.
<P>
	Side agreements which for now apply only in areas of federal 
jurisdiction are not likely to apply to all provinces equally 
anytime soon.
<P>
	If our partners did not understand the nature, or should I say 
the confused nature, of the Canadian federation, well now is 
certainly their chance to get a clearer picture of the situation. 
Although they have expressly stated that they would like the 
federal government to conclude agreements with the provinces, 
their wish does not seem to have been universally heard.
<P>
	Regardless, Mr. Speaker, we will enthusiastically support this 
bill in view of the arguments presented and the underlying 
principles which gave rise to it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we 
are taking a last look at Bill C-4 as it gets third reading.
<P>
	This bill was introduced by the government on January 26 and 
I spoke to it at length a few days later. At that time I said the 
Reform Party supported this bill although we did have some 
concerns about there being fair representation on the panel. We 
also wondered whether there should be an appeal process. These 
concerns were addressed to our satisfaction in committee.
<P>
	I can now say that I and the Reform Party fully support this 
bill which will bring into Canadian law an enforcement 
mechanism established under the NAFTA side agreements on 
environmental and labour co-operation.
<P>
	In the area of environmental co-operation we will be assured 
that there will be strengthened environmental co-operation in 
North America. We will be assured of sustainable development 
on a continental basis and of effective compliance with domestic 
and environmental law.
<P>
	In the area of labour co-operation we look forward to 
improved working conditions and living standards in Canada, 
the United States and Mexico, and the protection, enhancement 
and enforcement of basic workers' rights.
<P>
	The trade pacts we have signed recently are of crucial 
importance to Canada since they help us gain better access to 
foreign markets. The sooner we get these trade pacts 
implemented the better.
<P>
	Naturally there will be irritants as these agreements become 
operational. These will have to be addressed as they come up 
and I am confident they will do so.
<P>
	We are doing the right thing by passing the bill quickly and 
moving on with the implementation of NAFTA. However there 
is still much work for the government to do to make it possible 
for business to take advantage of these trade opportunities.
<P>
	The most important one is to reduce government spending so 
that we can eventually begin to lower taxes in Canada, which is 
among the highest taxed countries in the industrial world.
<P>
	The second one is to eliminate the many interprovincial trade 
barriers that exist in Canada. I know these trade barriers are 
being discussed among federal and provincial governments 
now. I urge these governments to move quickly and without 
hesitation in these areas.
<P>
	We are making great strides in securing our prosperity by 
making trade deals abroad. Let us see whether we have the same 
resolve to make the same breakthrough at home.
<P>
	Canada is a trading nation. We support the bill and hope that 
we will benefit from the many opportunities this trade deal 
brings to Canadians.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the third time and passed.)

Canadian taxpayers were angered to awake this morning to find 
a story in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> outlining the federal 
government's intentions to invest $4.8 million of their 
hard-earned dollars on a theme park in the Prime Minister's 
home town.
<P>
	This project, which I suggest they call Jean's World, calls into 
question the new politics that were promised in the Liberal red 
book by continuing the tradition of rewarding the Prime 
Minister's home ridings with useless patronage projects.
<P>
	I remind the members opposite of how loudly they bleated 
when Brian Mulroney built the patronage prison in Baie 
Comeau. In comparison, the reaction from the members

<P>
	Between 1941 and 1971 approximately 200,000 to 400,000 
pregnant Canadian women were prescribed the synthetic

their sons and daughters are at risk of health problems related to 
DES exposure.
<P>
	DES Action Canada is a national non-profit consumer health 
organization that has worked since 1982 to alert Canadians of 
the potential dangers of DES. Most of the attention to date has 
focused on DES mothers who are at an increased risk of breast 
cancer and on daughters who may suffer from infertility or even 
cancer.
<P>
	This year DES Action Canada will try to alert as many DES 
exposed women as possible.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Just two weeks from the date initially scheduled by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development to table his action 
plan concerning social program reform, the minister says that he 
``is not ready''.
<P>
	Also, yesterday a newspaper quoted the Minister of Finance 
who said: ``Federal ministers, as well as Quebec's Minister of 
Finance, have agreed on a moratorium regarding social security 
reform''.
<P>
	Will the Deputy Prime Minister confirm that the Minister of 
Human Resources Development is improvising his reform and 
that, at the Minister of Finance's request, the government has 
decided to impose a moratorium?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, what we said and what 
we discussed last January with the finance ministers, is that 
there will be no cuts, there will be no freeze in transfers to 
provinces for a period of two years, precisely to give the 
Minister of Human Resources Development time to discuss and 
negotiate the necessary reforms with his counterparts.
<P>
	The situation is very clear: We have decided on a moratorium 
to have a period of discussion and negotiation. In fact, this 
exercise has already been launched by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development.

<P>
	I would like to know if she agrees with her colleague, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, who said earlier this 
week that the duplications in the main power sector are costing 
$300 million to the Quebec taxpayers.
<P>
	I would like to know if she maintains the assertion made by 
her colleague.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada 
is concerned with duplication at every level.
<P>
	As a matter of fact we are working very hard with the province 
of Quebec and other provinces on harmonization of 
environmental laws. We are working very hard on 
harmonization of laws relating to trade. We are working very 
hard at breaking down the barriers between provinces.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister has not really answered the 
question. Will she confirm whether or not the figure of some 
$300 million quoted by the Quebec government is true, 
especially considering that the strategy regarding the youth 
program will create more duplication and overlap?
<P>
	Will the Deputy Prime Minister and her government pledge to 
release the studies to which the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs referred, precisely to downplay duplication and overlap 
between Ottawa and the provinces, so that all members of this 
House are able to put a figure on the cost of Canadian 
federalism, and so that, as the Liberals promised in their red 
book, the whole negotiating process involving the provinces and 
the federal government can be more transparent?
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Is the Deputy Prime Minister prepared to release those 
studies, as did the Quebec government in the case of the 
Bélanger-Campeau commission, as did the Liberal Party of 
Quebec, which is of course pro- federalist, and as did the Parti 
Quebecois in that province? Will you release these studies?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, the federal government 
works very hard with all the provinces to reduce overlap in every 
sector, including human resources and the environment.
<P>
	I also said that the work done by my colleague, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, aims precisely at determining costs 
and reducing those costs for all taxpayers.
<P>
	The hon. member asked about the cost of federalism. I think 
that, instead of complaining like he does about every initiative 
taken by the government, he should tell Quebecers about the 
cost of separation.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> 
Yesterday, we learned that the Hibernia megaproject was 
swallowing up even more money.
<P>
	The developers are now projecting cost overruns of almost $1 
billion on top of the original $5.2 billion price tag. This 
represents an increase in costs of close to 20 per cent. An 
additional $85 million in federal input and $175 millions more 
in loans may be required. A lot of pressure is being put on the 
government to pump more money into this white elephant of the 
nineties.
<P>
	Given the sad state of our public finances, is the Deputy Prime 
Minister prepared to make a commitment that the government 
will not invest a penny more in Hibernia and that this massive 
drain on public funds will stop, since the potential profitability 
of this megaproject, which the <I>Globe and Mail</I> has called a real 
tragedy, is being challenged?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Natural Resources):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all we 
should realize that these are preliminary numbers and 
preliminary estimates and that more detailed work is being 
done.
<P>
	We have representatives on the board who are working to 
monitor the situation. We have contractual obligations as well 
that were entered into two years ago and we will have to honour 
those commitments. More money will be flowing to this project 
if it has an overrun.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a supplementary question. In that case, will the 
Deputy Prime Minister undertake to ensure that Parliament will 
conduct a detailed analysis of the financing, profitability and 
industrial benefits of Hibernia before extending any more 
financial assistance?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, what is unfortunate in this 
situation is that the Bloc members, ever since the beginning of 
this new session, have been demanding job creation programs, 
and that is what we are trying to do.
<P>
	Before asking us to axe Hibernia, I think the hon. member 
should take a look at who stands to benefit from these contracts? 
Does he realize that 34 Quebec companies are involved in the 
project? SNC Lavallin, MIL Davie, Monenco, Janin 
Construction, and Atlas Construction have all obtained 
contracts, following the commitment on the part of the federal 
government to ensure that the project is 65 per cent Canadian?
<P>
	Does the hon. member want the federal government to break 
its commitment to SNC Lavallin, Monenco, Atlas and other 
private companies that need contracts from all over Canada?

Speaker, my question is also regarding white elephants which do 
nothing in comparison to live elephants that are able to walk.
<P>
	The Hibernia project is at least a year behind schedule and at 
least $1 billion over budget. Canadian taxpayers are directly at 
risk both through government commitments and through 
Petro-Canada. The Minister of Natural Resources has already 
said that Canadians are on the hook for another $85 million.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	In light of the fact that government has been able to back out 
of the Pearson airport deal and from the EH-101 contract, can 
the Deputy Prime Minister guarantee that the federal 
government will not spend another cent of taxpayer money on 
this boondoggle?
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Natural Resources):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is passing 
strange that the member would raise this particular matter when 
we know full well that his leader has indicated this project is too 
far along to back out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the leader of the Reform Party said the problem is that 
governments keep getting themselves in deeper and deeper and 
the sooner we extricate ourselves from these types of 
mismanaged projects the better.
<P>
	When is the government going to learn? Hibernia is joining 
the Bricklin auto plant, the Mirabel airport, and now the 
Lloydminster upgrader has run out of operating funds. These are 
all entering the white elephant hall of fame.
<P>
	What would have been the benefit to Canada's unemployed if 
the money spent on so-called megaprojects had been directed to 
deficit reduction, leading to lower taxes and thereby creating 
real jobs?
<P>
	When will the government come to its senses and rescue 
taxpayers from the Hibernia project before it sinks?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member makes the comparison with Pearson 
airport and other projects. These are projects that had not begun, 
where hundreds of millions, or billions of dollars had not yet 
been spent, and where 5,300 Canadians are currently employed.
<P>
	The policy of the Reform Party is, notwithstanding 
expenditures of billions already under way, to shut down a 
project and to throw away those billions, to throw away the lives 
of 5,300 Canadians who are currently employed and to bankrupt 
hundreds of secondary supply companies currently involved in 
this project.
<P>
	Let me complete my answer by quoting Wood Gundy which 
has done an independent assessment of this project: ``We 
believe that the upside potential from developing Hibernia and 
the returns that should be generated from the project offset the 
levels of risk that currently exist''.
<P>
	The assessment went on to compare this project with the 
Syncrude project of western Canada which now profitably 
produces approximately 12 per cent of the total Canadian 
production.
<P>
	We believe in the west, we believe in the east, we believe in 
people. We do not abandon Canadians or projects halfway 
completed in the heartless fashion as proposed by this so-called 
Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I get really concerned when I hear the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans answering a question on megaprojects.
<P>
	I am trying to bring to the attention of the government the 
boondoggles it is involved in. I wonder why the Prime Minister 
is preparing to waste $4.8 million tax dollars on a patronage 
park in his home riding. It is my understanding that perhaps the 
feature attraction will be a fantasyland ride called debt 
mountain.
<P>
	Why is the Deputy Prime Minister ignoring a federal study 
which says that just like the failed humour museum in Montreal, 
the patronage park is also a bad joke?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I get concerned when I hear 
the leader of the Reform Party claiming to speak on behalf of 
Quebecers.
<P>
	From the point of view of the government we are very happy 
that the minister who is the spokesperson for this project 
happens to be a minister who is from Newfoundland and who 
understands how beneficial the Hibernia project can be for not 
only Newfoundlanders but for those 34 Quebec companies that 
are receiving $800 million in contracts, those literally millions 
of other dollars in contracts that are going out across the 
country.
<P>
	Frankly, we on this side of the House are not going to 
apologize for creating jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	Yesterday for the first time in the House the Reform Party 
started asking questions about the real issue that touches 
Canadians, and that is jobs. When the government through the 
minister responsible for FORD-Q or through the ministers 
responsible for energy or through the ministers responsible for 
industry and environment are out there creating jobs we do not 
expect to take flack from the Reform Party.

statement if the House is willing.
<P>
	With respect to the position of the Russian government, as 
you know, Mr. Speaker, it has had some reservations on the 
whole question of broadening air strikes in the former Yugoslav 
republic of Bosnia. We have no information as of this moment as

<P>
	Our military people in Brussels will be consulted as to the

<P>
	With respect to the question of the safety of our troops, we did 
acknowledge yesterday that we have taken some precautions in 
and around our base in Visoko so that we do not unnecessarily 
expose our troops to the Bosnian Serb lines. However I should 
say that this does not mean, contrary to some media reports, that 
our troops are hunkered down in the base in Visoko. They are

their own durum shortage and have put a $52 per tonne export 
tax on it to keep theirs at home.

	Canadian apple growers are looking to this government for 
action to protect them from wholesale dumping by the

inequity and avert a crisis in the snow crab fishery in the Gulf of

<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the member for his question. Indeed, he 
has brought to the attention of the House one of the more 
difficult situations in Atlantic Canada. That is the incredible 
irony in the comparison between those who have plenty and 
those who have very little or nothing. It is causing great tensions 
in our communities. Frankly, in some communities in the

with each other. None of us want to see that in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	I have spoken to representatives of both the crab fleet and 
representatives of groundfishermen in the last 24 hours from 
Quebec, New Brunswick and elsewhere in the region. The 
fishermen have begun a dialogue across the gear sectors. The 
fishermen are suggesting they will attempt to reach a means of 
seeing a better sharing of the wealth of the resource in question.

to understand what the country is all about, he had better not

<P>
	One of the things we did in making our decision about the 
centre was that we looked at all applicants. We looked at the 
criteria that we established and we made a decision based on our 
best political and environmental advice.
<P>
	The reality is that any decision made by a government is a 
decision that involves politics. The difference between this

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

the leader of the Reform Party is also political.
<P>
	The reality is that if one follows the criteria of the member 
and suggests that the centre should have gone to Toronto 
because it has the most number of flights, every single thing 
done by every ministry in the government should go to Toronto. 
Toronto has more direct flights to all parts of the United States

A month ago, an adjudicator at the labour court in the Vancouver 
area handed down a ruling ordering Canada Post Corporation to 
guarantee the social benefits of the same-sex spouse of one of 
its employees. We heard that the Minister of Justice did not 
intend to appeal this ruling, which caused considerable 
consternation in the gay community and among all those with a 
concern for human rights.
<P>

government's plans are with respect to extending guarantees and 
recognition of the rights of same-sex spouses?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, I believe the Minister of 
Justice said he was not prepared to proceed with an appeal in 
each case. In fact, he gave instructions that in some cases where 
an appeal had been made, the appeals should not be pursued.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with all due respect for the Deputy Prime Minister, if 
this had been a question on an examination, she would have 
failed her exam.
<P>
	May I remind the Deputy Prime Minister that the Minister of 
Justice promised to proceed with a thorough review of the 
Canadian Human Rights Act and that on several occasions 
during the election campaign, her government repeatedly made 
a commitment to recognize sexual orientation as grounds for 
discrimination. When will this government stop its double talk

legislation that will guarantee an end to discrimination and 
recognize the rights of same-sex spouses?

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development or for whomever the government chooses to 
answer.
<P>
	The red ink book advocates an extensive increase in the 
number of child care spaces available. The government funding 
for this service will be paid by individual taxpayers whether or 
not they use it. Government funded day care increases the tax 
burden on Canadians and will further discriminate against 
families who choose to be single income households.
<P>
	Does the government recognize that such a proposal will force 
more parents to send their children to day care even if they 
would prefer to stay home with them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday the member's 
colleague was asking the government what we could do to get 
people working.
<P>
	Obviously one of the things we could do to get people working 
is to ensure that they have proper support for their children when 
in fact they are out in the paid workforce. I happen to believe 
that women who work at home are working every bit as hard so I 
specify the paid workforce.
<P>
	However, for the member to suggest the government pull out 
of child care funding, it would take the case of the Canadian 
economy back decades. At the moment child care spaces across 
the country are set up by provincial governments with the 
financial assistance of the federal government directly to those 
families, primarily single income mother led families who 
without the assistance would not be able to go out into the paid 
labour force.
<P>
	The member suggests that for some people it is not necessary. 
The same thing holds true for health care. Would he like to 
abolish national health care or education?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Deputy Prime Minister misses the point. I do not advocate 
withdrawing funds or inhibiting people from going to work.
<P>
	A voucher system would allow parents to stay home with their 
children or to send them to the most suitable day care. It would 
also direct public assistance to those who really need it.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	Will the Deputy Prime Minister and the government consider 
the introduction of a child care voucher system rather than 
universal day care?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

government that tells me where I have to send my child for child 
care. We do live in a free country.
<P>
	At the moment what this government has said is that when it 
comes to employment outside the home obviously child care is 
an important component of any initiative to help people get out 
to work. Our government intends to meet its commitments in the 
red book.
<P>

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, today is Earth Day in 
Canada, a day that we have set aside to join with people around 
the world in making our own personal contribution to the 
well-being of our environment.
<P>
	Since Earth Day was first celebrated in Canada on April 22 
four years ago, the grassroots support for this event has grown so 
rapidly it now involves nearly one in three Canadians in some 
form of environmental activity. There is much energy, 
enthusiasm and support for greening our way of life.
<P>
	More than ever before Canadians are aware of our natural 
environment and we are doing something to make sure that what 
we now enjoy can be passed on to our children and to their 
children. By planting a tree, composting kitchen waste, reusing 
shopping bags, recycling cans, returning bottles and demanding 
less packaging from producers, Canadians are showing that we 
want governments to sit up and take notice.
<P>
	In fact, recent surveys have shown that 60 per cent of 
Canadians support more spending for environmental protection. 
Industry too is quickly coming to realize that green planning and 
green operations mean green savings and green bucks.
<P>
	Almost every sector of our economy now realizes that 
consumer demand means that by producing a product in an 
environmentally friendly manner you can have the critical 
competitive edge.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Business and industry, for their part, are asking the 
government to put its house in order. They need our 
co-operation as well as clear, specific directions to achieve our 
environmental objectives.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	I am proud to announce to this House and to all Canadians that 
our government is answering the call. Canadians can stand up 
and say that their federal government is the first green 
government in our country.
<P>
	Three former federal environment ministers currently sit in 
this House, along with a former provincial environment 
minister. Two of these people are leaders of their respective 
parties.
<P>
	We are also fortunate to have the highly qualified Chairman of 
the House of Commons Standing Committee on Environment 
and Sustainable Development and finally, my parliamentary 
secretary who is absolutely indispensable to me.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians can also feel secure that there is environmental 
leadership within their government. We are proud to have a 
Prime Minister who understands that environment is an integral 
part of job creation and growth and who made sustainable 
development an underlying theme of our red book.
<P>
	Our Prime Minister appointed our former Speaker, the one 
who initiated the greening of the Hill program, to be our 
ambassador for the environment to the world. We have a Prime 
Minister who created more national parks than any other 
minister in the history of Canada. We have a Prime Minister who 
announced clearly on his first international trip that Canada's 
water is not for sale.
<P>
	Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs understands that we 
must work globally to attack environmental degradation and 
make sure that the global environment facility, the GEF, and the 
Montreal protocol receive Canada's fair contribution.
<P>
	Our minister responsible for infrastructure made water and 
sewer upgrades, environmentally friendly projects, an 
important part of our national infrastructure program.
<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans moved quickly to fulfil 
promises made about Kemano and has also recognized that 
eco-tourism can play an important role in the revitalization of 
our economy.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development and the 
secretary of state for youth have announced a plan to involve 
youth in environmental training programs to help us get 
environmental industries on the cutting edge of the world 
community.
<P>
	My colleague, the Minister for Natural Resources, has been 
actively promoting sustainable development in her natural 
resource sector. She has also been working very hard on energy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3397"> 3397 </A></B>
<P>
efficiencies, an integral component of any future use of energy 
when we realize that we are the most energy consuming country 
in the world. Her  department's model forest program provides a 
model for sustainable forest management.
<P>
	She has also recently tabled the first report to Parliament on 
the Energy Efficiency Act which outlines the environmental and 
economic benefits available to energy users to improve energy 
efficiency.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have a Minister of Finance who acts in a progressive 
manner on environmental issues. Last February, he announced a 
major new initiative in support of sustainable development.
<P>
	In the budget, it was announced that a task force involving 
government, industry and representatives of environmental 
groups would be established to identify barriers to sound 
environmental management.
<P>
	This task force will also focus on a wide range of economic 
instruments which rely on market forces and demonstrate 
potential for rapid implementation either as an alternative to or 
to complement environmental regulations.
<P>
	Speaking of this task force, I am delighted to announce today 
that following consultations will all interested parties, the 
Minister of Finance and I will be releasing shortly the names of 
the task force members and the nature of the task force's 
mandate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am very pleased on behalf of the Minister of Finance and 
myself to announce that we are moving ahead rapidly with our 
commitment to analyse how tax policy and how economic 
instruments can be used to help build a strong environmental 
record.
<P>
	Very shortly we will be announcing the membership and the 
terms of reference of a committee. It will be examining the 
whole issue of not only economic instruments as they can help 
government policy but also a review of taxes and subsidies to 
make sure that they are environmentally friendly and do not 
work against a clean environment.
<P>
	I could go on and mention the environmental contributions of 
every single member of this cabinet, for example the Minister 
for Industry and his secretary of state who are working very hard 
on environmental industries, but the point is clear. This 
government, this cabinet and this Prime Minister are committed 
to the environmentally sound management of our nation's 
business.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As Minister of the Environment, I am proud of my 
department's achievements. In the six months since taking 
office, we have built strong foundations to meet our 
commitments. I said that we would pass legislation providing 
for a round table on the economy and the environment. This will 
give existence in law to a vital organization and also fulfil a 
commitment made in the red book.
<P>
	The throne speech spoke of the government's intentions and I 
also announced that we would pass an environmental 
assessment act this spring, as was requested by the Leader of the 
Opposition. As promised in the red book, we will also 
strengthen regulations, thereby fulfilling a second commitment.
<P>
	In co-operation with my colleague, the Minister of Industry, 
and his Secretary of State, we are in the process of developing a 
government strategy for environmental industries and we 
sponsored consultations earlier this winter, in order to generate 
the required public support. We are currently looking at the 
comments received and the strategy will be announced very 
soon. This is the third commitment fulfilled.
<P>
	Last Monday, I had the pleasure and the honour of announcing 
phase II of the Great Lakes action plan, as well as the 
implementation of the plan for the St. Lawrence, Vision 2000. 
These two plans are major steps to clean up the largest 
freshwater expanse in the world.
<P>
	These initiatives, combined with the statutory five-year 
review of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act which 
will soon be undertaken by the standing committee of the House, 
will enable us to fulfil another promise made in the red book 
regarding pollution prevention. We should soon get the answer 
of the parliamentary committee on our commitment regarding 
the Auditor General, and we also expect results very quickly. 
This is the fourth commitment fulfilled.
<P>
	An oil tanker sank some time ago. We worked with the four 
provinces concerned, in co-operation with the Minister of 
Transport, and we found a solution which will soon be 
implemented. This is another commitment fulfilled.
<P>
	Earlier this spring, I gave the Standing Committee on 
Sustainable Development the very important mandate of 
looking at the concept of an auditor general for the environment. 
The committee made its recommendations, thus allowing us to 
fulfil another commitment made in the red book.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our government is keeping its promises and we hope with the 
help of the Parliament of Canada to continue to do so.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3398"> 3398 </A></B>
<P>
	On Earth Day I wish to give my friends and colleagues in this 
House and all Canadians my personal pledge that we want to 
work with the provinces, the municipalities, workers, 
environmental groups, businesses and, most important, we want 
to work with the children of Canada to ensure the protection and 
promotion of our natural environment.
<P>
	As Minister of the Environment for Canada I am proud of 
what we have accomplished. I would be prouder still if I could 
stand today and tell this House that we have no need for Earth 
Day, that we do not need a special day to think about the 
environment because every day is Earth Day in Canada.
<P>
	This House has heard many speeches from many eloquent 
individuals but I would like to leave members with the motto 
which I think should be the standard bearer for Earth Day, for 
this House, for our country and for the world. It is an ancient 
Haida saying which we all know and which we should take to 
heart: We do not inherit the land from our ancestors; we borrow 
it from our children.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, now that the Minister of the Environment has praised 
the government's actions with respect to the environment, the 
Official Opposition would rather talk, on this Earth Day, about 
the real problems, that is problems in our ecosystem and 
challenges that must be met so that we can live in a sound 
environment.
<P>
	The minister would rather dwell on her government's 
accomplishments since the election. So, allow me to put in 
perspective some of those accomplishments that must leave 
more than one Quebecer and Canadian totally confused.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Regarding the legislation, the minister has made several 
statements in the House and in the media. However, we still have 
not had the pleasure of seeing one single bill come out of her 
department. The minister seems to misunderstand the 
legislative process leading to the meeting of an electoral 
commitment. It is not enough to announce that regulations 
relating to the Environmental Assessment Act will be produced 
and that a bill on the round table on the economy and the 
environment will be presented for people to consider that the 
Liberal Party has kept its promises. If the government thinks 
that its commitments have been met simply because they were 
announced, we may end up once again facing needless verbiage 
and pious hope.
<P>
	After announcing with great pomp that there will be 
consultations on governmental strategy with environmental 
industries, it seems, as was the case in Montreal, according to 
some observers, that in fact these consultations were only an 
excuse for a social gathering of officials. It would appear that 
the environmental industry was not really associated with the 
process. Yet, the Official Opposition had given its support to 
this  initiative, hoping it would be an opportunity to promote 
research and development in environmental industries. So, there 
is still much to be done before the minister can proudly 
announce that her commitment has been met.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would be glad to have talks with the minister. I 
know she is in a good mood today and it is always with great 
pleasure that I have talks with her. So I will continue to do so.
<P>
	As for the St. Lawrence Action Plan-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Copps:</B> But not always in good faith.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I realize that, from 
time to time, there may be some friendly give and take between 
two members, but perhaps we could stick to the subject of this 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your vigilance.
<P>
	As for the St. Lawrence action plan, now pompously called St. 
Lawrence Vision 2000, this government is merely continuing 
the Conservative Party's policies. I do not think we can see this 
as meeting a commitment made by the Liberal Party.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the budget brought down by the Minister of 
Finance, to which the minister refers with such enthusiasm, 
contains no funding for dealing with harbour sediment 
contamination, although according to the minister, the 
infrastructure program would be able to provide the necessary 
funds. If that were the case, we would be delighted. However, 
according to <I>Le Soleil</I>, and the minister has probably read this, 
one of the department's officials expressed some serious doubts 
about that possibility.
<P>
	Although there have been many important announcements, it 
is clear that implementation is lagging, while the public's very 
legitimate expectations are increasing. Consider the case of 
chlorinated organic compounds, which include most 
pesticides-whose presence in our Great Lakes are a threat to 
the health of the people living in these densely populated areas, 
as was pointed out in the latest report of the International Joint 
Commission.
<P>
	Furthermore, as was pointed out by the chairman of the 
Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, the 
hon. member for Davenport, Canada has been postponing 
ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the 
Sea for nine years now, a convention that, if implemented, 
would contribute very substantially towards protecting the 
oceans, improving the fisheries and reducing the risk of 
pollution. So far, 57 countries have signed the convention, but 
60 signatures are required to ratify it. Now that, Mr. Speaker, 
would be good news. That is something tangible the very 
energetic Minister of the Environment could have done.
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians have no illusions about the 
triumphant announcements made today by the Minister of the 
Environment. I am surprised that I am the one in this House who 
will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3399"> 3399 </A></B>
<P>
have to describe the serious problems facing Canadians, 
Quebecers and humanity.
<P>
	Since the early 19th century, more than half of our tropical 
forests have disappeared. Only 40 per cent of the forests are still 
standing in Third World countries, and this dramatic situation 
has led to the extinction of 100 species daily. Desertification is a 
problem in more than 100 countries and it affects more than 800 
million people.
<P>
	One third of Asia's arable land is threatened by 
desertification, and 80 countries, with 40 per cent of the world's 
population, lack clean drinking water, and deteriorating water 
quality is a death sentence for millions of children. The global 
environmental situation has reached crisis proportions.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Instead of dealing at length with the qualifications of her 
Cabinet colleagues and the Prime Minister, the Minister of the 
Environment should have taken advantage of Earth Day 
celebrated today to bring the discussion to a higher level and 
inform us of the direction her government will take regarding 
solutions that will have to be put forward by Canada and other 
countries if we want to live in a community where environment 
meets the demands of the population, in particular those of 
young people who will inherit the outcome of the decisions we 
are taking today.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you and I want to say to the minister that 
we wish to be part of any initiative that she will propose to this 
House, but until now, concrete measures have been delayed for a 
long time and we pray St. Basile that legislative action will be 
taken as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I cannot help asking 
myself if the invitation of the minister is still on the table or on 
the ground, but anyway the issue is worth following.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni):</B> Mr. Speaker, as Earth 
Day is a positive day, I will keep my comments in a positive 
vein.
<P>
	Earth Day is a time for all of us to look inward and examine 
what many of us take for granted, the planet on which we live.
<P>
	I am pleased to see that we are on a path through the forest that 
leads toward a sustainable future and that we are addressing, 
although sometimes quite slowly, ways to prevent pollution thus 
ensuring a healthy planet for our children and our grandchildren.
<P>
	The Brundtland commission's definition of sustainability: 
``Leaving our planet to our children in the same or better 
condition than the one that we inherited'' should be the goal of 
each and every one of us. In order to achieve this goal we need to 
get into the regular habit of doing more with less.
<P>
	Although I agree with the minister that government should be 
involved, I feel that it is more up to each and every one of us 
personally, not someone else, to do what is right. Only when we 
take responsibility and learn to live our everyday lives by 
conserving resources will we have achieved this goal of 
sustainability.
<P>
	As I said earlier, we are still on the path in the forest. 
Sustainability is still some distance away. Only when we live 
each and every day as Earth Day will we have achieved that long 
awaited goal.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wonder if I could seek 
unanimous consent of the House to allow the member for 
Regina-Lumsden to say a few words on behalf of the New 
Democratic Party. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden):</B> Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker, and thank you to my colleagues in the House. It is my 
pleasure today to join with members of this House of Commons 
in celebrating Earth Day. First, I congratulate all those in 
Canada who are taking as a priority not only our country but our 
planet in terms of its environment.
<P>
	I have met with many individuals and organizations in my 
constituency in the city of Regina who are taking an active role 
in their community to ensure that when they leave this earth as 
living persons, they leave it a better place in terms of 
environment and resources for their children.
<P>
	I congratulate them on their efforts in terms of recycling 
programs and other approaches that they are taking, which I 
participate in as well. I recycle all of my glass, tins, plastics, 
newspapers, clothing and other things that I or my family 
consumes. I think it is important that all legislators consider 
following that example that, indeed, many of our children have 
set for us.
<P>
	I agree with the government's priority of ensuring that we 
have an environmental plan in this country. I agree with its 
sentiment that we should leave this earth better than we found it 
because we are indeed caring for this earth on behalf of future 
generations. Nobody knows that more than parents who see their 
children growing through various stages of their lives and see 
some of the very difficult challenges that face our young people 
in today's economy and today's environment.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	I have a little bit of a difference of opinion from the 
government. The Liberals in opposition spoke very loud in 
terms of opposing the green plan that was put forward by the 
former Conservative government. The catch words here are: 
Actions speak louder than words. Their action in opposition was 
that they opposed the green plan .Their action is government is 
that they are implementing the Conservative green plan. To me 
that is a flip-flop.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3400"> 3400 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not believe the government is taking seriously its verbal 
commitments to ensuring we have a healthy and strong 
environment in this country. That is demonstrated very clearly 
by the fact that here we are into the end of April 1994, we have 
been sitting here for three months, and the government has yet 
to bring forward any major discussion opportunity in the House 
of Commons on our environment in Canada. There is no new 
green plan. It is implementing an old green plan that was not 
acceptable to the Liberals in opposition. Now they flip-flop in 
government and support the green plan. Actions speak louder 
than words.
<P>
	The other action the government has undertaken is it 
appointed the NAFTA environment office to the city of 
Montreal which does not have an example of good 
environmental protection for its citizens. It has one of the worst 
records in Canada.
<P>
	My sense is that actions speak louder than words. The 
Liberals are very, very wordy. They get up, talk and rant and 
rave about all sorts of wonderful things they are doing but they 
are not doing anything. Their actions prove the opposite.
<P>
	On behalf of the New Democratic Party we will continue to 
ask the government to ensure that it does put the environment on 
the agenda and to ensure that Canada's environment is sustained 
for future generations.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley)</B> 
moved for leave to introduce Bill C-240, an act to amend the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act and the Criminal 
Code.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this bill is to amend the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act as well as the Criminal 
Code to provide for the detention of high risk violent offenders 
after the expiration of their sentences and to provide for the 
detention of sex offenders convicted of offences against 
children.
<P>
	This bill will give the Correctional Service of Canada and the 
National Parole Board the power to refer the offender to the 
appropriate Attorney General for a dangerous offender hearing. 
Upon making a dangerous offender finding, a court could then 
make the following orders for the protection of society: First, 
custody for an indefinite period of time; second, custody for a 
definite period of time; and third, supervised release in the 
community for a period of 10 years.
<P>
	The second aspect of this bill would eliminate the need to 
prove the serious harm criteria when dealing with high risk 
offenders who victimize children. The current requirement to 
prove serious harm is difficult in cases involving children as the 
actual harm to the child may not be evident for several years. A 
child's difficulty in clearly communicating the effect of a sexual 
crime makes serious harm very difficult to detect.
<P>
	It is my pleasure to introduce this bill. I hope it is given great 
consideration as it is very important for the protection of 
society.

Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, it is my duty and 
pleasure to present a petition on behalf of a number of 
constituents of Prince Albert-Churchill River calling for the 
repeal of section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The petitioners strongly oppose this clause which allows 
convicted murderers serving mandatory life sentences of 25 
years without parole to apply for parole after 15 years.
<P>
	I urge all members to consider these views expressed by the 
residents of La Ronge, Buffalo Narrows, Smeaton, Shellbrook, 
Waskesiu, Holbein and Southend in my riding in northern

Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to present a petition, along with 
my colleague from the opposite side of the House, to repeal 
section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	This section is called faint hope. It allows a convicted 
murderer sentenced to life without parole for 25 years to apply 
for parole after 15 years.
<P>
	I support this petition. I feel that when a judge and jury make 
the determination that somebody should not have access to 
parole for 25 years it should be respected, and I support this

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of ensuring that the reform of the tax system is harmonized and 
integrated with review and reform of the Canadian system of social security as a 
whole with a view to most efficiently realizing the fundamental objective of 
income security for all Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, my motion is seconded by the member 
for Regina-Lumsden.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	It calls on the House to agree that the government should 
consider the advisability of ensuring that the reform of the tax 
system is integrated and harmonized with the review and reform 
of the Canadian system of social security.
<P>
	My motion has three themes to this point. The first is that our 
tax system needs to ensure that we have the revenue needed to 
provide for the social programs we have deemed necessary so as 
to ensure that all Canadians can live at a reasonable level of 
security and dignity.
<P>
	The second aspect of this motion revolves around the use of 
the tax system in social policy administration. The tax system 
has been used over the years as an integral way of ensuring the 
administration of social policy through various different 
measures, tax credits and so on.
<P>
	The third aspect of the motion deals with the issue of the 
unfair tax burdens and tax implications on Canadians who are 
moving off social programs into the workforce. I will deal with 
each of these separately.
<P>
	To date, the focus of the government as it looks at social 
programs, as it was for the previous Progressive Conservative 
government and following the wishes of the Reform Party, has 
been to focus on cuts to expenditures and programs, cuts to 
people, cuts to those most vulnerable, the poorest in society. 
That has been the focus of the government's attention to social 
programs.
<P>
	It is worth pointing out that the Bloc Quebecois has made 
many important contributions against that approach, arguing as 
the New Democratic Party would, for a more holistic, a more 
people oriented approach to social policy reform. I thank the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois for that.
<P>
	The government has placed no emphasis on solving the 
problem. The problem is that the economy simply does not work 
for more than four million Canadians because these people do 
not work in the paid workforce, not through any fault of their 
own but because the government has not made a priority of job 
creation. Neither did the government before it.
<P>
	No emphasis has been placed on making the economy work, 
giving Canadians the opportunity for the jobs they so sorely 
need in order to feed themselves and their families and make a 
contribution to our society. As a result of this, we have seen an 
increase in social program payments because of the large 
numbers of Canadians who have been unable to find work.
<P>
	In addition, there has been no emphasis by the government or 
any emphasis from the previous government on ensuring a 
progressive, fair tax system even though this is recognized in the 
budget. Indeed one of the budget quotes from the government 
says that the fundamental basis of a sound tax system is the 
reality and perception that everybody pays his or her fair share.
<P>
	That may be the perception but clearly it is not something the 
government has seen fit to do anything about. We continue with 
a tax system which is unfair to most ordinary Canadians because 
it loads the tax burden on middle and lower income Canadians 
while allowing those who are wealthiest and our largest 
corporations essentially to get a free ride.
<P>
	We need some action in a holistic way to deal with our social 
programs. They are there for those who need them. Those who 
need them have grown in numbers because our economy is 
simply not working for them. We also have a tax system which 
unfairly burdens middle and lower income Canadians. 
Essentially we have seen no action from the government on this 
measure even though in opposition they frequently criticized the 
Conservative government for its regressive tax changes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3403"> 3403 </A></B>
<P>
	I would just like to point out too that Canadians are 
concerned about the speed of social policy reform and its 
implications. They are concerned the government is focusing 
only on cuts to social programs, cuts in the order of billions 
of dollars, with inadequate consultation and inadequate 
consideration of the major impact this will have both on the 
provinces but more important, on those Canadians who need 
those programs.
<P>
	In spite of the advice to the contrary from the government's 
own advisers, it continues to make ad hoc social program 
changes while trying to consider the overall picture.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	One member of the task force of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, Mr. Ken Battle, proposes a 
moratorium on changes to social programs and changes to the 
income tax system until a comprehensive in-depth review of 
those programs has been conducted. That advice of the 
government's own adviser is not being taken.
<P>
	Going to the tax system itself, we have seen nine years of 
Conservative government focusing on cutting expenditures to 
deal with the debt and deficit problems that Canada faces. We 
see governments across the country, Conservative and Liberal 
governments, focusing in that same way. We see New 
Democratic governments balancing budgets without cuts to 
social programs.
<P>
	My own province of Saskatchewan cut the deficit from the 
highest per capita to the lowest in three years, the very best 
deficit cutting record of any province or any government in the 
country, according to all the reports of financial managers who 
are not normally friends of the New Democratic Party. In 
addition it has increased spending on social programs and health 
care.
<P>
	It is not necessary to attack the deficit by attacking those who 
are most vulnerable in society. The New Democratic 
Government of Saskatchewan has proven that to all Canadians. 
Anybody who would rather live in Alberta with Ralph Klein's 
slash and burn deficit cutting than in Saskatchewan is probably 
somebody making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in 
income.
<P>
	The debt as we know was not caused by social programs. 
Statistics Canada has indicated many times that half the debt 
Canada has faced since 1975, which is when the debt became a 
major problem, was due to tax breaks and tax loopholes for 
wealthy individual Canadians or about 50 per cent. Forty-four 
per cent was due to high interest rates; only 6 per cent to 
increases in government spending, and of that 6 per cent only 3 
per cent was for social programs spending.
<P>
	The problem has not been social programs spending. It has 
been a weak tax system, a tax system that has favoured the rich. 
After all, the rich have their own political parties in the House 
that have served them well by providing them with this very 
favourable tax situation.
<P>
	Surely, if we are to attack the problem, we need to attack the 
regressiveness of our tax system. More than $140 billion in 
corporate taxes, for example, have gone untaxed in the last nine 
years. Eighty corporations each owe $100 million or more in 
deferred taxes. Workers often pay more taxes than the 
companies they work for. New Democrats and Canadians think 
it is time the government at least treated corporations as they 
treat other Canadians.
<P>
	Why not impose a minimum corporate tax? Even Ronald 
Reagan imposed a minimum corporate tax. Why not charge 
interest on deferred taxes which are outstanding on the part of 
these corporations? Why not pursue more aggressively those 
companies that are deliberately avoiding paying their taxes?
<P>
	Let us look at one example of the implications of the unfair 
tax system. If Imperial Oil had paid its 1992 deferred tax bill of 
$1.58 billion, we could have created 600,000 child care spaces 
in the country or we could have built 54,000 social housing 
units. The costs to Canadians are significant as a result of a tax 
system which favours the rich. It also ensures that middle and 
lower income Canadians pay an unfair proportion of taxes and 
that there are not enough resources available to deal with the 
social program costs required as a result of the fact the economy 
is not working for four million Canadians.
<P>
	Another example which we know well in Canada is that of the 
family trust. It is an example in which the richest Canadian 
families are able to escape taxation while others have to go to 
the food bank to beg for food. Estimates indicate that over a 
billion dollars a year are lost to the federal treasury as a result of 
giving Canada's richest families a tax break that enables them to 
hide their tax benefits.
<P>
	This tax benefit was introduced by the Liberal government of 
Pierre Trudeau and was extended by the government of Prime 
Minister Mulroney.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	It is an outrage that Canadians are faced with a tax system 
which gives the richest Canadians huge tax breaks while it 
forces the poorest Canadians to go to food banks to find food.
<P>
	There are many other tax loopholes that could be eliminated. 
We have seen some attention in the government's budget paid to 
the business entertainment tax deduction. More could be done 
there. Another half a billion dollars could be saved as a result of 
closing that loophole. I do not see why my constituents who 
cannot afford to get to Toronto to watch a Blue Jays game should 
subsidize business people who are entertaining their friends in 
skyboxes at the SkyDome. There is a clear inequity in that 
process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3404"> 3404 </A></B>
<P>
	We should eliminate special tax breaks enjoyed by real estate 
developers. To give real estate developers tax breaks on an 
imagined depreciation of their assets when in fact their assets 
are increasing in value is a perverse gift to the richest of 
Canadians. We see very large wealthy development companies 
paying no or very low rates of corporate tax.
<P>
	We should eliminate the tax breaks for corporate mergers and 
acquisitions. There is absolutely no gain to the average 
Canadian there. These three tax breaks to the very wealthy 
would save another billion dollars for Canadians and provide 
more resources for the social programs we need.
<P>
	I could go on. We could tax wealth. We could clamp down on 
tax cheaters. As I mentioned we could put a minimum corporate 
tax on corporations to ensure they at least pay something.
<P>
	I have made my point that our tax system is unfair, balanced in 
favour of the wealthy who have had political parties and 
continue to have political parties in the House working for them, 
and unfairly harsh on middle and lower income Canadians who 
have seen their taxes increase significantly over the last few 
years.
<P>
	It is time, if Liberal words mean anything and if Liberal words 
in opposition mean anything, to make some changes to ensure 
that Canadians do not see this matter continue.
<P>
	Briefly my second point is with regard to the use of the tax 
system for social policy implementation. It has a long tradition 
in Canada. It can work well if those tax changes are progressive. 
However, it works badly if those tax changes are regressive.
<P>
	Mr. Ken Battle, an adviser of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, has pointed out over the years that 
progressive changes to social programs and tax policy have been 
undermined consistently by regressive changes under the past 
government. The only significant change in the first budget of 
the Liberal government was to get rid of the lifetime capital 
gains exemption. There is perhaps $12 billion lost to the 
treasury as a result of high tax deductions for RRSPs which only 
the wealthy can take advantage of and child care expenses that 
favour well-off taxpayers.
<P>
	We have also seen how our tax system has impacted on our 
social programs in a way in which most Canadians have not 
realized until well after the fact. The minister's own adviser, 
Ken Battle, calls this politics of stealth. We are seeing that same 
politics of stealth carrying on under this government, although 
its members criticized it extensively when in opposition.
<P>
	We see universal child and elderly benefits no longer existing 
as a result of the clawbacks imposed on old age pensions and 
family allowances. We see a replacement of family allowances 
based on an income tested child tax benefit, all things that were 
criticized by the Liberals in opposition, all things they continue 
to allow to take place in government.
<P>
	Lastly we see the impact of partial deindexation which is 
catching ever more lower income Canadians in its net, excluding 
them from social programs and placing them in ever higher tax 
brackets.
<P>
	It is necessary for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, in conjunction with the Minister of Finance, to 
take charge of the issue to make sure that tax policy as it impacts 
on social policy is progressive, helpful to those who are 
experiencing difficulties in our society, and contributes, as the 
government's own words indicate, to a fairer tax system so that 
we can all be satisfied the tax system is fair and that we are 
paying our fair share as is everyone else.
<P>
	My last point deals with something about which there has 
been much loose talk.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	As with the previous government, this government is fond of 
talking about deterrents to work which can be addressed by 
reducing the social programs for people who are not working. 
The biggest deterrent to work, as every Canadian will say, is that 
there are not enough jobs with adequate wages. If we address 
that problem we also address not only our deficit problem but 
our social programs. We would simply not have as many 
Canadians drawing on social program expenditures.
<P>
	There are significant practical problems to be addressed 
dealing with moving off social programs, social assistance or 
unemployment insurance, and into the workforce. This has been 
described as being a welfare roll. Thousands of welfare 
recipients each year are blocked from moving into the 
workforce because of the adverse economic consequences that 
would give rise to, the so-called welfare taxback in which those 
who move off social programs experience the very highest 
marginal rate of income tax in the country. Either 100 per cent or 
something very close to it is taxed back from them on earnings 
they make as they attempt to move from social assistance to the 
workforce.
<P>
	Many Canadians who are on the verge of moving from social 
assistance to work and are able to earn a bit of money on social 
assistance lose a dollar of welfare assistance for every dollar 
they earn. That is the highest rate of marginal tax in the country 
on the very poorest of Canadians. Of course it is an outrage.
<P>
	We have also seen the value of refundable tax benefits and 
GST being determined by net income. As a person leaves social 
assistance they lose those programs. We have to ensure that is 
not a deterrent, as it presently is, to moving off social assistance 
and into the workforce. We have to ensure that our tax policies at 
the federal and provincial levels and our welfare policy fit 
together so that we encourage wherever possible, wherever 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3405"> 3405 </A></B>
<P>
there are jobs, those people who can fill them to move off social 
assistance into the job market.
<P>
	We have to ensure that the transition period from social 
assistance or unemployment insurance into the workforce is a 
smooth one and is possible for Canadians to make. We have to 
take notice of the high cost of working for some families as they 
move from social assistance into the workforce.
<P>
	In conclusion, it is incumbent upon the Minister of Human 
Resources Development to work with the provinces to ensure 
these transitional arrangements are smooth and encourage 
participation in the workforce.
<P>
	The motion brings together the important points on how we 
deal with one of the most serious problems in our country: how 
to find the resources necessary to ensure that those who are not 
part of the paid workforce live in security and dignity. Surely 
that is a role of any democratic and decent society.
<P>
	We have to ensure that our tax system is fair, that those who 
can pay do pay, and that we close tax loopholes which would 
bring in, as I have indicated, billions of dollars that could be 
used on social programs. We have to ensure that tax policy as it 
affects social policy is progressive and that the transition from 
social assistance or unemployment insurance into the workforce 
is a smooth one.
<P>
	This is not easy but with political will to solve this problem it 
can certainly be achieved as it has been in many other countries.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was pleased when I read the motion. In the beginning 
I searched to see whether it was from the member for 
Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing or put forward by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Of course, as we know, the two hon. members have the same 
surname, and that has caused some confusion. I thank the hon. 
member opposite for fully supporting this government's policy, 
seeing that by and large, what he is proposing in his motion is in 
fact what this government is seeking, and indeed has 
undertaken, to do.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member across has read the red book. I say 
that because of the way his motion is written. He has inspired 
himself with Liberal policies. I am very glad though that he has 
done so. I do not agree with the text of his presentation to the 
House today but I do agree with his motion.
<P>
	For instance, today he complimented the provincial 
government of Saskatchewan for its social policy. My very 
distinguished colleague from the riding of Prince Albert has just 
informed me that a number of hospitals were closed in his riding 
alone. Can you imagine that? That is the kind of policy that gets 
praise from the member for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing.
<P>
	He also complimented the NDP generally. I am sure it was an 
oversight on his part. I cannot for the life of me think of anyone 
wanting to compliment Bob Rae for any of his policies, 
particularly social policy, job creation policy and tax policy, in 
the province where you and I have the honour and privilege to 
represent constituents, namely the province of Ontario.
<P>
	In my area in Ontario we have seen the devastation of NDP 
provincial policies. We have seen what they have done to our 
area. It is more than a passing coincidence that every single NDP 
candidate, every single NDP MP in Ontario without exception, 
was soundly defeated. That tells you something. The NDP in my 
riding got approximately 4 per cent of the votes. That tells you 
what the people thought of that party.
<P>
	I get back to the motion because it is a good motion. I want to 
read portions of the red book. I know that all members of the 
House will consider it a privilege. Reading from page 22 of the 
red book, let me read the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The federal and provincial governments share common problems of too 
much government debt, too much foreign owned debt, and too high borrowing 
requirements, domestically and internationally. All three levels of government 
put the burden of these problems on the same taxpayer who is subject to taxes on 
income, capital and consumption. To this list governments add other charges in 
the form of licences, permits, user fees, and additional payroll deductions. A 
Liberal government will work closely with the provincial governments to 
achieve maximum possible co-ordination of tax policies.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is just the kind of thing that is advocated in the motion. I 
read further, Mr. Speaker, from the red book because I know that 
you would want me to do this. It says the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the first session of the new Parliament the Liberal government will give the 
all party finance committee of the House of Commons a 12-month mandate to 
consult fully with Canadians and provincial governments and to report on the 
ways to achieve tax fairness, simplicity and harmonization.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the exact thing that is asked for in the motion. Let me 
read the motion a little bit here. It says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the government should consider the advisability of ensuring that the 
reform of the tax system is harmonized and integrated with review and reform-</BLOCKQUOTE>
And so on. This is exactly what our government is doing. I am 
sorry I was interrupted in my reading of the red book and we 
should never do that to the red book. I continue:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In particular, the committee will be mandated to report on all options for alternatives 
to the current GST. A Liberal government will replace the GST with a system</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3406"> 3406 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>that generates  equivalent revenues, is fairer to consumers, to small business, 
minimizes disruption to small business and promotes federal-provincial fiscal 
co-operation and harmonization.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So, you see, Mr. Speaker, that is what the Liberal Party was 
suggesting during the last election campaign and we, of course, 
had made our intentions known in the red book, from which I 
have just quoted.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	But that is not all, Mr. Speaker. As you know, earlier this year, 
the Minister of Finance tabled a budget, a budget that this House 
has passed.
<P>
	In this budget, we have made good our promises, if not all at 
least most of our election promises, and this just in the first year 
of our mandate. So, you see, Mr. Speaker, I think that on the 
strength of this first budget alone, this government would 
deserve to be re-elected. Of course, in the years to come, we will 
give the public many more reasons to re-elect us, as the hon. 
members opposite will learn to appreciate.
<P>
	In our red book, and again in the budget, we promised to bring 
the deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP within three years. There it 
is, in the budget.
<P>
	Also in the budget: to implement a national program to renew 
infrastructure; restore funding for the National Literacy 
Program; establish a Youth Service Corps; provide new youth 
internship and apprenticeship programs; improve access to 
capital for small business; replace the GST; re-institute the 
Residential Rehabilitation Assistance Program; create a 
Canadian information highway. As you can see, Mr. Speaker, I 
could go on and on. Perhaps I should: set up a Technology 
Partnership Program; launch an Engineers and Scientists 
Program, and so on.
<P>
	These are all things that we had promised in the red book, 
electoral promises that we are acting on.
<P>
	There are two main thrusts. The first one is to make the tax 
system better, more balanced and more in line with our social 
programs.
<P>
	I will now outline the second.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development 
proposed to this House a change in the system in which we 
deliver social programs. Much to the chagrin of some opposition 
members, we are proceeding to do exactly what the motion is 
asking us.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development has 
mandated a committee to do some work. Stage one of that will 
be hearings by this committee, federal-provincial and territorial 
labour market and social services ministers to meet and to 
discuss this, later on a task force to advise the minister and then 
an action plan to be drafted and presented in this House.
<P>
	I congratulate the member for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing 
for supporting so wholeheartedly the policies of our 
government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today as a member of the committee responsible 
for reviewing the social program reform action plan of the 
Minister of Human Resources Development and, unlike the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, I think that the 
vision of Mr. Chris Axworthy, the hon. member for 
Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, is much broader than that of his 
namesake, the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	His motion, in favour of which I will speak, has only one flaw 
in our eyes: it should be more proactive since the hon. member 
says that ``the government should consider the advisability of 
ensuring that the reform of the tax system is harmonized.''
<P>
	I myself think that the government must ensure that the 
reform of the tax system is harmonized, and I think it is 
important to make that clear because the current approach used 
by the Minister of Human Resources Development in this area is 
no guarantee of future success and because he announces 
changes, to the Unemployment Insurance Program in particular, 
even before his reform initiative is in place, and it is clear that 
there is no harmony between the budget and the objectives, and 
the way social program reform is being conducted.
<P>
	So we obviously support the proposal of the hon. member for 
Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, since the Bloc Quebecois has 
been calling for tax reform since the election. This issue was 
part of our election platform and we think it is important to 
harmonize the two elements, namely the tax system and social 
security programs, regardless of our opinion on how to approach 
social program reform in the future. Be it the Reform Party or 
the Liberals, I think that, in this respect, everybody will admit 
that we need a little more harmony. I believe that, at the present 
time, there is a serious lack of co-ordination on the part of the 
government, and a warning such as the one the member for 
Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing is proposing is in order.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	It seems to us that the planned social program reform might 
create more inconsistencies if it does not take the tax system 
into account. We will end up with the same counterproductive 
situations we saw in the past, where we gave people incentives 
to increase their income but these same incentives discouraged 
them from working and being productive members of society. 
Harmonization is a must.
<P>
	We must harmonize because the present government does not 
seem in any hurry to deal with some elements of the tax system 
which impact on the reform of social programs. I am referring to 
family trusts, for instance.  We can reform all the social 
programs in the world, but if we do not take care of the revenue 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3407"> 3407 </A></B>
<P>
side of things, making sure that everybody pays their fair share, 
we are not doing our job as a government, as a Parliament.
<P>
	In 1969, there were $18 billion in family trusts. In 1982, there 
were $80 billion. The potential growth of those trusts should 
encourage us to check to see what today, in 1994, the exact 
amounts involved are, to determine why these people pay no 
taxes and to find ways of obtaining a reasonable amount of tax 
revenues from those trusts. After all, they belong to a few very 
rich families, as Mr. Claude Piché said in <I>La Presse</I> on January 
19, 1994, when he explained that the creation of a trust is a very 
complex and costly process which is not really worthwhile 
unless you have a real fortune.
<P>
	Therefore, on the question of family trusts, it would be 
interesting to know exactly what is going on as soon as possible 
because since 1983-84, we have not been able to find out what 
funds are in there. In my view, the government should take a 
close look at its own actions on that issue and publish the exact 
figures as soon as possible.
<P>
	Tax reform also seems very important because the tax 
structure must be fair for everybody. We should make our tax 
tables much less regressive because right now taxes do not serve 
justice and equity in our society and there is a lot to be done in 
that area. The present government is saying nothing and does not 
seem to be really willing to make the necessary changes; it is 
burying its head in the sand.
<P>
	There is also the issue of tax shelters that need to be 
abolished. There would be a lot of work to be done just to 
determine which shelters should be maintained and which 
should be abolished. In that sense, the motion of the hon. 
member for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing is very interesting 
and it is a needed reminder for the government which seems to 
forget that what it does on the one hand does not necessarily 
agree with what it does on the other.
<P>
	The other important element is that the fiscal structure must 
be harmonized to take income security into consideration. There 
are examples from the past which demonstrate that income tax 
tables can be used to help low-income earners. In Quebec, Mr. 
Parizeau, when he was Minister of Finance, made sure that 
low-income families would pay no income tax. That kind of 
initiative should be taken by the current government, which 
seems to be forgetting its electoral promises to the neediest and 
more inclined to protect those who financed its electoral 
campaign.
<P>
	We therefore consider it important to support the motion of 
the hon. member for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing. There are 
also a few other things that I would like the government to take 
into consideration when harmonizing, and one is a minimum 
corporate tax. There is no doubt that Canadian tax policy is very 
favourable to business. Naturally, businesses should be allowed 
to  develop, but at the same time we have to avoid an imbalance 
between the share individual taxpayers must bear and that of 
business. In that area, I thing we have a long way to go.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	Another thing I would like to mention are the changes to fiscal 
arrangements that apply to foreign corporations. For example, 
in 1990, taxpayers with incomes of over $80,000 accounted for 
more than 70 per cent of all taxable capital gains, and 66 per cent 
of those were investors. We in the Bloc Quebecois believe that 
the financial position of the government requires a larger 
contribution of high income taxpayers, and in the spirit of this 
motion we could, at the very least, undertake a thorough study of 
this aspect, to make sure that in the future, the tax policy and the 
forthcoming reform of social programs guarantee some 
harmonization between the two and that, in effect, we do not 
create situations that are even more absurd than the ones we now 
have.
<P>
	I would like to add that when the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell quoted from the red book, it 
reminded me of a saying my grandfather was fond of. Do not 
judge people by what they say but by what they do. It is 
particularly true with the Liberals' election platform. During the 
campaign, all they promised were jobs, jobs, jobs, but they have 
yet to deliver. The Liberals made a lot of commitments 
concerning social equity in the red book, but they have not 
achieved much. And worst of all, they do not seem to have the 
will to forge ahead in this area.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to say that, unlike the hon. member 
for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, I do not see how you can 
compare the motion put forward by the hon. member for 
Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing with the position taken by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development. There is a 
fundamental difference between the two in that the minister 
tends to act a bit like a bulldozer these days. However, he may be 
realizing that provinces have some rights in this area and will 
expect the government to respect them.
<P>
	The public also want things to be done legally and has shown 
in the past that if governments are divorced from the realities of 
their constituents, voters can remind them of the harsh realities 
come election time. I think that a motion like the one before the 
House today should prompt the government to review the need 
for more harmonization at the Cabinet level, which would allow 
people to share their ideas and dovetail their programs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
agree with the bill that has been put forward by the hon. member 
for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing. The tax system does need to 
be reformed. How can anyone disagree with that broad goal of 
income security for all Canadians?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3408"> 3408 </A></B>
<P>
	The disagreement, however, comes on these two questions: 
How should the tax system be reformed, and what constitutes 
social and income security?
<P>
	Let me deal with the second question first. What is social and 
income security? In the minds of most Canadians it can only 
exist in a society in which there are good jobs with good 
incomes. That is the bottom line. To have good jobs there must 
exist good investment opportunities and there must be good 
rates of return or profit. Without that we will not have good jobs 
in this country. Such a society must also have an 
environmentally sound, financially viable economy alongside a 
supportive, responsive public services sector.
<P>
	How do we get on the right road to achieving this objective for 
our society? How do we get there from here? There are many 
areas that need to be reformed. Reforming our tax system would 
be a major variable in the equation.
<P>
	What kind of tax reform is needed? Our current system with 
its unjustifiably high taxes is a wedge, one that is being driven 
between Canadians eager to be fruitful, prosperous and just and 
the ultimate goal of achieving a socially and income insecure 
society. It is a wedge that is being driven between the intentions 
and the realization of that goal.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	What is the real culprit? Why is the current system of high 
taxes a problem? These unfair high taxes are only a symptom of 
a bigger inherently related problem. We cannot separate the two.
<P>
	What is the real problem? The real root that necessitates high 
taxes and prevents us from achieving the kind of society which 
we really want is government fiscal irresponsibility. We 
consistently spend more money than is brought in. These high 
taxes are detestable and they are a wedge that is coming between 
the ambitions of Canadians and the realization of their goals.
<P>
	The driving force that forces up taxes and that fuels the 
underground economy and that causes unnecessarily high 
unemployment and makes businesses and jobs pack up and flee 
the country and creates social unrest and crime and a general 
loss of confidence in our whole country drives up interest rates 
and depreciates our currency.
<P>
	The root cause is the fact that as a country we have lost control 
of our finances. We spend too much. Let us not blame anybody. 
We are in this together. High taxes are destroying jobs and they 
are destroying social programs because they destroy the 
initiative of the people and their desire to invest and work.
<P>
	The common sense of the common people could have foretold 
us our fate. Do we seriously believe we can continually spend 
more money than we bring in? Can we keep borrowing from our 
neighbours, from businesses and from other countries? 
Someone, some time, has to pay.
<P>
	Many of my hon. colleagues from the other parties in this 
House will on almost every subject in this House Reformers talk 
about the same thing, fiscal responsibility. Why are they stuck 
on that? Let me explain why.
<P>
	We are focused on the financial matters of this country 
because we want Canada to decide its own future and not destroy 
it. We want Canada to have the best social programs and 
infrastructure, the most beautiful environment, the best jobs and 
incomes for its people. We are not going to get it the way we are 
going now. We cannot achieve a socially and income secure 
society for ourselves and for our families and future generations 
by continually demanding more.
<P>
	We cannot withdraw from what will happen. We will 
eventually deny ourselves and our children everything that we 
are trying to preserve. We have to decide now how we are going 
to adjust our lifestyles, that we are going to tighten our belts and 
that we are going to expect less. It is really a cruel hoax on all 
our fellow Canadians to let them think that we can continue as 
we are. It is wrong.
<P>
	It is a lot of fun to talk about spending, talk about social 
programs, to talk about women's rights and minority rights and 
immigrant rights and refugee rights, criminal rights, language 
rights, universal social programs like health care and day care 
and many other noble causes which some other group might feel 
is deserving money. It is fun to talk about those things and plan. 
The final result is that somebody has to pay.
<P>
	Occasionally we may sound apocalyptic when we talk about 
our nation's finances. Perhaps things will turn around. Maybe it 
will happen some day. Maybe it will happen soon. Perhaps our 
debt crisis will not become drastically worse. Maybe we will 
look back in 50 years from now at this session of Parliament and 
on the continual attention that Reformers gave to the 
government finances as overkill. Maybe we will look back and 
see it as that.
<P>
	I sincerely hope that happens. If it does it means we have done 
one thing, that we were able to control spending and taxes and 
bring in real fiscal reform. At the present time we are in a free 
fall. We are plunging downward. We are skydiving without any 
intention of opening our parachutes.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	I agree with the motion. Let us reform our tax system. Let us 
reform the GST. Let us slash personal income tax, corporate tax 
and payroll tax. Let us pretend for a moment that all govern-
<P>

<B><A NAME="3409"> 3409 </A></B>
<P>
ments were able to cut taxes; federal, provincial and property. 
Would Canadians not love us? We would be heroes. We would go 
from being  one of the highest taxed countries in the developing 
world to one of the least taxed.
<P>
	What would Canadians do with all the money that previously 
went to government? One can only imagine and we should 
imagine. Canadians want to be freer. Canadians want to be free 
to decide what to do with all their hard earned money. What if 
the government kept its greedy, grimy tentacles out of the 
people's pockets?
<P>
	Governments often have a philosophy that they have some 
absolute sense to know what is best for people. It is deceitful, it 
is dishonest and it is immoral. That ideology has manifested 
itself in the extreme repression of the former East Germany, 
Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and the Soviet Union, just 
to name a few. Such regimes were ruled by elites, elites who 
believed very strongly that they had the ultimate answer for a 
perfect society, indeed for a perfect world. Because of this elitist 
attitude they taxed to the max. Poor, hard working citizens had 
to pay the bills. There was very little regard for them. Their 
mental skills were seen as inferior.
<P>
	If Canadians felt that the government was spending their hard 
earned dollars in a responsible way and that these programs 
were good for all Canadians, they would jump on board. 
However, Canadians see governments misspending their money 
and they feel things are out of control.
<P>
	Canadians see government responding to policies and 
programs and funding any group or cause that will keep them in 
power. Our current system allows a majority government to 
implement policies to a myriad of controversial programs. Quite 
frankly, the government simply does not have a mandate for 
these programs.
<P>
	One example is the bilingual-multiculturalism notions that 
the government is inflicting on the nation. We have never had a 
referendum on official bilingualism or official 
multiculturalism. We simply have to accept these policies 
because the elites have told us it is good for us.
<P>
	When we question them we always get: ``If you don't like it, 
five years down the road you can throw us out''. However, if our 
leaders are accountable only every five years and not every day 
they end up representing the people only once every five years.
<P>
	The essence of democracy is that we must be accountable 
every day. We are usurping individual freedoms, choices and 
responsibilities in favour of some elitist version of ``what is best 
for them''. The guiding hand must come from the bottom not 
from the top. We need government to promote law and order, but 
the big disagreement comes over how and what amount of 
government we have. The Reformers call it the legitimate role of 
government.
<P>
	The legitimate role of government is to do for people only 
what needs to be done for them or they cannot do at all or as well 
individually or through non-government organizations. That is 
the legitimate role of government. If we want to have the best 
tax system in the world we must look at our expenditures. We 
must finance only  those services that Canadians cannot provide 
for themselves or through non-government agencies.
<P>
	In order to do that we must also have a different attitude 
toward government and a different attitude by our government 
toward ordinary Canadians. That is the only way we are going to 
have real tax reform.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am honoured to rise on this motion that has been 
brought forward by the member for Saskatoon-Clark's 
Crossing.
<P>
	In his motion he suggests that while the reform of the tax 
system needs to go ahead, it needs also to be harmonized and 
integrated with the reform of the Canadian system of social 
security.
<P>
	If we look at what is involved in reforming a tax system and 
what is involved in reforming a social security system we can 
see some very complicated and very difficult, long and tedious 
hard work to do.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	For instance, if we look at the GST, a very small portion of the 
taxation system that is now being reviewed with a view to 
changing it and making it better, we see that hours and hours of 
study need to go into it, consultation, hearing from the people 
affected by it.
<P>
	It would seem even this small area within the taxation system 
that needs to be reviewed takes a lot of work. We can imagine the 
effort it is going to take to completely review the entire tax 
system.
<P>
	At the same time, with the social safety net review the 
Minister of Human Resource Development has begun an 
unprecedented consultation across this nation with provinces, 
with citizens across this country to find out what they are 
thinking about these issues, what the problems are, what the 
needs of Canadians are.
<P>
	In this motion it is suggested that these two massive reviews 
be brought together. I see a lot of danger in this. This proposition 
in my view would delay reform in an interminable fashion, years 
to complete this type of integrated review.
<P>
	I am not saying that there is not overlap in specific areas 
between the taxation system and the social safety net system. 
For instance, we have the child tax benefit, child care expense 
deduction, the personal pension income credit, the age credit, 
the disability tax credit, the medical expense tax credit and there 
are certain other tax measures for people who have disabilities 
within the taxation system which assist with the social safety 
net.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3410"> 3410 </A></B>
<P>
	Where there are these links, they can be dealt with on their 
own. There does not have to be a complete linking of these 
reviews. What is so dangerous about this is that we can see that 
our present welfare system and much of our social safety net 
system are designed and have created dependencies across this 
country.
<P>
	Welfare and a lot of the housing and things like that, all the 
things that have gone together to compose the social safety net, 
have become a prison from which people cannot escape.
<P>
	I have gone around my riding a number of times before the 
election and after the election. When I talk to people who are on 
social assistance there is no doubt that they want to work. What 
is the biggest inhibitor to going to work? It is the dependency 
and the rules created and put in force dealing with welfare that 
keep people from being able to earn money, that keep people 
from using their initiative and drive to make better lives for 
themselves and their families, that keep people from having the 
dignity that comes with having a job and putting bread on the 
table.
<P>
	What worries me is that if these two major reforms are 
brought together the pace of reform is going to slow down to 
nothing. Then perhaps that is what the hon. member who is 
proposing the motion wants. Perhaps he wishes to keep a system 
in place that is going to prevent people from getting away from 
the dependencies that have been created by this very system.
<P>
	That cannot happen in this nation. It cannot happen in my 
riding. There are too many people who have been asking for 
years for the opportunity to get out of the system that presently 
holds them captive. We cannot take a chance that this type of 
reform will be derailed, that it will be stalled.
<P>
	We want to see a simplified tax system. We want to see an 
equitable tax system. We want to see the deficit go down. The 
Liberal Party has stated that it wishes to see the debt go down to 
3 per cent of the GDP within the first three years, but we want to 
see people go back to work. We have undertaken a number of 
initiatives to achieve that, whether it is our infrastructure 
program, whether it is a number of the small business 
initiatives, or whether it is other initiatives designed to get 
people back to work.
<P>
	I do not think we should delay what we are going to do any 
longer. I think the motion is designed to do exactly that, not to 
allow another generation to go forth before getting rid of a 
system that creates dependency. The people need to be free to 
succeed and the Government of Canada is committed to making 
that happen.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 96(1), the order is dropped from the 
Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 1.38 p.m. the House stands adjourned until next 
Monday at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
