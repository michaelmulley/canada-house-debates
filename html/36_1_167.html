<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CRIMINAL CODE 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK5">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 20 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-219, an act to amend the Criminal Code (using or 
operating a stolen motor vehicle in the commission of an 
offence), be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak in support of Bill C-219.  I know that justice 
issues are very important to my colleague from Wild Rose.  This 
bill is simple.  It is not rocket science.  A person stealing a 
vehicle to rob a bank will be subject to a third offence of 
stealing a vehicle to commit another crime.  That third offence 
will get an automatic one-year sentence added to the sentence for 
other offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already heard government members speak in opposition to 
this legislation.  That is most unfortunate, but not really 
surprising.  Once again this government sings the tune that it is 
in favour of safer streets and more secure communities, but when 
it gets down to the short strokes it typically fails to dance the 
dance and continues to maintain the status quo.  Government 
members are quick to cite support from the Canadian Association 
of Chiefs of Police when they happen to be on the same page, but 
they invariably ignore these same chiefs when additional 
protections are sought.  As mentioned by the member for Wild 
Rose, the chiefs themselves initially proposed this change to our 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice claims 
that Canadians are already well served by common law principles 
of sentencing and current legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to my initial example, yes, there is an offence for 
stealing a motor vehicle and, yes, there is an offence for 
robbing a bank and, yes, a judge considers both the theft and the 
robbery at sentencing.  However, we all know that multiple 
convictions virtually always draw concurrent sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-219 impresses upon those judges that they are to proceed 
as always by imposing an appropriate sentence, but that they are 
then to add another year to the total.  As part of their function 
they are to consider the wishes and instructions of parliament 
which, if it supports this bill, will serve notice to both 
potential offenders and the courts that the representatives of 
the people are seriously concerned with the theft of motor 
vehicles to commit other offences and we have decided to 
pronounce additional condemnation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out some of the justification for this proposal. 
According to Statistics Canada, some 178,580 vehicles were stolen 
in 1996.  The rate of vehicle theft has been increasing for eight 
consecutive years, nearly doubling since 1988.  In 1995-96 the 
cost of stolen vehicles and their components amounted to $600 
million.  That is $600 million a year for vehicle theft.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the solicitor general and the justice minister have 
received strong messages to introduce policy to reduce auto 
theft.  The problem is not just with auto as in car theft; there 
has been a large increase in the number of trucks stolen in 
recent years given the tremendous increase in popularity of 
minivans and sport utility vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These statistics reveal the nature of the problem of auto theft 
in Canada.  Of course not all stolen vehicles are subsequently 
involved in other crime.  This legislation addresses the problem 
of the more professional criminal, those who steal a vehicle and 
then continue on to other criminal activities.  Surely these 
individuals deserve extra attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I have learned here is this government's resistance to 
change.  It is most often quite content with the status quo.  It 
only moves on crises.  Another is its apparent policy of not 
permitting any individual member of this place to succeed in 
bringing forth change.  As a member of the committee on justice 
and human rights, I continue to see this government through 
ministers and parliamentary secretaries being unwilling to 
support private member initiatives, especially those of the 
opposition.  We can only hope that members of the government 
backbench will see the wisdom of Bill C-219. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition to the bill appears to be based solely on the 
reliance on present laws to properly address the problem.  If the 
present laws are doing the job, then why do we have this epidemic 
of motor vehicle theft?  Why do we have a proliferation of 
anti-theft devices for vehicles?  Why are manufacturers 
installing satellite tracking systems in many new vehicles?  Why, 
when we walk on virtually any urban street in Canada, do we see a 
variety of locking bars on steering wheels or little red lights 
flickering on the dashboard indicating that an alarm system is 
armed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same holds true for vehicles parked on residential driveways 
and even private garages.  Why, when we unwittingly brush against 
a car in a crowded parking lot, do we run the risk of setting off 
a chorus of sirens, whistles and klaxons?  Obviously the present 
laws and the present judicial discretion concerning sentencing 
are not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the Progressive Conservative House leader who said 
that it would toughen the criminal sanctions for those 
individuals who use a stolen vehicle to assist in the commission 
of their criminal act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many instances the government has gone out of its way to 
protect the rights of criminals.  It has been much slower to 
protect the security of the public.  We all recognize the tax 
burden on citizens.  We may not be so clear as to how, through 
increases in crime, citizens are expending an ever increasing 
proportion of steadily shrinking disposable income on protection 
devices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already mentioned anti-threat devices on motor vehicles. 
Home security alarms are just another example of costs to 
citizens which can be equated to taxes because the expenditures 
are brought about by the government's failure to provide 
sufficient protection for properties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Wild Rose through his private member's bill is at 
least proposing a method to attempt to protect Canadians from not 
only motor vehicle theft, but in some cases serious injury or 
even death.  He is merely asking for a consecutive sentence for 
those professional criminals who steal a vehicle in order to 
commit another crime.  Surely this is a laudable and long overdue 
initiative.  Surely its passage will cause some criminals to have 
second thoughts about stealing a vehicle to use in other crimes. 
Surely the sentence imposed through this proposal will act as a 
deterrent to others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I speak of this legislation I cannot help but compare it to 
another private member's bill which is presently before the 
justice committee.  I refer to Bill C-251, which seeks to impose 
consecutive sentencing on those convicted of multiple murders or 
sexual assaults.  We know that the vast majority of Canadians are 
in support of this initiative.  I would seriously believe they 
would also be in support of consecutive sentencing for those who 
steal a motor vehicle in order to commit another crime.  It only 
makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Wild Rose is fond of saying “We need more 
common sense in this place”.  We need to impress upon those who 
consider making a career of crime that we intend to deal most 
seriously with their multiple offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some numbers from my home city of Surrey, British 
Columbia.  Corporal Greg Roche of the Surrey RCMP auto theft 
division provided me with statistics for January 1 to October 31 
of this year.  During that period 3,161 cars were stolen, 823 
trucks, 75 motorcycles, and 62 other vehicles such as all terrain 
vehicles.  That is a total of 4,121 stolen vehicles.  If we 
exclude the motorcycles and others, we still have 3,984 cars and 
trucks in 309 days, or an average of nearly 13 vehicles each day. 
That is about one stolen vehicle for every 80 residents of 
Surrey.

</I></B></P><P align=left>About two years ago I was playing in a hockey tournament.  My 
wife and I left the arena around midnight, about a half hour 
before my daughter left with a friend.  Turning a corner, we saw 
a blaze of flashing emergency lights about five blocks ahead. The 
road was cordoned off two blocks from the scene but we could see 
a horrendous car wreck.  My heart leaped into my throat because 
this was the route my daughter would have taken home.  After an 
anxious few minutes spent taking a detour, we turned on to our 
street and saw her friend's car in our driveway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next morning I learned that police had called off a pursuit 
and parked their vehicles at the side of the road intending to 
stop a stolen vehicle headed their way.  The thief sped past them 
with his lights out, laughing and flipping them the finger.  He 
blew through a red light and T-boned a small car which was 
catapulted across the intersection and through a fence.  A middle 
aged woman on her way home from a church meeting died on impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was two blocks from my home and could just as easily have 
been my daughter and her friend.  They had just pulled into the 
driveway when they heard the impact.  The offender, in his early 
twenties, was well known to police for a long history of auto 
thefts and other crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members to support Bill C-219 and address just 
one facet of a problem that is epidemic and, in cases such as I 
have just described, tragic. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-219, an act to amend the Criminal Code, provides for 
amendments to Part IX of the code, Offences against Rights of 
Property. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who is proposing this amendment suggests a new 
and indictable offence of using a stolen motor vehicle in the 
commission, attempted commission or flight following commission 
of an offence.  Everyone who commits this indictable offence 
would be liable to imprisonment of a term of one year.  The 
proposal also provides that the sentence imposed for this offence 
be served consecutively to any other punishment imposed in 
respect of a different offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal does not, as the sponsor of the bill would have us 
believe, create a minimum jail sentence of one year when a stolen 
vehicle is used during the commission of a crime.  The Criminal 
Code is very clear in stating that “no punishment is a minimum 
punishment unless it is declared to be a minimum punishment”. 
This is subsection 718.3(2).  All that the proposal does is 
create a new indictable offence punishable by a maximum of one 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member sponsoring the bill raises the issue of 
increased car thefts.  He pointed out that 80% of the cars stolen 
are stolen for purposes of joy riding.  I would like to point out 
the following. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are already common law provisions under the Criminal Code 
with respect to theft, including theft of a motor vehicle, and 
to the related sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 334 of the Criminal Code, theft over $5,000 is an 
indictable offence carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years. 
Theft not exceeding $5,000 is considered an indictable offence 
with a maximum sentence of two years, or an offence punishable 
on summary conviction. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These provisions reflect parliament's recognition that theft of 
property is a serious offence.  In addition, any court which 
imposes a sentence upon an individual convicted of any criminal 
offence is already obliged to take into account the circumstances 
surrounding the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the fact that a stolen vehicle was used in the 
commission of an offence will invariably be considered as an 
aggravating factor in sentencing.  The conduct of utilizing a 
stolen vehicle in the commission or attempted commission of the 
offence will usually result in a harsher sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government supports the principle that those who use stolen 
motor vehicles in the commission, attempted commission or flight 
following commission of an offence ought to be punished. 
Moreover, in any case where the use of a stolen motor vehicle in 
a criminal offence endangers the lives or safety of others, the 
offender should be exposed to harsher penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However our current system, revamped in 1996 through Bill C-41, 
the sentences reform act, already provides the necessary 
flexibility in effectively tailored sentences to circumstances 
such as the foregoing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is perplexing to me that the issue of consecutive sentences 
continues to be raised in the House by certain members including 
the member responsible for the bill being debated today.  The 
government has already addressed the issue of consecutive 
sentences in its package of amendments to the sentencing 
provisions of the Criminal Code which came into force in 
September 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 718.3(4) of the Criminal Code currently provides 
judicial discretion to impose consecutive sentences, that is 
sentences served one after another, where appropriate, for 
example where the offender is already subject to a sentence of 
imprisonment or where the offender is convicted of more than one 
offence before the same court and several periods of 
incarceration are required. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this paragraph is subject to paragraph 718.2(c) of the 
Criminal Code, which provides that “where consecutive sentences 
are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or 
harsh”. This is the sentencing principle known as the totality 
principle. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also been held that a second crime committed while in 
flight from a first crime should be subject to a consecutive 
sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, jurisprudence has stated that where there are a number 
of different offences committed within a short period of time the 
offences should be grouped in categories and concurrent sentences 
imposed in respect of the offence in the same category but 
consecutive sentences for those imposed in respect of other 
categories, again bearing in mind that the total term should not 
be excessive.  This is consistent with the sentencing process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all levels of courts have recognized, including the Supreme 
Court of Canada, the sentencing process is an individualized one. 
The court exercises discretion based on the particular facts of 
the case before it.  The court tailors a sentence appropriate to 
the individual circumstances of the offences and the offender, 
after having taken into account such things as the aggravating 
and mitigating factors, the gravity of the offence, the degree of 
responsibility of the offender, and what sentences others have 
received for similar offences committed in similar circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, parliament has enacted provisions which address the 
purpose, principles and objectives of sentencing which serve to 
guide and structure the court's exercise of its discretion.  In 
particular, courts are instructed that the fundamental purpose of 
sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention 
initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a 
just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that 
include as their objectives the deterrents and denunciation of 
unlawful conduct.  Courts have all the required tools to address 
this situation at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be noted that while the problem of motor vehicle 
theft is international in scope, the recent international crime 
victimization survey conducted in 1996 revealed that Canada's 
rate of vehicle theft ranked as one of the lowest among 
industrialized countries.  In 1995, 18 out of every 1,000 
Canadian vehicle owners experienced a motor vehicle theft 
compared with a rate of 33 per 1,000 owners in England. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, a number of non-statutory measures have been 
developed to prevent motor vehicle theft in Canada.  These have 
been quoted as examples of reasons for needing more legislation 
but I think they are more appropriately alternatives to 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many police departments across the country have set up 
anti-theft programs involving visible stickers on car windows 
which signal to the police to stop the car when it is being 
driven between midnight and 6 a.m. and to check the driver's 
identification. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, car parts are marked and there are measures against 
the exporting of stolen vehicles. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These crime prevention programs designed to reduce car theft, 
together with existing criminal code provisions, provide a 
comprehensive scheme for addressing the use of stolen motor 
vehicles to commit crimes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more concerning is the constant occurrence during 
Private Members' Business of members proposing legislation based 
on the assumption that the criminal justice system is not working 
and that it is at a state where Canadians should be tremendously 
concerned about their public safety.  Granted it may be because 
of demographic reasons, but for whatever reason Canadian society 
is becoming one that is less and less violent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not serve the public interest well.  Not only this 
member but members from all parties bring forward private 
members' bills based on the assumption that the criminal justice 
system is not working.  That is a very misleading position for 
members to bring to the House. More study should be done as to 
the actual facts and statistics. Inasmuch as that may not be as 
politically expedient as the contrary, the public interest would 
be much better served. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise to address the House on private member's 
Bill C-219 as the justice critic for the New Democratic Party 
and, since it is a private member's bill, as an individual member 
of parliament from Cape Breton and Sydney—Victoria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill seeks essentially to do two things, as has already been 
commented upon by the previous speaker from the government.  It 
makes it an offence to use a stolen car in the commission of 
another offence.  It provides for consecutive sentencing of a 
person for a maximum period of one year should the individual who 
has stolen the car be convicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an interesting piece of legislation.  The hon. member for 
Wild Rose was well intentioned when he prepared and submitted the 
bill to the House.  It says a number of things.  It speaks to a 
concern that has been addressed by the member for Wild Rose and 
other members in the House about crime and how we deal with 
crime.  As the hon. member prior to me indicated, it makes a 
provision for a maximum sentence of one year if a vehicle is used 
in the commission of an offence or while fleeing an offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who spoke prior to me is correct, at least in my 
experience, when he says that if a vehicle used in the commission 
of an offence is a stolen vehicle it is an aggravating factor in 
sentencing.  It does not detract from the private member's bill 
that has been introduced in the House by the member for Wild 
Rose.  It is a reality.  It needs to be said that in the 
commission of an offence, whether that offence is break and 
enter, robbery or whatever, if the offender has used a stolen 
vehicle it comes to the attention of the judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It comes to the attention of the judge in a number of ways. 
First, the prosecutor will bring it to the attention of the 
judge.  Second, and in my experience of some years as a criminal 
lawyer, in most cases the individual will also be charged with 
theft over a certain amount in addition to the offence for which 
he or she has been convicted, as referred to by the hon. member. 
That in and of itself is another criminal offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a specific offence under section 335 of the 
Criminal Code which says that subject to subsection 1.1 every one 
who without the consent of the owner takes a motor vehicle—and 
it goes on to define that—or is an occupant of a motor vehicle 
that is taken without the consent of the owner is guilty of an 
offence punishable on summary conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes it is helpful for people watching or listening to the 
debate, or those reading <I>Hansard</I>, to have an example 
because the Criminal Code is such a complicated document.  I 
practised criminal law for some 14 years.  It is a comprehensive 
and complicated piece of legislation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT6"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT6"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1130

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example of an individual who commits a break and 
enter with a stolen vehicle, not into a dwelling house but into a 
place of business.  That offender would be charged under section 
348 of the Criminal Code and would be subject, because it is not 
a dwelling house, under an indictable offence, to a term not 
exceeding 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member for Wild Rose has his way and his bill becomes 
law, the use of the stolen vehicle would add another year to that 
sentence.  I do not think it would make a huge difference when 
one looks at the other sections of the code, which make it an 
offence to steal a vehicle in any event— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Who gets 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  I am asked who gets 10 years.  Again, 
sentencing is a complicated factor.  Some people get five, some 
people get seven.  Even if the offender were sentenced to a 
lesser amount—and I am not taking away from Bill C-219, I am 
just providing an example—it would add one additional year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no great problem with that.  I do not think that is 
necessarily a bad thing.  I think it would bring home how wrong 
it is to use a stolen motor vehicle in the commission of an 
offence.  It would add that one year penalty.  I would submit 
that in most cases there would be an additional period of time in 
any event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I have no problem with the bill.  It seems to me that 
it is simply codifying what happens in common law, except—and 
this is one area that I think is worthy of some discussion and 
some thought—it makes it a mandatory consecutive sentence, as 
opposed to providing the judge with the discretion to make it 
concurrent.  Even at that I have no great problem with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do have a problem with some of the motivation.  I 
only say this because it is an ongoing debate as to whether or 
not increased penalties prevent crime.  I appreciate where the 
hon. member is coming from when he says that it will teach a 
lesson to those who decide to steal a car in order to commit a 
crime.  For those very few offenders who do in a premeditated and 
calculated way determine that they are going to steal a vehicle 
to commit an offence it may in fact be a deterrent.  However, the 
vast majority of individuals who come before the court because of 
the commission of a criminal offence rarely plan it.  In fact, 
they say that is why most of them get caught.  It is a spur of 
the moment, poorly thought out action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a criminal action, nonetheless.  It is a serious action, 
nonetheless.  But the very real argument that there would be 
general deterrence or specific deterrence by saying “Listen, 
buddy, when you decide you are going to steal that car to commit 
an offence, you had better think twice because you are going to 
end up serving consecutive time for the commission of the 
offence”, that thought process does not happen.  Nine times out 
of ten, I would venture to guess, the vast majority of stolen 
vehicles are stolen on impulse and they are stolen to commit 
another crime that happens on impulse.  The reality is that 
offenders do not sit down to calculate how much time they might 
serve for the commission of an offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know they are committing an offence which is why it is 
wrong.  They ought to be punished for it.  But if members of the 
House think they are going to be able affect the thought process 
of those who commit offences, it simply is not going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rehabilitation is an aspect of sentencing that is rarely 
addressed by these kinds of bills.  Rehabilitation is what 
happens to the offender after the commission of the offence. 
Hopefully it teaches them not to commit that offence by 
addressing the root causes of the offence.  Rarely in the debates 
on these kinds of bills are the issues of rehabilitation 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was another bill mentioned by hon. members in this debate 
that had to do with consecutive sentencing.  I have read the 
speeches on that bill given by the mover.  It is a different 
bill, so I will not address it too long.  However, nowhere in his 
comments in the House of Commons does the mover of that bill talk 
about rehabilitation.  Until we address that problem, simply 
thinking that we can scare those who would offend by increasing 
sentences is simply not going to solve the problem.  That being 
said, for the victim whose car is stolen, if they are seeking 
some kind of retribution, I suppose the one year sentence makes 
sense.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For the most part, the one year sentence, whether it be six 
months, eight months or a year, will be calculated by the judge 
in determining the sentence if a motor vehicle is used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a worthwhile point of discussion.  It is an interesting 
bill.  It is motivated because the hon. member has heard from his 
constituents and chiefs of police who support it.  As a lobby 
group, the chiefs of police come from a particular point of view, 
as do other lobby groups which try to effect bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members say that chiefs of police come from a lobby group 
that protects society.  They do.  The John Howard Society is a 
group that wants to protect society in a different way.  The key 
for parliamentarians is not to be dictated to by either lobby 
group, but to find the balance that reflects the will of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for introducing the bill.  It has given 
us some thoughtful discussion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today to support Bill C-219.  I commend the 
member for Wild Rose for submitting this private member's bill. I 
believe it is required in our society to send a message to those 
who have a tendency or an intent to commit crimes, and in this 
case to do so with stolen vehicles.  Therefore, I commend him for 
bringing it forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former police officer, I have to say that I can see a great 
deal of merit in this bill.  I have had experience dealing with 
young offenders who are intent on breaking the law, stealing 
motor vehicles, taunting the police and recklessly driving 
without being chased just to get the attention of the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early part of my career I saw a number of minor motor 
vehicle thefts increase to up to a thousand a month in the city 
of Calgary alone.  That was experienced in every city across this 
country.  There was no deterrent sentencing.  The young offender 
would laugh at the thought of even being caught in a stolen motor 
vehicle.  They would deliberately commit some infraction and look 
for the police so they could taunt them into chasing them.  That 
is a very harsh way of dealing with the freedoms of this country 
and the young offenders are not being treated accordingly by the 
courts to deter such criminal activity.  There needs to be a 
deterrent.  Bill C-219 is a step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Approximately 80% of the vehicles are recovered.  Eighty per 
cent of vehicles are used for joy riding or crime and then they 
are dumped.  In other words, they are recovered, but there is 
still a cost to the insurance company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other 20% are often used for things other than crime.  They 
are often sent overseas.  They are dismantled for parts.  Or they 
become part of some other country's economy.  It is unbelievable 
the number of stolen vehicles that leave this country to become 
part of another country's economy.  All we have to do is go to 
either one of the coasts where there is a port and look at the 
container traffic.  In those containers there may be two or three 
stolen vehicles.  It is something that the police cannot get a 
handle on.  They know it is happening in a substantial way, but 
they cannot get a handle on it because it requires extra 
resources.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think anyone caught in a stolen vehicle, let alone committing 
another criminal offence, should have another year added to their 
sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who spoke just before me mentioned sentencing for a 
break and enter.  If a person was caught in a stolen vehicle and 
had just broken into a shop, that would certainly bring a 
sentence of 10 years.  I do not know of anyone who received 10 
years for breaking into a shop.  I do not even know of anyone who 
got 10 years for breaking into a house, let alone breaking into a 
shop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judges already have the latitude to hit an offender with a 
substantial sentence, but they do not take that opportunity.  It 
is like politicians.  They have to be forced to do something. 
Most of the time they are forced to do something after their 
constituents get fed up with the way things have been going.  In 
my respectful submission, this also applies to judges.  They say 
they have to go back to case law where it tells them that they 
have to do this or do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where on earth does case law come in when a person is charged 
with half a dozen car thefts and a few cases of break and enter? 
The court then decides it is not going to sentence the person for 
the six cases of break and enter or the six auto thefts, but that 
it will apply global sentencing which may amount to what they 
would get if they had stolen one car and broken into one shop. 
That is what is happening in our courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provisions for minimum sentencing must be brought into law.  If 
an offender is responsible for car theft, then he should get a 
minimum of one year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, I believe this bill is suitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember a recent jailbreak from the Drumheller penitentiary 
where five inmates went on the lam.  One inmate was responsible 
for killing a police officer.  Another one was charged and 
convicted of manslaughter.  Two others had been charged with 
robbery and the last one had been charged with break and enter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They stole a car to get away from the prison.  They drove it as 
far as Cochrane, which is about 100 miles outside of Drumheller, 
dumped it and stole another car.  They then drove the second 
stolen car to Coquitlam in British Columbia where they decided to 
commit one armed robbery and one robbery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They stole another car which they drove throughout southern 
British Columbia and then committed another armed robbery in the 
central part of British Columbia.  Here are five inmates on the 
lam.  What happens to them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should receive a one year sentence for every car they 
stole, not some global sentencing that throws it all together 
into one, which amounts to a few months more in prison.  That is 
not what should happen, but that is what is happening in our 
courts and that is the way the authorities have handled it.  I 
think it is time for change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to put a screeching halt to what is going on right now 
by introducing minimum sentencing in our legislation that will 
change the minds of judges who think they have so much discretion 
or that they have to do what their predecessors have done, with 
maybe only one other ruling, and put an end to this whole aspect 
of global concurrent sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the meeting in 1996 which involved the Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police would welcome such a bill.  They 
would now feel that they are finally getting some support from 
this House when they stand to speak.  The police are charged with 
a very serious responsibility which is to protect society.

that they have a problem on our streets and they want some help. 
It is only the politicians that can actually correct this 
problem.  They can bring in laws which will be much more 
demanding and place the responsibility on the shoulders of those 
who commit crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members of the House to consider the merits of Bill 
C-219.  I am confident that if they do so they will see the bill 
is a step in the right direction. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak in support of Bill C-219, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code with respect to using or operating a stolen motor 
vehicle in the commission of an offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although my party and the Reform Party do not agree on the 
remedies in the justice system, we agree that there are many 
problems in our justice system.  We agree that the Liberal 
government is not always there for Canadians to strengthen the 
Criminal Code and to toughen provisions when needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned by previous speakers, the bill would amend section 
334 of the Criminal Code.  The purpose of the amendment is to 
classify those found guilty of operating or using a motor vehicle 
which a person has stolen or knows to have been stolen while 
committing an indictable offence, during flight, or committing or 
attempting to commit an indictable offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sentence for such an offence would be a term of imprisonment 
for one year.  It would also require that the sentence be served 
consecutive to any other punishment if it arises out of the same 
set or series of events that contributed to the conviction of the 
first offence.  All that is to say in plain language that there 
would be a greater emphasis placed on an offence committed when 
using a stolen vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who state there are already existing Criminal Code 
provisions which effectively address this problem are incorrect. 
The existing provisions may reference the problem it enforced, 
but the reality is that we need to put greater weight in the 
Criminal Code to deter those who use stolen vehicles to break the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member's effort in this regard.  I am 
supportive of the bill, as are all members of the Progressive 
Conservative caucus.  It is a positive measure because it 
addresses two key areas in which there is a need for improvement 
to our Criminal Code.  It would toughen criminal sanctions for 
individuals who have stolen vehicles to assist in the commission 
of their criminal acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be a welcome change because it punishes criminals 
additionally for the additional step they have taken, namely 
having stolen a vehicle to commit another offence.  The use of a 
stolen vehicle is as much a crime as any other criminal act and 
it can be punished separately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of the intended amendment proposed ensures that the 
sentence imposed on the criminal, namely the driver, would be 
served consecutively.  It is very much a truth in sentencing 
provision.  For example, if someone is found guilty of an offence 
under this proposed provision the sentence would be cumulative. 
It would be served consecutively as opposed to concurrently. This 
would send a strong message to thousands of Canadians who lose 
their vehicles to theft or someone who would commit a robbery and 
forcefully take their vehicles.  It would bring about greater 
accountability.  It would certainly send that message to the 
criminal element. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crimes involving personal property such as stolen vehicles are 
particularly offensive to the victims.  People, for obvious 
reasons, attach a great deal of importance to their vehicle as a 
mode of transportation.  When that vehicle is stolen and often 
damaged or never recovered, the person is generally 
inconvenienced.  There is also that psychological feeling of 
invasion which people experience when their property is taken or 
damaged.  It is similar to when a person's home is invaded.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Progressive Conservative caucus feel that other 
amendments are needed to the Criminal Code to deal with crimes 
involving personal property.  Last month my colleague from 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough introduced Motion No. 515 which 
called for an amendment to the Criminal Code to include the 
offence of home invasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Progressive Conservatives also believe in a rigorous application 
of the principle of truth in sentencing.  If someone commits a 
crime, he or she should be punished for that crime.  That is why 
our caucus also supports the efforts of the member for 
Mississauga East in obtaining passage into law of Bill C-251. The 
purpose of the hon. member's bill is to amend the code to put 
greater emphasis on an existing offence.  I believe this is 
positive.  I would therefore hope that there is support for this 
bill which is votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to remember, however, that no matter how well 
intentioned legislation is it will go nowhere without the ability 
to implement and enforce it.  I would therefore like to outline 
some concerns with respect to the government's persistent 
underfunding of law enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister and the solicitor general often state that 
public safety is a priority with the government.  Instead of 
talking, the government could do a lot to demonstrate its 
commitment to public safety by supporting legislation such as the 
initiatives brought forward by the member for Wild Rose, the 
member for Mississauga East and the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government should pay greater attention to what our police 
community is saying.  Quite bluntly, police officers are getting 
the shaft from the Liberal government.  According to the 
information revealed by the government's own organized crime 
summit in April, the national police service needs an additional 
$200 million over the next four years or it will functionally 
expire.  That will have an impact on every part of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already seen a situation evolve where large detachments 
of the RCMP are underfunded.  Even worse, the force's overall 
budget for the fiscal year is $10 million short to date and the 
RCMP cadet program has been frozen for the rest of the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly the government has for many months displayed a callous and 
reckless attitude in its approach toward fighting crime.  This is 
a time when the Liberal government seems oblivious to the 
negative consequences of the government's disbanding of the ports 
police, as we saw in Halifax and Vancouver.  We are also seeing 
an increasing amount of drug smuggling and illegal contraband 
material coming into Canada through out ports.  Yet this decision 
was made and followed through against the wishes of many in the 
community who knew what the ramifications could be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general and the Liberal government decided to cut 
$74.1 million from the RCMP's organized crime budget for this 
fiscal year, according to the government's own estimate 
documents.  That is not leadership in providing resources to our 
law enforcement community.  That is a 13% cut in one fiscal year 
of overall dollars dedicated by the RCMP to fight organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP is not the only police force that feels the effects. 
Municipal and provincial police forces inevitably are forced to 
pick up the slack.  More download.  Many of these forces are 
already burdened by the abandonment of ports police and are 
struggling to fill the void left by the negative decisions of the 
government.  The Liberal government should stop downloading its 
financial responsibilities to support young offenders programs 
and services on the backs of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Young Offenders Act came into effect in 1984 the 
federal government guaranteed that it would assume 50% of the 
costs.  Today the federal government only picks up 30% of that 
tax with the provinces and territories assuming the remaining 
70%.  Is it any wonder the Minister of Justice cannot get 
provinces onside to replace the Young Offenders Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I support Bill C-219 I hope government members find the 
will to vote in favour of the bill.  I reiterate the call for the 
government to stop its destructive policies with respect to our 
frontline police officers.  Talk is cheap.  The law enforcement 
community needs action.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member opposite on his initiative.  I 
congratulate any member who has enough fortitude to put his 
thoughts in writing and to reduce them to a bill so that they can 
be debated in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While many members opposite might evaluate the bill on a variety 
of criteria, I evaluate the bill on its merits rather than on its 
politics.  I do not propose to rant about everything that is 
wrong in the criminal justice system or everything that appears 
to be wrong in the criminal justice system.  I say at the outset 
that the bill has nothing to do with RCMP budgets, young 
offenders legislation or a number of other items that are 
continually raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to direct the attention of the hon. members to the 
Bill C-219 which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every one who, while committing an offence or while attempting to 
commit an offence or during flight after committing or attempting 
to commit an offence, operates or uses a motor vehicle that he 
has stolen or knows to have been stolen is guilty of an 
indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of one 
year. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second section indicates that it will be a mandatory 
consecutive sentence.  In and of itself it appears to be a good 
initiative.  Were it to be taken in isolation, I would say it is 
a good initiative which deserves a lot of merit.  That is on the 
presumption that the Criminal Code is silent about the issues 
addressed in the bill: the issues of auto theft, using a stolen 
vehicle in the commission of a crime, et cetera.  My suggestion 
is that the Criminal Code is far from silent on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I direct the attention of hon. members to subsection 322(1) of 
the Criminal Code, entitled the theft section: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every one commits theft who fraudulently and without colour of 
right takes, or fraudulently and without colour of right converts 
to his use or to the use of another person, anything, whether 
animate or inanimate, with intent, 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) to deprive, temporarily or absolutely, the owner of it, or a 
person who has a special property or interest in it, of the thing 
or of his property or interest in it; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the overall global section attributable to the 
particular issue the hon. member raises.  The more specific 
section is offences resembling theft and addresses the issue of 
motor vehicles: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every one who, without the consent of the owner, takes a motor 
vehicle or vessel with intent to drive, use, navigate or operate 
it or cause it to be driven, used, navigated or operated (or is 
an occupant of a motor vehicle or vessel knowing it was taken 
without the consent of the owner) is guilty of an offence 
punishable on summary conviction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is a subsection which I will not read to hon. 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I caution hon. members that when one is in a criminal court 
dealing with issues such as this one, this is the kind of dry 
legalese that is dealt with by judges on each and every day.  The 
judges have to make decisions as to particular sections of the 
offence, the most relevant of which is whether the individual 
took the motor vehicle with intent.  I adopt the view of the 
member opposite, the justice critic, who said something to the 
effect that some offences were in large measure without intent 
whatsoever, that in fact the individuals are more pathetic than 
anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final section is with respect to how a judge arrives at a 
sentence.  This deals with subsection (2) of the proposed bill. 
It is dealt with in section 718 of the Criminal Code: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental purposes of sentencing is to contribute, along 
with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the 
maintenance of just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just 
sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) to denounce unlawful conduct; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing 
offences; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection (2) goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into 
consideration the following principles: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any 
relevant, aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the 
offence or to the offender, and, without limiting the generality 
of the foregoing. 
</UL></UL>
<It then goes on to list considerations to which a judge has to 
address his or her mind. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Criminal Code were silent on this matter, then the hon. 
member opposite would have a good point.  But the Criminal Code 
is not silent.  The Criminal Code is in and of itself a perfectly 
adequate piece of legislation to deal with the offences being 
complained about. This is not to minimize or to suggest that the 
offences and concerns raised by the hon. member are not important 
concerns, nor is it to trivialize them or to consider them 
frivolous.  On the contrary, these issues are of unique and 
considerable importance to Canadians and their justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The manner by which the member attempts to accomplish his 
perceived goal is possibly naive.  If anything it is 
counterproductive.  If he expects this bill will reduce the 
incidence of auto crime I would suggest he is quite naive.  A lot 
of auto crime or so-called joy riding is impulse crime.  It is 
crime done with very little forethought by foolish people.  If 
the hon. member thinks this bill will reduce the incidence of 
foolish people in our society, I would suggest that he explain 
himself a little more on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member needs to think again if he thinks consecutive 
sentencing is the be all and end all to all of our sentencing 
woes in Canada.  The understanding among crown prosecutors, 
defence counsel and judges is that for any particular kind of 
offence there is a bit of a sentencing envelope.  Within that 
sentencing envelope one will receive his or her sentence. That 
sentencing envelope is somewhat carefully crafted, with section 
718 in mind, as the individual either pleads guilty or is found 
guilty before a judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the judge hears the representations with respect to the 
sentencing, he or she takes into consideration all of the 
principles in section 718.  There is the need to denounce the 
unlawful conduct, the need to create a safe society, the need to 
deter this kind of offence.  Those are the kinds of principles 
that are taken into consideration within the sentencing envelope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wishes to add a year, which is what a 
consecutive sentence is, I would suggest that on the other side 
something will get discounted because the offence will not stand 
in and of itself.  The offence is contemplated to stand with 
other offences.  The consequence will be that the actual offence 
may get discounted while the judge takes into consideration his 
obligation to impose a consecutive sentence. That is ultimately 
the flaw of the bill in its sentencing principle if 
intellectually you can get over the point itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the hon. member addresses an issue that is of concern to 
Canadian society and to all of us, he does not do it through this 
bill.  It removes all discretion from judges.  The bill is not 
necessary.  It is counterproductive and ultimately I would 
suggest it is quite naive.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
naive, I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak on behalf of victims.  I have been a 
victim of vehicle theft, as have other members I am sure.  I will 
relate my story and its outcome to show one of my difficulties in 
trying to understand how our legal system works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is noon.  My company vehicle, filled with stock and 
equipment, is stolen. 
Not just the stock and equipment, but the vehicle to go with it. 
The police are called.  After five hours and no action, I went 
out looking for the vehicle myself.  Where did I find it?  It 
drove right by me, right in front of my office.  I found the 
vehicle myself.  With a cell phone and modern communications I 
had the police there within minutes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of this story is not that the vehicle or the stock and 
material were gone but it is about the person who did it. When he 
was captured and collared by the police he said “Whoa, three 
months, I need a rest, and I will be out of there”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He stole a vehicle with some $10,000 worth of test equipment and 
expensive gear inside it and he was out running around peddling 
it. By the time I caught him, half of the equipment was gone. 
Besides doing that, he ran from the police, rammed a police car 
and two other vehicles and this individual is going to be out in 
three months.  Why?  Because we have a legal system that packages 
everything together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really think this is a perfect example for the bill from the 
member for Wild Rose.  It is absolutely spot on.  Give him one 
year—

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>APPOINTMENT OF COMMISSIONER OF OFFICIAL LANGUAGES 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK16">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in accordance with subsections 49(1) and 49(2) of the Act 
respecting the status and use of the official languages of 
Canada, Chapter O-3.01 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985, 
this House approves the appointment of Dr. Dyane Adam as 
Commissioner of Official Languages for Canada for a term of 
seven years. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: First of all, Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the House and all 
Canadians, I would like to convey to Dr. Victor Goldbloom, the 
present Commissioner of Official Languages, our gratitude for 
his many years of devoted service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The job of Commissioner of Official Languages is an extremely 
important one.  Parliament created this position in order to 
protect and promote one of Canada's distinguishing 
characteristics, its two official languages.  The Commissioner 
of Official Languages is a special ombudsman reporting directly 
to the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner's mandate consists in protecting and promoting 
the language rights of individuals and groups in Canada, and in 
monitoring the language performance of federal institutions and 
other bodies covered by the Official Languages Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Commissioner investigates complaints and makes 
recommendations in order to ensure that Canadians' right to 
communicate with the institutions of the Government of Canada in 
either official language is respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also the commissioner's responsibility to inform Canadians 
about the Official Languages Act and his role within the 
Government of Canada, with a view to encouraging it to ensure 
that both of our official languages are respected, protected and 
promoted. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the commissioner is clearly focused on people.  The 
commissioner meets regularly with Canadians of all ages and 
conditions in every province, working with them to enhance 
respect for our two official languages. 
The commissioner also meets with officials from the various 
orders of government and individuals from the private, community 
and academic sectors.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner also plays an important role in assisting 
official language minority communities in developing and 
enhancing their vitality and obtaining the rights guaranteed them 
by the Constitution and by the Official Languages Act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Dyane Adam clearly has the skills and the experience needed 
to perform the duties of this position well.  She has played a 
vital role in the area of official languages for many years. 
She is familiar with the situation of official languages right 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Adam was involved in founding a number of provincial and 
regional organizations and participated in a number of 
francophone and women's projects across Canada.  Need I mention 
that she will, on her appointment, be the first women to occupy 
this prestigious position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Adam helped found the Réseau de chercheures féministes de 
l'Ontario français and is a member of a number of organizations 
including the Regroupement des universités de la francophonie 
hors Québec.  For three and a half years, she chaired the 
advisory committee on francophone affairs of the Ontario 
Ministry of Education and Training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure all members will agree with me that Dr. Adam has an 
impressive track record and is the ideal candidate with her vast 
knowledge and passionate interest in promoting the protecting 
the language rights of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This appointment takes effect in August 1999.  Dr. Goldbloom has 
already agreed to assume an acting capacity, the details of 
which will be arranged in the next few days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members to support the motion to appoint Dr. 
Dyane Adam to the position of Commissioner of Official Languages 
for Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak to this motion for a number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the pleasure to attend the official languages committee 
last week to which Mme Adam presented herself and made her 
qualifications open to the committee. I am really quite 
impressed.  Over the number of years I have been interviewing 
people at all levels, professionals in particular, Dyane Adam was 
particularly well suited for the interview and the job.  I was 
quite impressed with the way she handled herself through the 
interview.  Indeed she was calm, cool and collected, which she 
may have to be in her new job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My compliments go across the way.  It is very unusual to hear 
that from me, however my colleagues on the other side have been 
open enough and secure enough in this day and age to put officers 
of the House of Commons, to put jobs and people before a 
committee where they can be interviewed.  Originally when we 
talked about this process concerning the privacy commissioner and 
the information commissioner we said there was really nothing to 
fear but fear itself.  We have gone through these interviews now 
and we have in fact found that the selection process works in a 
normal way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Mme Adam, I think that had she not worked out in 
the interview, she would have known it and we would have known it 
and possibly we would have parted ways at that point.  But the 
contrary did happen and she did rather well indeed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does have the support of this party to have her 
appointed to the post of official languages commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While not new, the idea in the House of Commons where we talk 
about skills, abilities and qualifications as a first criterion 
for selecting people for jobs rather than who they know and what 
they did for the party and that sort of thing is the way to go. 
We do tend to get the best people for the jobs.  Someday in the 
not too distant future we may see that same process for people 
who are on parole boards or on other commissions.  I do not see 
that as unrealistic.  Perhaps my colleagues are now getting the 
drift that the process we have established is quite a normal 
process.  It happens in business every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My compliments to Dyane Adam on this job if she is appointed 
with the consent of the House.  My compliments to my colleagues 
in the selection process.  Although it is a majority government, 
my compliments to the Liberal government.  We know it did not 
have to do this.  It has gone through this process and it is here 
to stay.  That speaks well of everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Adam's resume is quite impressive.  I know the government 
House leader has spoken on some things in it.  I want to add a 
couple of things about her education.  She has a Ph.D. in 
clinical psychology, a masters in clinical psychology, a 
professional baccalaureate specializing in psychology and a 
bachelors degree with concentration in psychology, in and of 
itself enough to make most companies in the country wish they had 
somebody with those kinds of qualifications.  A few members in 
the House could probably use a bit of psychology assistance from 
time to time.  Perhaps we will call on her for things other than 
languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of her appointments include principal of Glendon College at 
York University, ministry of education and training, and 
Laurentian University.   She had a private practice in psychology 
in Toronto, Sudbury and Cornwall.  She was at the Cornwall 
general hospital and it goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do think the House of Commons has selected the best person for 
the job given the skills, abilities and qualifications.  My 
compliments to everybody who was involved in the process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that the Bloc Quebecois supports the government's 
motion to appoint Dr. Dyane Adam as Commissioner of Official 
Languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In accepting this nomination, Dr. Adam will establish two 
precedents, becoming the first woman to hold this office and the 
first person from outside Quebec to be appointed Commissioner of 
Official Languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Dr. Adam knows both Quebec and Canada. Born in Ontario, 
she worked in various Quebec regions before returning to her 
home province, where she has applied her talents and competence 
to serving the francophone community with intelligence and 
sensitivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next official languages commissioner knows that the Canadian 
Francophonie has many voices. At the Ontario consultation 
committee for francophone feminists, Dr. Adam unequivocally 
claimed the right of Franco-Ontarians to speak with many voices. 
In a paper presented at the seminar entitled “Visibles et 
partenaires”, Dr. Adam wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This consultation committee is a forum that adheres as closely 
as possible to a feminist vision of society, where the 
principles of justice, equity and respect for the diversity of 
experience of all Franco-Ontarian women prevail. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Adam also distinguished herself by her vision and her 
involvement in the Franco-Ontarian distance education network.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This network, which has included Ontario's bilingual 
universities since 1994, is a consortium whose purpose is to 
provide education services in French, at the university level. 
Dr. Adam also worked in the areas of health and communications, 
always striving to better serve her fellow French speaking 
Ontarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is confident that this woman will recognize 
that there are two minorities in Canada, namely the francophone 
communities outside Quebec and the anglophone community in 
Quebec. These two minorities live in very different contexts and 
must be treated in a way that promotes their full development 
and growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In several texts that she has written, including the one on the 
challenges of post-secondary education in Ontario, Dr. Adam 
clearly identified the features of the Franco-Ontarian community: 
small percentage of the overall population, assimilation rate of 
40%, scarce human and financial resources, isolation of 
francophone populations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could of course add more, but I am convinced that Dr. Adam, 
who is a former advisor with the Office of Franco-Ontarian

not provide more funding to the official languages support

<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-35, an act to amend the Special Import Measures 
Act and the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act, be read 
the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity 
to speak at third reading of Bill C-35. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been stated quite often in the House, this legislation is 
straightforward and responds directly to the recommendations 
contained in the 1996 parliamentary review.  It updates an act 
that has been around since 1984 and proposes consequential 
amendments to a related statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Briefly, Bill C-35 improves the operation of Canada's trade 
remedy system with respect to anti-dumping and countervailing 
duties under the Special Import Measures Act and the Canadian 
International Trade Tribunal Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also clarifies certain provisions in both acts through 
various technical amendments.  SIMA is an important component of 
Canada's trade legislation.  It implements Canada's rights and 
obligations under the WTO agreements in the area of trade 
remedies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under these international rules, special duties can be imposed 
when imports that are dumped or subsidized are found to cause 
injury to a domestic industry.  First and foremost, this law is 
intended to protect Canadian manufacturers and agriculture 
producers whose operations are negatively affected by the goods 
that are unfairly priced or subsidized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it must also be understood that in today's global 
environment market openness is critical to attracting investment 
and maintaining the competitiveness of Canadian companies.  These 
Canadian companies often have to rely on imported inputs to meet 
the needs of their customers.  These companies may, in some 
cases, be negatively affected by the imposition of special duties 
on imports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this situation, SIMA must be careful to strike a balance 
between two often conflicting interests, those of industry 
seeking trade remedy action and those of consumers and other 
manufacturers who may be negatively affected by the imposition of 
anti-dumping or countervailing duties on imported goods.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This question of balance was key to what was addressed in the 
1996 parliamentary subcommittees' report that reviewed SIMA.  The 
subcommittees heard from a broad range of stakeholders on their 
experience with the SIMA system and concluded that the law 
continued to protect Canadian producers from injury caused by 
dumped and subsidized imports, while at the same time limiting 
collateral damage to consumers and downstream users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They went on to identify several areas where the legislation 
could be made more efficient and more responsive to Canada's 
various economic interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, as hon. members will recall, supported virtually 
all of the subcommittees' recommendations and it is the 
implementation of these recommendations that we have before us 
today in Bill C-35. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As indicated earlier, the bill also contains several amendments 
of a technical or housekeeping nature aimed at clarifying 
existing provisions in the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main themes of the subcommittees' report reflected in this 
bill include:  the rationalization of the SIMA process in order 
to improve efficiency; ensuring access to the SIMA system by 
small and medium size enterprises; clarification of the public 
interest provisions; and the enhancement of transparency and 
procedural fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to spend a few moments on the public interest provisions. 
At the reporting stage, the issue of allowing the Canadian 
International Trade Tribunal to recommend a lesser duty as a 
result of a public interest inquiry was raised by the Bloc and 
the NDP.  They both opposed providing for it, and we recall that 
the Bloc proposed an amendment to the bill which would have 
amounted to leaving the public interest provision as it is now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially, the government responded by saying, as I said just 
a minute ago, that the bill implements the parliamentary 
subcommittees' recommendation in respect to the public interest 
and underscores the delicate balance that the bill was attempting 
to strike between divergent interests in the trade remedy area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially, the statement that I would make with respect to the 
public interest is that the lesser duty issue would only come up 
when it has been determined that there is a public interest 
issue.  When recommended, a lesser duty aims to provide a level 
of protection sufficient to eliminate the injury caused by the 
dumped or subsidized imports, which is really the main purpose of 
SIMA, while ensuring that users and downstream producers are not 
unduly penalized by the measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my mind, when I was listening to the debate at report stage, 
I asked the question:  How can one oppose this?  Those opposed to 
the lesser duty provision are suggesting that the interests of 
consumers and downstream producers are irrelevant.  As we stated 
earlier, and I will state again, the government clearly disagrees 
with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fine tuning the existing law, the investigative functions of 
Revenue Canada and the Canadian International Trade Tribunal will 
also better reflect the respective areas of expertise.  By 
bringing Revenue Canada's treatment of confidential information 
more in line with the tribunal's practice respecting the 
disclosure of such information, procedural fairness and 
transparency will be enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, the tribunal will benefit more fully from expert 
evidence by allowing expert witnesses to play a more effective 
role in its inquiries.  New penalties will deter the unauthorized 
disclosure or misuse of confidential information in the SIMA 
investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-35 also clarifies the conditions under which the tribunal 
can consider issues of broader public interest and the types of 
measures that it can recommend in a public interest report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the committee deliberations on this bill hon. members heard 
from industry stakeholders on both sides of this particular 
issue.  The stakeholders gave their support to the passage of 
this bill and there was agreement that Bill C-35 faithfully 
reflects the recommendations contained in the parliamentary 
report.  This support is a credit to members of the House who 
worked together on the review and this legislation and in fact 
identified improvements that were acceptable to all parties.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I think members recognize that Bill C-35 
fine-tunes SIMA to ensure that it continues to reflect Canadian 
economic realities.  It also ensures that SIMA will remain a 
strong trade instrument that truly protects Canadian producers 
who have been injured by dumped or subsidized imports, while 
allowing an opportunity for other producers and consumers to have 
their interests considered.  I urge my colleagues to support 
speedy passage of this legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to rise today to speak at third reading of Bill 
C-35, a bill which amends the Special Import Measures Act and the 
Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has been a long time in the making.  Two and a half 
years ago a special subcommittee was struck to conduct a 
mandatory review of the SIMA legislation.  I was a part of that 
subcommittee, as well as a former member of this House, Mr. Herb 
Grubel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agreed with the main components of the report, but we also 
issued a dissenting opinion.  The reason for it will be outlined 
as I walk through this process today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just before the House recessed for Christmas two years ago the 
subcommittee brought down its report which made a list of 
recommendations, most of which are included in the bill today.  I 
am not sure why the bill was delayed so long, but I welcome its 
appearance and I think it will help to clear up an area that 
needs to have more clarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports this bill, although we have raised 
some minor concerns with it.  We hope that, despite having our 
amendments struck down in committee, the changes to the SIMA 
legislation will strike the right balance in protecting producers 
and manufacturers without unduly hurting consumers, importers and 
downstream producers.  To that end, I certainly want to talk 
about the public interest component of SIMA, an area that we 
tried to strengthen in committee with an amendment that was not 
allowed.  Be that as it may, we are in general support of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a moment to explain what this bill is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under World Trade Organization rules all countries are permitted 
to impose duties on imported goods if those goods are being 
dumped into that country or if their production is being 
subsidized at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SIMA is the framework legislation which allows Canadian 
companies to request that anti-dumping and countervail duties be 
imposed against imported products which are found to be sold at 
too low a price or imported goods whose production is subsidized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The steps that need to take place to arrive at these duties are 
clearly laid out in the bill.  First, a Canadian company must 
file a complaint with Revenue Canada.  Once Revenue Canada is 
satisfied that the complaint is properly documented, it initiates 
an investigation.  The department then sends investigators to 
countries against which complaints have been filed and these 
investigators look into the books of those companies to ascertain 
whether there is sufficient evidence to establish whether or not 
there has been dumping or subsidization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the job of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal to 
conduct inquiries into whether dumped or subsidized goods are 
actually causing injury to Canadian producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, the CITT did not begin its job until Revenue Canada 
had determined that dumping had occurred.  This caused delays and 
allowed preliminary duties to be collected before the CITT ruled 
that injury to Canadian companies had actually taken place.  That 
process has been changed to the better.  The new legislation 
under SIMA changes that.  In future, the CITT will begin its work 
immediately and I fully support that process.  I think it will 
help to speed things along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said earlier that I was concerned about the public interest 
component.  After all, even though products are being dumped into 
Canada, there are times when I believe, in the public interest, 
that should be allowed to happen.  The basic concern I have with 
this legislation is that the interest of the public is not taken 
into account soon enough in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good example of this is in the recent baby food case.  Earlier 
this year Heinz, an American company with a subsidiary in Canada, 
charged Gerber, another American company, with dumping.  Heinz 
took its case before Revenue Canada and the CITT and won its case 
against Gerber. 
Gerber had a 60% duty slapped on it which effectively forced it 
out of the Canadian market.  That is one thing, but it left Heinz 
with a monopoly on baby food in Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT20"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT20"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1240

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime we have parents of babies in Canada who do not 
have time to prepare their own baby food and as result are left 
with only one brand of baby food.  My office received information 
that some babies could only be fed Gerber products because they 
were allergic to Heinz baby food products.  With Gerber pushed 
out of the market, the parents of those babies found that their 
interests had been overlooked.  This is only one example of how 
dumping duties hurt consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we create monopoly situations or lessen competition, that is 
a problem.  I want to make sure that this public interest 
component is taken into account and reviewed down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also instances where dumping duties have hurt 
downstream producers and importers.  It is not just exports that 
create jobs in Canada.  Imports create jobs as well.  Carpet 
distributors and importers in Canada have long complained that 
the entire dumping procedure has hurt their business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because carpet distributors have so many types of carpets coming 
into the country, with different weights, fibres and finishes, 
they are always unsure at the border what the dumping duty will 
be.  Therefore, these distributors find it difficult to bid on 
large contracts.  It is bad enough having to deal with exchange 
rate uncertainties and problems in Canada in terms of being 
competitive, but when duty fluctuates by 10% or more profits can 
often turn to losses in no time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Downstream manufacturers are also hurt when the cost of imported 
inputs suddenly rise because of dumping duties.  I have quite an 
active and aggressive company in my riding that imports a lot of 
components for the finished product they manufacture.  Those 
components come from the United States.  They are a big part of 
the total package, something like 65% or 70% of the end product. 
This company imports those products.  Dumping duties often hurt 
companies such as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was given assurances by the drafters of the bill during 
briefings that there was enough flexibility built into the bill 
to consider the public interest in a timely fashion.  But I 
believe this component should be examined again in a few years' 
time to ensure it is working properly.  It must balance the 
interests of those companies that require protection with those 
that will ultimately pay the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an ideal world, which everyone knows we do not have, dumping 
duties would not be necessary.  I would like to see the U.S. 
trade remedy law and this particular legislation rescinded down 
the road.  Canada's provinces do not have dumping duties against 
each other's products and, ideally, Canada and the United States 
should not have either because we have become very much an 
integrated market on many commodities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have sectors such as steel, beef and the automobile sector 
that essentially conduct cross-border trade via train and truck 
every day.  We are not talking about a typical example of dumping 
with 50 million metric tonnes of dumped steel arriving at a 
Vancouver port from an Asian country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trade between Canada and the United States is regular trade 
between a supplier and a business that requires that product on a 
daily basis.  So it is very hard to see how dumping duties do 
anything to satisfy that.  On the other hand, the United States 
continues to keep its trade remedy law, including dumping, and it 
uses it very aggressively.  As long as it does that, we have to 
keep that protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the first country in the world to ever 
use dumping was Canada.  We introduced the measure 80 or 90 years 
ago.  Now it is coming back to bite us.  Eventually I would like 
to see it phased out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the next round of World Trade Organization talks I would like 
to see a better definition of dumping and a better subsidies code 
to make sure we can all play with the same rule book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that a duty free world is quite a long ways away, 
but I would suggest that a duty free world between Canada and the 
United States is not that far away.  We should be working to see 
if something can be done in the integrated industries, as I said 
earlier, to make dumping and countervail duties unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports this legislation which has been a long 
time in the making.  We trust it will prove to strike the right 
balance that we are seeking to protect manufacturers and also to 
provide openness for our consumers and our downstream producers 
and importers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support this legislation and would like to see it move along 
fairly quickly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, like the 
two previous speakers, I am pleased to rise today in this House 
to speak to Bill C-35, an act to amend the Special Import 
Measures Act and the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we Bloc Quebecois members indicated in previous speeches, we 
support this bill. However, since we had some reservations about 
certain aspects of this bill, at report stage, we introduced a 
number of motions in amendment to try to improve it. But they 
were defeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These motions result from a study of the Special Import Measures 
Act done by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade and by the finance committee. I would like 
to briefly outline these motions, which reflect the issues on 
which we differed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Motion No. 1 read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-35, in clause 15, be amended by adding after line 21 
on page 10 the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(3.1) In determining whether the complaint is properly 
documented, the Deputy Minister shall not take into account 
representations received from parties other than the 
complainant.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of witnesses voiced concern during committee 
proceedings. The Canadian Steel Producers Association was one of 
these witnesses with concerns about certain provisions of the 
act. 
The Bloc Quebecois shares the concerns of these witnesses, which 
were asking that Revenue Canada ignore the unsolicited 
presentations by parties other than the complainant before the 
start of an investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such an approach would have Revenue Canada take into account 
only information coming from the complainant, without having to 
consider unsolicited comments from outsiders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach, which was rejected, seemed reasonable to us since 
it would apply only before an investigation was opened. 
Unfortunately, the government does not seem to care any more 
about our requests than about those of an industry as essential 
to the economy of Quebec and Canada as the steel industry. 
Therefore, it rejected this amendment, which will not be 
included in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-35 be amended by deleting Clause 27. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We considered that Bill C-35 should not contain provision for the 
minimum duty.  We think it is premature to include the concept 
of a minimum duty in the Special Import Measures Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think the government should stop approving policies that 
reduce the protection afforded Quebec and Canadian businesses 
when our main trading partners are not doing the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade recommended in its report—not one of the ones that was 
leaked—inclusion of the concept of a minimum duty in section 45 
of the legislation on  public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, clause 27 of the bill incorporates the concept of a 
minimum duty by amending section 45 of the existing legislation. 
Thus, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal may, on its own 
initiative, or on request, initiate a public interest inquiry if 
it is of the opinion that the imposition of an anti-dumping or 
countervailing duty, or the imposition of such a duty in the 
full amount provided for by any of those sections, in respect of 
the goods, would not or might not be in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of a public interest inquiry, if the tribunal is of 
the opinion that the imposition of a duty might not be in the 
public interest, the tribunal shall without delay do two things. 
First, it shall report to the Minister of Finance that it is of 
that opinion and provide that minister with a statement of the 
facts and, second, it shall cause notice of the report to be 
published in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>, which many people read every 
day without fail, as we all know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, in that same report, the tribunal shall specify 
either a level of reduction in the anti-dumping or countervailing 
duty provided for, or a price or prices that are adequate to 
eliminate injury, retardation or the threat of injury to the 
domestic industry. It is through this last measure that the 
concept of minimum duty is introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 4, 5 and 6 concern the notion of “material harm”. 
In our opinion, the definition of material harm was also 
problematical. 
The Bloc Quebecois called for insertion of a definition for the 
expression “material harm” into the Special Import Measures Act. 
This, coupled with the criteria suggested in the current

</I></B></P><P align=left>In Motion No. 4, we proposed, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-35, in clause 44, be amended by adding after line 46 
on page 33 the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(3.2) For the purposes of subsection (3.1), “material harm” 
means harm that is more than negligible and that is not 
immaterial or trifling.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also proposed to make reference to “material harm” in several 
other provisions, including in clause 44, line 46 on page 33, 
which would read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(3.2) For the purposes of subsection (3.1), “material harm” has 
the meaning given to that expression by the regulations.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also asked that the notion of “material harm” be applied to 
clause 51, through the following amendment: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—be amended by adding after line 18 on page 36 the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(f) defining the expression “material harm” for the purpose of 
section 44;” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very technical, but so is the bill, and this is why we 
had to conduct a thorough review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, had these amendments and improvements been included, the 
legislation would leave no uncertainty for Quebec and Canadian 
businesses. 
These motions are very important, because the bill is supposed 
to improve the Canadian system of special trade measures so that 
it can better reflect the new economic context and the changes 
in the rules of international trade, and leave no room for 
confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another Bloc Quebecois proposal ignored in this bill concerns 
the future or retroactive method of imposing duties. We wanted 
Revenue Canada to continue using the future method. However, we 
would, in cases where prices or costs are likely to fluctuate 
significantly, like to have Revenue Canada authorized to use the 
retroactive duty imposition method. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This method would be used only exceptionally and only when 
Revenue Canada considered it necessary. 
This is why we tabled Motion No. 7 in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read a passage from this motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-35 be amended by adding after line 42 on page 36 the 
following new clause— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, we referred to the prospective and retroactive 
methods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is very important as it governs the imposition of 
antidumping and countervailing duties on dumped or subsidized 
goods where this dumping or subsidizing has or may have an 
injurious effect on producers in Quebec and Canada, while at the 
same time making changes to the Canadian International Trade 
Tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need only think of our farmers on the Prairies, who are 
facing very definite problems with farmers in the northern 
United States, to realize how the border aspect of subsidies and 
dumping duties are a part of our daily lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interventions of Bloc Quebecois members during this study 
have already led to a few important changes and substantial 
improvements. We suggested, for example, concrete measures 
allowing small and medium size producers in Quebec and Canada to 
have fair, equitable and easier access to the redress procedures 
provided by the current legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also proposed improvements to the way the Canadian 
International Trade Tribunal operates.  The Bloc Quebecois also 
proposed that the cumulative effect be taken into consideration 
by the tribunal when assessing damages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the amendment of section 76 of the Special Import 
Measures Act, requiring the Canadian International Trade 
Tribunal to assess the cumulative injurious effects of dumping 
or subsidizing in the context of interim reviews was 
consolidated as the result of our interventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the intent of this bill, which marks the 
government's first effort to clarify things. Quebeckers and 
Canadians, as well as the Bloc Quebecois, have long been calling 
for less bureaucracy and more efficiency.  The government must 
give producers in Quebec and Canada the tools they need to 
compete in the global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dumping and subsidies are tools criticized, but often used, by 
industrialized countries. 
This legislation and the Canadian International Trade Tribunal 
Act are necessary, in fact essential tools to counter dumping 
and subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that these laws be designed in such a way as to 
appropriately meet the needs they were intended to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments should hopefully improve the Canadian trade 
remedy system so that it will better take into account the new 
economic context and the evolution of international trade rules.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike our colleagues across the way, who suddenly changed their 
tune after they took office five years ago, we in the Bloc 
Quebecois have always been in favour of free trade. We can 
therefore only applaud any steps taken to help ensure businesses 
in Quebec and Canada are full participants in this era of 
globalization, in a well-structured context based on appropriate 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, the Bloc Quebecois supports the principle of Bill C-35, 
which is to clarify the role of the Canadian international trade 
tribunal and to improve the Special Imports Measures Act. The 
review conducted by the subcommittees helped identify the 
improvements that should be made to these acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-35 will implement the recommendations included in the 
December 1996 report on the Special Import Measures Act which, 
as I said, was not leaked, and which the Bloc Quebecois greatly 
helped improve and fine-tune. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This review has identified a number of improvements which should 
be made to these acts, but more needs to be done, including the 
changes put forward by the Bloc Quebecois and by officials from 
various industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, in spite of some concerns, we are rather pleased with the 
bill and we will support it, as we did at the previous stages. 
However, as we said before, we feel that rapid developments in 
international trade emphasize the need to review these two laws 
on a regular basis in the future. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise on behalf of the New Democratic Party caucus to 
speak to Bill C-35, an act to amend to the Special Import 
Measures Act and the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act. 
Along with the Bloc Quebecois we oppose the bill, but we want to 
make clear that opposition in no way detracts from our overall 
support for SIMA and the work of the CTT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Special Import Measures Act remains one of the very few 
mechanisms we have in Canada to protect Canadian industry and 
jobs in the ongoing trade disputes we have with the United States 
in particular.  Because we live in an increasingly liberalized 
global trading environment, we support the bill in so far as it 
clarifies, streamlines and improves the Special Import Measures 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we oppose Bill C-35 in its totality because we honestly 
feel that what is before us has not strengthened the legislation 
sufficiently, in particular with respect to trade with the United 
States of America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some ways the bill may actually weaken SIMA as a protection 
against unfair trade.  As has been expressed by others, the main 
concern is the anti-dumping legislation.  It must be as strong on 
the north side of the 49th parallel as it is south of the 49th 
parallel.  In other words, our system must be as advantageous to 
Canadian producers as the U.S. system is to its producers.  We 
can afford to do no less in the protection of our country, our 
traders and our exporters.  I do not think the boy scout image 
will carry us very far in negotiations with the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trade wars between our two countries have continued unabated 
despite the free trade agreement and the North American Free 
Trade Agreement.  A few weeks ago and even last weekend we saw 
the spectacle of the U.S. violating international agreements, 
making it difficult for our processors and producers of grain and 
livestock to transport goods into the United States.  The first 
blockade was with the encouragement of elected U.S. legislators, 
but that was not true with the resumption of the blockade we saw 
this weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-35 may very well weaken SIMA and place our producers and 
shippers at a further disadvantage to their U.S. counterparts. 
The key concern would be implementing the World Trade 
Organization's definition of a lesser duty provision.  The 
concept of lesser duty as I understand it allows anti-dumping 
duties to be set lower than the injury faced by domestic 
producers.  There is a genuine concern that it will put Canadian 
producers at a further disadvantage. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect of it is the concept of material injury.  We feel 
that too is inadequate.  The U.S. employs a broad definition to 
provide greater scope for corrective measures.  For example, 
pasta that was dumped on both sides was found to cause injury in 
the United States but not found to cause injury in Canada.  The 
broader definition of the material injury has been pointed out as 
the reason for the different interpretations on either side of 
the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the report stage of the bill, we supported the Bloc 
because we wanted to clarify material injury and ensure that it 
was as tough north of the border as the U.S. definition. We 
regret sincerely that that was defeated at the report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also supported an amendment which would have enabled Revenue 
Canada to use retrospective duty assessment in cases when there 
would be significant fluctuation in prices or costs.  Once again 
we see that the United States uses the retrospective method in 
all cases which of course provides greater security for its 
domestic producers.  We regret sincerely that this amendment was 
also defeated at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We regret profoundly that Bill C-35 was not used to strengthen 
the Special Import Measures Act.  Does the government not 
recognize the inherent dangers our producers face?  When our 
protective system is weaker than that of our trading partners, we 
disadvantage our exporters, particularly with respect to the 
United States, and make ourselves a target for countries looking 
to dump into North America.  We expose ourselves to abuse from 
foreign exporters by our actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see a pattern that emerges time and again in Canadian trade 
law and in Canadian trade policies.  Whenever there is some 
liberalization to be done or some weakening of a nation state's 
ability to protect itself, Canada always seems to be the first to 
want to jump in with both feet.  We are always eager to play the 
game, so eager that we often leave ourselves vulnerable to other 
nations, in particular to our powerful neighbour to the south. 
It seems we just cannot get enough of this tickle me Elmo 
approach by other countries and then we are first to hail any new 
agreement as some kind of testimony to our free trading spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say with respect that the United States seems to have 
absolutely no respect for any agreement into which it enters. The 
United States is the last country to amend its laws in such a way 
as to conform to whatever other nations may be doing in order to 
liberalize trade. The U.S. has not adopted this lesser duty 
provision, but no, we will be the eager ones again.  We will be 
out there leading with our chins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This certainly gives an opportunity in the context of Bill C-35 
to say that we are not only opposed to the bill, but we are 
opposed to the entire approach that the government opposite has 
pursued with respect to trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has become totally uncritical about free 
trade in recent years.  The Liberals have become evangelists for 
the very notions they deplored when they sat on this side of the 
House.  After campaigning against the free trade agreement in 
1988 and in the years following, after being elected in October 
1993, the Liberal government promptly signed NAFTA. Since then it 
has become the cheerleader for additional free trade agreements 
around the world, whether it is signing on to the Canada-Chile 
free trade agreement, APEC, the free trade agreement with the 
Americas, the FTAA, the multilateral agreement on investment or 
the World Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ongoing crisis faced by Canadian farmers shows the danger of 
sticking our neck out as far as we do for the sake of this or any 
free trade deal.  The Liberal government went way beyond our WTO 
commitments to reduce farm support after the Uruguay round in 
1993, way beyond what the United States has done, and way beyond 
what the European Union has done.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians have a right to feel utterly betrayed.  The 
result is a disaster for our farmers.  We are now belatedly 
trying to rectify the damage that has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent deal the Liberals have chased after is the 
multilateral agreement on investment.  Fortunately other 
governments had better sense.  This fall various governments in 
the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 
rejected the MAI and the NAFTA model.  When they looked closely 
at NAFTA as the blueprint for the MAI, they wondered why Canada 
ever agreed to signing a deal like NAFTA. They wondered why 
anyone would be so keen to replicate NAFTA on a global scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caucus has been critical of this unthinking pursuit of free 
trade from the beginning.  We are not against fair trade.  We are 
not against trade agreements that incorporate into them real, 
meaningful and enforceable protection for workers, for labour 
standards, for environmental regulations and for the continuing 
ability of governments to act in the public interest.  It is 
because we believe in fair trade and the role of effective 
regulation that we support SIMA.  That is why we see the need for 
strong and effective mechanisms to protect Canadian producers and 
ensure a level playing field with the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we believe that Bill C-35 does not ensure this, 
so we do not support the bill.  We oppose it because we believe 
that overall we are facing a weaker SIMA, one that will put us at 
a disadvantage especially with respect to the United States. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
will make a couple of comments first then ask the member a couple 
of questions about Bill C-35. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at this bill we see a bill that tries to address 
the anti-dumping problem in the world where heavily subsidized 
foreign companies dump products into Canada and try to drive our 
businesses out of business.  We see the bill as a move in the 
right direction.  I do not claim that it is a perfect bill, but 
at least it does make that provision possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to detail a bit what he would rather see 
in this bill.  More importantly, because this comes before us in 
the form of a bill, we have a chance to debate an idea or a 
conclusion, in this case an act of parliament, that will commit 
Canadians to an international agreement for years to come.  That 
does not happen all that often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All too often people on behalf of the government wander off to 
different UN conferences, conventions, groups and backdoor 
meetings of all sorts.  Often they sign on to deals and there is 
no corresponding legislation in the House of Commons. We live 
with whatever those folks negotiate behind closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MAI is a good case in point.  People were very nervous about 
the potential of the MAI. Although I must admit that Canada does 
need an agreement on international investment, it is a matter of 
how it is negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member to comment on the approval process he 
would like to see on international agreements like this one.  At 
least we have a bill that we can debate, talk about and amend. It 
is healthy for the House of Commons to deal with those issues in 
that way.  There are countries, for example, Australia and the 
United States, and other countries both inside and outside the 
Commonwealth which have a much better approval process for 
ratifying international agreements.  It involves either 
committees of a house or a vote of some sort before the treaties 
come into effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to comment on two things.  How would he 
like to see this bill specifically amended to strengthen it? 
More importantly, what type of approval process would he like to 
see this House adopt for the adoption of international treaties?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member asked what we 
in this caucus would rather see in the bill as it affects 
anti-dumping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tried to indicate in my remarks that we wanted to see similar 
provisions to what the United States has on its side of the 
border including the retrospective look at legislation so that we 
can remedy changes when they come up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the approval process, I indicated that we 
supported SIMA and the CITT.  I recognize and appreciate that 
parliament needs to figure out ways for members of this House 
regardless on which side they sit to work co-operatively to 
assist Canadians who we are here to represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have a specific approval process that I would be 
advancing here today.  However, I concur with the hon. member's 
remarks that we need some help in that direction and we could 
probably look to some of the countries he referred to. Australia 
is a good example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly need to draw opposition members into the operation 
more than we do now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will leave aside the rather large philosophical 
question as to the way in which this House and we as members go 
about ratifying and approving international treaties.  This 
clearly is something of interest to a lot of members.  It comes 
up in the foreign affairs and international trade committee from 
time to time, and it may be something we should be looking at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little surprised at the tone of opposition the member 
expressed and particularly his suggestion that we should be 
adopting mirror legislation vis-à-vis the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will recall that the committee held extensive 
hearings on this bill.  We often heard recommendations from 
various parties, particularly the steel industry and others, 
saying that we should adopt mirror legislation vis-à-vis the 
United States. However, it was pointed out by a lot of people who 
came before the committee that this would also hurt the Canadian 
automotive industry which imports a lot of parts that are then 
used in exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the member that I am not so sure we would 
want to go down the track of imitating what the United States 
does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are trying to tell everybody in the United States and 
the world is that their ideas are crazy, do not make sense and 
are contrary to the international agreements we are subscribing 
to. Why would we want to do what they do just to prove that we 
agree that what they are doing is crazy?  I do not understand 
where the member is coming from on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I understood that his party is in favour of the general 
thrust of the legislation and that maybe we can work on it 
together.  However, the recommendations in this legislation have 
all-party support of the committee which recommended most of the 
changes.  The legislation itself brings Canada into conformity 
with our international agreements and at the same time protects 
our producers and our consumers in a proper balanced way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member opposite talks 
about the United States being crazy.  I agree with him but it is 
driving our producers nuts in the process.  This is in the 
context that the United States is our major trading partner. 
Around $20 million worth of trade, an inordinate amount of money, 
crosses the border every day. I think the feeling around here 
from Canadian producers and exporters is that we are being hosed 
more often than not.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It may very well be that the United States is out of step with 
the rest of the world.  We are so close in proximity to the 
United States and our trade with that country is so important 
that we cannot afford, as I suggested in my remarks, to be 
leading with our chins when negotiating with the United States. I 
fear that the legislation before us today will force that upon 
us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to rise on this occasion.  I would like first to tell a very 
short story and then ask a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 I remember the NDP running ads talking about how free 
trade would kill jobs and devastate the Canadian economy, that it 
would be a colossal failure and that the whole nation would weep 
in the wake of the signing of a free trade agreement.  I am glad 
to hear the member's party has changed its position on free 
trade.  I remember as well the commercials that were run in the 
1993 election campaign were actually made in the United States. 
It was rather ironic since they were running ads that were 
negative to free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member aware of other flip-flops the Liberal Party has 
made with regard to issues like free trade since they won 
election in 1993? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  No, Mr. Speaker.  I think I set that 
out fairly clearly.  When the Liberals were in opposition they 
were very firmly opposed to free trade.  The previous leader 
referred to it as the fight of his life back in 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However they embraced free trade altogether, 100%, following the 
election in 1993.  They continue to go down that road with the 
agreements I referred to:  the agreement with Chile, the 
agreement with the Americas, the WTO, their push on the 
multilateral agreement on investment, et cetera. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to speak to Bill C-35. The Progressive Conservative 
Party is in favour of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, Bill C-35 is not perfect, coming as it does from 
the government opposite, which is not perfect. Let us hope that 
the future will bring perfect legislation from a perfect 
government of the right colour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in favour of Bill C-35, about which much has been said. 
I would like to come back to the purpose of this bill. We 
already had the 1984 Special Import Measures Act, which was 
aimed at exercising some control over what was coming into this 
country by setting rules to protect our industry. Following a 
most welcome change in government that Canadians and Quebeckers 
had been waiting for, negotiations were initiated to open up 
channels for trade around the world and with the United States 
in particular. Free trade agreements were signed, leading to 
various international trade negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a free trade agreement is negotiated, it continues to 
evolve. In implementing the legislation, it becomes evident that 
changes have to be made to the laws of the various countries 
involved. Bill C-35 contains a number of changes, especially 
with respect to antidumping measures. This is the main purpose 
of Bill C-35. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been much mention of the United States.  Free trade 
agreements have fortunately addressed most of the potential 
problems with that country.  Since 1984, the Special Import 
Measures Act has been amended with each successive international 
treaty.  Free trade is therefore a partial solution to some of 
our import problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much was said about the United States and the very tough 
measures imposed by that country.   One thing needs to be 
understood.  Like Canada, the United States has a trade deficit. 
When a country has a trade deficit, it reacts by making its 
legislation more protectionist.

election, when barriers go up.  With its free trade agreements 
and exports, however, Canada has been able to reassure 
Quebeckers and Canadians.  The latest figures show, without a 
shadow of a doubt, that, had we not had free trade boosting 
exports to the United States, among other countries, Canada 
would be in a recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We export 1.8 per cent of our GDP. 
If we reduced our exports, we would go into a recession and all 
Quebeckers and Canadians would lose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, some things still need to be changed.  Bill C-35 
introduces some worthwhile amendments, but it is not perfect. 
The Bloc Quebecois suggested some very interesting amendments 
that would have seen duties apply even further back in the case 
of dumping.  We hope that it will not take the government two 
and a half years to amend the Special Import Measures Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-35 also introduces a change with respect to the Canadian 
International Trade Tribunal Act.  It will be made much more 
stringent. 
We are going to send a very clear signal to those who want to 
dump their products onto this country, directly or by devious 
means, that Canada, under its international agreements, is ready 
to face the music. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have examples from 80 years back, but the practice of dumping 
has existed since the time of the empires.  At that point—as a 
history buff like you, Mr. Speaker, would know in spite of your 
young age—what they dumped was rum or furs or wood, depending 
on what the empire wanted to do with the recalcitrants in 
certain parts of its great kingdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As countries were established, various laws and agreements came 
into being, often within large groups such as the Commonwealth 
where there was some control over the movement of merchandise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-35 is a step in the right direction.  But, naturally, it 
is not perfect. 
However, we are giving it some teeth.  Oftentimes on the 
international scene, when the government tried to show its 
teeth, people realized it had no dentures.  Bill C-35 gives it 
enough teeth to better control the measures that could harm 
Canadian producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we are delighted, we think it took far too long: two 
and a half years.  Whether it is the crisis we are facing now in 
agriculture or the pasta crisis because of dumping by Italy, 
which has made it difficult for Italian products to move through 
the Canadian market, or any natural resource produced and sold 
in the country, there are difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go further, for time is slipping by.  I also know 
that all parliamentarians, with the exception of members of one 
particular party, have agreed to support Bill C-35. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, we might say that the Liberal government has 
recognized its past mistake of failing to support the previous 
government on free trade, and we hope that the red of the 
government in office becomes a little less evident, that is, a 
little more blue.

Speaker, it is not often that I stand in the House in agreement 
or even partial agreement with something brought forward by the 
government.  I can say that with regard Bill C-35. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have to look too far to see what is actually going on 
today with trade.  It is in the news.  At the border there has 
been stoppage of some of our produce from entering the States.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-35, if it were to be implemented, might play a small part 
in addressing some of the concerns.  Dumping is basically when 
other countries sell their product in our country at less than it 
costs them to produce it.  We have to pay attention to exactly 
what is going on.  Otherwise our financial picture will look 
bleaker than it is now.  I do not think the country could stand 
that for one moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-35 respecting the Special Import Measures Act governs the 
procedures under which anti-dumping and countervailing duties are 
imposed.  Under WTO rules all countries are permitted to impose 
penalties on imported goods if the goods are being dumped into 
their countries or if their production is being subsidized at 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That also brings forward the definition of dumping or 
subsidizing.  What exactly is subsidizing?  We should be looking 
at this subject more carefully than we do.  Subsidization can 
take many forms.  I am and always will be basically a free 
trader. More important, I would like to say I am a fair trader. I 
do not have a doubt that Canadian workers, farmers and 
manufacturers can compete in any field against any country if we 
have fair trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fair trade does not necessarily fall into the same guise, 
unfortunately with the government, as does free trade.  Fair 
trade means that we require a level playing field for our 
producers to compete.  When we have to face higher taxes than in 
other countries, it is no longer fair trade.  When we have to pay 
more for our electricity and for our heat than other countries 
do, it is no longer fair trade.  When we have to pay more for 
shipping costs than other countries do, it is no longer fair 
trade.  When we have to pay our own people to collect taxes such 
as the GST and other countries do not have to do so, it is no 
longer fair trade.  However it may be so-called free trade.  If 
we were to look into those areas we would find that Canadian 
producers could definitely compete by anyone's standard in the 
world.  I have no doubt about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admit that is getting a bit off topic from Bill C-35, but the 
government should take heed of this when talking about imports 
and exports.  The first basic concern should be for the producers 
in Canada and trying to give them a fair chance to compete in the 
global economy, if that is where we want them to go.  It is only 
reasonable to ask that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long ago as 1904 Canada developed the world's first 
anti-dumping legislation.  Over the years since then Canada has 
evolved into one of the world's leading trading nations. Canada's 
trade legislation has been changed many times, including changes 
to the Special Import Measures Act or SIMA that were needed to 
implement the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Uruguay 
round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or GATT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been here before.  We have gone through the hoops.  We 
know we have serious problems and keep on having serious 
problems.  It was only on Friday that I asked the minister about 
what was happening at the border.  His answer to me was basically 
“Don't worry.  Be happy.  We have drawn up an agreement and 
nothing will happen”.  It did happen because these agreements 
were not implemented when they should have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I am basically in support of Bill C-35.  The 
government could be doing a lot more to help our companies and 
producers but it refuses to look at it.  I sincerely hope it will 
give as much attention to that area as it has to Bill C-35.  It 
has taken the government two years to get the legislation before 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, basically the government has our support.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to tell a story to the House about a small company 
in my constituency.  It is called Bed-Roc Industries, a medium 
size company. It had to fight against an American competitor that 
used to dump tiles in B.C. and Alberta. It was selling specific 
tiles at a price which was undercutting Bed-Roc's price, selling 
at a very low price to outbid Bed-Roc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It fought against the American company.  It went through the 
International Trade Tribunal.  After many years of battle it won 
the case and was compensated for the injuries it suffered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small and medium size businesses suffer because the bigger 
companies dump some of their products in our market and it is 
difficult for the smaller companies to survive.  Very few 
companies go to the tribunal and go through the lengthy process 
to save the jobs they create in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this Bill C-35 I am wondering if we are looking at the 
long term implications of the amendments. How will the changes to 
be implemented affect business in the agriculture sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The difficulty is we have passed 
questions and comments and we are on debate.  Perhaps there would 
be consent to allow the hon. member for Okanagan—Shuswap to

catch the question. I thought that time had passed and I got on 
with something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope it will address the member's concerns. If not, I am sure 
we will be back before the House screaming and hollering, there 
is no doubt about that.

speak to a matter of concern to all of us, the subject of Bill 
S-21, the bribery and corruption of foreign public officials in 
international business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill when enacted will allow Canada to ratify the 
convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in 
international business transactions.  This convention was 
negotiated by the members of the Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 29 member OECD, which includes Canada, the United States, 
most European countries, Japan and South Korea, is the major 
economic policy forum for the world's most advanced 
industrialized democracies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an accepted fact that corruption distorts international 
trade and competition.  It impedes economic development.  In 
developing countries in particular corruption distorts public 
policy.  It leads governments to make decisions that are not in 
the public interest but are in the interest of those who benefit 
from the bribes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corruption also has the effect of lowering the quality of goods 
and services provided by the private sector in the course of 
meeting its contracts.  If substantial bribes are being offered 
the money comes either by shortchanging the countries with which 
one has a contract or by undermining the quality of the goods and 
services being provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore it has an insidious effect of threatening the rule 
of law, democracy and human rights.  It undermines the 
development of competent political and democratic institutions. 
Where they are in the course of development, it blocks that 
development. Stability and security are essential preconditions 
for economic growth.  Prosperity, sustainable development and 
employment engender greater security and stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The successful promotion of Canadian values abroad can be 
assisted by increased economic partnerships between Canada and 
other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the corruption of foreign public officials is not 
new and continues to be a major problem affecting international 
trade and investment.  The problem has been the focus of 
attention within the OECD, the Organization of American States 
and the Council of Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To implement the OECD convention would enhance Canada's 
reputation as a world leader in fighting corruption.  It would 
honour the commitments Canada has made at the OECD, at the Denver 
and Birmingham summits of the G-8 and at the United Nations.  And 
it would continue to ensure if not enhance Canada's standing at 
the OECD. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have questioned whether what we are doing is enough.  My 
response is that this is a dramatic and significant first step in 
the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will highlight the key elements in this legislation.  The 
essence of the convention is the requirement that each state 
party criminalize the bribery of foreign public officials in 
international business transaction and take measures to establish 
the liability of legal persons for the bribery of a foreign 
public official.  This provision appears in section 3 and is the 
centrepiece of the proposed act. It prohibits the bribery of a 
foreign public official in the course of business whether 
directly or indirectly.  It calls for significant penalties.  The 
offence would be punishable on indictment and carries a maximum 
penalty of five years imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will use the definition of person found in the 
Criminal Code that includes Her Majesty and public bodies, bodies 
corporate, societies, companies and inhabitants of counties, 
parishes, municipalities or other districts in relation to the 
acts and things they are capable of doing and owning 
respectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore for the purpose of the offences under this proposed 
act, potential accused are not limited to natural persons. 
Corporations also fall within the scope of these offences.  The 
bill describes facilitation payments that would be exempted from 
the ambit of the offence.  It would not be an offence if the 
advantage were lawful in the foreign official's country or public 
international organization. Reasonable expenses incurred in good 
faith and directly related to the promotion, demonstration or 
explanation of products and services or to the execution or 
performance of a contract with the foreign state could also be 
argued as a defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would amend section 67.5 of the Income Tax Act to add 
this new offence to the list of Criminal Code offences referenced 
in that section in an effort to deny the deductibility of bribes 
paid to foreign public officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The convention requires the parties to provide that the bribe 
and proceeds of the bribery of a foreign public official be 
subject to seizure and confiscation.  It requires the parties to 
consider the imposition of additional civil or administrative 
sanctions.  For this reason the bill proposes to create two 
additional criminal offences, the offence of possession of 
property or proceeds obtained or derived from the bribery of 
foreign public officials or from laundering that property or 
those proceeds, and the offence of laundering the property or 
proceeds obtained or derived from the bribery of foreign public 
officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill incorporates the proceeds of crime provisions of the 
Criminal Code for use on prosecutions of the new offences.  The 
new offence of bribery of foreign public officials is an 
enterprise crime offence to permit the search, seizure and 
detention of these proceeds of crime and is a predicate offence 
for the offence of laundering of the proceeds of crime. The 
convention has provisions dealing with mutual legal assistance 
and extradition with which Canada can comply.  If possible under 
their legal systems, each party must also provide legal 
assistance in criminal and civil matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note the Canadian business community is 
behind this initiative.  It considers the OECD convention as the 
most significant achievement to date in the international 
campaign against bribery and corruption.  This convention is seen 
as an opportunity to create a level playing field on which 
Canadian companies can compete on the basis of quality, price and 
service.  This was said loudly and clearly by members of 
Transparency International when they appeared before the Senate 
last week.

recent article that “Integrity in commercial transactions is 
essential in making the global market work and to ensure that the 
public supports it.  A logical consequence of globalization is 
that honesty has to be enforced at the global, not just national, 
level”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the passage of this legislation Canada has the opportunity 
to be the fifth country to ratify the OECD convention and to 
bring it into force, thus ushering in a new era of international 
accountability.  I ask all hon. members to consider that the war 
on corruption is well underway.  There is now no looking back. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
privilege to speak to this bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I start talking about the corruption bill, I would like 
to make a couple of points before the House.  The first one is 
that this bill came into our hands late on Friday and depending 
on what happened in the Senate determined whether it was actually 
going to show up today or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important bill to businesses and to the international 
community and, as usual, we are ramming it through the last week 
of parliament.  There has been very little planning on this bill. 
It was signed in December of 1997. We have waited or stalled or 
put it off and now all of a sudden this bill is so vitally 
important that we have it before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is government management.  This is the way it handles 
things.  This is the way it takes care of business.  Of course we 
have seen a lot of this.  We have seen it in the case of the 
Somalia report.  Murders were committed.  There was a cover-up. 
A commission was set up.  It held hearings for months, which 
extended into years, and finally the cabinet waffled it away and 
suspended any action on it.  A few little guys took the fall and 
then we moved on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now there is the APEC inquiry.  It is the same sort of 
thing, mismanagement of the issues.  Among the APEC protesters 
was a very well known teacher from my community who is a student 
at UBC.  He has told me all about what happened.  He was 
standing on the front line, around the pepper spray. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we have the government's mishandling of this sort of 
situation, stalled investigations and stalled handling.  I point 
this out because this is how the government manages things, or 
mismanages things.  It waits until it has a crisis.  Someone in 
the OECD said this thing has to be signed and it should have been 
done yesterday.  All of a sudden, here it is in the House and we 
are expected to ram the thing through with little time to look at 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of this motion, to which I object strenuously, is 
the fact that it is coming straight from the unelected, 
unaccountable Senate.  We have a body proposing that this 
legislation is good for Canadians and good for our businesses. 
However, it is coming out of a place that has absolutely no 
credibility, a place that totally lacks legitimacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously there are solutions.  For instance, Alberta has 
recently held Senate elections.  Mr. Brown receive 331,000 votes. 
Mr. Morton received more than 261,000 votes.  And yet this 
government, in its wisdom, will not even acknowledge that this 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is proposing a bill on corruption and, literally, 
on credibility when it has made so many inappropriate actions and 
has such a lack of ability to deal with any kind of an issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concerns are obvious.  We would like to have the opportunity 
to call witnesses.  We would like to have the opportunity to look 
at the various problems and the good points of this bill.  We 
would like to have the opportunity to become informed on this 
issue.  However, it was handed to us on Friday afternoon and we 
were told that on Monday we were going to deal with it and ram it 
through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The OECD is made of up of a group of 29 of the most 
industrialized countries.  It is one of the most important think 
tanks in the free world.  Obviously combating bribery in business 
transactions and what that would do for the international trade 
scene is something that all of us care about.  However, we have 
desperately handicapped ourselves because of the lack of 
management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the whole bill is very credible, and while we support the 
principle of it, we have to raise some very great concerns. 
Above everything, when we look at this we see how naive the 
government has been in dealing with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but think of our most recent look at the nuclear 
situation in our foreign affairs committee.  Would it not be 
great if we had no nuclear weapons?  Obviously it would be great 
to not have nuclear weapons.  But what is the reality of the 
situation?  The government seems to have a great deal of problem 
dealing with reality.  It likes to live in a glass house.  It 
likes to think that everything is going along so nicely, so 
friendly and so well organized.  What is the real situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The OECD says, above other things, that Canada has a big 
problem.  Our dollar is too low.  Our debt is much too high.  We 
have a $600 billion debt which is dragging us down every time we 
try to get ahead.  Will that ever be dealt with? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  There is $50 billion in interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  There is close to $50 billion in interest. 
Think of what we could do with $50 billion if we had it.  Look at 
the $12 billion spent on health care by the federal government. 
Look at the $14 billion spent on education.  Look at the $22 
billion spent on pensions.  Close to $50 billion is spent on 
interest payments.  That is the kind of mismanagement that the 
OECD talks about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also talks about the level of taxes in this country.  It 
talks about how we have some of the highest corporate and 
personal tax rates of the 29 OECD countries.  That also is 
mismanagement by the government not responding to what the OECD 
has been telling it for so many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about being naive we also look at things like 
getting our UN seat.  Are we going to say that we did not try to 
influence some of the foreign embassies in getting that seat? Are 
we going to deny that that is part of an Olympic bid?  Are we 
going to say that we are so perfect that we will never, ever try 
to coerce someone into supporting us in a position?  That is not 
true.  That is not how the real world works.  That is not how 
this government operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it would like to stand in this place and talk about how 
wonderful it is, what a great manager it is and how good a job it 
does, when we look at it we do not have to go very far below the 
surface to see the level of mismanagement and how it handles the 
way the House operates.  The whole process of presenting this 
bill is a perfect example of that sort of mismanagement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about corruption in many different ways and I will 
try to explore some of them.  Obviously, we oppose corruption. 
We are, after all, one of the countries in the world that has a 
great role to play in setting an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see how corruption can undermine the very workings of 
various governments.  It can destroy developing democracies.  It 
can literally cause countries in transition to go backward.  We 
can talk about countries such as Sudan and others which are in 
transition and have moved back and forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corruption distorts public confidence in the whole process.  I 
would even say that public confidence has been held up to 
question because of the mismanagement of this government.  It 
leads to the misallocation of valuable resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is corruption, there are resources going off to the 
wrong place to do the wrong thing, ultimately to the detriment of 
the people of that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I would come back to Canada and look at the allocation of 
resources.  I would ask, are these being allocated according to 
what is best for the people of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It hurts the private sector.  It distorts the operation of the 
markets.  It deprives ordinary citizens of receiving the benefits 
of the flow of wealth.  Whenever there is corruption within the 
system that obviously can happen.  Above all else, it hurts the 
poor people of the world.  From this government's standpoint, we 
often hear about their concerns and about human rights abuses 
around the world.  We see very limited action in that regard, but 
we certainly hear the words being spoken from the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need transparency in international reporting and in 
international business deals.  We could look at the way NGOs 
operate and go a long way in increasing our transparency.  We 
could also look at CIDA.

October 7, 1996, I filed a complaint with the commission

</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday the chair of the public complaints panel investigating 
the APEC affair resigned citing new interference from Ottawa. 
Gerald Morin cited interference from the Liberal appointed 
chairman of the commission, Shirley Heafey.  He said her 
tampering made the panel's work impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What possible excuse does the solicitor general have now for not 
replacing this panel with an independent judicial inquiry? 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am taking the liberty of answering this question 
because the question relates to something the Prime Minister 
deals with, setting up judicial inquiries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to the hon. member that the chair of the 
commission according to press reports says that she is dealing 
with the matter that has been the subject of press coverage. 
Second of all, the whole issue of apprehension of bias on the 
part of the commission is still before the courts.  Surely we 
should let the courts come to their decision which they are ready 
to do as quickly as possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

being solicitor general.  It is time to take the training wheels 
off and answer my questions himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Heafey's interference was bad enough to make the panel 
chairman quit.  She tampered with the panel's independence.  She 
interfered with its decision making. She refused to deal with 
charges that their phones were bugged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who directed the actions of this Liberal appointed chairman?

the RCMP.  I ask the opposition to let the public complaints 
commission do its work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the people who will not let the commission do its work 
is the government itself.  The former solicitor general 
pre-judged the outcome of the panel.  That is tampering with the 
work of the panel.  Now we have the chairman of the commission 
interfering to the point where the chairman of the panel quit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not true that the only reason the solicitor general keeps

</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the public complaints commission can be 
terminated under the following grounds:  number one, the

reasonably practical.  This situation fulfils both of those 
criteria.

quoting the law as far as I know.  As far as I know there are no 
grounds on that basis in the act setting up the commission to let 
the activity he is asking for be carried out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no authority under the law to take any role

commission is fatally flawed, that it will not get to the truth 
about the Prime Minister's involvement in the APEC fiasco.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, all the members of the commission, not just the chair, 
are appointed by order in council, that is to say by the Prime 
Minister.  That is exactly what would happen if a judicial 
inquiry were to be set up.  That person would be appointed by the 
Prime Minister.  I would ask the hon. member to explain why she 
wants the Prime Minister to be involved in one way to set up a 
commission, and she does not want the commission to carry out its 
work when it is appointed in exactly the same way under the law 
passed by this parliament to work at arm's length from the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B>

uncover the truth.  The current process lacks the credibility and 
the mandate to thoroughly investigate what happened at APEC.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

the premise to his question.  The solicitor general would not 
appoint an inquiry.  It would be appointed by the Prime Minister 
under the Inquiries Act.  That is obvious.  The hon. member

question is for the Minister of International Trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The continued blockade of our border by American farmers this 
weekend shows pretty clearly this government's so-called trade 
agreement was nothing more than a public relations exercise.  It 
is full of nice words like consult, exchange of information and 
increased dialogue, but no action and no concrete agreement to 
protect Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the minister stop finding nice words and get tough

<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade,

what the Canadian Federal of Agriculture said:  “Congratulations 
are in order for both the agriculture and trade minister for 
Canada.  The agreement marks a positive step forward in 
Canada-U.S. agriculture trade relations and is good news for 
Canadian producers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of 1 o'clock this afternoon, the only blockade we can speak 
of is a group of farmers on Montana's border.  The other 
blockades have ceased.  This one, I am assured, will cease as of 
4 o'clock.  Trade was not severely restricted this weekend. 
<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that is rather interesting because two things simply have not 
changed.  The government's so-called deal with the Americans on 
Friday did not change the fact that Americans blockaded our 
border two days afterward.  It did not change that we are still 
subject to high subsidies by Europeans and Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the minister get out from under his desk and 
do something to help Canadian farmers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade,

critic for the Reform Party of Canada is on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he is asking is that the blockade should have been bigger 
and longer.  If we look at what happened over the weekend, those 
blockades were already set.  I believe, as does the American side 
of the equation, that this agreement led to those blockades being 
much smaller. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the only protest left is the one in Montana. It started 
in three states.  I think the member should recognize that 
progress was made, which is also for Canadian producers 
themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With the sting still burning from the UN attack on his 
government's abysmal poverty record, today the minister must be 
reeling from two more devastating reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CCSD report blames the feds for the declining well-being of 
Canadian children, and the National Council of Welfare takes the 
hot air out of the much touted child tax benefit and condemns it 
for ignoring the poorest of the poor.

ensure that no children go hungry in Canada?

Friday, the government is always appreciative and respectful of 
the research work done by outside agencies commenting on the 
social policies of the country.  We try to learn from those 
reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the charge about the national children's benefit not 
helping the poorest of the poor, we have found out through our 
statistics that there are many children in low income working 
families who have fewer resources than those in welfare families.

The truth is that instead of reversing its dreadful attack on the 
poor, this government is set on providing tax breaks to the 
wealthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday, the Liberal majority report of the finance committee 
called for billions in tax cuts for upper income earners.  Will 
the minister promise today to stop catering to the wealthy?  Will

$1.7 billion in the national child benefit by the year 2000.

<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today on a point of privilege arising from an incident 
that occurred here in this chamber on December 3, just last 
Thursday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise based on citations 93 and 92 of Beauchesne's 
Parliamentary Rules and Forms which say that any threat or 
attempt to influence the actions of a member is a breach of 
privilege, and that that action must relate to the member's 
parliamentary duties.  I assure the Speaker this action did 
affect my parliamentary duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I sat at my desk preparing questions about the New Brunswick 
toll highway issue which I was intending to ask in question 
period just a few moments later, I was confronted by the member 
of parliament for Kenora—Rainy River.  With no introduction, he 
demanded to know what I “had against Doug Young”.  When I asked 
for clarification, he accused me of calling Doug Young a crook, 
which I did not do.  Then the member warned me to “back off” 
because “Doug Young has a lot of friends and they have long 
memories”. I do not know who these friends are.  I do not know 
if somebody else put the member up to this.  The member was 
obviously agitated at the time and therefore I did not argue with 
the member.  I just wanted the confrontation to end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I proceeded to prepare my questions which actually referred to a 
letter of Doug Young's.  Then the member challenged me to take my 
comments outside the House, which I assured him I already had. 
When that did not work, he pointed over to the Liberal benches 
and said “you better be careful because there are a lot of us 
over here and we will not forget either”.  He left, warning me 
to remember what he had said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very, very least, this is intimidation designed to 
prevent me from asking effective questions on matters of concern 
to my constituents.  At worst it is a threat against me as a 
member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no place in this House for intimidation or threats.  To 
be intimidated and threatened makes it very difficult to remain 
focused on the issues. I am sure that was the purpose of the 
implied threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if you find that I have a prima facie case of 
privilege, I am prepared to move the following motion, “that the 
matter of possible threats uttered by the member for 
Kenora—Rainy River should”— 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I take this as a serious 
circumstance, I want the hon. member to know.  I am not going to 
make a ruling on it today.  I believe you named the member for 
Kenora—Rainy River, is that correct?  I would rather wait until 
the member was here in the House.  You have raised it at the 
earliest possible moment.  I would like to hear what the hon. 
member for Kenora—Rainy River says, so I will hold this in 
abeyance until the hon. member comes back to the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
in this year of celebrating the 50th anniversary of the United 
Nations Declaration of Universal Human Rights, I am pleased to 
present a petition signed by a number of Canadians including from 
my own riding of Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners would like to bring to the attention of the 
House that human rights violations continue to occur in many 
countries around the world including Indonesia.  They also point 
out that Canada is internationally respected for its defence of 
universal human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore call upon the government to continue 
its efforts to speak out against countries that tolerate 
violation of human rights and to do whatever is possible to bring 
to justice those responsible for such abuses.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
ask that all questions be allowed to stand. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  On March 11, 1998, I placed 
Question No. 84 on the order paper asking how many violent crimes 
had been investigated by the RCMP and how many involved the use 
of registered and unregistered firearms.  In accordance with 
Standing Order 39 I asked for a written answer within 45 days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents have been waiting for 271 days.  The 
commissioner of the RCMP wrote me a letter on July 6 referring to 
the answer he had given to Question No. 84.  The RCMP gave its 
response to the government 154 days ago.  I raised this point 40 
days ago and I was assured at that time that I would get the 
answer immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government give my constituents and me the RCMP's 
answer to this very important question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Madam Speaker, we have answered well 
over 70% of the questions.  The member is right.  He has asked 
before.  The response to his question is being finalized.  I will 
continue to work to obtain the answer for him. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, Question No. 132 was placed on the order paper on 
September 31 and Question No. 138 on September 24 and I am still 
waiting for answers.  They are important answers because they 
have to do with the issue of a veteran's family being denied 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the Library of Parliament to do a study on order paper 
questions in Great Britain where the majority of questions are 
answered within a week.  The situation we are facing, which my 
colleague and I have just raised, is absolutely scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Madam Speaker, I note again Questions 
Nos. 132 and 138.  Some questions may well involve one 
department, but other questions may literally involve every 
department in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have mentioned, we have answered well over 70%.  I will 
continue on the member's behalf to work on Questions Nos. 132 and 
138. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Shall the remaining 
questions stand?

<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora—Rainy River, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, just after question period the member for 
Cumberland—Colchester suggested that I had made some remarks to 
him that were intimidating.   First of all, if it was intended to 
be that way, Madam Speaker, I can assure you he would not be 
sitting there today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole objective of my comments of the other day were to make 
it very clear to him that Mr. Young, the previous minister of 
human resources, defence and transport, was a very honourable 
member in this place in the last parliament.  He is a very honest 
individual for whom I have a lot of respect.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was trying to make it very clear to him that in the way he was 
posing his question he was suggesting that Mr. Young had somehow 
done something illegal, that he was crooked, and that it was not 
something I cherished hearing from members on the opposite side 
because it is not very honourable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my comments suggested in any way to him that I was being 
intimidating and hurting his work, I want to take this 
opportunity to apologize because that was not the intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent was to suggest to the House that when one poses 
questions one should not pose the kinds of scenarios that he was 
suggesting toward Mr. Young which would in any way jeopardize his 
abilities to make a livelihood out there in the workplace now 
that he is no longer a member of parliament.  Those were the 
reasons why I made those remarks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, there was no misunderstanding of the comments made by 
the member to me in that confrontation.  There was no way to 
interpret them other than as a threat.  He tried to intimidate 
me.  He said that I had better remember that Doug Young has lots 
of friends and they all have long memories.  Just today he said 
that if he meant it to be a threat I would not be here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put on the record what the member just said in 
defence of the points he made to me.  He said if I was 
intimidating the member I would know it and I would not be here 
today.  That just happened now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do not want to get into a debate on 
this issue.  As I understand it, and I saw part of it from my 
office only, what we have here is a member of parliament who 
stood in his place today on a point of order and said that 
another hon. member said certain words to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is here in the House right now.  As far as what 
I could make out, the hon. member had said there was a 
misunderstanding.  I am to be corrected, but if there is a 
misunderstanding the hon. member apologizes or withdraws.  Is 
that correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  If this is the case where we have one hon. 
member making an accusation and another hon. member apologizing 
in the House of Commons, then as far as I am concerned as a 
matter of privilege this matter is closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  On a point of order— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will hear a point of order but not on this 
matter.  Is it on this matter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think I was part— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  If you can't get up on a point of 
order, what is the sense of being here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I ask the hon. member to put in his 
earpiece. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  You didn't hear the whole 
conversation, Mr. Speaker.  That is the point I am trying to 
make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I have ruled on the 
particular point of privilege the member has raised.  If this is 
another point of order then I will listen to another point of 
order.  If it is on the same point of order I will not listen to 
it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a point of order in the sense that the same 
situation happened to me as another member of parliament.  That 
is the point I want to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to that, it was the same language and the same tone as 
used by the member for Kenora—Rainy River to me as a member of 
parliament based on a question that I had for the Minister of 
Transport on the same individual, Mr. Doug Young.  I think it is 
out of character for the member to do that, but the same language 
and the same inference was used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make is simply that in the apology he said 
that if he were serious I would not be standing here today.  In 
other words, how do we know when he is serious and when he is 
not?

other member is apologizing, I would hope that would end the 
situation.  I would hope this type of thing would not happen. This

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, to

have is that the bill was put forward in December 1997.  It is 
now a year later and the bill is coming before us to be rushed 
through on literally the last day of debate.  That is the first 
point.

would bring forward a bill that is as important as has been

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to say a few words about Bill S-21. The NDP 
supports the bill.  We see these provisions as a good thing for 
Canada and for all OECD countries.  Certainly the extension of 
anti-corruption measures around the globe would be a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members and particularly the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs will know the NDP has recently come 
out of a fairly successful battle to prevent something from being 
adopted at the OECD, namely the MAI.  Here we are standing in 
favour of something being adopted at the OECD. I wanted that to 
be noted because it is not that we are against a rules based 
global economy or rules for that matter.  We are in favour of 
rules, rules that prevent the wrong things from happening.  In 
this case when it comes to corruption and bribery, we feel the 
imposition of rules to prevent corruption and bribery is a good 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we did not like about the MAI, that other thing being 
perpetrated by the OECD, were the rules which were put forward to 
protect investors and corporations at the expense of workers and 
the environment and the ability of democratically elected 
governments to act in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a role for rules.  There is a role for conventions. 
There is a role for international law. That role is to prevent 
undesirable things from happening, whether in this case the 
existence and the spread of corruption and bribery or other 
undesirable things like the exploitation of workers, the 
exploitation of the environment, the setting up of corporate 
profit strategies as somehow superior to the common good and to 
the legislation which democratically elected governments might 
want to pass from time to time in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the very opposite of what we have here in this kind of 
legislation, not a convention but nevertheless an international 
agreement that Canada has entered into in respect of NAFTA and 
that Canada wanted to enter into in respect to the MAI. We see 
the interests of a corporation like Ethyl Corporation being held 
up as more valuable than the ability of the Canadian government 
to legislate environmentally or the health of Canadians insofar 
as it is related to MMT and other environmental goals the 
government might have from time to time and might want to 
legislate in respect of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have finally the OECD, after having spent all this time 
trying to do the wrong thing in terms of the MAI, doing something 
right.  Just so nobody thinks we think the OECD is always wrong, 
we stand here today to say this bill we would like to support and 
we have co-operated in the easy passage of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, like my 
colleague from the NDP, I too am pleased to speak today on Bill 
S-21. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an act respecting the corruption of foreign public 
officials and the implementation of the convention on combating 
bribery of foreign public officials in international business 
transactions, and to make related amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports this bill because it addresses the 
problem of corruption in international business transactions 
involving governments and government projects. 
It follows on the signature by Canada and 28 other countries of 
the convention on combating bribery which was signed last 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement required five of the ten greatest OECD 
trading partners to ratify the convention by the end of 1998.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four have already either done so or stated their intention of 
doing so by the end of December, the United States, Germany, 
Japan and the United Kingdom.  Canada's ratification, therefore, 
would allow the convention to come into effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are at five minutes to midnight, and the government is 
just waking up, only a few days before the end of these 
sittings, and asking us to turn our work topsy-turvy in order to 
get this convention put through.  Obviously, we support it, but 
some questions could be asked about the process leading to its 
adoption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will describe the convention.  By signing it, the countries 
commit to enact legislation which will make it illegal for 
companies to bribe representatives of foreign governments. 
They also promised to develop a mechanism for overseeing the 
implementation of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this convention, the parties must ensure that 
intentionally offering or agreeing to give or offer an unfair 
pecuniary or other advantage to a foreign public official to 
obtain or retain a contract or any other unfair advantage in 
international trade constitutes a criminal offence. The 
convention also applies to kickbacks paid to persons holding 
public office, that is lawmakers and officials of public 
organizations. In addition, this convention deals with 
facilitation payments and requires that the parties implement 
rules to prevent misleading accounting practices and the use of 
forgeries for the purpose of bribing or covering up bribery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill, whose main thrust is found in clause 
3, is to implement this convention. From now on, all OECD 
countries will be subject to the same rules. Bribery and 
kickbacks will no longer be tolerated and will in fact be 
considered criminal offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This convention will ensure that businesses in Quebec and Canada 
have access to a more level playing field on which to compete 
internationally. Of course, the Bloc Quebecois joins the 
business community of Quebec and Canada in supporting this bill. 
But perhaps we could go further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are now 28 member countries in the OECD. We all know that 
we also trade extensively with developing countries, APEC 
countries and other countries around the world. 
So, as far as we in the Bloc Quebecois are concerned, this 
convention negotiated with 28 OECD countries should be placed as 
quickly as possible under the aegis of the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say I am bitterly disappointed with the Liberals' 
attitude.  The Conservatives have spoken of threats. Here we 
have another example of the lack of respect of Liberal members 
and an example of the way they perpetuate the bad reputation 
politicians have in the community as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members speak in this House in a debate that is not totally 
conflictual and are continually being interrupted by sarcasm, 
jokes or private conversations, they may well wonder what 
happened to courtesy.  Perhaps there is none in that party, it 
is found only among the opposition.  That would be one more 
thing they do not have that the opposition does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have a whip that occasionally tightens the screws.  Will 
they understand?  Perhaps the whip should move and sit there to 
get them to understand common sense.  When they are not busy 
accusing or threatening the Conservatives, they are preventing 
other members of this House from speaking by holding their 
Christmas party in the House at 3.50 p.m. on a Monday.  It is 
rather disgraceful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might also ask ourselves, as the minister and the government 
are acting in good faith and accelerating the passage and the 
process of the convention on corruption, why this same 
government does not take as much interest in other actions that 
could be taken internationally, through national leadership, in 
order to improve international trade, which is increasingly a 
part of our activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Frontenac—Mégantic has just tabled a fairly 
thick petition calling for abolition of the Senate. But the 
Senate, perhaps in a moment of brilliance, recently tabled a 
report.  In it, they ask the government to issue a code of 
ethics for business, stronger and more restrictive than the 
current voluntary code established by Canadian business. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I myself asked the Minister for International Trade whether he 
intended to implement the code of ethics recommended in the 
Senate report.  The minister told me that a simple “yes” or “no” 
would not suffice with respect to such a recommendation and that 
further study was required.  We are all for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we asked the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade and the Subcommittee on International Trade 
to examine the idea of a code of ethics for Canadian businesses 
so that Quebec and Canadian values would apply in other 
countries, we were turned down by the Liberal government. 
The committee is refusing to examine this proposal at the very 
time that the Canadian government is prepared to rush through in 
one day a code of ethics for businesses operating abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same Senate report says that any Canadian assistance—whether 
through the Export Development Corporation, CIDA, or other 
government agencies—to Canadian or Quebec based businesses for 
the purpose of conducting trade abroad should be tied to 
observance of minimal standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But no recommendation is made regarding the obvious need for a 
code of ethics, to ensure Canadian businesses will not, in order 
to save a few dollars or cents per hour, exploit women and 
children by making them work in dreadful conditions, in 
countries where working conditions are much worse than they are 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the government helps businesses through subsidies, 
financial assistance, or payments following the export of goods 
or services. We are asking, and the Senate committee is 
recommending, that such assistance be tied to compliance with 
minimal standards on Canadian exports. But again, the government 
has turned a deaf ear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased that the Canadian government moved quickly to 
implement the convention on combating bribery in international 
business transactions, thus becoming the fifth OECD member to do 
so. However, we must question the government about its true 
intentions, as we wonder whether it is not making a small 
concession to hide a more serious problem, that is the 
absolutely dreadful working conditions imposed on children, men 
and women in some parts of the world. The Canadian government 
could not care less, because “we must not adversely affect our 
companies' competitiveness”. In order to make money, increase 
their sale figures and preserve their competitiveness, some 
Canadian companies go to countries where human rights are not 
respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate made two very realistic recommendations: the 
establishment of a code of ethics for businesses that is more 
strict than the voluntary one, and a requirement to comply with 
minimal standards to be eligible for government assistance 
regarding international activities. But these two issues will 
remained unanswered for a very long time, because while it looks 
like the government is quick to take action, it is slower in 
providing concrete help.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Madam Speaker, since we are right in the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would be glad to do 
that.  I do assure the member that we have sought unanimous 
consent with the parties.  These are documents that were 
requested of the Minister of Natural Resources regarding the 
record of understanding between the Government of Canada and the 
United States regarding areas of agricultural trade.

responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board was asked to table 
certain documents.  The minister indicated that he would be happy 
to present the documents concerning an agreement signed between 
Canada and the United States.  As I mentioned this agreement is a

United States of America regarding areas of agricultural trade. I 
present the documents in both official languages.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CORRUPTION OF FOREIGN PUBLIC OFFICIALS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK249">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill S-21, an 
act respecting the corruption of foreign public officials and the 
implementation of the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign 
Public Officials in International Business Transactions, and to 
make related amendments to other acts, be read the third time and 
passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, people in 
the media would tell us that if we repeat and repeat and repeat 
we will get the message across better.  Having spoken to second 
reading today and having partially finished my second reading 
speech after question period, I now have an opportunity to speak 
at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that one of the biggest problems we have with this bill 
is the fact that it was agreed to in December 1997, it showed up 
here on Friday and now there is a great rush to move it through. 
It shows a great deal of mismanagement, of not dealing with 
issues that the government says are good for the country.  It 
does not allow us the opportunity to call witnesses.  It does not 
allow us the opportunity to look at all of the issues and to ask 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will this handicap us when it comes to dealing in the 
international marketplace?  What about those that are not part of 
the OECD?  Where will they be when it comes to competition? 
There are so many questions we should ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often find the government presents a rather naive view of the 
world.  For instance, in the nuclear study we found that the 
government believed there would be no more wars and that we do 
not need to protect ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our second reason for having problems with this bill is the fact 
that it came from the unelected, unaccountable Senate. No matter 
where we go in the world it is difficult to try to explain the 
Senate.  We talk about democracy and democratization. One-quarter 
of our government officials are not elected, but simply are 
political hacks sent here to raise funds for the party and to 
help organize the party.  We have a great deal of difficulty 
giving credibility to the material coming out of that body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address the bill itself.  The OECD has made a number of 
recommendations to Canada.  The most notable comment from the 
OECD was clearly made when we visited with them in August. There 
are three basic reasons Canada is having difficulty with its 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are losing our trained people. We have a low dollar.  We have 
8% unemployment and many other people who are not part of that 
unemployment figure any more.  We have a pension plan that is 
going to fail.  We have the highest taxes and so on. When we ask 
what is wrong and why is Canada not working very well they do not 
come to corruption right away but they come to three things, 
three really clear things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is that we have too much debt.  Our debt to GDP ratio 
is too high.  No country with 79% of its GDP to debt ratio is 
going to do very well in the international community. Obviously 
they are telling the government to fix the debt problem.  It took 
us 30 years to get into this huge debt of $600 billion but we 
have to find a way to get out of it. The big thing with this debt 
is the interest payments.  When we spend close to $50 billion a 
year on interest payments it hurts our country.  It hurts our 
young people.  It hurts our businesses.  We have to know that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing the OECD says is that taxes are too high. 
Taxes are why there is unemployment.  Taxes are why the best 
trained people are being lost.  Taxes are why businesses are 
being lost and why people will not invest in the country.  They 
are causing the problem.  Whether they are individual taxes or 
corporate taxes, they are destroying the country and its ability 
to compete in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, and probably most important of all, the country does not 
have a plan.  This country does not know where it is going.  That 
is because of 30 years of mismanagement by a couple of different 
kinds of governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we get this bill about corruption, we certainly know it is 
important.  Corruption does destroy countries.  But that is not 
the number one problem in Canada.  The problems in Canada are the 
huge debt, huge taxes and the lack of any kind of a plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine the different kinds of corruption and what 
corruption does to a country and its economy.  There are several 
things we should look at.  There cannot be good government if 
corruption is allowed to go on.  Democracy will be destroyed, 
whether it is in a transition phase or whether it is well 
developed.  Democracy will be destroyed when corruption is 
allowed to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why many people here question democracy.  Are we really 
a democracy when we see cabinet ministers beat the back bench 
into submission to vote the way of the party?  Is that really 
democracy?  We see committees that are forced to come up with the 
government position, even when members disagree.  Is that really 
democracy?  Deals are made and deals are changed.  Is that really 
democracy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listen in question period to the government saying it is 
going to examine the entire APEC matter.  However, the chairman 
is gone.  They cannot look at the politicians.  Is that really 
democracy?  We should not throw too many stones when we live in a 
glass house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are lots of things that would allow us to really question 
the kind of government that we have.  I could go back to the 
Somalia inquiry.  What a terrible example that set for other 
countries.  We were condemned in countries like Belgium and other 
European countries when they saw how we handled that inquiry.  We 
let it go on for a year and a half, not touching any of the guys 
at the top.  We just went after a few of the little people at the 
bottom.  We did not support our troops.  We did not support the 
Canadian way of life.  I question again what the government is 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can distort public policy.  We have the examples of the 
Pearson airport deal and the helicopter deal.  All of those 
things are examples of manipulation by government for political 
reasons, but out there in the public they raise a big question 
mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corruption also causes the misallocation of resources.  How many 
examples do people have out there of CIDA projects gone wrong? 
Just last week our minister went down to Washington for lunch. He 
agreed that Canadians will be one of the big guys up to the table 
so he wrote a cheque for $92 million to the Palestinian effort to 
help them build roads and complete an airport.  We have already 
given $120 million.  The only country that has given more is the 
U.S.  Do we know where that money is going?  Is it accountable? 
Do we know how it is going to be spent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tell some of the Saskatchewan farmers who are trying to haul 
their grain on some of those roads that in fact Palestine needs 
roads more than the Saskatchewan farmer does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The misappropriation of funds that goes on is part of 
corruption.  It is all there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about the aboriginal issue.  That is good one.  We 
just had a forensic audit of the Stoneys.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, many of our native people are saying “There is 
corruption within our chiefs and councils.  We, the grassroots, 
are asking you to straighten this out, to fix it”.  That is a 
problem in Canada.  Why are we not dealing with that problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we can live in our glass house, throw stones and talk 
about corruption internationally, but we should be looking at it 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also look at the poor of the world.  We can see how 
corruption affects them and hurts them.  We have to keep asking 
these questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are here for, to raise these questions. 
Government members might not like to hear them.  They would like 
to live in a naive world, a wonderful world, a glossy world where 
everything is just fine.  Those rose-coloured glasses are 
starting to get a little foggy.  I think some members opposite 
should start cleaning their glasses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as transparency is concerned, there was a very 
interesting study done by the UN.  It was a corruption index. 
They went from country to country and rated them from zero to 
ten.  Zero was the highest level of corruption and ten was a 
clean bill of health where they could not find any corruption at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty interesting.  I will refer to a few of the 
countries that are covered in this study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Denmark finished first.  It had a perfect score of 10.  In other 
words, no corruption could be found in that government.  Canada, 
interestingly enough, finished sixth, at a rate of 9.2.  It was 
not bad, but they did find some corruption within our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Britain was 11th, at 8.7.  The United States was 17th, at 7.5. 
Chile was 20th, at 6.8.  Botswana was 23rd, at 6.1.  Hungary was 
33rd, at 5.0.  Russia was 76th out of 85, at a rate of 2.4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see in this corruption scale where some of these 
countries are and then we can take a look at what that means. 
Let us use a few examples.  Let us talk about Russia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, Russia today is run largely by the Mafia.  Obviously, 
by the rate of 2.4, corruption is pretty rampant.  It is pretty 
difficult for the people even to get along.  The businesses have 
to pay protection money in order to stay open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone in Russia wants to make a deal, they have to pass 
money under the table.  The GDP is destroyed.  The only thing 
that makes that country an international power, if you want, is 
its nuclear weapons.  Obviously, we need to control and stop that 
sort of corruption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us come back to Canada again.  We are not at 10.  Why not? 
Is there any government corruption here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we listened to the finance minister today, we would have 
heard him bragging about how he has created all of these jobs, 
how taxes are actually good and that they really do not cost 
jobs.  We hear all kinds of innuendoes back and forth.  One 
minister says one thing, one says another.  What are those people 
out there who pay taxes thinking when they get this doublespeak 
from their ministers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the people to think?  The area I am most familiar with 
is the foreign affairs area.  What are they to think when we send 
an ambassador to Los Angeles to live in Beverly Hills in a $2.5 
million mansion with servants?  That person really has no 
credentials to be our ambassador there.  Her only credential is 
that she had the biggest defeat in election history in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There she sits in her palace in Beverly Hills, paid for by the 
taxpayer to promote Canada.  Is that corruption?  Did she know 
too much about the Somalia inquiry?  Was that a way to get her 
out of the country? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about our ambassador to the United Nations, Mr. Fowler?  On 
December 24 he received his appointment, but that was at the same 
time as the Somalia inquiry was going on and he just happened to 
have been deputy minister of DND for nine years.  Why was he 
hustled out of town?  Why does he live in a fancy place in New 
York with a high salary and why is he untouchable by any inquiry? 
Why does that happen?  Is that corruption? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mary Clancy is in Boston.  Gilles Bernier is in Haiti.  Roger 
Simmons is in Seattle.  These are all appointments.  Who are 
these people?  Are they the best people to represent Canadians? 
No, actually they are defeated members of parliament.  That is 
their credential for being there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  What about Kim? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  What about Kim?  Kim was certainly 
defeated.  She managed to do a real good job of being defeated, 
and there she is off in Beverly Hills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These appointments conjure up something in our minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look at the Senate and we see a bunch of party hacks working 
on campaigns, raising funds for the party.  We ask ourselves, 
what about corruption?  What about democracy?  Again we have 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliament Buildings were supposed to cost under half a 
billion dollars.  Now it is $1.4 billion.  What do Canadians 
think about that?  In planet Ottawa maybe those things are fine, 
but out on the street it is not so fine, it is not so happy.  We 
have to address these kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about what people think about the social union. 
People think that their health care is hurt, that their education 
systems are not as good as they were and that the social policies 
are not working.  They have food banks, housing problems and all 
kinds of other problems.  They ask “What is government doing 
about it?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government is cutting funding.  Health care has been cut by $7 
billion in the last five years.  Again I come back to the fact 
that there is no plan.  The government does not know where it is 
going.  It has no master plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government know what it is going to do in agriculture? 
Certainly other places in the world are looking at it.  Why would 
agreements be signed when other places like the European Union or 
the U.S. are giving grants to everybody?  Why did we not 
negotiate a better deal?  What is wrong with the people who 
allowed us get into a situation like that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about the policing problem.  In my area the police 
showed up at a rotary meeting begging the Rotary Club to help 
provide a motorcycle because motorcycles are more efficient at 
catching speeders and people going through red lights.  Why were 
they at the Rotary Club?  Because the government has cut their 
funding.  In the past month they were told not to use their 
cellphones any more and to put two cars in the garage.  They 
could not use them because of funding cuts.  Meanwhile we have 
young offenders, break-ins and all kinds of other problems 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening to our system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about the pension plan and the 73% increase in the 
cost of the plan.  Talk to a young person and ask them about 
investment in the pension plan.  If they are 20 or 25 years old 
and they put 9.9% of their income in until they are 65, ask them 
what kind of an investment that is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did a little survey last January.  It was very interesting.  I 
think the House might be interested in this survey.  It was to go 
door to door in Chile, a country that has had a pension plan for 
26 years.  It is a private pension plan.  They invest in their 
own pension.  They own the pension plan themselves. 
I found an overwhelming pride among the low, middle and upper 
class of income earners.  There was a real pride in that pension 
plan because it meant something.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about employment insurance?  People certainly question that 
the government is collecting $350 per person more than it can 
use.  It is also collecting $500 per business per worker.  And we 
are going to give back 15 cents per $100.  Are we not just 
wonderful? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People ask “What is happening down there?  Is that place 
corrupt?”  Ask people what they think about Ottawa and they will 
bring up these kinds of items.  They will not necessarily talk 
about the big international deals.  They will talk about health 
care, taxes, pensions, education, the systems that touch people. 
That is what they care about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we agree in principle with this bill, the way it has been 
brought in is disgraceful.  The Liberals should be ashamed of 
themselves for bringing it in this way.  They should be ashamed 
of bringing it in through the Senate.  They should be ashamed for 
not allowing the time that a bill like this one needs and for 
simply running it through at this eleventh hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically as we look at it, we are against corruption.  This is 
a real motherhood issue.  But there are questions businesses 
would like to have answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle we can go along with this bill, but we certainly 
have a lot of questions.  And we certainly tell the government 
that we do not like the method by which it brought in this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, Bill 
S-21 is a step in the right direction, an international 
agreement, introduced in the Senate, and much to our liking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worthy of note that there is already an agreement to 
ensure that there is a periodical report—an amendment in this 
regard will be moved in the Senate—on the international 
corruption situation.  That report will be tabled in Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will then be able to assess regularly what is going on, in 
order to have greater credibility than the Reform member who, 
when we were discussing the study, stated that there was no 
corruption in Denmark, but there was in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, given the arguments raised by the Reform Party, I 
will have to spend a few minutes on this.  It is, if I may be 
pardoned the expression, rather disgusting to see the Reform 
Party pushing the parliamentary rules as far as they can.  They 
have given some 10, 12 or 15 examples, asking whether they were 
cases of corruption.  If that is what the parliamentary spirit 
of the Reform member is all about, I have some questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the credibility of the Reform Party is at stake. 
Looking at oneself in the mirror is one thing, but what the 
Reform Party has tried to do, to say that Canada is a corrupt 
country, which is pretty well what the hon. Reform member has 
said, is quite another thing again.  What is the point of all 
this? Not to mention that the examples given were dubious at 
best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example given by the Reform Party or follow the 
same line of thought. 
Does the fact that the leader of the official opposition turned 
down Stornoway, the official residence, for several years and 
then accepted it mean that there was corruption?  That is the 
sort of question I am asking: Was there corruption? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party talks about nuclear arms in the papers, and 
while it condemns the United States, it appears to be in the 
pocket of the Americans.  Is corruption involved?  We have to be 
very careful about this sort of thinking, there is a term for 
it— “irrelevant”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-21 is a step in the right direction.  It is an 
international agreement.  The Reform Party is busting its 
britches saying “It came from the Senate, it came from the 
Senate”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have no respect for the institution, and no election in 
Alberta is going to change the rules.  If they really want to 
change it, there is a way to go about it, without discrediting 
it.  Discrediting parliament means discrediting those who sit 
there.  The Reform Party has already done that.  It is not 
serious, but care must be taken.  I know the Speaker wants to 
apply the standing orders to the letter.  However, a speech like 
that becomes less credible and could lead to accusations.  They 
do not go far enough, because they haven't got the balls—as we 
say at home—to go further.  They raise questions and propose 
theories to discredit a number of people, but they are no better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An aid to the Reform Party took pictures of the renovated gym 
and bath. He did not look too good when members said “We use the 
facilities and that is all right; there is nothing wrong with 
that”. In the end, one has to be credible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But seriously, and this excludes the Reform Party, Bill S-21 is 
a step in the right direction in the sense that a convention was 
signed. It may not cover every country in the world, but there 
will finally be a legal framework dealing with the various forms 
of corruption. While incomplete, Bill S-21 ensures that the 
convention signed by Canada can become law here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important point is that, for once, the House gets to 
debate the convention, although too briefly. 
While the government had been saying since January that it would 
be introducing the bill, we did not have enough time. I am 
really disappointed about that. With the Liberals, it takes 
time. Eventually, though, they will realize that much more time 
should be devoted to debating international agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, as I said, I think this is a step in the right direction. 
This bill, which we will be passing and which the Senate will 
hopefully ratify soon afterwards, will ensure that the primary 
condition, set out in the first operative provision of Bill S-21 
will come into effect and be enforced in five countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the review will go further than the periodical 
report and include non-government and non-profit organizations. 
I think we should go much further than that. However, with Bill 
S-21, Canada meets its international obligations.  That is a step 
in the right direction.  The issue has been raised in the House 
and we in the Progressive Conservative Party are going to push 
to have it move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Bloc Quebecois members have often pointed out, the next 
step is human rights.  In the interests of greater credibility, 
much more will eventually have to be done with respect to 
international trade as it affects human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade has its work cut out for it.  At some point, it would be a 
good idea for us to give thought to what sort of policy Canada 
could enforce that would incorporate a number of laws and 
international agreements to which Canada is already a party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So Bill S-21 is speeding through.  There was, however, I believe, 
agreement in this House that corruption should cease.  But will 
that happen?  Probably not tomorrow, but at least people will 
know that Canada, like four other countries, has a law, has 
signed a convention, and that it could push for the signing of 
these agreements, and perhaps even make it a kind of condition. 
When Canada negotiates or renegotiates international agreements 
or portions thereof, it must ensure that the other signatories 
also enact anti-bribery legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bribery used to be a way of life.  If people wanted a passport 
in some countries, they had to bribe an official.  They were 
told this was the way things were done, and it was hard to deal 
with that. 
Now, fortunately, because of globalization of markets, among 
other things, the situation has evolved and the laws and 
regulations governing a country are now scrutinized closely by 
all real and potential world trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is therefore a good one. It comes to us from the 
Senate, an institution that of course could do with some 
improvement. However, that shows that there are things that can 
be credibly accomplished within parliament, and this is our goal 
in the Progressive Conservative Party.  We enthusiastically 
support Bill S-21 and assure the government and parliament, both 
the House of Commons and the Senate, of our full co-operation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to thank 
the members who have participated in this debate. It has been to 
a large extent a constructive debate this afternoon. I extend 
appreciation for this very important breakthrough bill. This is a 
first for Canada and by all parties showing co-operation, it puts 
Canada in a position of leadership. Having said that, I would 
like to comment on the words of some of the members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I marvelled at the generosity of the Speaker when the member for 
Red Deer was straying from the subject to such an extent.  I 
realize there is a great deal of latitude in this parliament and 
there probably should be.  I think he would have been ruled out 
of order in the Ontario house, if I can remember from my former 
incarnation.  There were times when I did not know whether to 
call him Dr. No or Chicken Little, but it was a very interesting 
speech.  Through it all and through all the raving and hair 
pulling about the terrible condition of this country as he sees 
it, there were a couple of questions which I think deserve 
answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One was his concern that this bill went through the other place 
first before it came to this House.  I want to point out for the 
record that in our present system of parliament, a bill may be 
introduced either in the Senate or in the House of Commons. It is 
essentially for procedural purposes and for no other reason other 
than very often it makes for a more efficient process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Red Deer was also concerned that this bill 
appears to be coming in at the last minute, because the 
commitment was made in December 1997.  I will admit that 
sometimes things seem to happen very slowly around this place. I 
can share that point of view.  The fact is that there was a 
tremendous amount of consultation undertaken when this bill was 
being considered.  All the provinces and the territories were 
consulted, as well as the private sector.  The Canadian Chamber 
of Commerce, the Canadian Council for International Business, the 
Pacific Basin Economic Council and so on, all of these 
organizations had to be taken into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps in hindsight, maybe the commitment to implement 
something like this should have had a more extended period before 
it was brought in.  However, the bureaucracy operated as I think 
bureaucracies operate, with the speed of light. It actually 
brought this to an acceptable point here and allowed us to go 
ahead with a universally acceptable debate today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc and my friend from the Conservative Party suggested 
that we could have gone further.  Indeed we could have gone 
further, but I remind the House that we are acting in concert 
with the OECD, those 29 highly industrialized countries; in 
concert with the Organization of American States; and in concert 
with the European Community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those organizations together, as this anti-corruption force 
takes hold and as the net is cast, will cover almost all the 
commerce which takes place around the world.  Yes, there will be 
some rogue countries, but the pressure will be on all countries 
in the world to operate a progressively cleaner ship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from the Bloc was also mildly critical about human 
rights and Canada's position on human rights.  Canada is 
encouraging every country to act positively on human rights.  We 
are helping China on the human rights issue and progress has been 
made over the last years.  We are doing that in every country 
where we have what we call constructive engagement which 
hopefully involves doing business but also allows countries to 
see how Canada acts and how the Canadian system works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the honour of receiving delegations from countries 
around the world that come here to study Canada, to study the 
government process and to study what my hon. friend from Red Deer 
considers to be very awkward, regressive democracy.  He asks if 
we do have a democracy.  I remind him of the words of the late 
Sir Winston Churchill who said “The democratic process in 
government is the worst form of government except for every other 
form of government”.  As difficult as it is, our system of 
democracy works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all hon. members for participating in this debate and 
for agreeing that we should proceed together so that Canada is 
truly seen as a leader.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased to hear the hon. member quote Winston 
Churchill on democracy.  He apparently agrees with Mr. Churchill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he really believes in that, why does the Liberal government 
not try it some time?  It would be wonderful if we could 
introduce a bit of democracy into the House and into the country. 
No one would applaud more than I would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Madam Speaker, I remind the hon. member 
that in 25 minutes we will be practising the art of democracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For the folks back home, late last Friday afternoon the 
government decided that it had dawdled a little too long on a 
piece of legislation and thought that it would bring it before 
the House to try to get it passed as soon as possible.  We all 
smell a whiff of proroguing in the air, and that is the reason it 
did that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell a few stories in the time I have today.  First I 
will start with a number of quotes and let everybody in the House 
in on a little game.  They can try to guess who I am quoting. The 
first person said:  “I on the other hand support Senate reform. 
If it is done properly, a restructured and revitalized upper 
chamber can give Albertans a voice in the governance of Canada. 
If elected Liberal leader I pledge to work for a Senate that is 
elected, that has legislative powers of its own and contains 
strong representation from all regions of Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was spoken at the Liberal leadership convention on June 23, 
1990.  I will drop a little hint.  This person is currently the 
Liberal leader of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go on in case people do not have the drift.  The second 
quote is:  “The regions of Canada need to be more involved in 
decision making and policy making at the national level.  To meet 
the hopes and dreams of those who live in the west and the 
Atlantic, a reformed Senate is essential.  It must be a Senate 
that is elected, effective and equitable”.  This was taken from 
the <I>Hansard</I> of September 24, 1991.  For those who do not 
have a clue, the person I am quoting was once upon a time a 
finance minister under Pierre Elliot Trudeau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring to the Senate, I go on: “The Liberal government in 
two years will make it elected.  As Prime Minister I can take 
steps to make it happen”.  This person was speaking to 400 
delegates at the annual general meeting of the Alberta branch of 
the federal Liberal Party.  Once again it was the same 
individual, the one we know so well to always say “ya know”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer a fourth quote:  “You want the triple E Senate and I 
want one too”.  This was given to the Toronto <I>Star</I> on 
February 2, 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not leave members in the dark and guessing.  I will share 
it with the folks back home.  All four quotes were from our 
current Prime Minister who continues to appoint people to the 
Senate of Canada despite all these promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch on several issues we are dealing with today in Bill 
S-21 as it relates to Canada's international obligations under 
the OECD convention on combating bribery of foreign public 
officials in international business transactions.  First I will 
talk about the foreign component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until recently we had foreigners who helped serve the House.  I 
remember a gentleman down the way by the name of Andrew Thompson. 
He was a foreigner, indeed, for he only spent one day in the 
spring and one day in the fall in the chamber we call the other 
place.  As a result he only spent 2.6% of his time.  What time is 
that, some may ask.  The sentence he served in the Senate which 
was only 65 to 68 days a year.  It was not a tough or arduous 
sentence by a long stretch but he only served 2.6% of it.  It 
left him with 97.4% of his time down in Mexico, a luxury many 
Canadians would like to enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch on a few things in this regard.  Our Prime 
Minister, whom I quoted four times in terms of his commitment to 
an elected Senate, wrote about Andrew Thompson in a letter: “The 
absence from the sittings of the Senate and the record of 
non-participation in the work of the caucus over many years are 
totally unacceptable”.  Our Prime Minister brought attention to 
the fact of the non-participation and the absence of a senator 
from the Liberal caucus.  Even the Prime Minister agrees that we 
had foreigners operating as legislators in our land.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Senate began keeping attendance sheets in June 1990, 
Andrew Thompson attended 12 sittings out of a total of 459 in the 
past two parliaments, a foreigner by any stretch of the 
imagination.  He was absent so often that, with the $519,550 he 
collected for attending his 14 days in the Senate, this absentee 
foreign senator earned $37,110 per day that he sat in that 
chamber, a handsome salary for a one day sitting.  Who in the 
land earns over $37,000 a day for merely sitting down in a chair? 
I cannot think of anyone, but Andy Thompson did.  He is not the 
only one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently debated a senator who had to defend Andy's record, a 
senator who has a 100% attendance record but is few and far 
between.  There are 17 senators who miss more days than they 
actually attend.  Can we imagine having a job and missing more 
days that we actually attend?  They are supposed to be docked 
$120 for every day missed.  However there is an honour system 
that allows them to miss for illness or business.  Some honour 
system, indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That addresses, as I said, the foreign aspects of Bill C-21, 
foreign bribery, foreign corruption.  Let us now talk more 
specifically about just the word corruption, this bribery.  I do 
not have to look very far.  I can look into the other place and 
see Michel Cogger.  What have we there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cogger, as of June 2 this year, was convicted of influence 
peddling, indeed some form of bribery.  He was convicted of 
peddling his influence between 1986 and 1988 to businessman Guy 
Montpetit for $212,000.  He was said to have plied his influence 
in Mr. Montpetit's bid to land government subsidies to set up a 
computer chip foundry in Vaudreuil and for his assistance in the 
computer translation project that benefited from $4 million from 
the Saskatchewan government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fitting with the term of corruption, Cogger's defence was that 
he did not have a corrupt state of mind, and there was some 
debate over whether or not his state of mind was corrupt, 
touching on the whole idea of corruption.  He was convicted of an 
indictable offence.  He was convicted of a felony or certainly an 
infamous crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the Senate actually go ahead and request his resignation? 
No.  Senators were too busy coming forward with Bill S-21, were 
they not?  That seemed to be a higher priority to our senators 
than to go ahead and get a resignation from one of their 
colleagues who was convicted of influence peddling.  That 
conviction has brought the Canadian Senate into further 
disrepute.  Senator Cogger should be the one who submits his 
resignation.  Otherwise he brings further disrepute over time to 
that institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a debate this weekend in Montreal.  I was debating one of 
the senators from that other place.  He was one of the senators 
who has a 100% attendance record.  My compliments go out to him 
for he is few and far between in that place.  I have heard from 
some people that the whole point there is to kind of reward loyal 
party followers.  I was told something that I found interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though Iona Campagnolo, whom I also met this weekend, is a 
very loyal party worker for the Liberal Party and many would 
suspect should be sitting in the Senate, she did not cosy up to 
the right prime minister or to the right candidate.  As everyone 
knows, she was a floor worker for Paul Martin at the Liberal 
leadership convention.  As a result, even though she is very 
competent and is a well respected Liberal MP, she was never 
appointed to the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to touch on my fifth point with regard to Bill S-21 
as it relates to bribery of foreign public officials and the idea 
that our Senate is full of bagmen, party fundraisers and people 
who have vested political interests with various parties.  I 
could go on. I was going to refer to some of the things that have 
gone on in the Senate and a list of some of the bills that 
originated there, but I digress.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am happy to rise today to speak in the debate on Bill S-21, the 
anti-corruption initiative that was taken at the OECD roughly a 
year ago. The memorandum of understanding was signed December 17, 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am concerned with in that regard is not the content of 
the bill necessarily, although I certainly would like to have had 
some time to call witnesses and hear what they had to say.  My 
concern is more that this was dropped on us on very short notice. 
I cannot understand why that would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had almost a full year to introduce this as a 
bill.  It did not do it.  It dropped the ball.  It requires five 
major economies of the OECD to sign this to bring it into effect 
so that it does not all fall apart before the end of the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four other countries, including the United States, found time to 
bring it through their legislative process.  I assume they are 
pretty busy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden there is a panic these last few days.  I know 
our committee ended up with this bill, looking at it last Tuesday 
afternoon.  Liberals told us the reason it had to be started in 
the Senate as opposed to the House of Commons was that they did 
not think they could get it through in time, that they knew they 
could rush it through the Senate and get it on to the floor for 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments of the parliamentary secretary in that regard were 
that it is a more efficient process to have it introduced there, 
therefore the need to bring it through that process rather than 
through the elected officials of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be more efficient from some points of view but not more 
efficient in terms of making a better bill. One reason it may be 
more efficient there is that the people appointed to the Senate 
do not have to go out and consult with constituents as we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall being on the foreign policy review, a review conducted 
jointly by the House of Commons and the Senate.  I found that 
many of the senators involved were completely out of date on the 
issues.  It took them several months to get them up to date in 
terms of what was happening in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest it was a good process for them because it gave them 
the opportunity to find out what the current thinking across 
Canada was.  I see it is a problem because they do not get out 
and regularly consult.  They do not need to.  They are appointed 
until their 75th year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the concept.  I was on the subcommittee that 
examined small and medium size enterprises.  We had a very good 
committee report.  We heard a lot of things from businesses that 
came to make presentations to our committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among them were the reasons that kept them out of the export 
business.  They were not competitive outside Canada largely due 
to factors like high taxes, a great deal of regulation that is 
very difficult for small businesses to comply with, proportionate 
costs to the small businesses doing that and things like 
interprovincial trade barriers.  They hurt their ability to get 
into the export business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those in the business did identify that bribery in the whole 
process of doing business outside Canada in some third world 
countries made it very difficult to do business.  I can quote 
from the OECD document: “Considering that bribery is a 
widespread phenomenon in international business transactions, 
including trade and investment, which raises serious moral and 
political concerns, it undermines good governance and economic 
development.  It distorts international competitive conditions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what they were telling us at committee.  I suggest that, 
to some extent, the OECD initiative came out of those SME 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the concept that we should make it illegal for our 
public servants and businessmen to bribe foreign officials.  The 
OECD plus a few other members have signed on to that convention 
and therefore will be bound by it when they sign the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome that.  It means that all of us who belong to the OECD, 
including Canada, including all our businesses, not just the 
private sector but our crown corporations, have to adhere to that 
as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that selling nuclear reactors around the world in the 
past got some Canadian officials into hot water in that area.  We 
see AECL having to be subsidized to build these nuclear reactors. 
We have to subsidize the sale of them through export credit 
through the Export Development Corporation and in the past we 
have needed a finders fee, and in some cases I suggest it was 
beyond that, to grease palms of member countries that were 
considering buying this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It certainly did lead to what has been identified at the OECD, 
serious moral and political concerns.  It undermines good 
governance and economic development and distorts international 
competitive conditions.  I agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a move in the right direction and we should move forward 
with it.  Our party intends to support it and will be happy that 
third reading takes place today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the consultation process the parliamentary secretary 
talked about in some detail?  The subcommittee on international 
trade and trade disputes was just about to start the process of 
calling witnesses.  We were denied that opportunity by a 
government that could not manage its own affairs.  It left this 
until the last moment before dropping it on us and then expects 
first, second and third reading to take place in one day.  There 
was no consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee was to consider the hearings and invite witnesses 
to tell us whether they thought it was a good deal or not.  We 
are not allowed to do that.  We had to railroad it through the 
Senate process in order to ram it through.  What about the 
consultation process?  The parliamentary secretary told us there 
was consultation with businesses this summer. Where were they? 
Who were they?  I guess we will find out in due course but it was 
not available to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the government learned nothing from the whole MAI process, 
that ordinary Canadians need to be consulted, not just its 
friends and special organizations, not just the industry groups 
but Canadians themselves? They want to be involved in something 
of the magnitude of the MAI.  Apparently the government does not 
recognize that as an important process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went through some kind of facade of a consultation process 
over the summer apparently when the House was not in session. 
Parliamentary committees did not really count for much.  We 
wanted that process of having witnesses.  We did not have that 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem.  Members over there have to get their house 
in order and understand that they had a full year to introduce 
the bill.  Here we are in a last minute turmoil, a last minute 
rush to go through today before the House rises for Christmas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still have some concerns with the act itself although it is a 
start in the right direction.  It makes it a criminal offence to 
bribe foreign officials by any members who sign on, and Canada 
will be signing on.  That is the right thing to do but there is 
still the matter of a facilitation fee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that even though the United States has 
adopted a similar concept with its foreign corruption practices 
act there still is the business of recognizing that a 
facilitation fee is allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me facilitation fees might become pretty large in 
the next few years and then what of the countries that have not 
signed on to this pact?  Only 29 OECD countries have. I think 
there are four or five others that will sign on as well, but 
there are a lot of others out there competing for business around 
the world.  Are they not going to adhere to the same code as the 
rest of us?  Does this not need to go further, into the World 
Trade Organization and try to incorporate it into the 135 member 
countries that make up the World Trade Organization?  It seems it 
does. There is no further plan to do that in this legislation but 
we are happy to make a start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a step in the right direction.  We will support all three 
readings today in the House of Commons as a result of this 
initiative.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
demand to know something from my hon. colleague on the subject of 
some of these other things that have come from the other place, 
Bill S-3, Bill S-4, Bill S-5, Bill S-9, Bill S-16.  One of them 
has to do with senators voting themselves a pay increase.  One of 
them is the Canada Shipping Act and how that relates to Canada 
Steamship Line.  One has to do with the Evidence Act, persons and 
human rights.  A young fellow in Ottawa, Michael O'Connor, is 
assembling a class action law suit in terms of his not getting 
fair value for his money with regard to the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-9 had to do with financial administration.  The Senate 
did something useful in its lifetime with the GST and saving us 
$10 billion by blocking it and dropping it from 11% to 9% to 7%. 
Bill S-16 implemented an agreement between Canada and the 
socialist republic of Vietnam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether my hon. colleague could address some of the 
other things that have happened and originated in the other place 
and how they relate to Bill S-21, the whole idea of foreign 
corruption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have already 
outlined the concern I had that this was introduced in the 
Senate.  As the parliamentary secretary said, it is a more 
efficient process.  It might be a more efficient process but it 
lacks the legitimacy it needs.  The reason is members there 
technically have the right to introduce this legislation.  But it 
becomes a matter of legitimacy.  I believe that institution has 
discredited itself so badly with the Canadian public that it 
really is a matter of how it is viewed, whether there is 
legitimacy in legislation coming from that body. I suggest there 
is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the public does not believe there is any reason that 
legislation needs to be introduced in the Senate.  This is the 
institution where the public has the chance to elect and not 
re-elect members after a term of office.  It has the ultimate say 
as to whether members of parliament are in place as a result of 
doing good work or bad work after a period of time. That does not 
happen in the other place.  There is an opportunity for the 
Senate to become a legitimate body if it were elected and equal. 
I would welcome that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States Senate was not always elected either.  It did 
not happened until 1910.  Oregon was the first state that made a 
major initiative. It wanted to elect its senators.  It was a very 
strange request at the time.  Others thought it would not work. 
It took about five years and then the entire process led to an 
elected senate in the United States.  It has the legitimacy 
needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is the House ready 
for the question?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
following is from the October 1988 report of the Standing 
Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs entitled 
“Moving Forward: A Strategic Plan for Quality of Life 
Improvements in the Canadian Forces”: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Canadian Forces must be fairly and equitably 
compensated for the work they do and the risks they take. Members 
and their families should never have to suffer the indignity of 
substandard housing, nor should they be reduced to charity in 
order to feed their families. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lifestyle faced by military personnel often makes it well 
nigh impossible to support a dual income lifestyle.  Due to 
compulsory posting of Canadian forces personnel, spouses must 
often forego their own careers or any reasonable hope of having a 
regular, well paying job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Working alongside civilians and the RCMP, many armed forces 
personnel working to counter the savaging effects of the great 
ice storm of 1998 found themselves being paid less for the same 
work and facing harsher living conditions than their non-military 
co-workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first recommendation in “Moving Forward” is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the base pay gap between non-commissioned members and their 
public service equivalents be closed no later than April 1st 
1999. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is less than four months away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I very much hope this government will not risk the health, 
safety and even lives of Canadian forces personnel by taking 
these funds from purchases which would otherwise be made to 
guarantee the safety of military and civilian workers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked my question in the House on November 4 of this 
year, the minister chose not to answer the question.  I hope the 
government will produce the information requested in response to 
my comments at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, I would like to know, and I am quite sure 
Canadians would want to know, what military hardware is currently 
mothballed in warehouses and elsewhere throughout our land. There 
must be big ticket items that are neither currently be used nor 
intended for use. I know the government recently sold Chinook 
helicopters to the Netherlands after paying to refit them at a 
high cost to the Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us see an inventory of unused hardware that might be sold to 
other allied countries.  I am concerned that the government may 
be reluctant to provide this information so as not to be 
embarrassed by the amount or value of the equipment purchased 
that was never used or used for a short period of time before 
becoming obsolete or incompatible with other equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are there CF-18s in storage in Bagotville and Cold Lake which 
could be sold to NATO partners to generate revenues?  What about 
ADATs, air defence anti-tank systems?  Are these mothballed in 
storage somewhere outside Montreal and could revenues be 
generated from their sale to NATO partners?  What about any plans 
to mothball frigates?  Is there some way equipment can be turned 
into revenue to deal with pay and living conditions for service 
personnel? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is part of the problem that the Canadian military has too many 
top level brass for the number of lower ranking service 
personnel?  Is the balance between upper ranking officers and 
lower ranking personnel on par with that of other NATO countries 
or is there a real imbalance in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has the responsibility to ensure that both 
civilian and military personnel are properly paid and housed.  It 
also has the obligation to minimize waste in the military.  This 
is a challenge I expect the government to meet.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to begin 
with sincere thanks to the Standing Committee on National 
Defence and Veterans Affairs for their work on behalf of the 
Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members are aware, enhancing the quality of life of 
armed forces personnel and their families constitutes the number 
one priority of those in charge of the department and of the 
Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a broad range of questions to be addressed, in 
particular pay raises for all levels of the military, employee 
benefits, and housing allowances. 
We strongly support the committee's efforts aimed at 
improvements in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department does, however, have to meet some sizeable 
financial challenges if it is to make the desired changes.  As 
the minister has said, it would be very difficult to improve the 
quality of life for Canadian forces personnel without raising 
the defence budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are convinced that it would be unproductive to dig into the 
operating or training budgets to finance new quality of life 
projects, because all these components are important to 
operational efficiency.  The committee supported this position 
in our report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department and the Canadian forces will continue to manage 
their resources in order to ensure a balance between these vital 
areas, including managing materiel as economically as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The size of the Canadian forces has been reduced over the last 
decade, and consequently some materiel has been declared surplus 
to present needs.  Whenever possible, the department attempts to 
dispose of surplus materiel, but this is a highly complex 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some cases, when it is cost-effective, the department tries to 
modernize its materiel in order to avoid costly total 
replacements.  This is the only way we will succeed in 
optimizing operational efficiency and in fulfilling our 
commitments to all Canadians, our allies and the—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I raised a question on October 1 to the 
Minister of Finance.  I asked the minister to do the right thing 
and cut EI premiums immediately.  The minister answered by saying 
that it is the government's intention to stay the course.  He did 
not once answer why he would not cut EI premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from British Columbia.  British Columbia is in the midst 
of a recession.  Most economists agree that one of the fastest 
ways to escape a recession is to lower payroll taxes.  One of the 
ways to stimulate the economy and especially job creation is to 
lower the taxation on jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Employers and employees are co-financing the employment 
insurance fund.  Employees are paying $2.70 for every $100 of 
income and employers are paying $3.78 for every $100 in employee 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, last week the finance minister announced that EI 
premiums would be cut a measly 15 cents for every $100 of income. 
Well, whoop-de-do.  That is like comparing the government to a 
schoolyard bully who robs a child of their lunch money and then 
gives them back a few cents, hoping the child will not feel too 
upset.  The government should learn a lesson from this.  No 
matter how one views it, I think it is theft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current EI law is clear:  premium rates should be no more 
than needed to keep the fund in actuarial balance.  The chief 
actuary of the EI account stated recently that a $10 billion to 
$15 billion accumulated surplus is more than enough.  The latest 
figures have the surplus at a whopping $19 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If EI premiums were reduced by 33% next year, the fund would 
still be balanced with sufficient reserve.  Instead, the Minister 
of Finance has other liberal ideas.  One, he is using the surplus 
to balance his books.  Two, he is using the rest to pay for new 
programs.  The government over-collects for other purposes.  It 
is a tax on jobs and it is also against the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers paid into the fund and therefore the money belongs to 
them.  The EI premiums need to be put back into the pockets of 
the payers.  Instead of keeping the money in a political slush 
fund, the minister needs to be a wise administrator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to challenge the government to show me a small 
business owner in this country who believes that high payroll 
taxes encourage growth or is the right thing to do at this point 
in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the November issue of <I>Maclean's</I> magazine one reader 
sent in the following letter to the editor: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Employment Insurance fund was short, the government cut 
off some recipients, lowered the benefits to others and increased 
the premiums of all.  When the EI fund swells from excess 
contributions, and sacrifices of the unfortunate, the government 
steals the money under a scheme to buy votes from the same people 
they robbed.  The media are pussyfooting around this profanity 
just like they downplayed the (Heritage Minister's) flag caper, 
the survival of the GST, the (P.M.'s) NAFTA boner, the (Health 
Minister's) paper wars with gun-toting non-criminals and the 
hepatitis C charity farce, the chopper flip, the Pearson airport 
disgrace, another Quebec armoury with no arms to put in, and the 
64-cent Canadian dollar.  The big-mouthed watchdogs of public 
good in the media all play dead for the Liberals. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I am standing here today is because the Minister of 
Finance did not answer my question.  Perhaps he could have 
answered my question with the statement he gave on October 17, 
1994.  He said then “We believe there is nothing more ludicrous 
than a tax on hiring.  But that is what payroll taxes are.  They 
have grown dramatically over time.  They affect lower wage 
earners much more than those at the high end”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the government can explain why it does not listen to the 
auditor general who has commented that it would not be legal to 
use the premiums or make payments from the account for other 
purposes other than those stipulated in the Employment Insurance 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister knows the law.  His parliamentary secretary knows 
the law.  Why do they insist on breaking the law? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask the question again.  Perhaps the parliamentary 
secretary will be able to delete the rhetoric from his speech and 
tell Canadians why they cannot be given back the entire amount of 
the over-collection.  When will the premiums reflect the cost? 
When will the government become fiscally responsible and live 
within its means, for surely the lowly taxpayer must?  Why can 
the government not live within its means, just obey the rules and 
have premiums reflect the true cost of the plan? 
<P><A NAME="LINK285"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member asked me to 
delete the rhetoric from my response.  I do not have any rhetoric 
at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member first asked this question it concerned how 
the EI premium rate was set.  In his original question he stated 
that every year the finance minister meets with the Employment 
Insurance Commission in mid-November to set the employment rates. 
As that statement indicates, it is very clearly false.  The 
Minister of Finance does not meet with the employment 
commissioners, has no intention of meeting with them and has 
never met with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer the hon. member a quick lesson on how the premium is 
set.  It is set by commissioners who are appointed after 
consultation with their respective organizations which are 
representative of workers and employers.  There is the Deputy 
Minister and Associate Deputy Minister of Human Resources 
Development for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only after the commission has set the rate that the 
Minister of Finance and the Minister of Human Resources 
Development play a role.  They jointly recommend the commission's 
rate for governor in council approval.  They do not meet with the 
commissioners at any time to discuss the actual rate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member talks about EI premium cuts, he knows very 
clearly that since coming to office the government has continued 
to reduce the employment insurance premiums and will continue to 
do so each and every year.  When we arrived the Tories had it 
going up.  We have it going down and we will continue to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to do that in balance.  We know that there are 
Canadian priorities.  The reduction of EI premiums is one of 
those priorities and we will continue to maintain that downward 
track.  But we will also continue to ensure that there is 
balance: a balanced budget, reduction in taxes and reinvestment 
in health care.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
on October 28 I posed a question to the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food.  As the House will recognize, that was more than a 
month ago.  I would have hoped that the issue I raised would have 
been dealt with by this time and that we would have a policy and 
a program in place that would in fact help the agricultural 
producers in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I am very saddened to say that still the government is 
waffling.  It has not put anything concrete forward so that 
farmers can take some solace in the fact that there is actually a 
government that cares about agriculture in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question was quite simple.  It stated that producers in the 
country right now have incomes that are down 55%.  This is a huge 
industry, involving some $50 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States at the time dealt with the issue by announcing 
a $6 billion program the week before this question was posed. The 
U.S. question was not “When will?” or “Will we put forward 
support for our farmers?”, it was “How much?”  The question of 
how much was answered the day I posed the question.  It was some 
$6 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to say, but Canada is now the second lowest, if 
not the lowest of the OECD with respect to support for its 
agricultural producers.  Our government seems to be fiddling 
while farm incomes not only burn, but unfortunately farms are 
being lost right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I tabled this late show is because the minister came 
back with some very facetious answers concerning the policy and 
the platform of the Conservative Party in the last election 
campaign.  He talked about the amalgamation of the departments of 
the environment, natural resources and agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention that because the parliamentary secretary some days 
later, during an emergency debate that was instigated by the 
Progressive Conservative Party, took 10 minutes of the House's 
valuable time to spew nothing but political rhetoric.  He did not 
deal with this very important issue, but only with the political 
position of his party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like some answers from the parliamentary secretary with 
respect to what is now happening with the proposed program that 
is to come forward.  Today in the House I asked if the program 
will be announced before the House rises for the Christmas break 
and if there will be criteria associated with that program which 
will allow cash to flow to producers who require it before the 
spring seeding which will begin in the new year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In dealing with that I would say that we do have some experience 
we can point to.  The previous Progressive Conservative 
government put into place the well respected and received NISA 
program which is still in place for agricultural producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 we also put forward the GRIP program, the gross revenue 
insurance program, which this government in its wisdom decided in 
1995 to do away with.  Why did it do that?  It did it because 
there was short term gain for some very long term pain.  We are 
recognizing that today.  The pain is now only showing up at the 
farm gates and farmyards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government had any vision it would have maintained that 
program or, at the very least, put in a program that would have 
had the vision to see the problems that could present themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary is going to get up now and probably 
not answer any of those questions or any of these issues.  If he 
wants to talk about policy—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, since the 
member for Brandon—Souris mentioned the minister's remarks and 
my own remarks that were made recently, I promise tonight, unless 
provoked, not to raise the platform of the fifth party again.  I 
would like to leave that now and bring the member up to date on 
what we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member as a member of the committee knows what is 
going on.  The reason why we are taking a little longer is that 
we know the pressure on producers and we have known it for some 
time.  Producers have told us that they did not want an ad hoc 
program.  Therefore, if we are not doing an ad hoc program, we do 
not want to be sending out cheques to people for various amounts. 
No one will know what we are doing or how we are doing it.  We 
will take our time.  Time is running short, but we will take our 
time to make sure we do it right for the short term and right for 
the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 26 the minister made a presentation to cabinet where 
he had the opportunity to present the plan to his colleagues. 
Obviously we cannot talk about the exact details of the plan 
because it is still being discussed in cabinet.  The minister put 
forward his plan on how he wants to help Canadian producers 
impacted by the current situation.  There was a good discussion 
on the issue and the government realizes the severity of the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>November 26 was not a decision making day.  There are a number 
of important steps that have yet to be taken before a final 
decision is made.  It is still early to indicate what amount of 
additional assistance is being contemplated.  Assistance to 
farmers is one of several important priority areas for investment 
including knowledge and innovation, the alleviation of child 
poverty, and health care.  Therefore we are competing for—

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK290"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, on September 29, 1998, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development said, in reply to my question, that the 
employment insurance program was funded by employers and 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We fully agree with that statement. In fact, the government 
should not forget that it no longer contributes to the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give an idea of the situation, on December 2, 1998, the whole 
$13 billion required to fund the employment insurance program 
for the 1998-99 fiscal year, which began on April 1, 1998 and 
will end in March 1999, had already been collected. This means 
that, as of December 2, the money put into the fund is used by 
the government for other purposes, such as paying off part of 
the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is workers earning $39,000 or less, and the unemployed, who 
made the greatest contribution to the fight against the deficit. 
Now, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Human Resources 
Development want to use that money to generate surpluses and pay 
off the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These ministers are forgetting that there are people who do not 
pay employment insurance premiums. 
They include all the ministers, members of parliament and 
self-employed workers, who are not employees. These people are 
not asked to do their part. Those who do the largest part to pay 
this huge debt down are middle and low income earners. And that 
is unacceptable to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could someone on the government side explain how we ended up 
with contribution rates being reduced by 15 cents, from $2.70 to 
$2.55, which will result in bringing the 1998-99 surplus down by 
only $260 million? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By cutting rates by only 15 cents, the finance minister did 
nothing to improve his image as someone who is misappropriating 
money from the EI fund to use it for other purposes. 
Money continues to be diverted from its intended purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On their pay stubs, employees see “employment insurance 
contributions”. Therefore they expect these amounts to be paid 
into their employment insurance plan and not to be used for any 
other purpose. That is why the concept of misappropriation of 
funds remains valid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the fact that the employment insurance program can 
be self-financing with premiums of $2 per $100 of insurable 
earnings, and that the current rate is $2.55 per $100, could the 
government not spare another 40 cents per $100, or approximately 
$3 billion, to correct the inequities in the system? 
Because of these inequities, the number of claimants and the 
amount and duration of benefits are dropping rapidly, with the 
result that the federal government is being accused of 
contributing to poverty through its failure to act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a first step in the fight against poverty, should it not 
restore its EI system to decent and acceptable levels so that, 
on the one hand, employees feel that they are paying into a 
system that provides sufficient benefits and that they are 
getting their money's worth?  On the other hand, since only four 
out of ten unemployed workers draw benefits, could the federal 
government not be required to put this $3 billion towards 
improving the system so that the war on poverty can resume and 
wealth can be shared more equally? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not time to leave behind the federal government's cash-cow 
concept of employment insurance and go back to a system that 
provides adequate benefits and leaves employers and employees 
feeling that they have got their money's worth?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
government is very concerned with the situation of unemployed 
Canadians and wants to help them to make ends meet while they are 
between jobs and then to get back into the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague on the opposite side of the House starts off 
tonight with his statement that there are $13 billion in the fund 
and that is enough to finance 1998-99.  He fails to mention that 
the recently announced reduction in the premium rate of 15 cents 
from $2.70 to $2.55 will save workers and employers $1.1 billion 
a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also fails to mention that the EI fund has been in deficit 
seven out of the last ten years.  During those years average 
taxpayers in Canada paid out EI benefits through their taxes, in 
other words from the general revenues.  Average taxpayers in 
Canada shared their ability to pay into the general revenue fund 
through taxes with those who were less fortunate and found 
themselves unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the EI fund is in surplus, it sounds as if the member 
opposite does not want that fund shared with other Canadian 
taxpayers who may have priorities other than benefits to EI 
recipients.  That is why we took on the difficult task of 
modernizing a 25 year old system which no longer met the needs of 
today's work environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that getting Canadians back to work is the only real 
long term solution to high unemployment.  That is why we shifted 
the focus from reliance on benefits to active re-employment 
measures, for example, the 31,000 jobs that have been created in 
areas of high unemployment because of the transitional job fund. 
Thousands of other Canadians are benefiting from the $2 billion 
we reinvested in active employment measures.  We believe that 
helping people to help themselves is the key to their success.
