</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to speak in support of Bill C-202, an act to amend the 
criminal code concerning flight.  I also rise to thank members 
from all sides of the House who have worked together to transform 
this bill into a non-partisan effort.  I trust that this 
co-operative spirit will continue so that we can make Bill C-202 
law in the briefest possible time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A special thanks must go to our colleague from Leeds—Grenville, 
a strong contributor and co-sponsor of Bill C-202.  Of course we 
owe the largest debt of gratitude to our colleague, the member 
for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, for developing, drafting and 
tabling this bill during the first session of this parliament. 
Without his determined efforts we would not be here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-202 sets out straightforward principles that are shared 
by Canadians.  Individuals who use motor vehicles to flee and 
evade police, who cause police chases, who put the lives of 
police and innocent citizens at risk must learn that such 
behaviour will be severely punished.  By way of Bill C-202 these 
individuals will learn that Canadians and parliament will not 
tolerate such behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-202 creates a new and separate offence for using a motor 
vehicle to flee and evade police.  The penalties are tough, 
providing a maximum imprisonment of five years in cases of 
pursuit to evade police.  There is a maximum imprisonment of 14 
years where the pursuit results in bodily harm, and when a 
pursuit results in death the penalty provides for life 
imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals who flee and evade police in cars, trucks and vans 
are a significant risk to public safety.  The penalties set forth 
in Bill C-202 reflect the seriousness of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that the Canadian Police Association, the Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police and La Federation des policiers 
et policière du Québec have publicly come forward in support of 
the bill, a bill that will help protect police officers and make 
Canadian streets safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who flee police inflict tremendous human costs on our 
communities.  According to the CAA, in Ontario alone between 1991 
and 1997 there were over 10,000 high speed chases that resulted 
in 2,415 injured people and 33 deaths.  These people are our 
friends, neighbours and the police officers upon whom we depend 
for our protection.  That is why we need Bill C-202. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 28, 1999, Sergeant Rick McDonald of the Sudbury regional 
police was struck and killed by a van fleeing police. He was 
laying down a spike belt.  Our friend Rick was only 38. 
Words are so inadequate to express the senseless nature of this 
tragedy. 
Sergeant McDonald's wife Corrine is also a member of the Sudbury 
regional police service. 
Sergeant McDonald's family is represented here today by his 
sister Marlene Viau. 
Sergeant McDonald's colleagues and the community he served so 
proudly all want to see Bill C-202 become law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would go even further to say that they need to see this bill 
become law and they need to know that the tragic death of a man 
they loved and respected, a man who gave so much of himself, will 
lead to a law that will improve safety on our streets, a law that 
will help save the lives of other police officers throughout 
Canada and a law that will severely punish those individuals who 
put our communities at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to support immediate passage of 
the bill because we all know that it is the right thing to do for 
our communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to stand today to support Bill C-202, an act to 
amend the criminal code regarding flight from a police vehicle, 
which was put forward by the member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hardly a week goes by without reading in the papers about the 
carnage on the highways as a result of an individual fleeing the 
police.  In many cases an innocent person pays with his or her 
life as a result of this reckless behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such was the case in Toronto when Father Ilce Miovski was at the 
wrong place at the wrong time.  Father Miovski was struck and 
killed by a stolen car being pursued by Scarborough police.  A 21 
year old man now faces nine charges, including criminal 
negligence causing death, impaired driving causing death and 
theft over $5,000.  Unfortunately we do not have a specific 
section in our criminal code which deals with the offence of 
fleeing a police officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts of these cases are indeed frightening.  Between 1991 
and 1997 police entered into more than 10,000 high speed chases 
in the province of Ontario alone.  That is over 1,000 high speed 
chases a year in Ontario.  Six innocent bystanders were killed as 
a result of these chases, another 33 who were directly involved 
were killed and 198 were injured.  This has to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said previously, fleeing police as it now stands is not a 
separate offence.  Bill C-202 proposes a new criminal code 
prohibition against leading police on a high speed chase and it 
would add maximum penalties.  This is a good first step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for taking this issue forward.  I am 
pleased to say that this bill is endorsed by all parties within 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maximum penalty for evading a police officer in a motor 
vehicle will be raised from two to five years.  The maximum 
penalty for injuring an individual while trying to flee police 
will be raised from 10 to 14 years.  Anyone who causes the death 
of another person is liable to imprisonment for life.  This is 
testimony to the emphasis put on this issue and the gravity of 
these offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general for Ontario is very supportive of this 
bill, in particular for its criminal code implications. Ontario's 
solicitor general has tabled his own code of conduct for police 
officers involved in high speed chases.  In my own province of 
B.C. the attorney general introduced new rules in September, 
specifying that police can only close the distance and chase 
without lights and sirens if an officer has reasonable grounds to 
believe the vehicle has been involved in an indictable offence. 
Officers in that situation have to regard public safety before 
starting a chase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While these actions attempt to address the growing menace of our 
highways, they do not stop the behaviour of the criminals who 
take on the police.  The criminals must be stopped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-202 sends a message that society has simply had enough of 
this carnage.  Leading a police car in a chase is akin to taking 
a lethal weapon in the form of a two tonne vehicle and driving it 
with abandon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some of the more disturbing facts about high speed 
chases.  From 1993 to 1997 high speed chases on the island of 
Montreal killed three people and injured 59.  In B.C. the RCMP 
and 12 municipal police forces were involved in over 4,000 high 
speed chases from 1990 to 1997.  Twenty-one people were killed 
and another 748 were injured.  This problem is growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these pursuits can cover great distances, as one in 
Ottawa did recently, where a young intoxicated person with his 16 
year old girlfriend took the Ontario police on a 50 kilometre 
chase.  That same week a 21 year old Brampton, Ontario woman who 
was pulling out of a parking lot was killed by a drunk driver 
travelling at 140 kilometres an hour trying to evade police. 
This is the situation we have at the present time.  Just last 
week a teenager in Aldergrove, B.C. died while driving a stolen 
van in a police chase.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people would paint the police as causing the deaths.  The 
police are not the problem.  The people driving the cars are the 
problem.  Telling police not to chase, hands these criminals 
carte blanche.  For all intents and purposes, it says “If you 
want to carry out a criminal offence, simply get in a car and 
drive fast.  The police won't chase you”.  We do not want that 
to happen.  This is hardly the way to attack the problem and in 
fact it avoids it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice is currently studying the problem of 
police pursuits.  The justice minister seems to realize that in 
many cases the police are able to lay criminal code charges, such 
as for dangerous driving, but in other cases the offender just 
receives a slap on the wrist.  This is wrong.  Society has had it 
with these people and it wants to have the problem put to an end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-202 does just that.  The problem is escalating and we 
simply must act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-202 proposes necessary amendments to the criminal code 
which will deter individuals from taking police on high speed 
chases and endangering or taking away the lives of innocent 
bystanders.  I fully support the bill and hope that it has speedy 
passage through the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, as 
every previous speaker has already said, there has indeed been 
all-party support for this bill.  The Bloc Quebecois made up its 
mind some time ago.  We have supported the hon. member from the 
start.  A number of members even signed the forms to speed up 
the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the object of the bill is concerned, it is obvious 
that the various parties support it because it meets a 
significant need.  The Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights heard a number of witnesses. They told us that there was 
something missing from the Criminal Code, from the legislation, 
and that a change like this one would fulfil a need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens today if someone steals a car, tries to get away 
from the police and is finally arrested?  At most, he will be 
charged with theft.  If there really has been a police chase, if 
it can be proven that there has been dangerous driving, he will 
also be charged with that offence.  But for there to be a 
conviction for dangerous driving, there has to  be very strong 
evidence of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a specific clause in the legislation, we are going to have 
a precise response to an offence. Its addition to the Criminal 
Code will meet a crying need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not cite statistics, as all of the parties have already 
done so. 
These statistics tell us that there have indeed been a number of 
court cases in Quebec and in all of Canada. Unfortunately, these 
proceedings are not all listed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we do not have specific numbers regarding this 
situation. I want to make it clear that we support Bill C-202. In 
so doing, we are not supporting the party opposite, but the 
police officers who have asked repeatedly for this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that we will also be asked to speed up the process. The 
House will submit a request to all parties, asking that this 
bill be referred to the Senate as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the introduction of Bill C-20 by the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, the Bloc Quebecois has decided it 
will not co-operate with an undemocratic government. 
That was our approach in December and it is still our approach 
today. However, there are exceptions to any rule, and the bill 
before us today is one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a government bill, but a private member's bill. It 
was drafted at the request of the witnesses heard by the 
committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House are democrats. The Bloc Quebecois 
has always reacted in a very democratic fashion and it listens 
to what Quebecers want. And Quebecers have said, through, among 
others, police officers and the Quebec police federations, that 
they want parliament to pass Bill C-202. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will make an exception and agree to this accelerated process. 
I do hope that the government opposite will take its cue from us 
and will set its politicking aside when it comes to issues 
regarding which Quebecers are unanimously opposed to the 
adoption of certain bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention only two that are extremely important to me.  The 
first is Bill C-3 on the young offenders, which Quebec opposes 
unanimously.  I would hope there are democrats on the other side 
of the House who will do their work and tell the Minister of 
Justice that the bill is not wanted in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is, naturally, Bill C-20.  The great democrat sitting 
in the seat of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs should 
come and visit Quebec to hear what Quebecers have to say about 
Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope he will rise in this House, as I am doing as a 
democrat today, and say “Quebecers do not want this bill, and I 
have decided to withdraw it”. I would hope that the government 
opposite will say yes to Quebec's demands, as the Bloc Quebecois 
did to Bill C-202, which it supports, and it will work with the 
House to expedite its passage so that the police in Quebec and 
the rest of Canada may have it at their disposal in order to act 
effectively and, most importantly, offer Quebecers and Canadians 
greater security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I thank the police in the gallery listening to 
the debate.  They have done a fantastic job, and I mention among 
others Yves Prud'homme of the Fédération des policiers du Québec 
and thank him.  He enlightened me further, although I already 
supported the bill.  This is why, among other reasons, the Bloc 
Quebecois is supporting this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak today in favour of Bill 
C-202, an act to amend the Criminal Code and strengthen the laws 
involving criminal flight from police pursuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin my remarks by recognizing the efforts of the 
policing community in bringing this matter to fruition.  This is 
a very practical and admirable amendment.  Those congratulations 
must also extend to the hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge 
and his supporting mover from Leeds—Grenville.  They have both 
displayed exemplary perseverance and a non-partisanship that is 
uncommon and remarkable in this place.  The member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge obviously recognizes the need for 
greater good in areas of justice and public protection.  I offer 
him our unconditional support.  Chapeau, monsieur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party has always supported crime prevention and 
police forces across the country.  We have continually demanded 
that government correct the problem of underfunded and overworked 
police forces that are trying to deal with the growing violence 
that exists in the country, especially amongst youth, biker 
gangs, organized crime and cross-border terrorism.  The example 
we saw in Washington state in December 1999 exemplifies some of 
the problems that exist in law enforcement in the country.  Human 
smuggling and other issues are the daily tasks that face our men 
and women in blue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP Public Complaints Commission, speaking specifically to 
this bill, issued a report last December calling on police to 
take measures to reduce death and injuries caused by dangerous 
police chases.  This has highlighted the problem that exists in 
the country and highlights recent government neglect of policing 
and public safety. 
Funding cuts to the RCMP and indirect cuts through transfer 
payments have also affected municipal police forces.  Other 
problems have been created because of government policy in the 
area of prisoner release, like dangerous prisoners being placed 
in minimum security prisons.  I note for the record that Gary 
Fitzgerald is still on the loose from Ferndale prison.  We also 
have a weak youth criminal justice system.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has consistently shown that combating criminal 
activity is not a priority.  Yet we see a backbench member, the 
hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, bringing forward what 
is obviously a very informed and exemplary piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand from a reliable source that this is the first time 
a backbench member has been able to achieve this level of change 
within the criminal code.  He has obviously come up with a good 
piece of legislation.  It is surprising and disappointing that 
his party was not able to do so through the Minister of Justice. 
Perhaps the hon. member on the back bench should be on the front 
bench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Liberals have misplaced billions of dollars at HRDC, 
the RCMP cannot even investigate major fraud files in British 
Columbia because of a lack of resources.  Simply repeating bland 
generalities, as we have heard from the solicitor general, does 
very little to help frontline police officers.  I suggest that it 
increases the growing cynicism and sense of frustration in those 
brave men and women.  Hopefully the RCMP will not be forced to 
engage in its own fundraising efforts similar to what we saw in 
the controversial true blue campaign in Toronto because of the 
lack of government support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope Bill C-202, which has been delayed since December, will 
receive no further delays.  There have been attempts to amend and 
improve the legislation, which has been embraced with open arms 
by the hon. member.  It must be underlined that this bill is far 
too important to be engaging in partisan politics or to be 
holding it up.  It is important for frontline police officers and 
innocent civilians who could be injured or killed as a result of 
high speed chases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-202 will serve as a deterrent.  Many of the substantial 
changes, which have been outlined by previous speakers, are:  up 
to five years in prison for evading a police officer using a 
motor vehicle or injuring someone in the process; up to fourteen 
years for a person killed in a pursuit by irresponsible driving; 
or, a life sentence for those who engage in such an activity.  We 
should have no qualms about codifying in our criminal code that 
escaping from the police, who are in pursuit of a person, poses a 
danger to everyone on our highways and roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it be in a community of a small town or a large city, it 
goes without saying that this type of activity is extremely 
dangerous.  Whether a person is injured with a knife, a gun or 
any type of weapon, or a car that is used in a irresponsible 
fashion, the criminal code has to be amended and codified so our 
judges and our justice system can respond appropriately and 
proportionately.  The judges of this country must be given leeway 
to respond to and reflect on the gravity of these types of 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments, which we are supporting, toughen up the 
original draft and allow more judicial discretion.  We know 
judicial discretion is a wonderful thing if it is properly 
exercised.  The amendments surrounding flight, and the type of 
carnage, injury and death that can result, are aimed at doing 
just that; toughening up response and responding appropriately 
with general and specific deterrents aimed at both treating the 
offender with a firm hand and sending a message to the general 
public that our system is adequately responding and responding in 
a way that is appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minor aspects of this bill involve those who cause police 
chases.  They are now being charged with crimes that include 
crimes under the Highway Traffic Act, offences which vary from 
province to province.  Dangerous driving and criminal negligence 
causing bodily harm or death are already there but this singles 
out and puts the focus on a specific problem.  It also brings 
about a greater form of continuity and a common response from the 
provinces across the country.  We all know that consistency and 
an even-handed approach is what the criminal code should try to 
portray. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Issues of flight from police came to the forefront last year, 
particularly in Toronto.  March 21 marked the death of Father 
Ilce Miovski, age 50, and March 27 marked the death of Valeri 
Kovaliv, age 41.  Both were pedestrians, innocent victims, hit by 
runaway vehicles fleeing the police. 
It was only March and he was 1999's fifth victim of a police 
chase in or around greater metropolitan Toronto.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enacting tougher legislation would reflect the public's 
abhorrence to such reckless and dangerous acts and would deter 
flight from police.  It would make an example of criminals who 
place innocent lives at risk through such thoughtlessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lives at risk often include the lives of police officers who 
often drive outdated unsafe police cruisers due to cutbacks. 
Innocent bystanders on the street are most at risk when killed in 
the midst of a car chase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminals may be fleeing from an unpaid parking ticket or a 
speeding charge which has led to such a chase.  Many flee because 
there are legal consequences for relatively minor criminal 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know there are other instances where high speed chases 
are a result of criminals who know that when they are taken into 
police custody they will face serious ramifications for 
outstanding warrants or other criminal acts that they may have 
committed prior to becoming engaged in the chase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many in the country feel that police chases using such tactics 
as roadblocks, spike belts, helicopter surveillance et cetera 
would be a more effective approach.  In reality, increasingly we 
find that the lack of funding impacts greatly on the ability of 
the police to engage in other types of responses.  These devices 
do not always help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very real example involved Calgary police Constable Richard 
Sonnenberg who on October 8, 1993 used a police spike belt to 
stop a car from fleeing police.  The car was driving, as I 
understand it, at 170 kilometres an hour.  The car veered away 
from the police spike belt and hit the officer killing him 
instantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police are very often faced with making split second 
instantaneous decisions. We must remember that anyone is at risk, 
anyone can be killed when these types of chases begin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further tragedy was that in the case of Mr. Sonnenberg the 
criminal was given a six year sentence for criminal negligence 
causing death.  This underlines the importance of the provisions 
of Bill C-202. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that life does not mean life in this country, but I 
would suggest that the recognition of this type of offence 
resulting in the loss of life and it being codified in the 
criminal code sends a very important message to all.  The need to 
give our justice system the ability to respond appropriately to 
those who escape justice does send that message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly police are faced with this difficult situation.  We 
know that the public complaints commission has released some very 
pointed and useful responses that the government should be quick 
to embrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by saying that we can do more, but this bill 
certainly addresses part of the problem and it is a big part that 
we in this House can all embrace and pass quickly.  It is a very 
smart and reasonable step in the right direction, a direction 
that recognizes the attempts to address the serious problems with 
flight from police.  I urge all hon. members to support this bill 
and others aimed at improving Canada's criminal code.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
want to reiterate the New Democratic Party's support for this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has been said today indicating that it is a non-partisan 
bill. I believe it has the support pretty much of all members of 
the House which we will see when the vote takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The highlights of the bill indicate that it creates specific 
offences for anyone who while using a motor vehicle fails to stop 
for the police.  It sets the penalty for committing the offence 
as imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that something had to be done to address 
the problem, to give police the tools to work with to stop the 
high speed chases.  We also had to put in place laws that will 
make it a criminal offence so that the police are able to do 
their job properly.  So often, as the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough indicated, this government has 
failed to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the laws of Canada are questioned a number of times as 
to whether or not they are severe. Parliamentarians are often 
torn as to how to protect civil liberties and the rights of 
people against the rights of victims. There is no question that 
there has been agreement on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases the problem is the government's support of its 
police forces. We have seen a number of classic examples in the 
last months of not enough funding for the RCMP to carry through 
on cases.  I am talking about cases dealing not just with petty 
theft but with million dollar extortions.  If we do not give the 
RCMP enough funds to proceed with those cases, how on earth do we 
expect it to act on each and every piece of legislation that 
comes through? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reiterate our support and thank the hon. members who 
are going to support this bill.  As well I want to thank the 
member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge for putting forth this bill. 
I also want to thank those backbenchers, one of whom has come up 
with this bill, and ask them to put pressure on the government. 
We in the opposition will continue to pressure the government to 
put enough support into police forces so they can enforce these 
laws.

am very pleased and very honoured as a member to be speaking to 
the first bill to be debated in this House in the new 
millennium. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss in saying that it is certainly a proud moment 
for all of us as parliamentarians but it is struck on a sad note. 
The extraordinary circumstances which bring us together and unite 
us as parties are underlined by the fact that extraordinary 
sacrifices and the sad loss of family, friends and loved ones are 
really at the root of creating this bill.  With the help of the 
justice minister and her department we have been able to craft a 
piece of legislation which will send out an important message 
which I believe transcends politics and ensures a greater measure 
of public security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rick McDonald, whose wife and sister are here today, Richard 
Sonnenberg, Sarah Bowman, Dominique Courchesne, Ilce Miovski of 
my riding are all individuals who have paid the ultimate price in 
order to ensure that this bill passes. There is no pride nor 
pleasure in knowing that while we pass a bill unanimously, which 
I believe I am hearing from all members of parliament, it 
nevertheless does not take away from the tragedy that has taken 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect what we are trying to do here for the love of God and 
for the love of humanity and mankind and all those around us is 
to do our very best as legislators to ensure that this parliament 
is relevant not just on the front benches or in the discourse and 
the debates at two o'clock in the afternoon, but also here on the 
backbenches from which we rarely hear.  Politics in this country 
can be relevant if we work hard to understand the pain and 
anxiety which people go through day in and day out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank my two colleagues who from the word go were very 
helpful to me in crafting this legislation. I am referring to the 
hon. member for Leeds—Grenville and the hon. member for Nickel 
Belt. It is not always the case that politics and policies are 
top down; sometimes they are bottom up. Indeed when they are 
bottom up they receive the consent of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am honoured to know that several individuals also worked very 
hard to make sure this legislation could pass.  I am referring to 
people like Sergeant Charlie Green, Doug Corrigan, a good friend 
of mine from the Toronto Police Association, and others in the 
Durham police and right across the country who have spoken so 
eloquently to this need.  Words cannot replace the tragedy and 
indeed the investment of the blood of thousands of people and 
hundreds of injuries in order to make this bill what it is today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we send this bill to the Senate there will be equal concerns 
and equal considerations.  Because the House of Commons speaks 
with one voice, and it is extraordinary circumstances under which 
it does so, I think that the Senate too will see in its wisdom 
the importance of ensuring this parliament passes relevant laws 
for the people whom we represent.

sends a very important message that this is a parliament that 
will achieve extraordinary ends if we only work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind I hope this will be the final speech on Bill 
C-202 and that with the consent of the House we may heretofore 
pass it into its rightful place in terms of sending it to the 
Senate and making it relevant public policy from the backbenches 
of this parliament.

</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MEMBER FOR WENTWORTH—BURLINGTON 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on a question of privilege regarding a member of the House 
who used false representation to gain unjust advantage.  The 
member for Wentworth—Burlington used my signature, without my 
permission and knowledge, to advance a private member's bill.  As 
a consequence he presented a falsified document to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The circumstances that led to my question of privilege today 
began in the last session when I seconded Bill C-264, an act to 
amend the Access to Information Act, which was introduced on 
October 23, 1997, by the member for Wentworth—Burlington.  In 
that session the member obtained another 112 seconders for this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 11, 1998, the member sought unanimous consent to change 
the text of his bill.  He felt that there were some flaws and 
technical changes that needed to be made, and the House agreed to 
change the text of the bill.  From that point on the House had 
before it a new version of Bill C-264.  By virtue of, I guess I 
could say, the magic of unanimous consent, I became a seconder to 
the new bill, an altered Bill C-264, even though I did not second 
that particular version. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT11"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT11"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1200

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make no objection to the House changing the bill because it 
has that authority.  My objection is with the original 
signatories being attached to the new version of the bill and 
with the member for Wentworth—Burlington for carrying over his 
invalid support for Bill C-264 into the second session and 
applying it to the new procedures for Private Members' Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1999 the rules regarding Private Members' Business 
were changed.  Under the provisions of Standing Order 87(6) a 
private member's item is now eligible to be placed in the order 
of precedence after the sponsor files with the clerk a list 
containing the signatures of 100 members who support the member's 
item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The breach of privilege occurred when the member resubmitted the 
altered Bill C-264 from the first session to the second session 
and listed me as a seconder for the purpose of Standing Order 
87(6).  The bill was given a new number.  I did not second Bill 
C-206.  As I mentioned earlier, I did not officially and wilfully 
second the new version of Bill C-264 from the last session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is a very serious matter.  The member was 
obviously aware that his bill had changed yet he kept the 
original seconders.  As a result he falsely represented support 
for his private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also charge that the member is guilty of non-disclosure. 
He never contacted me to advise me of the changes to his bill and 
to ask if I still supported it.  I appreciate that at the 
subcommittee on Private Members' Business he mentioned the 
history of Bill C-206, but he failed to mention to the committee 
that he did not notify the original signatories of the changes he 
had made to the bill.  I would expect that any changes, minor or 
major, should have been brought to the attention of the members 
who supported the original bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the member failed to disclose to the committee the 
extent of the changes he had made to his bill.  He told the 
committee that he had only made minor technical changes.  This is 
false and misleading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had an analysis done of both bills and I am willing to share a 
very brief synopsis of this analysis with the House.  There would 
appear to be little question that a number of the revisions to 
the bill are indeed substantive rather than simply minor wording 
changes.  For example, clause 4 of the revised Bill C-264, now 
Bill C-206, contains an exemption for information that could 
reasonably be expected to be injurious to the constitutional 
integrity of Canada.  However in the initial version of Bill 
C-264 clause 4 did not contain these words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the most notable revision is found in clause 9 of Bill 
C-206.  The proposed section 14.1 contained in clause 9 was not 
included in the first version of the predecessor bill to Bill 
C-206, Bill C-264.  When it received first reading in the first 
session of the 36th parliament on October 23, 1997, section 14.1 
did not appear in Bill C-264 until it was revised pursuant to an 
order made on June 11, 1998.  The proposed section 14.1 which now 
appears in Bill C-206 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The head of a government institution may refuse to disclose any 
record requested under this Act that contains information on 
plans, strategies or tactics relating to the possible secession 
of a part of Canada, including information held or collected for 
the purpose of developing those plans, strategies or tactics. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of section 14.1 would allow the government to refuse 
access to information on plans, strategies or tactics relating to 
the possible secession of a part of Canada.  It differs notably 
from the current section of the act and the proposed subsection 
4(2.1) in that it does not contain the wording “reasonably 
expected to be injurious to”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of this wording it is arguable that the rather 
high threshold test of reasonable expectation of probable harm 
would not apply to the information or plans, strategies or 
tactics relating to the possible secession of a part of Canada. 
Arguably, then, it would be easier for the government to refuse 
access to public opinion polls on the subject of national unity 
and constitutional reform on the basis of the proposed section 
14.1, at least to the extent that the polls contain information 
on plans, strategies or tactics relating to the possible 
secession of a part of Canada. 
The bottom line is that I did not and would not second Bill C-206 
yet I am recorded as being a seconder.

Privilege in Canada</I> on page 233, that any person who presents 
documents to the House or committee that have been forged, 
falsified, altered or fabricated will be found to be in contempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Wentworth—Burlington fabricated and falsified 
support for Bill C-206.  He presented this invalid support to the 
House, which gave him unfair advantage over other private 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to 
consider his testimony and determine whether he is in contempt 
for giving false testimony and for misleading its subcommittee on 
Private Members' Business.  If you find that there is a prima

appropriate motion.

intervention.  Before I hear other interventions I would like to

other representations on that same question of privilege.

will choose to make that presentation.  I just ask that you 
ensure that the rest of us who have been on our feet will be 
notified so that we can respond after listening to it.  I do not 
want to be off in a committee and find out that it has all been

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege.  Earlier today 
the Department of Human Resources Development gave a news 
conference which was astonishing in its degree for the contempt 
that it showed for this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation where the government is unable to properly 
account for over $1 billion in public money.  I would strongly 
urge the Chair to take under advisement that there is a 
responsibility on the minister to have been here in the House, in 
her place, prepared to speak to this matter and to make a public 
statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and the Prime Minister have decided to distance 
themselves from this fiasco by simply taking it outside the House 
of Commons.  In so doing I suggest they destroy centuries of 
practice which are at the core of our freedoms in this place. The 
government must be accountable to this parliament, 
representatives of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to bypass the House and marginalize the 
abilities of all members to ask questions and to interact 
directly with the minister.  Ministers have an overriding duty to 
advise the House of actions which go to the core of the 
management of public money in this House, which is the sole 
source of authority for the legal expenditures of public money. 
By hiding behind a press conference by unelected officials, the 
same officials who created the situation— 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would rule that it has been our 
tradition for a number of years that ministers and all members 
are absolutely free to make interventions in a press gathering or 
a meeting of any kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always said that it is better to bring this information 
to the House, but I suggest to the hon. member that over the 
course of the next few days he will have ample opportunity in 
question period and by other means to question the minister 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I would rule that the member does not have a question 
of privilege.

If it might be helpful to you and other members of the House on

</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is important for the future of all of Canada. It is 
critical for me, my constituents and the future of our children, 
and this is why I want to be part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ensure that the democratic interests of people in every 
province are respected, should there be a referendum process 
that could lead to secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 25 years, I have been fighting the separatists who want to 
destroy my adopted country. This beautiful country allowed the 
daughter of immigrants, a Quebecer and a Canadian of Greek 
origin, to now be a member of this House and to represent her 
country all over the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill calls on the government “to give effect to the 
requirement for clarity as set out in the opinion of the Supreme 
Court of Canada in the Quebec secession reference”.  If there is 
one thing that the supreme court insisted on, it was clarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clarity is the cornerstone of any democratic process.  Citizens 
must be in a position to understand the scope and the 
consequences of what they are voting for, and governments must be 
clear about the nature of the mandate they have been given.  For 
that to happen what is at stake in a referendum must be clear to 
all.  As the supreme court has pointed out, the political actors 
have a role to ensure that this requirement for clarity is 
respected.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit strange even to have a debate on the need for a 
clear question in a future referendum.  I would have thought it 
was intuitively obvious, yet the separatists continue to harp on 
this and reproach us through ads that use children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I became a member of the House I never imagined for a 
moment that one day I would be reproached for caring too much 
about the fundamental component of democracy.  After all, clarity 
is the first thing incumbent on all of us as parliamentarians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PQ government criticizes our alleged interference in the 
referendum process. We on this side of the House would by far 
prefer no referendum at all, since such a process can only be 
divisive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the PQ government, in particular Premier Bouchard and 
his Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Joseph Facal, keep 
repeating that such a referendum will take place during their 
government's current mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Facal made it very clear when he said that, in his mind, 
there was no uncertainty whatsoever, adding that, every day, he 
works relentlessly to prepare for a winning referendum on 
sovereignty during his government's current mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the events that took place in Laval this past 
weekend, however, there seems to be some confusion among 
separatists. Some say that a referendum will be held during the 
current mandate, while others say it will be during the next 
mandate. Be that as it may, these people are arguing amongst 
themselves. They do not know when a referendum will be held, but 
they are trying to create, as they have always said, winning 
conditions, precisely so that they could then have a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on what Mr. Bouchard and the separatists, including their 
former leader, are saying, we are concerned that a referendum 
probably will be held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that the question to be asked should be clear, and that 
Canada could not be divided without a clear majority of the 
people of a province having opted for separation; without their 
saying clearly that they want the province to no longer be a 
part of Canada.  This stands to reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read the following question, and tell me whether it is 
clear, because I do not think it is. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec has made public its proposal to 
negotiate a new agreement with the rest of Canada, based on the 
equality of nations; this agreement would enable Quebec to 
acquire the exclusive power to make its laws, levy its taxes and 
establish relations abroad—in other words, sovereignty—and, at the 
same time, to maintain with Canada an economic association 
including a common currency.  No change in political status 
resulting from these negotiations will be affected without the 
approval by the people through another referendum; on these 
terms, do you give the Government of Quebec the mandate to 
negotiate the proposed agreement between Quebec and Canada? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not clear.  That was the 1980 question.  Now let us look 
at the 1995 question: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you agree that Quebec should become sovereign, after having 
made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political 
partnership, within the scope of the bill respecting the future 
of Quebec and of the agreement signed on June 12, 1995? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the question with the partnership proposal that Mr. 
Bouchard later described as skeletal. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The separatist leaders have always tried to have Quebecers 
believe that the questions asked, both during the 1980 and the 
1995 referendums, were clear.  Let me clarify that in 1980, and 
again in 1995, Prime Minister Trudeau and our current Prime 
Minister clearly indicated that the questions posed to Quebecers 
were not clear and that they did not feel bound to negotiate 
because the questions were not clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question in 1995, like the one in 1980, is convincing proof 
that we need a clear question.  A poll conducted shortly before 
the referendum of October 30, 1995 revealed that 80% of Quebecers 
who were planning to vote yes believed that if the yes side won 
Quebec would continue to use the Canadian dollar and that 
economic ties with Canada would remain unchanged.  Fifty per cent 
believed that they would continue to use the Canadian passport. 
Twenty-five per cent believed that Quebec would continue to elect 
members to the federal parliament.  Another poll indicated that 
almost one out of five yes supporters believed that a sovereign 
Quebec could remain a province of Canada.  If that is not cause 
for confusion I do not know what is. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the truth of the matter with respect to the so-called 
clarity of the question in 1995. 
I would remind those still unconvinced of the ambiguity 
surrounding that referendum of a statement made by their friend, 
Jacques Parizeau, in an open letter he sent to the <I>Devoir</I> last 
year.  Mr. Parizeau said:  “We have often been told that the 
1995 question was not clear”.  He is the one saying so.  “It is 
true, as I have often said, that the question I would like to 
have asked was the following:  Do you want Quebec to become a 
sovereign or independent country effective—?”

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can be forgiven for wondering why Mr. Parizeau was not 
interested in this degree of precision when he took up his 
duties as Premier of Quebec and leader of the yes camp. 
But I will not get into that today. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is duty bound not to undertake any negotiations 
that could lead to the separation of a province unless the voters 
of that province state clearly and democratically that they want 
to secede from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak of voters I must speak on behalf of certain 
Quebecers who are often overlooked, ignored or even ridiculed by 
certain members of the opposition and by certain separatists in 
Quebec, unfortunately.  I am one of those Quebecers who is not 
pure laine—not that I know what that means—and who, in the 
language of some separatists, should be excluded from their 
so-called democratic process.  I will not quote a number of 
former leaders of the movement who stated that openly and 
publicly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consider myself a Canadian living in Quebec, whose origins are 
Greek.  I am proud of my origins, but I am also proud of being a 
Quebecer.  Most important, I am particularly honoured and proud 
that my parents chose Canada as their adopted country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, as others who have immigrated from around the world, am 
Canadian by choice.  We have chosen to live in Quebec.  Many of 
us have left countries that have known civil unrest, 
dictatorship, coup d'etat, hypocrisy, abuse and even the denial 
of basic civil, legal and human rights, the imprisonment and the 
execution of democratically elected parliamentarians, economic 
hardship beyond comprehension, and let us not forget the abuse 
and exploitation of the most vulnerable of our society, our 
children.  That is an abuse to which I will not refer in terms of 
the ads that are now being promulgated all over Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is on behalf of the citizens who sought and found a safe 
haven in a democratic society, as well as all of my constituents, 
that I ask my provincial government to respect my rights and to 
ask a clear question without ambiguity, without nuances and 
without word playing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bouchard should give all Quebecers the right to choose 
separation or unity.  It is only through clarity that all 
Quebecers can make an informed decision.  I am confident that 
their choice will be the same as mine, that their democratic 
rights will be respected by the PQ government and, more 
important, that future generations of Canadians living in Quebec, 
such as my daughters, will thank the members of this government 
and of this House for assuring that Canada continues to remain an 
open, democratic and just society where everyone can enjoy the 
same rights and where future immigrants from all over the world 
will be embraced and offered a safe haven.  We are and will 
continue to be the best country in the world in which to live.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, we can 
understand the hon. member fighting for her country to be 
Canada.  However, we cannot understand as well her resorting to 
some rather complicated reasoning for someone who wanted to 
speak of clarity.  We too wish to speak of clarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On two occasions, in the previous referendums in Quebec on 
sovereignty, in 1980 and 1995, reference was made to an 
association or partnership with Canada.  The hon. member who 
today boasts of belonging to a government of clarity is one of 
those same people who told us “No, no partnership for us”.  We 
subsequently learned that Ontario was making secret preparations 
to negotiate with Quebec; we also learned in the Supreme Court 
decision that there would be an obligation to negotiate a 
partnership. 
Why were these aspects so important?  Because we were dealing 
with people who were not telling the public the truth, that is 
that there would obviously be negotiations between Quebec and 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are today staunch defenders of clarity were trying to 
spook people by telling them there would be none.  What we 
wanted was to show that we were sincere and honest, and it was 
even made part of the question.  We were creating an obligation 
to negotiate even before achieving sovereignty, with a time 
limit of one year, with a monitoring committee which would reach 
a decision on this.  There was even room in its membership for 
representatives of the Liberal party of Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not consider ourselves any smarter than the people who are 
going to vote.  People can make decisions.  Those about to 
express their opinion and finding the issue unclear still have 
the option of saying “No, the question before me is not clear 
enough”.  Of those who voted, 49.5% found the question 
sufficiently clear to say yes and say that they were prepared to 
support the proposal of sovereignty-association put to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 90% of voters cast a ballot.  Did the people not understand 
the issues?  The fact that a Liberal Party poll has just shown 
there may be some confusion is not going to convince us that the 
people did not know what they were voting on. 
When the people left home to go and vote they knew very well 
what the issue was, and the proof is that 93% of voters went to 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do members opposite think they are smarter than the other 
side of the House and say to us “The people voted yes because 
they did not understand”?  That is not the case.  The people 
understood perfectly well.  They understand increasingly that 
they have an intransigent Liberal federal government before them 
that has been incapable of offering anything to Quebecers since 
the referendum and so has decided to take a hard line and 
prevent them from deciding as they wish the next time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will not work, because Quebecers are responsible and 
intelligent people.  They can see through these tricks and they 
will express their pride fully the next time by saying that they 
have had it with people who cannot understand and respect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B> Madam Speaker, the only people who do not 
respect the intelligence and the rights of Quebecers are those 
who belong to the party sitting on the other side of the House 
and those who belong to the governing party in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about intelligence. Yes, people went out to vote. 
Thank God, people believe in the importance of their right to 
vote, and I will always defend that right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only people who are afraid are those in the Quebec 
government who do not dare ask a question such as the one 
proposed by Mr. Parizeau “Do you want to separate from Canada?” 
Negotiations are not the issue here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We always said and the supreme court said that there will be 
negotiations if the question is clear and if there is a clear 
majority. 
Those are the two things upon which the supreme court insists, 
even before negotiations are undertaken. However, the members 
opposite are talking about two questions that were not clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a poll by the Liberal Party. It is a general poll 
that was done before the 1995 referendum, and it showed that 
people believed that, after a yes vote, they would still be part 
of Canada and they would still use Canada's currency and have a 
Canadian passport, things the party opposite and the governing 
party in Quebec does not want.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in Quebec who voted no, the federalists on her side 
who voted no, did they understand the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B> Madam Speaker, we are back to the same 
issue. The member asks me if they understood clearly. Yes, 
because I think federalists— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Are federalists more intelligent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B> No, I never said that. Madam Speaker, the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> You are not being very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B> I find it unacceptable for the member to

this side of the House, but maybe on the other side—

bill that has been tabled in the House is a crucial issue for 
Canada, which is why I wish to speak to it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members opposite, like members of the current Quebec 
government, are reproaching us for wanting to clarify the 
referendum process.  They say that the Government of Canada wants 
to take the place of the legislative assembly of a province. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the time given to me, I will explain why I believe the 
Government of Canada has a role to play, as stated in the bill, 
in giving effect to the requirement for clarity as set out in the 
opinion of the supreme court on August 20, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to bear in mind what the separatists never wish 
to speak about.  By playing its appropriate role in the 
referendum debate, the Government of Canada is in no way 
encroaching on the prerogatives of the legislative assembly of a 
province.  Any province can ask any question it wants.  No one is 
challenging its right to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill reiterates that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>...the government of any province has the authority to consult 
its voters by referendum on any issue and the right to formulate 
the wording of its referendum question. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the supreme court's opinion stipulates that the 
obligation to negotiate secession is closely linked to another 
obligation, that of obtaining a clear majority in support of 
secession and in response to a clear question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 100 of the opinion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A right and a corresponding duty to negotiate secession cannot be 
built on an alleged expression of democratic will if the 
expression of democratic will is, itself, fraught with 
ambiguities. 
</UL>
That applies “both in terms of the question asked and the 
support it achieves”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In paragraph 153, the court also specifies: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>...it will be for the political actors to determine what 
constitutes “a clear majority on a clear question” in the 
circumstances under which a future referendum vote may take 
place. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two sections of the opinion are highly significant and are 
more than sufficient to justify the role the federal government 
intends to play in clarifying the referendum issue.  In fact, it 
obliges the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Asking for a clear question and a clear majority does not 
violate the prerogatives of the national assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is one of the political actors the 
court referred to in its opinion.  How can the separatists speak 
or ask us to shirk our constitutional responsibilities when the 
future of our country is at stake? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our opponents accuse us of flouting Quebec democracy.  We have 
heard a number of politically inspired accusations against us 
over time but this particular one raises the bar.  Since when is 
it undemocratic to call for clarity?  Our shared democratic 
heritage demands that citizens really have a say through their 
votes.  All we are asking for is a clear question and a clear 
majority.  Otherwise, how can we determine whether the citizens 
of a province truly want their province to leave Canada and 
become an independent state? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really undemocratic is asking citizens to vote on a 
deliberately ambiguous question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question must allow the people to clearly state whether or 
not they want their province to leave Canada and become an 
independent state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A question on a mandate to negotiate that does not ask the 
people to state whether they want their province to cease to be a 
part of Canada or a question for secession mixed with another 
option would not allow the people to express their will that 
their province cease to be part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the 1995 referendum question referred to a new 
economic and political partnership with Canada, an ill-defined, 
unrealistic partnership that Mr. Bouchard would later describe as 
“bare bones”.  That question posed as a question on secession 
is patently undemocratic.  It was not exactly a masterpiece of 
clarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure our opponents will not accept my judgment on this. 
Maybe they will believe the polls conducted at the time of the 
referendum.  I note specifically the poll that revealed that one 
in four yes voters believed they were voting for an option that 
proposed that Quebec would remain a Canadian province.  One 
sovereignist voter in four. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give rise to such confusion, the 1995 question certainly did 
not permit voters to clearly express their will for their 
province to cease to be a part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at facts like that, we get a better appreciation of 
why the federal government—to use the language of the supreme 
court decision—is an “actor” in ensuring that a referendum on 
separation, if we were ever to come to such a sorry state of 
affairs, would have to be held in an atmosphere of clarity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other reasons for setting out the circumstances under 
which the Government of Canada would negotiate around a 
referendum result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premier Bouchard has never renounced holding another referendum 
during his mandate, so we need to be prepared.  We need to 
clarify these issues, not when the referendum campaign is in full 
swing but well beforehand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This referendum obsession is still a clear and present danger. 
Premier Bouchard said so on November 9.  Quebec's 
intergovernmental affairs minister, Mr. Facal, has suggested that 
the Quebec government may override the supreme court opinion. Mr. 
Bouchard has also said that the Government of Canada's 
willingness to have the supreme court's requirement for clarity 
respected is a sign of bad faith on our part and opens the door 
to a unilateral declaration of independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all likelihood, it was the former Quebec premier, Jacques 
Parizeau, who got it right when he pointed out on November 30 how 
important the allusion was to a unilateral declaration of 
independence.  The translation reads “He's really opened the 
door.  You have to understand how important Mr. Bouchard's 
statement really is on that.  It's really something, that 
statement”.  He added that he himself had never been that clear. 
Not only is there a real threat of another referendum, there is 
also the real possibility of a unilateral declaration of 
independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was ever an issue that we on this side would gladly 
stop speaking about it is the prospect of another referendum for 
the secession of a province.  The Quebec separatist leaders will 
not let it die.  It is the first article on their political 
platform.  They are obsessed by it.  That is why they rejected 
the Prime Minister's proposal to stop talking referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to address other priorities but we are duty bound 
to ensure that the supreme court's requirement for clarity does 
not fall by the wayside.  Our respect for Quebecers requires us 
to assume our responsibility in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not start the fire and we are not the ones perpetuating 
this sad state of affairs.  We are not the ones trying to break 
up the country.  The separatists leaders are doing that.  As long 
as we have to argue with them to ensure the unity and the 
progress of the country, we will continue to promote the 
democratic tradition that is one of the great achievements of 
Quebec and of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the bill itself, to those who say “not now”, I 
say “if not now, when?” 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
listened with a great deal of interest to my hon. colleague's 
remarks. He talked mainly about the requirement for clarity and 
democratic principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My feeling is that the main purpose of this bill is not so much 
to establish the need for a clear question, or the respect for 
democracy, but rather to strike a blow against Quebec and its 
citizens' interests. It spearheads a plan B that involves making 
no concession whatsoever to Quebec. The government does not want 
to have a clear question and a democratic process—we always had 
that—but to make sure the next referendum is unacceptable 
for English Canada. That is the purpose of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to make both the question and the majority 
in favour of that question unacceptable. In other words, it is a 
direct attack against Quebec. The government is setting rules 
that will make any referendum unacceptable in English speaking 
Canada so that it will not pass in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit like going into somebody's living room and telling 
him how to should place the furniture. It is invasion. It is a 
show of strength. The requirement for clarity has nothing to do 
with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, the referendum questions have been clear, and 
people in Quebec understood quite well what it was all about. 
This bill is an insult to Quebeckers. It treats them like 
ignorants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why this show of strength? Why force on Quebeckers referendum 
rules without respecting their basic rights and their democratic 
rights?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will address two or 
three points made by my colleague.  First, he said that the last 
question in the 1995 referendum was in fact clear.  I suspect 
that is one of the reasons why we need to take a role in this.  I 
do not think there would be a consensus that it was a clear 
question at all.  In fact, it was anything but clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remind my colleague that the legislation actually 
supports the notion that the province has the right to conduct 
such a referendum and frame its own question. That is contained 
within the bill.  All provinces have the democratic right to 
conduct their own affairs and express their own will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the supreme court has stated, the exercise and the expression 
of that will can only be achieved if the question is clear and 
the majority is clear.  If 51.1% is a clear majority, then what 
is an unclear majority? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's bill is an important recognition of the right 
of any province to speak its mind in terms of its will.  Our 
condition of negotiation subsequent to that is to make sure that 
it is based on a clear question and a clear majority, which what 
democracy is all about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is always disappointing to hear members opposite say that the 
Quebec separatist leaders will never let it die. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court decision he has just cited said that the 
sovereigntist project was a legitimate one and that we were 
within our rights to promote it. They have never been willing to 
admit that our project is legitimate. 
So legitimate is it that there are 45 sovereigntist members in 
this House. Logic dictates that the House recognize this 
legitimacy, which is the legitimacy recognized by the Quebec 
people, who are entitled to decide, in a percentage of 50% plus 
one, what their future and political status will be. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott:</B>  Madam Speaker, the bill specifically 
recognizes the legitimacy of this movement by stating that any 
province can ask any question it wishes, but it would seek 
clarity on both the question and the majority.  This is a 
significant act for a democratic country like Canada to propose. 
As I am sure the hon. member knows, many countries would not 
allow that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is with considerable regret that I rise today to 
speak on a bill that contemplates the potential breakup of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having recently participated in the NDP Social Democratic Forum 
on the Future of Canada, a constructive and thoughtful process of 
consultation and reflection on the future of our federation, I 
would much prefer, as I am sure many members of the House would 
prefer, to be making the case for the many positive proposals 
that the forum put forward not simply to strengthen national 
unity but more significantly to improve our democracy and the way 
that Canada works for all its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My regret also stems from my firm belief that Canada could have 
done better than this, that the situation we are now in was 
avoidable.  While I believe that the government is now doing in 
part what needs to be done, I begin by saying that I hold the 
Liberals, who are now the government, responsible in no small way 
for where we are now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Prime Minister has had a long career, all of it 
characterized by a lack of sensitivity to the appropriate 
constitutional aspirations of the Quebec people within Canada. 
This was most clearly and most tragically apparent in the nature 
of his opposition to the Meech Lake accord, the failure of which 
led to the formation of the Bloc Quebecois and the resurgence of 
separatism in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also led, in the context of the subsequent and unsuccessful 
Charlottetown accord, to the rise of the then nascent Reform 
Party and therefore a political situation in which a meaningful 
plan A is now a faint hope or at least a plan A which addresses 
the desire of many Quebecers for some kind of constitutional 
recognition of the special, distinct or unique nature of 
Quebecers as a people or a society within Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devolution of power is one thing and this has happened 
extensively in recent years in training, housing, immigration and 
other areas.  However, this administrative approach to addressing 
Quebec-Canada relations not only has no effect on separatists, 
not surprisingly, it does not address the most important needs of 
Quebec federalists either, all the while weakening the presence 
and the role of the federal government in the rest of Canada. 
Likewise, the resolutions passed by the House after the 1995 
referendum having to do with distinct society and the Quebec veto 
came too late and too much like deathbed repentance after the 
near death experience of the 1995 referendum, and they still do 
not constitute constitutional change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so Quebecers may be asked to choose between staying in a 
Canada that is now unwilling or unable to do certain important 
things, or becoming a separate country.  If they are asked this 
question they will be asked to make the choice by a provincial 
government that is committed to Quebec becoming a separate 
country in any event.  I say this because I take it as 
self-evident that if Quebec federalists were in power in Quebec 
City, if Jean Charest was in power in Quebec City, Quebecers 
would not be having such a question put to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not all Quebecers are committed to the view that if Canada does 
not meet each and every desire they have for constitutional 
change their response should be to form a separate country. 
There are many Quebecers who may be unhappy with the way things 
have worked out in recent years but who are still committed to 
working out those problems within the context of a united Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is to those Quebecers that in many respects I feel this bill 
is directed, so they do not become, along with other Quebecers, 
the object of a political process which sets in motion a process 
toward secession without there being such things as a clear 
majority and a clear question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to deal with the situation we have before us, with the 
real live historical possibility of another referendum.  We do 
not know exactly when it will come.  It appears that Mr. Bouchard 
does not know exactly when it will come.  He appears more 
uncertain as the days and weeks go by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How we got here is not the issue any more.  The issue now before 
us is twofold.  The first issue is whether Quebecers, in any 
subsequent referendum that a separatist Quebec government sees as 
an instrument of its separation strategy, will be presented with 
a clear question so they know exactly what they are choosing. 
The second issue before us is whether Quebecers, if they choose 
to leave Canada in response to a clear question, should do so by 
some standard of “clear majority”.  These two issues correspond 
to the two conditions laid down by the Supreme Court of Canada as 
the conditions that would have to be met if the rest of Canada is 
to be obliged to negotiate secession after any referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to referendums on non-secessionist questions, these would 
continue to be possible and would continue to have whatever 
effect they might have, depending on the level of support that 
such non-secessionist proposals might have in Quebec and in the 
rest of Canada.  There is no need to incorporate the possibility 
of such referendums into this bill, as has been suggested by 
some.  The possibility of such referendums is not endangered by 
the clarity bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referendums on various forms of partnerships and associations 
would still be possible, but they would not trigger negotiations 
that had anything to do with, or could lead to, secession.  That 
is the difference between the kind of referendum and referendum 
question that this bill addresses and other referendums and 
referendum questions that may be possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those other kinds of referendum questions, which do not have to 
do with secession, could trigger whatever kinds of negotiations 
that might be politically possible in any given historical 
context. 
Such non-secessionist referendum proposals would presumably come 
as an aid to the normal process of constitutional amendment, 
whereby a province like Quebec, or for that matter any other 
province, could demonstrate the unity of its population or the 
strength of its posital change by having a referendum.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clarity bill does not damage nor does it replace the 
ordinary process of constitutional change and amendment.  The 
clarity bill addresses what would need to happen for there to be 
extraordinary constitutional negotiations and extraordinary 
constitutional amendments leading to the secession of Quebec or 
some other province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians listening to this debate may notice that I have 
assumed the right of Quebecers to freely and democratically 
determine their own future.  Since the founding of the New 
Democratic Party in 1961, New Democrats have affirmed Quebec's 
right to self-determination.  The NDP is proud to have been the 
first federal party to recognize that right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently at our August 1999 convention we adopted a paper which 
advocated recognizing Quebecers as a people, not in the ethnic 
and therefore inappropriate nationalistic sense of being a 
people, but rather as a way of recognizing that Quebecers form 
one of the two linguistic and cultural realities that most 
Canadians live and move and have their social being within.  This 
non-ethic understanding of a people which the NDP proposes to 
recognize corresponds with what some observers have called civic 
nationalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In itself, though, Quebec's right to self-determination, or the 
self-determination of the Quebec people, is just an abstraction. 
It is just a principle if it is not fleshed out in the context of 
other democratic values, such as the rule of law, individual and 
aboriginal rights, constitutionalism and federalism.  As with any 
other individual or collective right, Quebec's right to 
self-determination must be given concrete expression in a clear, 
fair and democratic process that is consistent with all of the 
competing but equally legitimate democratic principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is precisely this challenge that was taken up in the 1998 
supreme court reference on Quebec's right to secede from Canada. 
In that opinion the supreme court offered some key advice, 
particularly with respect to the rights and obligations of the 
federal parliament in any secession bid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its opinion the supreme court made two key points.  First, it 
affirmed the democratic legitimacy of Quebec's right to 
self-determination even though the Canadian constitution contains 
no explicit process for the secession of a province.  The court 
even recognized that a democratic referendum would be a 
legitimate mechanism through which Quebecers could express their 
desire to secede.  On this question the court said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A clear majority vote in Quebec on a clear question in favour of 
secession would confer democratic legitimacy on the secession 
initiative which all of the other participants in Confederation 
would have to recognize. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a legitimate victory for my sovereignist colleagues in 
the House who for too long have been taunted by some who have 
threatened to not negotiate in any event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the court in its opinion also made a second equally 
important point:  that Quebec's right to self-determination must 
be exercised within the Canadian constitutional framework.  The 
court said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec could not, despite a clear referendum result, purport to 
invoke a right of self-determination to dictate the terms of a 
proposed secession to the other parties to the federation.  The 
democratic vote, by however strong a majority, would have no 
legal effect on its own and could not push aside the principles 
of federalism and the rule of law, the rights of individuals and 
minorities, or the operation of democracy in the other provinces 
or in Canada as a whole. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a legitimate victory for those who believed that no 
referendum by itself would enable Quebec to act unilaterally and 
without regard for the views of the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see in the supreme court opinion that Quebec's right to 
self-determination must be respected by its partners in 
confederation, but that that right must be exercised with respect 
for the other democratic values that have guided us for more than 
130 years.  In striking a balance between these two key 
principles the supreme court specified a clear role for the 
federal parliament in any secession bid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a key actor in the constitutional amendment procedure, 
parliament has an obligation to negotiate in good faith should it 
be confronted with a clear will to secede, and it has an 
obligation to represent the rights and interests of all Canadians 
in any such negotiating process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today sets out an orderly process by which 
parliament would discharge these responsibilities.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP are supporting this bill in principle at second 
reading because we recognize the role that parliament must play 
in setting the terms under which the rest of Canada represented 
in parliament would negotiate secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one of the negotiating parties to any possible secession, 
parliament has a right to say what it will regard as sufficient 
to trigger its own willingness to negotiate secession.  This 
right should not be put into question any more than the right of 
the national assembly in Quebec to conduct a referendum and to 
ask any questions it wants should be put into question.  These 
two rights coexist.  They are not in conflict with each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing that should be debated here is whether 
parliament, in exercising that right, has set the bar too high on 
the issues of clarity and majority or whether the clarity bill 
acts in some other way that can be judged as unfair or 
prejudicial to the freedom of the Quebec people or the rights of 
minorities in Quebec such as the aboriginal community.  This is 
what the committee process should be about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day we believe it will be in everyone's 
interests, both in Quebec and in the rest of Canada, to have a 
clear and transparent framework for defining a secession bid and 
for dealing with a secession bid should we unfortunately be 
presented with one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is particularly important to establish in advance the 
conditions under which secession negotiations would be triggered. 
The supreme court identified two key conditions for a referendum 
to trigger secession negotiations:  a clear question and a clear 
majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats agree that a clear question is a necessary 
condition before any secession negotiations begin because with an 
ambiguous question it would be impossible to determine whether a 
referendum result truly reflected a desire to secede.  Surely 
this is a democratic principle and cannot be construed as an 
attack on democratic principles that an unambiguous question 
should be required in order to create the conditions for 
something as serious as separation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be emphasized again that the bill's requirement for a 
clear question to trigger secession talks would not in any way 
prevent Quebec from holding a referendum on any kind of question 
it desires.  It simply means that only referendums that are 
clearly about secession could impose an obligation on the federal 
parliament to enter secession negotiations.  That seems only fair 
and reasonable to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we do have some concerns about the current drafting of 
the bill's provisions with respect to a clear majority.  That is 
why we have offered our support in principle for the bill at 
second reading, but will no doubt be proposing amendments to 
address our concerns when the bill goes to committee for more 
detailed study and consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the bill's definition of a clear majority, we 
also have concerns about the role and rights of aboriginal 
peoples and the excessive role given to the unelected Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the notion of clear majority, the bill does not specify a 
particular threshold.  Instead, it follows the supreme court 
suggestion that after a referendum result parliament must make a 
qualitative judgment, taking into account the size of the 
majority, the turnout and any other factors relevant to 
determining the true meaning of the result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we can appreciate the court's desire to avoid 
oversimplifying the issue, the process proposed in the bill could 
permit an irresponsible parliament to ignore a clear majority in 
favour of secession by arbitrarily establishing an unreasonably 
high threshold after the votes are counted, the so-called moving 
goal posts after the game.  We are concerned about that.  We look 
forward to hearing from Canadians about how we might improve the 
bill to avoid or minimize this potential problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats are also concerned that the rights of aboriginal 
peoples are not adequately protected in the bill.  Existing 
constitutional protection for aboriginal rights would clearly be 
threatened by the secession of a province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill specifies that the question of aboriginal rights would 
need to be addressed—whatever that means—but specifies no basic 
level of protection for these rights that would need to be 
achieved before parliament agrees to the secession of a province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also identifies various actors whose views parliament 
must take into consideration in its deliberations on a secession 
bid, but aboriginal peoples are not among those specifically 
identified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent practice and natural justice suggest that aboriginal 
peoples should be involved.  New Democrats will be actively 
searching for ways to ensure both that aboriginal peoples are 
meaningfully involved and that stronger protection is provided 
for their rights.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill's failure to involve aboriginal peoples is particularly 
problematic, some might even say offensive, when one considers 
the prominent role it gives to the Senate, or to the other place 
as we are required to say in this place.  The bill calls on 
parliament to take into consideration the views of the Senate in 
determining whether or not there is a clear question and a clear 
majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats have long argued that an unelected, unaccountable 
Senate has no place in a modern democracy and so it seems to us 
that there is simply no justification for giving such an 
undemocratic institution an important role in a process 
concerning a serious issue like secession.  After all, the 
primary objective of the bill must be to establish a framework 
that is in both fact and perception fair and democratic.  Giving 
a prominent role to the Senate clearly does not help in this 
regard.  One can only wonder what the Liberals were thinking when 
they came up with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I raise these concerns about the current drafting of the 
bill, I want to emphasize that New Democrats will go into the 
committee stage with open minds.  We invite Canadians to share 
their suggestions for improving the bill in the three areas I 
have identified and indeed in any other areas they may want to 
raise and bring to the attention of the committee.  We also call 
on the Liberals to join us in a sincere effort to improve the 
bill so that Canadians can have the most fair and democratic 
framework possible for dealing with the gravely serious issue of 
secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many Canadians, I have been concerned that the Liberal 
Party may be using the bill to serve narrow partisan interests. 
It would not be the first time in Canadian history that votes 
have been sought by virtue of a so-called tough on Quebec 
strategy.  The Liberal Party since 1968 has profited greatly from 
such a strategy on occasion.  The Reform Party is heir to the 
same tradition, a tradition that the united alternative, or 
CCRAP, or CRCAP, or whatever, seems to want to distance itself 
from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say with great pride that the NDP has never been attracted to 
any such strategy.  We do what we do now because we believe it to 
be necessary.  We take no joy in it.  We loathe the destructive 
family feud that goes on in this House between the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs and my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois.  From time to time we are called to take a stand on 
some matter of principle.  From time to time in doing so we have 
voted with the Bloc on such matters as they pertain to Quebec and 
have been attacked in some of our home constituencies for 
catering to separatists and siding with separatists.  We have 
done it when we thought the Bloc was right.  On this issue we 
find the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to be in the right 
despite the often arrogant and unhelpful way he goes about his 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to reiterate the comments of my leader.  She 
closed her speech on this bill by urging the government and 
parliament not to allow work on this bill to distract them from 
the critically important task of building a better Canada, one 
that meets the hopes, dreams, needs and aspirations of our 
citizens so that the legislation we are debating today will never 
be required.

Cornellier, which appeared in the English press.  The headline 
reads “Progressive Canadians Opposed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article states as follows: “Support for the federal clarity 
bill is not unanimous outside Quebec, particularly among those 
who usually back the New Democratic Party. 
Over 80 intellectuals representing unions and activist groups 
have already indicated their support for an open letter 
denouncing the project launched by a Laurentian University 
professor, Gary Kinsman, and I quote: 'We are calling for the 
withdrawal of the clarity bill and an end to threats and 
intimidation with respect to the right of Quebecers to decide 
their own future'.  We are also affirming the right to 
self-determination of the aboriginal peoples in Quebec and in the 
rest of Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bit further on, the article mentions a source of concern. 
According to these same intellectuals who usually back the New

reserve the right to decide on the clarity of the referendum 
question and result and they say:  “This means that parliament

has to say about this. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am familiar with the 
statement from which the hon. member is quoting and I have to say 
that I think the people who signed that are wrong.  I do not 
understand how they could claim that what is happening here is an 
authoritarian attempt to prevent Quebecers from determining their 
own future.  All it is saying is that Quebecers are a part of 
Canada now, and if they determine their future in a way that 
results in separating from the rest of Canada, that the rest of 
Canada through its parliament has some right to say through its 
parliament what the conditions would be in the context of which 
negotiations for secession would commence. I do not equate that 
with any attempt to prevent Quebecers from determining their own 
future and if the people who signed this statement do, then I 
profoundly disagree with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that Quebec's self-determination is something 
that has to be defended by defending each and every position 
taken by a sovereignist government in Quebec City, or for that 
matter defending each and every sensitivity of Quebec 
nationalists, whether they be sovereignists or federalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the rest of Canada are entitled to our own view on this 
matter. I think that parliament has a right assigned to it by the 
supreme court as one of the actors that must determine what 
constitutes a clear question and a clear majority.  Parliament 
has that right.  This bill is a way of exercising that right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Quebecers vote for a clear question for secession and they 
get their clear majority, the negotiations will take place, 
Quebec will no longer be a part of Canada and my friends in the 
Bloc Quebecois will be happy.  They will have their own separate 
country.  Are they really saying to us that that is not possible 
under this legislation?  Because if that is the claim they are 
making, I think that is patently false.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly one of the things I understood the Bloc and many 
others to be worried about at a certain point when we did not 
know what the clarity bill would look like was that the 
government might be coming in with a bill that would actually and 
definitively set the threshold higher than 50% plus one.  The 
bill does not do that.  The bill says that a qualitative judgment 
has to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying in my remarks that I think the merits of the 
court's finding that there needs to be a qualitative judgment 
made after a referendum need to be held in balance with the 
legitimate concern that my colleague and I have that this somehow 
could be used, to use the metaphor I used earlier, to move the 
goalposts during or after the game.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just a question of 50% plus one, it is also a question 
of other things that an irresponsible parliament or an 
irresponsible government might try to do after a referendum 
result that it did not like.  I would remind the member, and this 
corresponds to the supreme court judgment, that if a parliament 
or a government tried to act in a way that was clearly moving the 
goalposts, that was clearly an abuse of that requirement for a 
qualitative judgment, that a Quebec to which such an injustice 
was being done would have the right then I believe, and I think 
the supreme court said this, to appeal to the international 
community that the Canadian government in that context was not 
acting in good faith and not respecting the findings of the 
supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as if there would be no recourse in such a 
circumstance.  The question is whether we want to set a numerical 
threshold going into the vote.  I understand the member wants to 
do that.  I think there are some good arguments for doing that. I 
want to hear those arguments, but I also want to hear the 
arguments against it.  I am happy so far that the government has 
not done what we were worried it would do, which is to come in 
and say that it has to be 60%, or 55%, or whatever because that 
certainly would have been a mistake.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, we 
take note of the reservations expressed by the New Democratic 
Party regarding the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two questions for our colleague. First, is it the NDP's 
opinion that the current clause dealing with the issue of 
majority might lead to arbitrary measures on the part of the 
government and the House of Commons and, second, does the NDP 
wish that the committee proceedings be as open as possible? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the New Democratic Party want the committee to travel 
across Canada and Quebec to hear individuals and groups on Bill 
C-20? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Madam Speaker, what I had to say 
previous to the question asked by the hon. member addresses the 
first part of his question.  With respect to the committee 
process, of course we would like to see it as open as possible 
and we would certainly support the view that the committee should 
travel.  It should go to Quebec.  It should go to other parts of 
Canada.  This is an important national debate.  In my judgment it 
is an unfortunate one but one that it appears we need to have. We 
would certainly support the view that the committee should travel 
and should seek as wide a consultation as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that within Quebec we will see the same variety of 
opinion that a colleague of the member who just spoke was eager 
to point out existed in the rest of Canada with respect to this 
bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, this is a great and historic debate and I am very 
honoured to be part of it today.  I will be splitting my time 
with the hon. member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is very important to me.  It is important to my 
constituents.  It is important, I would hope, to all members in 
the House and to people around the world.  Although we have 
differences, Canada is place where people can live in harmony 
with and tolerance of one another.  It is the envy of many 
countries worldwide because as a nation we can agree to disagree 
when and if necessary and yet coexist.  We can work together and 
share values and resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secession would be traumatic for all involved and it would 
certainly be difficult to negotiate.  Bill C-20 which I support 
is intended to protect the rights of all Canadians if we ever 
have to tackle such an issue, and I hope we will not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides a means to ensure that a decision which would have 
profound and irreversible consequences such as secession would be 
made only as a result of asking a clear and unequivocal question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is recognized as a model of openness and tolerance where 
disputes can be resolved through debate without recourse to 
force.  This means that we can engage in discussion at many 
levels in our country and our lives and well-being are not 
threatened because of the points of view we express. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this country it is possible for populations of different 
cultures and languages to respect each other and yet live 
together in harmony.  This is not the case in many areas of the 
world where identity based decisions result in violence.  One can 
only think of what has recently happened in the Balkans in the 
last number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must continue to express tolerance and openness toward each 
other, not only to serve ourselves but to serve as an example to 
other populations around the world that face ethnic, linguistic 
or identity based tensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our ability to work out our differences has been recognized by 
our neighbour to the south. On October 8, 1999, President Bill 
Clinton, after having said that the United States values its 
relationship with a strong and united Canada, remarked as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The partnership you have built between people of diverse 
backgrounds and governments at all levels is what...democracy 
must be about, as people all over the world move around more, mix 
with each other more, and live in close proximity more. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here then is recognition of the success we have achieved as a 
great multicultural federation able to face its current 
challenges and those that the world as a whole will have to face 
more and more often in the future.  We have done it and we are 
successful at it.  Here is recognition of the fact that our 
country can be a role model for other states that are emerging or 
evolving, for states that are starting out on the path of 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ours is a large and diversified country where each province and 
territory can solve problems by finding and implementing its own 
solutions.  We have learned from one another over the years.  At 
times we share solutions and best practices and we can also 
choose to be distinct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have differences, for example, they need not be 
irreconcilable, leading to the strife as is the case in many 
parts of the world.  They can be examined and we can find common 
ground that suits all.  As our federation evolves we must 
strengthen partnerships among all levels of government and ensure 
that all Canadians benefit from the strong economy we are 
enjoying now and that their rights are protected no matter where 
they live in this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a federal government and provinces that are strong in 
their areas of jurisdiction.  We respect certain principles and 
have mechanisms and programs in place to ensure that all 
Canadians enjoy the same rights and have access to a comparable 
quality of life whether they live in British Columbia, Nova 
Scotia, or any and all points in between. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where regional differences create disadvantages we try to make 
up for them, most notably through our equalization program. 
Canadians know this and appreciate the choices and mobility 
afforded them by those programs.  In 1996 our Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That's what Canada is, and that's why it is respected and envied 
by so many on the international scene.  It is the country that 
gives the best guarantee that human beings will be treated like 
human beings, with full dignity. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Truer words were never spoken.  There are other ways to solve 
our problems and work out our differences.  At the federal and 
provincial levels our first ministers and their officials meet 
and negotiate regularly.  We see finance, health, industry and 
agriculture, to name a few, trying to address collectively the 
problems people in our society face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our courts also resolve disputes, examine issues and then render 
decisions and opinions based on fact and law.  Elections that we 
often take for granted in a democracy are held and allow citizens 
to express their views on larger issues which affect them no 
matter where they live in Canada. 
This is the ultimate way we work out our differences, but it has 
allowed our country to thrive and to prosper.  We are stronger as 
a result.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-20 the federal government wants to ensure that we 
can handle the most difficult issue a country could ever have to 
face: the possibility of its own breakup.  However, the country 
would have to go through this while making sure that the rights 
of all Canadians are protected.  That is important to note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 ensures that if Canadians are asked if they want their 
province to separate from Canada it is through a question they 
can understand clearly.  We live in a democracy.  Bill C-20 is 
our democratic response to the talk of secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1980 and again in 1995 the Quebec government asked its 
citizens questions that could have led to the separation of 
Quebec.  If Quebecers are asked again, the federal government 
wants to ensure and needs to ensure that they know what they are 
being asked and what the consequences of their answers would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would the impact be to Canadians, to Quebecers and even to 
the world if Quebec were to separate from Canada?  A great nation 
would no longer exist, and that would be a tragedy.  Our example 
to the world showing that minorities can coexist and flourish 
would be lost forever.  Secession would break up Canada but it 
would also result in the division of Quebec society itself, a 
rift that history has taught us could last no more than a 
generation.  Disagreements would continue for many years, long 
after formal negotiations would have been concluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech opening the 18th Sommet de la Francophonie in 
Moncton on September 3, 1999, the French president, Mr. Jacques 
Chirac, expressed his admiration for our country.  He said: 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so symbolic to be here in Canada, a country which searches 
for and comes up with ways to live together in a peaceful and 
tolerant fashion. Today, Canada, this land of first nations, 
francophones and anglophones, provides an example of a cultural 
and linguistic diversity that is not only accepted but also 
valued. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada we now live in would no longer be.  The once 
exemplary federation decentralized and tolerant would now be a 
broken nation.  It would be a major setback for the coexistence 
of minorities worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the opinion on unilateral secession rendered by the Supreme 
Court of Canada on August 20, 1998, it was stated that only clear 
support for secession would give rise to an obligation to 
undertake constitutional negotiations should Quebecers decide to 
separate from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Support for separation would need to be expressed by a clear 
majority in favour of secession, answering a clear question on 
the very secession point.  The question that would be put to 
voters would have to be straightforward and clear.  It could not 
cloak a separation from Canada and its grave consequences in 
wordiness thereby allaying any confusion.  That is totally 
unacceptable.  Bill C-20 will ensure that facing the possibility 
of separation Canadians would know what they are being asked and 
would know how the government will uphold democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the bill is an enormously important one.  It is 
of historic consequence and one that all of us should support.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I was 
very much intrigued by what my colleague had to say, because it 
contains contradictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member describes Canada as a success story. How could 
Canada be a success story if one quarter of the population, 
namely Quebec, has been trying in vain for more than 30 years to 
obtain some recognition of its distinctiveness? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can now be said that half of this distinct people wants to 
separate from English Canada, precisely because it has always

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can Canada be said to be a success story when the federal 
government just introduced a bill whose main purpose is to 
threaten Quebecers, frighten them and force upon them what we 
already know will be unacceptable criteria for a referendum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the bill requires the question to be clear while 
we all know very well that the questions asked in previous 
referendums were very clear. The 1995 question was “Do you agree 
that Quebec should become sovereign?”  This is a rather clear 
question. If questions asked in the past were clear then 
obviously future questions will always be seen as unacceptable 
by English Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member the following: how can he truly and 
seriously declare that Canada is a success story when we have 
reached the point where the federal government has introduced a 
bill that threatens Quebec and in a way deprives the Quebec 
people of some of its rights and has every appearance of an 
antidemocratic measure? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, it never ceases to amaze 
me that the party opposite says things like frighten and 
intimidate and tries to pretend that somehow Quebec has been a 
victim in all this when the reality is that Canada is a 
federation that works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again not only have we proven it here at home but 
people around the world say that we are a country second to none 
because of our tolerance, our compassion, our assistance to 
others, and the ability to allow linguistic, cultural and 
religious groups to maintain what they believe and think is 
important.  We have done that in a very meaningful way which 
allows the people of Quebec and all parts of Canada to live in a 
way and in a sense of harmony that is unparalleled in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the member opposite I say it is quite frivolous to hear that, 
but I want to directly answer his comment about the Government of 
Quebec question and how clear it was.  Let me for the record say 
that in the 1980 referendum this was the question: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Québec has made public its proposal to 
negotiate a new agreement with the rest of Canada, based on the 
equality of nations; this agreement would enable Québec to 
acquire the exclusive power to make its laws, administer its 
taxes, and establish relations abroad—in other words, 
sovereignty—and at the same time, to maintain with Canada an 
economic association including a common currency; any change in 
political status resulting from these negotiations will be 
submitted to the people through a referendum; on these terms, do 
you agree to give the Government of Québec the mandate to 
negotiate the proposed agreement between Québec and Canada? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oui or non.  Do you think for one minute, Madam Speaker, that is 
a clear question?  I do not think so.  When the member opposite 
tries to hoodwink us by saying it is, I say it ain't.  It is not, 
and he should reread the question to find out and then he would 
know. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a delight for me to be here today to speak 
about an issue of grave importance to all members of Canadian 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something is happening in Ottawa.  Something is happening in my 
great riding of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke.  Something is 
happening in every province throughout this great country of 
ours.  In a way that something makes me a bit sad because if it 
is not properly addressed, if it is not looked into, if it is not 
handled in the right way, it could lead to the breakup of the 
greatest country in the world, our country Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My duty as a federal member of parliament is to articulate the 
concerns of my constituents, to be their advocate.  But as a 
federal member of parliament I have an even greater obligation. 
That obligation is to our country Canada and to the protection 
and preservation of national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each and every one of us in this room must be invigorated by our 
triumphs of the past, by the magic of the present and by our 
hopes and dreams of the future.  Canada has triumphed over much 
adversity to be in the situation we are in.  It is the year 2000 
and we are recognized as the greatest country in the world in 
which to live, work and raise a family.  There is a magic in the 
air.  We are in a new millennium.  There is a new command, to 
dare to dream about a fantastic future for our country that is 
strong, united and free.  With Bill C-20 unity will reign 
supreme.  This bill will be a blueprint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.

piqued the interest of members of the opposition.  They know that 
I speak the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one thing that will be front and centre in the clarity 
act. Veracity will reign supreme.  If any province or territory 
in this country, not only the province of Quebec, wants to embark 
on the vacuous voyage to independence, truthfulness, honesty and 
clarity will be front and centre. Not only the government but the 
Canadian people and all parties opposite have clearly said that 
without that there will be negotiations.  The truth of the matter 
is that the bill we are proposing is going to bring clarity to 
the future of this great country of ours.  Let us look— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> What about the billion dollars? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  Madam Speaker, do not worry about it. 
I am used to the heckling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am sorry to 
interrupt the hon. member but I am having a hard time listening 
to what is being said.  With all due respect please listen to the 
hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  Madam Speaker, the simple truth of the 
matter is that some of the people who have been advocating 
separation in the province of Quebec have not shown clarity in 
what could happen if the people of Quebec ever embarked on that 
voyage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at a few of the situations, such as currency. 
My colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois have said that if 
something ever did happen, and God help us that this does not 
happen, they would still use the Canadian dollar.  There is 
nothing preventing them from doing that.  The Bahamas use the 
American dollar.  But think about this.  They say they want to be 
maîtres chez nous, masters in their own house.  How can they be 
masters of their own house if they relinquish power to the most 
important thing, which is their monetary system?  Think about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member of parliament who is our Prime Minister comes from 
the province of Quebec.  The finance minister is a member of 
parliament from the province of Quebec.  They are putatively the 
two most powerful people in the government and they come from the 
province of Quebec. They can defend the interests of Quebec and 
the interests of other provinces with regard to the monetary 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look what happened when former premier René Lévesque gained 
power and said that they were leaving, quitting and separating 
from Canada.  There was a mass exodus of businesses from the 
province of Quebec.  Why?  Because business people want 
stability.  Where there is talk of separation and independence 
people will not invest money.  My colleague from 
Frontenac—Mégantic has a lot of money but perhaps he does not 
want to invest in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the province of Quebec, some people are saying 
that Quebec would automatically be a member of the United 
Nations, NATO, GATT and NAFTA. That is not necessarily true.  One 
has to negotiate oneself into these organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States has made it abundantly clear that Quebec would 
not automatically be in NAFTA. Think about that.  Without the 
protection of the North American Free Trade Agreement the milk 
marketing board in the province of Quebec would be obliterated. 
There is enough surplus milk in the state of New York to flood 
Quebec.  Tell the milk producers in the province of Quebec that 
it would be all over. They would not be able to sell any more 
milk because they would be undercut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On citizenship, one thing which really puzzles me is that they 
say they will still retain their Canadian citizenship.  That is 
like saying, “I am leaving home but I am taking the MasterCard 
and the family compact with me”.  Why in heaven's name would 
they want to do something as offensive as separate yet retain the 
citizenship of the country which they were separating from? 
Because the Canadian passport is recognized as the best passport 
in the entire world.  That will not automatically happen.  That 
is something the country will have a say in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On duplication, one of their famous mantras is “We can do 
things cheaper because we would be our own country”.  Let us 
take a look at the Charlottetown accord of 1992.  The province of 
Quebec held its own referendum as opposed to the rest of the 
country which held the national referendum.  Afterward the cost 
of the referendum was figured out. In the province of Quebec it 
cost about $6.63 per person for its own referendum on the 
Charlottetown accord.  For the rest of the country it was about 
$4.83.  So much for doing things cheaper on its own.  It is just 
not in the cards, and that was clearly evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now on to transfer payments.  I had a real job out in the real 
world before I got elected as a member of parliament.  I was in 
business.  I believed it was good business if I gave someone $10 
that they would give me back $11, $12, or even $10.01.  With the 
transfer payments, the people of Quebec should be made aware that 
they send the money to Ottawa.  Somehow they have the convoluted 
idea that we just throw the money away and they get nothing in 
return. The opposite is true.  They get over $3 billion a year 
more in transfer payments from Ottawa than they send to Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  I know the hon. member over there is a

am even prouder to be a Canadian. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this debate we must remember that being polite and gracious 
is not a sign of weakness.  We should be exploring the problems 
that unite us instead of deploring the problems that divide us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as Canadians who are strong in unity can and will face any 
challenge.  We as Canadians strong in unity will march forward 
vanquishing any naysayer who stands in the glorious path of 
liberty, prosperity and most of all unity.  I say this to my 
colleagues in the House, venez avec moi mes amis.  Come with me 
because my resolve is that a greater, more beautiful and brighter 
future awaits us in this millennium.  Come join with me and

</I></B></P><P align=left>When he claims that he knows the truth, he sounds like the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and his colleagues. 
That minister is not proud of his pupil because he does not 
even know that nowadays states that share jurisdiction adopt a common 
currency and citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what sovereignists have always wanted and proposed to 
the rest of Canada, and they will keep on doing so. Members 
opposite are rather like the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs about whom a commentator said today: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“For his troubles, Dion sits at the bottom of the hit parade of 
Quebec politicians.  Only a tiny minority of Quebecers approve of 
his performance.  He is an object of open ridicule in many media 
quarters”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is saying what the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
has been repeating for years. This does not work in Quebec. This 
is not accepted by Quebecers because they want the freedom to 
choose their future. This bill will take away that freedom. It 
is an undemocratic bill and we will fight against it until the 
very last in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B> Madam Speaker, if the Government of Quebec 
asked an honest and clear question, we would have no problem 
with the result. I say to my friends and to the Government 
of Quebec that they must be careful: the question will have to 
be honest and clear. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will not comment on the eloquence of the hon. member because he 
chose the wrong venue. He would be a cheerleader for a football 
team than a member of parliament. This is no picnic, the bill is 
an attack against the democratic rights of Quebecers. The 
members opposite should refrain from making stupid statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that Quebec would not be a party to international trade 
agreements; this is pure nonsense, it is simply not true. He 
said that we receive $3 billion more than what we pay each year; 
this is simply not true. They owe us at least $2 billion per 
year for the last two years. Quebecers pay too much taxes to the 
federal government, compared to what they get back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that all is well in Canada, that everybody gets along 
fine and that we all live in harmony. I beg to disagree. The 
premiers are unanimous in saying that the federal government 
must give back what it took away from the Canada social 
transfer, but both the Minister of Finance and the Prime 
Minister are not listening. Where is the harmony in this great 
Confederation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B> Madam Speaker, this is terrible. My friend 
across the way said that I am a football player. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> No, no. A cheerleader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B> I am a hockey player, not a cheerleader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that with the transfers to provinces—listen to this 
and say it to the people in Quebec—they get more than $3 billion 
each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B> I like my friends across the way a lot 
because they are passionate and demonstrative. It is perfect, as 
far as I am concerned, and it is good for Quebec, but it is even 
better for Canada. Let Quebec stay in Canada, and all will be 
well. Do not be afraid of me, I am only a backbencher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister resides in the Province of Quebec and we do 
not have any problems with our friends.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is an 
honour to address Bill C-20, the clarity act.  I will be sharing 
my time with the hon. member for Chicoutimi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, the bill that the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has the 
audacity to call the clarity act, falls just short of being 
rightfully tabbed the most unclear, the most ambiguous and 
certainly the most imperilling legislation ever proposed in the 
history of our great nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in the interest of time and procedure, it is the 
disingenuous, disruptive spirit of this bill rather than its 
blatantly flawed details that I will address during the time I 
have been given. As I read carefully through the bill I find 
difficulty in uncovering its merits. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason is that this bill simply has no merit.  In fact I 
submit that it represents not only the wrong course of action for 
Canada but moreover its presentation to the House for 
consideration is nothing further than adding another instance of 
Liberal government dishonest, poll driven practices.  I cannot in 
good conscience allow myself to look past the clarity act or past 
the motivations behind the government's proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is quite a 
brilliant individual.  The member holds a bachelor of arts, a 
master's degree and a Ph.D.  In addition he has served as a 
professor of political science, as a journal editor and as a 
research fellow.  No one is questioning his expertise on Canadian 
constitutionalism.  Indeed his expertise is the very reason why 
he was recruited to run for the Liberal Party.  However, with 
such distinguishing credentials and given that he is so clearly 
gifted, it is truly puzzling that the hon. member would make the 
mistake of proposing this ill timed, ill conceived, and most 
glaring, this ill advised bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I can serve as a beacon for the House and shed some 
light on my colleague's motivations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he was recruited to 
run for the Liberal Party, my colleague from 
Saint-Laurent—Cartierville was a professed federalist; and he 
remains as such today as the banner boy for the federalist forces 
of Canada.  During his byelection campaign we were introduced to 
the member as an experienced, reasoned academic who possessed 
practical and realistic ideas for saving Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told by political analysts that the minister's strength 
as a candidate was his supposedly unyielding support for 
reforming and ultimately renewing confederation.  He was called 
upon by the Liberal Party to quell Quebecers' wishes to separate 
from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member came to Ottawa as an adamant proponent of plan 
A, that is a proponent of negotiating and conciliating with 
Quebec toward a new constitutional arrangement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the 
minister's recent bill is not indicative of the plan A approach 
but rather of the directly opposite plan B approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are we to reconcile what certainly seems to be a glaring 
discrepancy?  On one hand we know that the minister came to 
Ottawa as a fervent advocate of plan A and on the other hand we 
have this new bill, the clarity bill, which obviously comes to us 
from the plan B school of thought proposed by the same minister 
who previously had not simply leaned toward plan A but as we all 
know had built his reputation on furthering plan A. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do members suppose would urge an apparently intellectual 
resolute individual like the hon. minister to make a 180 degree 
turnaround on such an important national issue?  Given the recent 
history of the Liberals the answer is quite simple: the polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Polling conducted following the 1995 Quebec referendum indicated 
that constitutional fatigue and a sense of exasperation had 
descended upon Canadians.  Having recently undergone two attempts 
at constitutional renewal, first in 1987 with the Meech Lake 
accord and then in 1992 with the Charlottetown accord, Canadians 
were admittedly tired of hearing about constitutional 
negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the referendum Canadians were so embittered by the 
near loss of our nation that many jumped aboard the plan B ship. 
This shift among Canadians was manifest in the polls of the day. 
Therefore, because of the prevailing sentiment in the nation at 
the time, many colleagues across the floor surrendered their once 
strong support for plan A and flocked to the masses as they 
adopted plan B, all in the name of electoral success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague turned a blind eye to the reality that plan A was 
and remains the most favourable course of action for the survival 
of our nation.  The Liberal trademark weather vane government is 
assuredly not the type of leadership Canada needs as we prepare 
for our most important challenge since confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time in our history the stages of possible 
succession for a province and for the resulting breakup of Canada 
are defined.  It is truly regretful that it has become common practice 
for our reddened leaders to govern the polls, placing utmost 
importance upon polls of the day rather than upon what is 
ultimately best for Canada.  By bending and stretching when told, 
hoping to sweeten the public come election time, the government 
is not only depriving Canadians of the leadership they so 
rightfully 
deserve from Ottawa, but even beyond this the government is 
compromising the future of this great nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today Canada does not need a government that governs solely 
according to the public will without first engaging its own 
steadfast conscientious deliberations on the issue.  Yes, it is 
true that we must actually solicit support from the public in order to 
gauge its inclinations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, basing questions of national interest on the fluctuating 
preferences of the public, particularly when the public may not 
be fully apprised of the complexities of the matter and 
particularly when the public may very easily be swayed by its own 
emotions, is not only thoughtless but I submit is the wrong 
course of action for the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill legitimizes the breakup of a great country that 
generations past and present have worked so hard to build. 
Canadians have been misled into thinking that the bill presents 
the most favourable course of action for Canada in dealing with the 
impasse Ottawa has reached with Quebec.  The Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs would have Canadians believe that 
laying down strict rules for the secession of Quebec is the only 
alternative left for Canada. However, this is most definitely not the 
case.  There is an alternative to Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The alternative, the most favourable alternative for Canada, is 
to focus on reconciliation between our nation's two founding 
peoples.  The alternative to the minister's bill is to do what 
was intended by our forefathers and by Sir John A. Macdonald, 
Canada's first prime minister: to fight for the preservation of 
Canada—and we have to remember this country is only 133 years 
young—to fight for the prosperity of all Canadians; to pursue 
aggressively the inclusion of all Canadians in the political 
discourse, and to stand firm and unite against challenges both 
external and internal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The alternative, contrary to what my 
colleagues across the floor would have us believe, is not to 
facilitate the separation of the nation's two founding peoples 
but rather to work toward a constitutional resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the right leadership and with a concerted effort to draw 
political actors, officials and Canadians together, our continued 
union between Canada's founding peoples can doubtless become the 
most flourishing, successful and triumphant union ever forged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes to cede the right of secession of our 
provinces.  With the bill the condition for the separation of 
Quebec and for other provinces will be set as law.  Once met, 
those who would destroy what countless Canadians have given their 
lives to build and to preserve will have the guarantee of 
entering into negotiation.  For what?  For the destruction of our 
great land and for undermining the work, the effort and the 
unrivalled commitment of our forefathers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I offer the following to my colleagues in the 
opposition and those in the governing party who still have the 
courage of their convictions to think for themselves. I would 
encourage all of them to join us as we expose the Liberals for 
the improvident, distanced, poll driven defeatists they are. I 
would encourage them to do what they know is best for Canada: to 
oppose Bill C-20, the clarity act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deserve better leadership than they have received from 
the Liberal Party and from the untrustworthy, vacillating 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  We have a responsibility 
to Canadians.  They must know exactly what the bill means for the 
future of our country.  I am afraid that should the bill pass 
Canadians will gain nothing further than a false sense of 
security.  The clarity act is the wrong course of action for the 
country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened quite carefully to what our hon. colleague was saying in 
this debate and I have a couple of questions for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said something to the effect that it was terrible to give the 
option to Quebec to possibly separate.  I agree with that because 
I want the country to stay together.  However, what would his 
alternative be?  Would it be to say that no province or no people 
within a province could vote democratically and make decisions on 
what they want to do?  That is my first question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second one has to do with the issue of clarity.  It seems to 
me that the votes in the past on this issue have been very 
unclear.  They could take our country into a kind of abyss, which 
is exactly what the member wants to avoid.  It seems to me that 
it would be in the greatest interest of keeping Canada together 
if those people voting in a province on such an issue have a 
clear question so that they clearly understand the consequences 
of their decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result I believe—and I think the hon. member would too and 
I ask him to express this—that if the people got a clear 
question and clearly saw the consequences then they would vote to 
stay in Canada because it is a wonderful country and it is part 
of what we are all together.  We want to stay together.  I would 
like the hon. member's comments on those two questions.

interesting.  The questions that come to mind are why is the bill 
even here and what has been done since 1995 to resolve this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am transparently aware that the only thing the interprovincial 
affairs and justice ministers have done is to have a reference of 
three questions to the supreme court and a letter writing 
exercise between the federal interprovincial affairs minister and 
the interprovincial affairs minister of the Quebec government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With what we have going for us, I would have worked a lot harder 
trying to resolve this issue with the interested parties, not 
only the people of Quebec but with the other provinces. Instead, 
it may be purely coincidental that this was brought out just 
before Christmas.  It was the same old story as in the 1997 
election.  A book was published in the U.S. where the president 
of the United States waged a war because his popularity had 
waned.  Maybe they brought this forth to conceal the impending 
fraud and scandal that are starting to emerge from the HRDC and 
the transitional jobs fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot more could have been done by working on plan A in trying 
to resolve this 150 to 200 year old situation instead of just 
bringing forth an act that talks about a clear question.  It did 
not specify a clear question.  It did not specify what is a clear 
majority, and there are a lot of other things it did not make 
clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of Canadians have not been happy about this issue over a 
long period of time, but it will only give them a false sense of 
security.

help foster the development and promotion of the feature film 
industry in Canada by founding the Academy of Canadian Cinema and 
Television and establishing the Genie Awards.  On January 30, 
2000 the Genies celebrated their 20th anniversary.

demonstrates the need for increased support to take Canada from a 
producer of world respected art films to a globally competitive 
producer and exporter of popular and entertaining films that are 
undeniably Canadian in content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to commend the academy, Telefilm Canada, CBC

of health care.  It has reduced the federal contribution to 
health care spending from 50%, the 50:50 partnership on which 
health care depended, down to 13%.  It has opened the door to 
privatized two tier health care.

are rich receive fewer tax points than provinces that are poor. 
That is in order to make sure that all provinces have the same 
opportunity. The hon. member forgot to mention that.  Perhaps I 
could quote someone after the Minister of Finance's last budget. 
Joy MacPhail, B.C. finance minister at the time of the 1999

now join together with Ottawa and address the problems of the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of getting to the bottom of this mess she stood in the 
House, smiled and told us everything was okay.  In the meantime 
she doled out almost $1 million to her own riding, a riding that 
did not qualify under her own department's rules.  The minister 
has been caught.  Why does she not do the honourable thing and 
just resign, just quit? 
<P><A NAME="LINK143"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I categorically reject everything in the 
hon. member's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the riding of Brant I want to confirm yet again 
that no rules were broken.  The riding of Brant was identified as 
a pocket of high unemployment and therefore eligible for the 
transitional jobs fund and then again for the Canada jobs fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that there were 250 projects across Canada 
that qualified for transitional jobs fund money where the 
unemployment levels were less than 12%, and half of them were in 
opposition ridings. 
<P><A NAME="LINK144"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in December the minister stood in the 
House, looked you in the eye and these cameras in the eye and 
said “Folks, everything is all right in my department”, despite 
the fact that she had on her desk an internal audit that said her 
department was a mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She now says “We are going to fix everything”.  How can she 
say to the House and all Canadians that everything is okay?  How 
can we believe her now after she misled the House in December? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  As much as possible I would like members to 
stay away from the word misleading because it sort of excites 
everybody. 
<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I cannot resist pointing out the double standards of the 
members and the leader of the party that wants to abolish all 
these programs.  I do not know about the critic.  He made a 
mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to this member, on September 30, 1997, he wrote “I 
am pleased with the museum's development over the years and your 
support of this project will have a significant and long lasting 
effect on our rapidly growing community”.  He wanted the money 
and now he is criticizing the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK146"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
rather than take responsibility for the findings of the HRDC 
audit the minister blames public servants.  Our democracy depends 
on ministers taking responsibility, yet the government refuses to 
do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the minister that the internal audit raised serious 
concerns about projects that were approved for political reasons 
and that a regime already exists of public expenditures. The 
problem is that the government has ignored it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the extent of mismanagement and political interference, 
the minister simply cannot run away from her own responsibility. 
Will the minister do the honourable and the democratic thing and 
resign? 
<P><A NAME="LINK147"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, they should stop a little bit of this double talk that 
is going on here.  She talks about political interference and she 
is a member who writes all the time to the department to get 
money for her riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has been successful.  She has got money for the Learning 
Disabilities Association of B.C., the Vancouver Volunteer Centre, 
KidSafe Project Society, and the Boys' and Girls Club of Greater 
Vancouver.  That was successful political interference. 
<P><A NAME="LINK148"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
usual the Prime Minister is holding up a smokescreen.  The issue 
here is the transitional jobs fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to say that the Canadian public is not fooled for a 
moment that this is some sort of administrative foul up.  People 
see it for what it is, a Liberal slush fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few weeks alone Canadians have watched in disbelief 
as a government stood ready to give millions to hockey

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to say again that 
the Canadian public is not fooled for a moment that this is some 
sort of administrative foul up.  They see it for what it is, a 
Liberal slush fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few weeks alone Canadians have watched in disbelief 
as the government stood ready to give millions to hockey 
millionaires and then millions to bank billionaires instead of 
students.  It has mismanaged billions in programs that should be 
helping the unemployed, not the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These misguided priorities of the Liberal government have lost 
the trust of Canadians.  Will the minister resign?  That is the 
right thing to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK149"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is getting funny because she talks about 
the Liberal slush fund.  Here is what she wrote to the minister 
of this department on June 24, 1999, in relation to summer career 
placement programs in her riding:  “This additional funding was 
sorely needed. Additional jobs mean more opportunities for 
students and community agencies”.  I agree with you, Madam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I ask all hon. members to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Liberal research department's has been working 
overtime.  Earlier in question period in response to a question 
from the member for Madawaska—Restigouche the minister said “I 
had to improve the audit”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was changing the date on the cover page only part of the 
improvements to the audit?  I suggest changing an audit is 
illegal.  Why was the minister trying to hide the truth about 
when she received the report? 
<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not trying to hide anything.  I made 
the report public, for heaven's sake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From my point of view the appropriate thing to do when you get 
information that says there are problems is to let Canadians know 
so that Canadians can appreciate the significance of the 
undertaking and they can also measure the impact of our results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to be looking forward to presenting on a quarterly 
basis the results of our reviews, the information that we get on 
the improvements that these undertakings are going to hold. There 
is nothing to hide here.  We are going to fix the problem and it 
is not going to exist after. 
<P><A NAME="LINK152"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if there was nothing to hide the minister should 
have been in here in November explaining what was wrong in her 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning at a press conference we heard from the same HRDC 
officials described by the minister as being in the dark ages. 
Over the course of this scandal the minister has blamed everyone 
from the previous minister to the press. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the minister now have Canadians trust the same officials 
she claims created the problem to investigate themselves? Before 
the minister resigns will she embark on a full, impartial, 
independent investigation into this scandal in her department? 
<P><A NAME="LINK153"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was the internal checks and balances 
of the department that brought this information to my attention. 
It was my review of the audit that suggested we had to take it 
seriously.  It is the response of the department that is now 
going to fix this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to make the results of that work public to 
Canadians so that they can measure our results.  That is what 
Canadians want.  That is the responsible thing to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the minister's department had an audit that showed 
severe mismanagement of public funds last summer.  Yet all 
through the fall she kept giving Canadians the clear message that 
everything was as it should be, everything was under control, 
everything was being done that should be done.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In December, after the minister acknowledged that she saw the 
audit, she again kept giving the clear message that everything 
was fine, that everything was under control and that there was no 
problem.  How can we tolerate anything less than this minister's 
resignation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK155"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

previously in the House that was misleading.  I stand by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about accountability.  When this hon. member goes 
back to her riding I wonder what she will say to the taxpayers 
who ask her why she did not know that tax dollars were being 
spent in their riding and why did she not know that $7 million 
was invested in community undertakings.  Her answer will be that 
she had no idea where the money went, but that she hopes it did 
some good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell her that that money has done good and it has made a 
difference in the lives of the citizens of Calgary—Nose Hill.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PRIVILEGE 
</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MEMBER FOR WENTWORTH—BURLINGTON 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Earlier today the hon. member for Athabasca 
raised a question of privilege in the House.  In effect, in his 
question of privilege he mentioned the hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington.  The hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington 
is now in the House.  Is the hon. member aware of what was said 
earlier today?   He has signalled that he is aware of what was 
said earlier today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member if he could please address this 
question in which he was personally named. 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was taken entirely by surprise by the member for 
Athabasca's point of privilege this morning.  I came into the 
office and it was remarkable to be named on a point of privilege 
when I have advanced what I think is one of the most important 
private member's initiatives that the House has seen for many 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has chosen to attack the very presence of this bill 
in the House, which has now arrived on the order of precedence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, what the member has suggested is that there is some 
impropriety in the fact that I introduced this bill at first 
reading two years ago at about the same time as the subcommittee 
on Private Members' Business, that is, the House procedure and 
affairs standing committee on Private Members' Business, 
introduced an amendment and made a recommendation to the effect 
that any member of this House who had a private member's bill 
that enjoyed more than 100 seconders from three parties should go 
directly on the order of precedence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, I sought and did obtain 113 signatures, all from 
backbenchers; none from members of the government and no 
parliamentary secretaries.  But I did obtain the support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequent to obtaining that support, as a result of 
representations made to me on my bill, I submitted a revised 
version of the bill in June 1998, and that bill now is before the 
House as the result of the member for Langley—Abbotsford, a 
member of the Reform Party— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  If members have 
conversations I would ask them to please take them into the 
lobbies.  I want to hear this question of privilege, as I am sure 
all hon. members do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your 
intervention because this is an issue of great importance to all 
members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I wish to draw your attention to the fact that the 
reason this bill is now on the order of precedence for 
Wednesday—it is to be debated Wednesday—is because the member 
for Langley—Abbotsford, who is now not in favour with his party, 
surrendered his position and agreed to change his position on 
Private Members' Business for Wednesday for my bill, and that is 
how it advanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I wish to draw to your attention, Mr. Speaker, that the 
issue of concern to the member for Athabasca pertains to 
something that occurred on June 11, 1998, 19 months ago, and he 
has held off making representations about his concern until 
today.  At no time has he spoken to me about his concern.  At no 
time, I believe, has he spoken to other people.  He has chosen 
this very last moment, and so while he had 19 months to prepare 
his submission this morning, I have only had a few hours. 
You will have to forgive me, Mr. Speaker, if some of my remarks 
are a little disjointed because I have had to put this defence 
together very rapidly.  But I am prepared to defend it because I 
do not feel that the member for Athabasca's charges—and they are 
very extreme charges—have any substance.  I will take my chances 
and go right from here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am just going point by point from the speech this morning, but 
I only have the advantage of the blues, Mr. Speaker.  One of the 
member's complaints was that the member for Wentworth—Burlington 
was carrying invalid support for Bill C-264, which is the access 
to information bill, over to the second session by applying it to 
the new procedures for Private Members' Business.  I contest the 
use of the words invalid support.  The people who seconded my 
bill, and I have the signatures before me, knew in principle what 
the bill was about.  I would contest the use of the word invalid. 
There was nothing invalid about the support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Athabasca claims that he did not second Bill 
C-264 in the form that he now finds it before the House, in the 
form of Bill C-206.  Mr. Speaker, you will have to understand 
that after the resumption of the session I had to reintroduce the 
revised version of Bill C-264 and it has now become Bill C-206. 
But the point to remember is that the original bill was submitted 
before this House on June 11, 1998 and had the unanimous consent 
of this House that it should go forward in that revised version. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the member says that he did not officially and wilfully 
second the new version of Bill C-264.  Mr. Speaker, the member 
for Athabasca was in the House at the time I submitted the 
revised version.  He was here.  He has had 19 months to examine 
the bill.  He has had 19 months to decide that he did not like 
what he gave his unanimous support for, and yet he leaves it to 
the last minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, Mr. Speaker, the member was in the House and he knew that 
the bill had changed.  If he had objections he has had ample time 
to raise those objections.  He was in the House with his own 
private member's bill, Bill C-227, and Mr. Speaker you will find 
it in <I>Hansard</I> on that occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to <I>Hansard</I> of that particular occasion because the 
member also raises that issue.  What I said at the time, Mr. 
Speaker—and he was there when I said it—was that the reason why 
I wanted to resubmit a revised version of Bill C-264 was that 
many people had made representations to me and felt that there 
were some flaws and technical difficulties.  Mr. Speaker, indeed 
I feel there were flaws and I did change them accordingly.  So it 
is very clear that I am not talking just about technical 
difficulties; I am talking about inadequacies in the bill as I 
originally wrote it as Bill C-264 and some changes were made. 
The member knew about those changes.  He did not know them in 
detail, but he knew that changes had occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essence of the member's complaint is that he is saying “I 
did not support Bill C-264 in its revised version”.  Now I will 
set aside for a minute, Mr. Speaker, the fact that he gave his 
unanimous consent.  Remember what is occurring here.  When a 
private member—and this was one of the first times that it 
happened—seeks seconders for his bill in order to get it on the 
order of precedence, he only seeks seconders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, that I do believe that many people 
who seconded my Bill C-264 in its original version had not 
actually read the contents of it.  I interpreted the seconding of 
my Bill C-264 as supporting Bill C-264 in principle.  Of course 
there are going to be aspects of the bill that are going to be 
subject to debate, to controversy.  Of course when it goes to 
second reading we are going to debate it.  There is no guarantee 
that anyone who seconded the bill is going to actually vote for 
the bill.  Mr. Speaker, all we did by having the seconders was to 
enable the bill to get on the order of precedence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer you, Mr. Speaker, to an actual document.  I will not 
show it to the House, but this is the petition I sent around with 
various signatures.  It contains the signature of the member for 
Athabasca and 112 signatures of other members of the House.  The 
wording I used in order to obtain those signatures was precisely 
this:  “I second Bill C-264 and would like to see it be placed 
immediately on the order of precedence”.  There was no promise 
about the detailed contents of the bill.  It was simply an 
undertaking that they would support the bill and to see it on the 
order of precedence so it could be debated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer you also, Mr. Speaker, to the 13th report of the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, the 
subcommittee that examined the issue of private members' business 
when it considered the various representations to have the 100 
signatures as a means of seconding a bill and getting it on the 
order of precedence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That report came out about a year ago.  It says, “If the 
sponsoring member is prepared to work hard to solicit support, 
and if enough members feel that the item should be debated”, 
just be debated, “then this alternative procedure” should be 
instituted.  The alternative procedure in the recommendation is 
that the standing orders be amended to allow items outside the 
order of precedence that have been jointly seconded by at least 
100 members from at least two recognized political parties in the 
House of Commons to be placed on the order of precedence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about the deep substance of the bill.  We are 
talking about the bill in principle.  We are talking only about 
the bill getting into the House to be debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that he would expect any changes, major or minor, should 
have been brought to the attention of members of the House.  When 
we have a very large bill it is impossible to discuss with 113 
members every change we might be contemplating, because the 
details of any legislation in the House, be it private members' 
legislation or government bills, are a matter of debate in the 
House and in committee.  The committee and the House decide on 
the fate of the bill based on that debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is totally unreasonable for the member for Athabasca to have 
expected me to go to him and 112 other members to detail every 
change I contemplated with the bill.  I repeat that the member 
for Athabasca was in the House when the revised version went 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  He was not paying attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  He was not paying attention, someone 
said, and that may indeed be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, toward the end, and this is probably the thing that 
is most wounding about this, he accuses me of having forged, 
falsified, altered or fabricated the legislation that came before 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that these are very wounding remarks.  That bill went 
before the House.  The House had ample opportunity to read it. 
He had 19 months.  There is nothing in the bill that I have 
attempted to hide in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member even sends out a red herring.  He complains that I 
misled the Subcommittee on Private Members' Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says that I only said the bill had technical changes in it, 
but he is referring to the Subcommittee on Private Members' 
Business that met on October 28, 1999 which determined the 
votability of a bill.  The contents of the bill in detail were 
not germane to that debate.  The members considered the 
votability and those members of that subcommittee had the bill 
before them.  So there was no attempt, there was no opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would I as a private member attempt any form of deceit with 
respect to private members' legislation that every member in the 
House should want to at least see get on the order of precedence 
and debated? If there are flaws or problems, if things have to be 
changed, even if the bill does not succeed, there is no reason to 
block, stop or halt this bill from going on the order of 
precedence and being debated in due course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Earlier today when the point was brought up 
there were two members on their feet, the hon. house leader of 
the opposition party and the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm. 
I said that I would hear them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK163"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to quickly go over why this is a very serious issue 
and why I believe the Speaker should refer this to the procedure 
and House affairs committee for further investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin with, there is no precedent for this particular case. 
This procedure involving getting 100 signatures from more than 
two parties in the House is a relatively new one.  We have 
experimented with it for the last year or so.  As far as I know 
this has never been a problem before because this is a relatively 
new procedure.  I think the Speaker needs to give us some 
guidance and I would suggest allow the procedure and House 
affairs committee to give guidance to the House in general.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no precedent because the rules are new but there are 
some examples involving signatures and signed documents presented 
to the House.  The authorities on parliamentary privilege agree 
that the House demands the utmost integrity of the documents 
presented to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joseph Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I> on page 
233 states that forgery or fraud in the preparation of petitions 
could be treated as a matter of contempt since that would 
constitute an affront to the House of Commons.  In other words, 
the integrity of documents is treated very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Erskine May talks about an abuse of the right of petition.  It 
points out that it would be an abuse to attempt to alter the 
prayer of a petition after it had been signed.  In other words, a 
person might think he or she could improve it by changing some 
words but Erskine May said it would be an abuse to do that, to 
change something after there were signatures on that page. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member for Athabasca that this same type of 
abuse has happened in the case of Bill C-206.  This is not a 
motion that was presented to the House where we could debate a 
motion, a generality, something that was just a statement of 
opinion in the form of a motion and we could give and take on the 
debate, one side or another.  This was a complete bill, a bill in 
its entirety, presented to members in the House saying “This is 
the bill I want to present in the House; please sign your name on 
the bottom”.  That name was signed in good faith.  There is the 
bill.  There is the document.  That is the bill.  It is not a 
concept.  It is not a theory.  It is not even an agreement in 
principle.  That bill is what that signature applies to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member thinks he has improved this bill.  But these 
were not technical changes such as having the wrong date at the 
top of the page or the clauses were not numbered correctly. 
Clauses were added to the new bill.  Clauses were deleted from 
the old bill.  This is a new bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I would go so far as to argue that one of the main 
reasons this bill had the support of over 100 members of 
parliament is because it specifically said that it could release 
polling information regarding the national unity file.  This is 
something that the government traditionally holds close to its 
chest, refuses to talk about, spends taxpayers' money on but will 
not release to the public. The original bill would have forced 
the government to release it to the House of Commons and to the 
public.  That is a bill worthy of support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the revised bill, and the member can stand and 
admit this, specifically excludes the polling information on the 
national unity file.  It is a huge difference.  It is poles 
apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would ask that you find a prima facie case here, 
that you ask the member for Athabasca to move the appropriate 
motion that this matter be sent to the procedure and House 
affairs committee because this is the first time we have dealt 
with it.  It involves the changing of documents without the 
knowledge of the signators on the bottom.  It involves a huge 
change in the content of the bill itself, an additional clause 
and deletion of other clauses or portions of clauses which 
changes the essence of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To fail to refer that to committee would mean that any bill that 
is signed by 100 members of parliament and subsequently changed 
by unanimous consent, and people should know that often that is 
as few as two or three members present in the House, from here on 
in if members sign their names on the bottom of a bill, they have 
no idea what will come down the pike a couple of weeks later. 
That is not right for members of parliament who have the right to 
know when they sign on the dotted line that nothing will change 
until they have had their say here in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think that it is worthwhile, considering how complicated the 
process has been—the hon. members who spoke one after the other 
earlier did not go into the historical aspects—to mention the 
dates, which are extremely important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Liberal member has also done—and I would like to have 
his attention—in connection with the consent relating to 
signatures, raises sufficient doubt to warrant taking our time 
to address this very important question which affects the 
privileges of all of the members here, particularly the way 
signatures are handled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ruling of the Chair is a very important one because it will 
impact upon how this matter of signatures will be handled in 
future.  I think that all of the parties will need to question 
themselves after you bring down your ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 23, 1997—we were in the first session of the 36th 
Parliament—the member tabled a bill, or in other words Bill C-264 
was read for the first time.  With that bill, the member 
obtained a series of signatures.  He even boasted of this on 
June 11, 1998.  At around 6.20 or 6.25 p.m., he sought the 
unanimous consent of the House.  I will quote him directly 
because what he said is very important: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I rise as a private member on a point of order to 
seek unanimous consent. I feel very awkward after what just 
occurred two seconds ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last October I submitted a private 
member's bill dealing with the access to information bill which 
proposed a great number of amendments to the legislation. I 
received support from all parties. There were representations 
from the Bloc, the Reform Party, the Conservatives and the NDP. 
I received seconders from all opposition parties and seconders 
to a total of 113 on the government backbenches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately in the time since then I have had many 
representations on my bill. A lot of people looked at it and 
made suggestions. They have noticed some flaws and some 
technical difficulties in a few areas which maybe I did not 
think out very clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize here it is still at first 
reading; it has not been picked. If it ever does get to be read 
in second reading I would not want debate to be deflected on the 
flaws. I would hope the debate would deal with the good points 
of the bill. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That day, he obtained unanimous consent. 
No one has yet read the bill he is introducing or the little 
discrepancies, little changes—essentially technical ones as his 
Prime Minister puts it on other matters. But when we look at 
these little changes—and what I am about to say is still very 
important—these two bills are worlds apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give only a few changes, and members will see that they 
are not just little discrepancies or small technical changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's new bill refers to Canada's constitutional 
integrity, whereas in the first one there was no mention of 
integrity or anything to do with the Canadian Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second extremely important little change is that clause 9 
introduces a section 14. Previously, there was reference to 
negotiations between the federal and provincial governments. 
Now, there is reference to federal-provincial—the way it is 
drafted is very ambiguous—relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following clause, which is the best, and which also was not 
in the initial bill for which he obtained the signatures of the 
House, reads “The head of a government institution may refuse to 
disclose any record requested under this Act that contains 
information on plans, strategies or tactics relating to the 
possible secession of a part of Canada, including information 
held or collected for the purpose of developing those plans, 
strategies or tactics”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that the first bill contained no mention of this and 
this one does?  Because the House gave unanimous consent, we are 
going to let this be done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who revised this bill?  Who advised the member? Was it the 
Council on Canadian Unity, the Privy Council, the Office of the 
Prime Minister, without our consent?  We do not know who advised 
him or anything.  This makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think very sincerely that the member is abusing certain 
privileges and cannot, as indicated here, use Standing Order 
87.6, which the Chair knows very well, and use the question of 
the 100 and more signatures to have his bill given precedence.

</I></B></P><P align=left>You must, Mr. Speaker, with what you have heard in this House, 
simply withdraw this bill, remove it from the order of 
precedence of this House, because, otherwise, you will set a 
precedent and, more importantly, you will change forever how 
things operate here with the famous system of the 100 signatures 
of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member proceeded unreasonably, and you cannot approve that. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I have now heard from four members of 
parliament.  I see the hon. member for Athabasca is rising.  I do

very short to add I will listen to him.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
a couple of points which I think are relevant.  They come out of 
the member's defence, which was very elegant but quite irrelevant 
to the issue here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in the House when he asked for unanimous consent to change 
the bill but I had no idea on the substance of the change. He 
said that the change was minor and technical and I took on faith 
that was in fact the case.  It turned out that it was not minor 
and technical.  On that basis, I would not have supported the 
change which, in essence, gave the government a loophole to avoid 
releasing information that I would support the release of to the 
public.  I thought the change was very substantive and I could no 
longer second the bill.

<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree that a 
number of aspects have been covered regarding the standing 
orders, but I would like to add another one which I do not think 
was adequately covered. I am referring to the commitment made by 
a member of parliament when he or she puts his or her signature 
on a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always taken part in the discussions that we have had, 
all of us together, to include in the standing orders the new 
possibility for a member of parliament to bypass the rule of the 
luck of the draw, which was the only one that existed 
previously, by using the signatures of colleagues representing 
various parties, including the government, to promote a private 
member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that rule was drafted, no one ever thought that, by putting 
his or her signature on a bill at the request of a colleague, 
the member had to make sure that the bill could never be the 
object of a request for the unanimous consent of the House to be 
amended. If this were the case, not a single parliamentarian 
would agree to sign in support of a bill whose nature could be 
changed at any time, unbeknownst to that member, by another 
member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you were to agree to the hon. member's request, you would 
introduce a totally new legal concept. It would be tantamount to 
saying in the business field “I put my signature at the bottom 
of a document, on the fifth page of the document, as is 
required, but the person who is the owner can decide to change 
the third, the second or the first page, since the signature is 
there on the principle that we agree.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a member puts his or her signature, he or she does so while 
being very aware that the colleague submitted a bill with which 
he or she agrees. We support the legislation; we show openness. 
But to try to change anything relating to the very nature of the 
document is an attempt to unfairly and inappropriately use the 
signature of a colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are terms which I will not use in this House to describe 
this kind of attempt to use other people's signatures for 
purposes other than those for which that signature was given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I implore you, Mr. Speaker, as the guardian not just of 
parliamentary traditions but of the new standing orders, as the 
guardian of our parliamentary rights, as the guardian of the 
spirit in which the standing orders were changed, and in the 
knowledge that you too, as Speaker, were associated with this 
change, which you saw come into being and about which you are 
very knowledgeable, and that you took part in the discussions 
surrounding it, I am convinced that you have no choice but to 
reject the member's initiative and to reject any similar 
initiative in future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would make it clear to the member that never, because 
another change to the standing orders in which I participated 
and helped to bring about in order to facilitate private 
members' bills allows a bill that was before the House to be 
introduced for consideration at a later date, should these two 
standing orders on which I worked and with which I was in 
agreement, and I remember very clearly the spirit in which they 
were introduced, and I would be deeply hurt by this, never 
should these two standing orders be used today by someone who 
wants to turn private members' business into something personal 
and partisan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot allow a member, not this member or any other member of 
the House, to use the signatures of colleagues under false 
pretences, without running the risk of destroying the little 
trust that remains between members in this House, a trust based 
on mutual respect, which transcends partisan politics and is 
rooted in the belief that we are all honest people, people who 
take a stand and hold what they sign, write and say in respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member opposite has problems with that, Mr. Speaker, it 
is your duty not just to reprimand him but to ensure that never 
again will anyone try to use our signatures for such ends.

to what members on both sides of the House had to say and the 
points raised are very important to me and to all members of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to have until tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.  At that 
time I will return to the House with a decision.  I hope that 
this decision will help us to improve how we work with the new 
standing orders.

that is 50% plus one, is used everywhere in Canada except in the 
case of Quebec.

the fact is that my colleague, the member for Rimouski—Mitis, had

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to rise today to debate a very important and 
critical concurrence motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will bring the members of the House, and perhaps those who are 
watching in CPAC world, up to speed on what is happening.  It 
just so happens that some time ago the auditor general presented 
one of the quarterly reports. That quarterly report of the 
auditor general has to do with the accounts of the country and 
how the public money is being guarded by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the auditor general's reports are tabled in the 
House.  Following the tabling in the House, they are normally 
then referred to the appropriate committee.  The particular 
committee that receives this report is of course the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 6 of the auditor general's report was tabled in the 
House in April 1999, almost a year ago.  The public accounts 
committee tabled its response to that report on November 15, 
1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something that happens here in the House is that we spend a lot 
of money operating the Office of the Auditor General and a lot of 
money on MPs and senators in parliament who try to hold the 
government accountable.  We spend a lot of money in many 
different departments and many different areas of responsibility 
asking for reports.  The reports are then referred to the 
committees and in due time the committees report back.  That is 
where it bogs down.  The reports are tabled in the House and the 
government must then bring forward a response. It usually sits on 
the reports until the next election.   Most of those very good 
reports go completely unnoticed in the country and are not acted 
upon on behalf of taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have the sixth report of the auditor general as 
responded to by the public accounts committee with its first 
report being tabled in the House on November 15, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion for concurrence was made just three days later because 
even back then we were very well aware that expenditures out of 
the human resources portfolio were not being well managed.  This 
particular auditor's report and the report of the public accounts 
committee addressed the question back in the middle of November 
last year.  Had we given a sense to that report at that time we 
probably would have avoided what has now become the billion 
dollar boondoggle.  The recommendations that were made by the 
public accounts committee should be acted upon on behalf of the 
taxpayers of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be very careful.  We need to make sure that we do not 
just routinely sweep this report under the rug.  I will take a 
little bit of time to explain to the members what is actually 
involved in this particular report.  I will urge them to vote in 
favour of my motion, which is to concur in this report.  When we 
concur in it, the recommendations that were presented by the 
committee will be enacted.  In other words, there will be some 
accountability to our hard-working, beleaguered taxpayers who 
send bushels of money—I suppose I should say billions of bushels 
of money—to Ottawa where it is administered and 
mis-administered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to address the important questions that address the 
House these days. 
The phones in our riding offices are ringing off the hooks these 
days.  Canadian taxpayers want to know what is going on.  They 
want to know how we can tolerate this total waste of money and 
the lack of accountability for it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general identified a number of areas in his first 
quarter report of 1999.  Chapter 6 of the report deals with a 
couple of the issues that we are dealing with today.  It was a 
program funded by HRDC, the human resources development 
portfolio.  We should listen carefully to what it says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report deals with, among other things, the national child 
tax benefit and the way in which it is administered.  The auditor 
general points out that the benefit has highly praiseworthy 
goals, such as reducing poverty for children, which is an issue 
this government has put at the forefront and which resonates with 
many Canadians.  None of us want our children to live in poverty. 
We know that children who live in poverty are living in families 
that are suffering from poverty.  The very government that has 
this high goal continues to tax Canadian families with incomes of 
$20,000 a year or less. It takes $6 billion a year from those 
poor families in income tax.  One really wonders what it is 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along comes the auditor general's report stating that the 
national child benefit, which, among other things, was supposed 
to reduce child poverty, is not being properly monitored and that 
there is not an adequate indication that the goals it has struck 
for itself are being met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general raises some important questions.  For 
example, the audit report talks about the definition of poverty 
and asks for clarification on what it really means.  That has 
never really been done.  When we target programs to people who 
are in poverty we need to know who those families are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentions that there are many short term goals, some political 
only, and that we should be looking at long term goals as 
pertaining to the welfare of our families in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to define our goals so that the target we are shooting 
at is clearly known.  When I was a youngster we used to say that 
if we shot at nothing we would be sure to hit it.  Here we have 
another government program that does not have clearly defined 
goals.  It just generally shoots at random in some location with 
taxpayer dollars and wherever it hits it is considered a success. 
Witness the statements made by the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of HRDC today.  What they are getting away with is 
really atrocious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accountability that is required is spelled out in the report 
from the auditor general.  He mentions specifically the national 
child benefit and the employability assistance for people with 
disabilities.  I emphasize that when I move for concurrence in 
this report I am speaking in favour of assisting people who need 
help.  Many times when we bring these issues forward the Liberals 
and some of our other political adversaries try to characterize 
us as not caring about these people.  That is a false 
characterization.  We do care about them.  We care about them so 
much that we would like the money taxpayers give toward helping 
them to actually get to them and to actually achieve the 
specified goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the auditor general wrote his report he said that there was 
lack of accountability.  It is a cost shared program with the 
provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not clear who sets these goals or who monitors them to 
make sure they are being met.  There are general statements of 
accountability.  It always makes wonderful politics to say that 
they want to be accountable.  Every politician will say that 
because it resonates with the taxpayer.  However, are they 
actually doing it?   The auditor general said no and the public 
accounts committee said no.  Some specific recommendations were 
made to correct this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to have an annual report that supplies in detail 
the information that is required in order to evaluate whether or 
not there were proper evaluations and whether goals were 
appropriately set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I find it difficult to speak with all the noise I 
hear with my left ear.  I would ask that you intervene on my 
behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Elk Island has requested that the House pay close attention to 
his words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  I appreciate the indulgence of my 
colleagues, since I believe these issues are very important. They 
certainly are these days as we listen to the big questions on the 
billion dollar boondoggle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now talk a little bit on why I am moving concurrence in 
this report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report makes a couple of important points.  Every province 
and territory in the country, with the exception of Quebec, has 
reached an agreement with the federal government on the new 
social union and on the way in which they will fund some of these 
shared programs.  I think there is probably a consensus across 
the country for that initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in a number of different parts of the country, but 
primarily my own province, and I have not met people who want to 
withhold assistance from those fellow Canadians who are in need. 
However, they are demanding and insisting that the money be 
properly managed.  It is a very simple question:  Is it going to 
be properly accounted for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective is to improve the work incentives for those people 
involved, to provide benefits and services for low income 
families with children, and to give those with disabilities the 
added ability to get jobs and look after themselves as much as 
possible and to get assistance from fellow Canadians who would 
like to assist them.  We would like to do this through an 
accountable tax program.  The key element is accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the report, the committee said “Accountability is a key 
element in the design of both programs.  In official statements, 
all signatories have made commitments to account for expenditures 
of funds and of outcomes”.  Having signed onto this shared 
program idea, the provinces and the federal government have made 
the commitment.  The report goes on to say “Notwithstanding 
these commitments, it is unclear how the accountability for 
overall results of these programs will be achieved”.  There are 
then some observations and recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An official from the department, who attended the committee 
meeting, said “Citizens, legislative bodies and audit offices 
may justifiably seek assurances that these new arrangements 
increase or at least do not diminish accountability for 
expenditures on shared social programs and their outcomes”. That 
is a very desirable goal.  As I said, in the milieu that we are 
in right now in parliament today, it is so appropriate. 
That is why I chose to bring forward this motion for concurrence 
today.  We believe we need to meet those joint goals together.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move on to some of the recommendations that the committee 
is making. Let me be very clear on this.  On the floor right now 
is my motion for concurrence.  If the House concurs in the 
report, it means that these recommendations are adopted by the 
House.  I want to read them into the record because they are so 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation number one from the auditor general via the 
public accounts committee is that Human Resources Development 
Canada and its signatories determine specific quantitative 
expectations of performance for their respective program goals 
along with implementation time lines for the national child 
benefit program and the employability assistance for persons with 
disabilities program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation number two is that Human Resources Development 
Canada and the other signatories regularly report on progress in 
setting quantitative goals and implementation of deadlines in 
their respective reports to the public and their parliamentary 
legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a critical recommendation and ought to have been 
implemented about six months ago.  That is that there be a 
regular report and that it be tabled in all of the provincial 
legislatures as well as in this House so that there is openness 
and accountability and we do not have to get out the damage 
control troops to try to ease a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third recommendation is that Human Resources Development 
Canada with the other signatories develop a common data reporting 
framework and protocol aimed at achieving quality, consistency 
and comparability of program data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am running out of time so I cannot explain this, but it is 
very important that there be consistency from province to 
province on what the goals are and how the achievement of those 
goals is measured.  If we do not have that, then these reports 
can be fudged and will be meaningless.  Therefore that is a very 
important recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation number four is that Human Resources Development 
Canada and the other signatories endeavour where feasible to 
present audited data in the annual progress report. The executive 
summary of that is simply that we want the data to be reliable, 
hence the call for it to be audited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation number five is that HRDC together with the other 
signatories ensure that the annual progress reports of these 
initiatives are tabled in their respective parliamentary 
legislatures at the earliest opportunity after the report is 
released to the public.  Again we have this accountability to the 
public and to the legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation number six is that HRDC and all the other 
signatories commit resources to implement the necessary 
evaluations of these programs.  I will not read the names of the 
programs again. What we have is the necessity for adequate 
staffing so that accountability can be achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am personally very upset.  Imagine if a bank said it had lost 
$100,000 of our money and that we could not have it back and when 
asked to explain where it went, the bank said “We are sorry, we 
had to cut back our staff”.  Would we accept that from a bank? 
No.  Will the taxpayers accept that from the government?  No, 
they will not.  It is a lame excuse.  It is an unjustifiable 
excuse and the government may not use it.  The government must 
put adequate resources to the accountability of these programs so 
that we do not get a repeat of the billion dollar boondoggle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a little aside, the auditor general also reported on programs 
such as TAGS.  The jobs training fund has been the focus of the 
media and of the public in the last month, but the issue is much 
larger. Again it was last April, almost a year ago, when this was 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general in looking at TAGS said that 26% had no 
clear objectives and 33% did not meet the criteria for the labour 
adjustment measure under which they were approved. 
Eighty-four percent did not have verification of contracts and 
83% had no supporting documentation.  This is a completely 
different program. The auditor general has pointed it out.  It 
has been reported to the committee which said, “Let us deal with 
these things” and the House said, “No, let us sit on it”.

call the vote on the concurrence motion.  I will double check and

with great interest to the comments by our colleague from Elk 
Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was struck by what he said at the beginning of his remarks to 
the effect that the reports tabled in this House are just that, 
tabled. The recommendations in these reports are left to the 
discretion of the government which, too often unfortunately, 
will only respond to them at election time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He very rightly said that excellent recommendations are thus 
shelved and never implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understand correctly, the motion is aimed at ensuring that 
any recommendation made in a report tabled in this House be 
immediately implemented with the agreement of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it an interesting proposition in several respects and I 
will ask him to comment on this in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this not the proof that the procedure followed by this House 
for decades fails to ensure good governance? Are we not faced 
with obsolete procedure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, I would suggest that he might have seen to it 
that members of this House have the opportunity to debate 
recommendations further because to endorse them just like that 
might be just a bit too hasty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I value the comments made by 
the member from the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is so eager to get back to Bill C-20 that it is 
going to shut down debate on this motion. That is what it just 
indicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I honestly think if we had a government in Ottawa that was 
responsive to the needs of the people in Canada and was 
accountable and treated taxpayers' money as if it were its own, 
as I pledged to do when I was elected, we would not have the 
scenario of people in Quebec eagerly trying to get out of this 
country.  I believe the problem is right here in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have botched the administration of the country and there is 
not an adequate reason for people to want to stay in the country. 
We should give them that reason by providing them with openness, 
accountability and absolute transparency when it comes to stating 
government objectives and evaluating whether those objectives are 
being met. We need to ensure that the people in Quebec as in the 
rest of Canada, the taxpayers who part with their hard-earned 
money, know for certain that their money is not being misused, 
abused and boondoggled.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a few comments to make. In Motion No. 14 our friend the 
Reform member talks mainly about the social union. As he knows, 
the Premier of Quebec refused to sign the social union framework 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He then said that if everything was working well, Quebec would 
stay within Canada. I would like him to prove to me that what he 
has just said is true. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned in my speech, an 
agreement was reached with all of the provinces except Quebec.  I 
am going to say something now which could come back to haunt me 
but I am going to say it anyway because I believe in brutal 
honesty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that Quebec is the only province standing up for the 
constitution of Canada.  Quebecers are the ones who are saying 
that this is a provincial jurisdiction and the federal government 
has been encroaching on provincial jurisdiction steadily over the 
last 30 years by an increasing use of the spending power.  The 
government has gone into areas where it ought not to be.  As a 
result people in Quebec are saying “We want out of here because 
you are not even obeying your own constitution”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not at all happy that I said that.  I am not happy because 
it is the truth and because it points out a fundamental problem 
in this country which has not been dealt with by past 
Conservative and Liberal governments. I am talking about a 
respect for the law and order of our constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must add that we want to live together as a federation.  I 
want Quebec to stay in Canada. I want Canada to stay together. We 
must learn to work together.  This means that Ottawa, this 
parliament, the government, must respect what Canadians are 
expecting from their constitution and from their individual 
provincial rights.  Too often the government steps on the toes of 
those people in the provinces who simply want to do things that 
are good for their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say it is time to fix that part of it.  Then we would not have 
Bill C-20 and all the other stuff that goes with it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for raising 
this matter, because the entire question of Canada's social 
programs is extremely important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the sectors in which it is clear that the 
Canadian federal system is working the least well.  In 1989, a 
motion was passed unanimously to eradicate child poverty.  Today 
we have more poor children than we did in 1989.  This is a 
matter that brings great dishonour to the Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, on the point raised referring to the auditor 
general's report, the proposal made by the Bloc Quebecois, by 
the hon. member for Québec, is an excellent one.  She has 
proposed that a commissioner for poverty be created. 
This commissioner would carry out the duties of the auditor 
general where poverty issues were concerned, but would go far 
beyond that, by not only finding if the legislation had or had 
not been complied with, but also making recommendations on where 
there ought to be amendments to the legislation, on how the 
government ought to be judged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This position would have the same credibility as the auditor 
general.  We know that when the auditor general criticizes 
something the government has done, the public listens to him.  I 
believe the poverty commissioner could have the same type of 
responsibility.  I find the proposal by the hon. member for 
Québec to be an interesting one, an interesting strategy within 
the overall strategy against poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our system, it is fairly complicated for a citizen to 
understand what the responsibility of each government is in the 
social area.  The federal government ought to give money back in 
the form of transfer payments to the provinces, whose 
responsibility it is to administer programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been a good thing if today's report had gone into 
this a bit further, and this is what I would like to ask the 
hon. member.  Ought we not to have gone as far as to pass 
concrete judgment on the federal government's interventions?  Is 
it appropriate for the federal government to interfere in things 
that are none of its business? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, again I appreciate the 
question.  Here is a person who says that we should deal honestly 
with the question of child poverty.  Child poverty results from 
families who do not make enough money relative to the expenses 
they need to provide for the needs of their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government do?  It taxes them.  People making 
$20,000 a year or less for their families put $6 billion a year 
into the federal coffers.  The Liberals ought to be ashamed of 
themselves for doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe what we need to do to fight poverty is first of all to 
allow Canadians to keep some of their earnings.  Poor people are 
taxed at the highest marginal rate of anyone in the country 
because of this Conservative-Liberal regime we have been under 
for the last 30 years.  That has got to be fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also certain people who have very specific definite 
needs.  They need the help of the community, and I would say they 
absolutely have it.  However, for those who are able to work, the 
best help we can give them and the best way to fight their 
poverty is to set up an economic climate where there are so many 
jobs that they all have a job and can provide for their own 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The House has heard 
the terms of the motion moved by the parliamentary secretary. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to

unanimous consent of the House to adjourn the business of the 
House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. whip of the 
Bloc Quebecois has asked for the unanimous consent of the House

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I intend to 
preface my comments not with a quote from the executive director 
of an NPO or other community organization but with one from the 
International Monetary Fund managing director Michel Camdessus. 
He urged northern countries as well as Southern countries to 
think about the fight against poverty, which he feels must 
become the priority of all governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at what has been going on here, in this country, in 
the past few days, with the government tabling a bill that is 
essentially a duplication of the supreme court decision, we have 
the right to wonder what the government is really trying to 
achieve. It talks about a clear question without defining it 
very much. I think a question can be clear without being trivial 
or trite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It talks about a substantial majority and a qualitative 
majority. Note that this is not specified either. There is 
nothing we can do about that as democratic parliamentarians. In 
the European common market, the Maastricht treaty was passed 
with a majority of 50% plus one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is totally incredible. We are coming back from a 
parliamentary recess. If there is one member of the House who 
met people who told him it is important to discuss the 
constitutional issue, I would like to have a chat with him 
tomorrow morning in my office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Canadians are facing huge difficulties. I believe 
that, in the last 30 years, the problem in Canada, in Quebec and 
in all the regions of the country, had to do much more with the 
demagogical attitudes of some politicians, and not of all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An analysis of Canada's history in the recent past shows who was 
elected from 1968 to 1984. There was always provocation to crush 
Quebec's profound aspirations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> That is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> I will skip the years 1984 to 1993, because I 
am not at all ashamed to be a member of the Progressive 
Conservative Party. Our predecessors drove the debt from $18 to 
$200 billion. They have managed to increase it elevenfold in nine 
or ten years. We only doubled it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constitutional issue was another mess. Had the Meech Lake 
accord not been a failure, we would not be here discussing this 
issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The failure of this agreement was not co-ordinated by the 
Canadian people; it was the doing, once again, of a few 
politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, polls were conducted across the country, not only 
in Quebec, and 92% of Canadians supported the agreement. But 
some politicians, and they were not members of the Progressive 
Conservative Party, made the whole thing fail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Wells, McKenna and Chrétien. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> I am proud to be a Progressive Conservative 
because my party has always drawn on the noblest feelings of 
Canadians, including reconciliation. 
I am happy to quote our present leader, the Right Honourable Joe 
Clark, who said that the Prime Minister has been playing a 
dangerous game for the past 30 years and that he will never be 
able to hold Quebec back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever applies to Quebec also applies to Alberta and British 
Columbia. Whether in a family, a region, a province or a 
country, it is impossible to force people to remain within an 
institution against their will.  Unfortunately, we underestimate 
the impact of this bill on the subconscious of all Canadians, 
starting with that of Quebecers, but also that of our English 
speaking counterparts, because this will leave a mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a number of concerns, not only down to earth 
ones, but also profoundly existential ones. 
It is not right to monopolize the energies of all politicians in 
the country, particularly those in this House and in the 
national assembly, to discuss an issue that does not interest 
our fellow citizens at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My feeling is that this is pure provocation motivated by 
political gain because they cannot, in earnest, copy the supreme 
court decision and make us believe this is in the best interest 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my guess—I could be wrong and, if I am mistaken, my 
colleagues will let me know: the present government got 38% of 
the votes and, for it to maintain its current status, there has 
to be at least four or five opposition parties.  There has to be 
some forty members of the Bloc, the Reform Party, the NDP and 
the PC Party, and the best way to achieve that is to play that 
chord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chord still elicits a response, but I am not sure that the 
government will make it to the next election with the 1997 
scenario, two weeks before the election, when the Prime Minister 
said that 50% plus one was not enough.  We remember what 
happened in election terms.  I am sure that this government will 
not be able to draw on the same sentiments, Canadians' 
strongest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I fear at the moment is that, when most of the 
considerations and concerns of our fellow citizens have been 
improved—the concerns of our fellow citizens must be considered. 
Imagine people at home without a job, with young children, who 
have a hard time meeting the basic needs and who see us debating 
a matter of clarity and significant majority.  It is crazy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is totally embarrassing for parliamentarians who are 
supposedly responsible to agree to this debate when we realize 
that the real clarity our fellow citizens want us to debate, 
want us to take a stand on, pertains, among other things, to 
health care.  It is totally dramatic, and not only in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And all this time the government is busy talking about home care 
when we know very well the source of all the surpluses it is 
currently using to create new programs, prepare its platform and 
play wildly partisan politics.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They were eked out of measures put in place by the Progressive 
Conservatives.  With respect to the free trade agreement, which 
enabled us to increase our exports in a few years from 
$90 billion to $250 billion, have you considered the net profit 
from these trading activities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice my colleague from Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour, who 
does not have a selective memory.  He remembers very clearly the 
matter of the GST.  We have paid dearly for the matter of the 
GST.  Some members beat us because they promised to do away with 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Hypocrites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> This year, tax revenues from the GST, which 
was supposed to be abolished, will be $24 billion. The House 
should be reminded without demagoguery that the purpose of the 
GST was supposed to be to reduce taxes. Unfortunately, we did 
not remain in office long enough to complete the tax reform. 
Taxes have never been reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning the poverty issue, our party, through a committee 
that is co-chaired by my colleague for Shefford, and with the 
co-operation of the Bloc Quebecois—we should give credit where 
credit is due—has undertaken to examine seriously the issue of a 
guaranteed minimum income. The current situation is not normal, 
and we will not be content with 2%, 3%, 4% or 5% increases in 
certain small programs in the next budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the government to consider, as it is being done in 
Europe and in many other countries, the issue of the citizens' 
right to an income, commonly called the guaranteed minimum 
income. We are ready to co-operate with the government, because 
our dozens of programs are totally inefficient. We should fight 
poverty, not the poor. We are ready to co-operate on issues such 
as this one, but do not count on us to wholeheartedly endorse 
Bill C-20, which is making use of the supreme court decision as 
a means to win the next election. I could go on and on. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask the hon. Membe a question. I think I can say 
on behalf of all my colleagues from the Bloc without exception 
that we appreciate his solidarity with Quebec's interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In politics, one can respect individuals. I have always 
considered it a duty not to make debates personal. I want to ask 
our colleague whether he does not find this situation 
unacceptable for Quebec. Quebec is a nation that has a tradition 
of democracy, which goes a long way back and which is clearly 
superior to the level of democracy of our colleagues across the 
way. Throughout Quebec history, all the important changes were 
sanctioned by consultations. René Lévesque, a great democrat, 
respected the results in 1980. And we respected the results in 
1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member agree that if one was looking for an 
example of lack of respect for the rights of Quebec, the best 
candidate would be the current Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> Mr. Speaker, the least I can say is that I 
invite the minister to give second thought to the strategy 
adopted by his government in the last 30 years. The figures are 
clear. The sovereignist vote in Quebec went from 20% to 49.4%. 
What will it be next time?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government to focus less on the needs of professional 
hockey teams and on those of our banking system, which is 
closing branch after branch our regions. I ask the government to 
focus on the real issues that concern people and every family 
tonight, instead of proposing a bill which is simply redundant 
and which shows a lack of respect for the national assembly and 
for every legislative assembly in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that, in order to do productive work, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs will have to work closely with the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard a lot about social union. 
Nobody understands it. If social union can be instrumental in 
establishing a guaranteed minimum income for the poorest in our 
society, it could be a very interesting initiative for the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, and I can assure him of 
our support and our willingness to analyze this issue, which is 
presently being looked at all over the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in the United States, the Americans established an inquiry 
which decided that this was probably the way to go. They did not 
implement the report, but it does not mean it was not good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to put aside for 
a while his constitutional obsession, to work on real issues and 
to find solutions that will get the big and small regions of our 
country out of poverty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a short and rather simple question to ask my 
colleague who just spoke brilliantly and courageously. I 
congratulate him because it is not easy in a party like his to 
take such a firm position against such an unnecessary and 
divisive bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is very simple. I remember sitting with my colleague 
as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party when that 
party had many members from Quebec, and I remember that each 
time the members from Quebec took a stand within the 
Conservative Party, there was a debate. For example, I remember 
the debates on constitutional reform, on official languages 
reform, and Conservative members from Quebec courageously took a 
stand within their party to bring about some changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the member explain to me why members of the Liberal Party 
who come from Quebec have nothing better to do but than to try 
to crush Quebec instead of giving it its rightful place, as 
Conservative members from Quebec did when they were in office 
and as members of the Bloc Quebecois are doing right now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I must admit that the hon. member 
saw things in their true perspective and that he has a good 
grasp of history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has an accurate recollection of what happened and, as 
a matter of fact, positions which received the support of the 
Quebec caucus usually dealt with the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite those from the other side to reflect on the 
consequences of this bill because I am convinced that, not 
necessarily in the short run but in few years from now if there 
is another referendum, this bill will be an asset for those 
campaigning for the yes side, and I am convinced that the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs will bitterly regret what 
he has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore ask him, in a very friendly way, to withdraw this 
bill. It would be the best proof of goodwill and I ask 
unanimous consent to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. Maybe you 
were not vigilant enough. The previous speaker asked for 
unanimous consent, which we believe we have, to withdraw Bill 
C-20. The House could do so at 6.05 p.m. this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I believe I put the 
question regarding unanimous consent but that it was not given. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds—Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will share my time with the member for Davenport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to speak on this bill, which proposes to give effect to 
the requirement of clarity expressed by the supreme court in the 
reference on the secession of Quebec, because I believe that a 
referendum process leading to something as serious as the 
separation of a province must be characterized by clarity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 23, Mr. Lucien Bouchard responding to our 
government's decision to enshrine in a federal act that he could 
embark into negotiations that might lead to secession only after 
asking a clear question and obtaining a clear majority in favour 
of such a proposal, said, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this decision is indicative of the bad faith in which 
the federal government will deal with a Quebec government 
willing to negotiate after a yes vote. —The federal 
government's bad faith opens the door to a unilateral 
declaration of sovereignty. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Answering an English-speaking journalist he gave the following 
elaboration: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote:  “The doors will be wide open for a unilateral 
declaration of independence with the authority of the supreme 
court”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his comments, the Quebec premier also said, again on the 
basis of the supreme court's opinion, that our government's 
decision could strengthen the likelihood of a Quebec having 
unilaterally declared its independence being recognized by the 
international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These statements were of course welcomed by Mr. Jacques Parizeau 
who, a few days later, at a meeting of the Société 
Saint-Jean-Baptiste at Laval University, was very quick to 
congratulate his successor, praising him to the high heavens, 
which was most unusual for the former premier of Quebec, who 
never missed a chance to criticize his successor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter what some people might say, including the member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry who, on November 23 attempted to mitigate 
the effects of Mr. Bouchard's comments by stating on CBC radio, 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote:  “I don't think it was threatening a unilateral 
declaration of independence”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premier of Quebec did threaten a unilateral declaration of 
sovereignty or independence, to use the English phrase, 
depending on whether he is talking to French speaking or English 
speaking reporters, which says a lot about the meaning the PQ 
gives to the term sovereignty, in spite of all its complicated 
attempts to distinguish between sovereignty and independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premier of Quebec uses the words of the supreme court which 
suit his purpose. Let us come back to certain elements of this 
reference to see if it supports a unilateral declaration of 
sovereignty or independence or if it recognizes that 
international law confers legitimacy to a unilateral declaration 
of independence such as the one the present government of Quebec 
is threatening to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question the supreme court was asked read as follows, 
and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Constitution of Canada, can the National Assembly, 
legislature or government of Quebec effect the secession of 
Quebec from Canada unilaterally? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this question, the opinion of the court was very clear: any 
unilateral secession attempt would be illegal. The Court wrote, 
and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any attempt to effect the secession of a province from Canada 
must be undertaken pursuant to the Constitution of Canada, or 
else violate the Canadian legal order. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secession of a province requires an amendment to the 
constitution and I quote, “which per force requires 
negotiation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the decision of the supreme court establishes clearly is 
that the Quebec government should negotiate in a provincial 
government capacity, under the terms of the Canadian 
constitution, from which it draws its powers, and that it would 
not be entitled to proclaim itself the governing body of a 
sovereign or independent state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court also has to deal with the question of international 
law and the right to self-determination. In this regard, the 
court established that a unilateral secession would not likely 
be accepted in international law if it were not compatible with 
the constitution of an existing state, as it is in Canada. Let 
me quote the relevant excerpt: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A state whose government represents the whole of the people or 
peoples resident within its territory, on a basis of equality 
and without discrimination, and respects the principles of 
self-determination in its internal arrangements, is entitled to 
maintain its territorial integrity under international law and 
to have that territorial integrity recognized by other states. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the publication of the supreme court decision, the 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada said, and I 
quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of Canada will respect this decision and abide by 
it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government's decision to try and ensure the clarity of the 
question and of the results of a referendum before initiating 
negotiations on the secession of a province is totally in line 
with the decision of the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court stipulated, and I quote “There are legal grounds for 
refusing to negotiate when there is a lack of clarity.”

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, beyond these legal issues, one should bear in mind 
that a unilateral secession is also unworkable. This is not a 
simple process, as suggested by minister Jacques Brassard on 
October 12, 1997, when he said that his government would only 
have to have effective authority on the Quebec territory, 
following a unilateral declaration of independence, for 
international recognition to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the House of the thrust of a speech given by the 
intergovernmental affairs minister before members of the 
Canadian Bar Association in Montreal on March 23, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After pointing out that, in the last 30 years, the debate had 
dealt with the why of the independence, the minister dealt with 
how Quebec could go from the status of a Canadian province to 
that of a sovereign state, following a unilateral declaration of 
independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Quebec government really have the means to fulfill its 
claims? Could it assume all the functions currently performed by 
the government of Canada? As examples, the minister outlined 
some important issues. I will enumerate them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following a unilateral declaration of secession, which passport 
and which embassy services Quebecers preparing to travel abroad 
would use? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would happen to the many citizens who work for the Canadian 
government? In the absence of agreements with the Canadian 
government, would they leave their jobs to work for the Quebec 
government? What would happen to their pension plans? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the RCMP members renounce to assume the responsibilities 
conferred to them by many laws such as investigations into drug 
offences and money laundering infractions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a commercial dispute between a Quebecer and an American 
competitor, would the Quebec government, which is not a member 
of NAFTA, have access to the dispute settlement mechanisms 
provided in this agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of a close co-operation with the Canadian 
government, could the Quebec government retrieve source 
deductions such as tax deductions, employment insurance 
premiums, excise taxes and custom duties, to name but a few? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would the Quebec government keep citizens of this province 
from benefiting of services provided them by the Canadian 
government, especially since it does not itself have the means, 
the expertise or the human resources to offer them the same 
services? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can hardly predict the future but we can foresee it in the 
light of a recent transfer of the manpower training. This 
transfer was done in conditions that could be called ideal—

</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to make sure, Mr. Speaker, that you do understand what is 
at stake here, it is not that the member opposite used words that 
are inappropriate, but they were irrelevant to the debate.  More 
than that, it was contrary to what is going on actually with the 
minister of HRDC through the employment embezzlement of over $1 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually the members opposite should not talk about things. They

House, I ask that our colleague apologize because we have in 
Quebec a most competent government, far more competent than the 
one in front of us. Consequently, I am asking him to apologize 
to the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The government of 
the province of Quebec, I am sure, rests very comfortably in the 
knowledge that it has such competent defenders of its interests 
here in Ottawa, but that is still a point of debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you will see on page 244 
of Beauchesne's that there is such a thing as the indivisibility 
of the Crown principle. When the Quebec government is insulted, 
all members of parliament from Quebec are insulted too. In the 
rest of our proceedings, you should ensure that such insults— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I am very patient, but 
there are limits. The hon. member for Pierrefonds—Dollard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, had my colleagues opposite listened 
carefully, they would have realized I did not say anything 
against the Quebec government. All I wanted to say is that 
everything was done in harmony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, my remarks 
are nothing compared to those we hear from the other side. You 
are the ones who accused me of being a traitor, of having sold 
out. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I request that 
members speak to each other through the Chair.  To suggest that 
one member is calling another member a very pejorative word is 
just not appropriate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I just 
heard the member who just spoke say “traitor” and “sold out”. 
These are unparliamentary expressions and I would ask him to 
withdraw them. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I heard the form and 
the context and it was reflected toward himself.  He was not 
addressing that to anyone else. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. With 
all due respect for the hon. member, there were two violations 
of the rules. First, as you appropriately pointed out, the 
member was not speaking to you. Second, he mentioned some words 
and accused us of saying these words in reference to him and his 
colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot accept being accused of unreasonable and disrespectful 
motives such as the ones the member just attributed to us. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We dealt with the 
question of addressing each other through the Chair.  I very 
clearly heard the member for Pierrefonds—Dollard address his 
comments in a general sense; not addressing them to any one 
person specifically, but reflectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, we should have honour for the Chamber and for 
the debate that is unfolding. 
Let us use our wit and our imagination.  Let us not be mean to 
each other.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, a unilateral declaration 
of independence would be illegal, not recognized internationally 
and impossible to implement, to name just three of the many 
reasons behind our government's decision to define the 
prerequisites to any negotiations for the secession of a 
province.

</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And more than 15 members having risen:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Fifteen or more 
members having risen to object, the motion is deemed to have been

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have a simple question for the member for Pierrefonds—Dollard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he try to tell us, as the Prime Minister did today, that 
the clarity bill applies to all provinces in Canada?  If it 
does, and if it is a bill that is intended to ensure the clarity 
of the question in the event of a referendum on secession, can 
he tell us which other provinces intend, like Quebec, to become 
independent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the hon. member 
for Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert for her question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian parliament's legislation applies to all Canadians 
not just to one people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is simply a bill on clarity and 
its purpose is to follow up on the opinion of the Supreme Court 
of Canada. This opinion said that the political stakeholders 
must determine what is a clear majority vote on a clear 
question given the circumstances under which a future 
referendum could be held.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, it is very simple, no province should be specified. As far 
as I am concerned, the province of Quebec will not secede, there 
will not be another referendum and we will live in harmony.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I understood the hon. member wanted to share his 
time with some other member. I do not want members opposite to 
think that I am that other member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will first make a comment and then put a question to the hon. 
member opposite. If I understood well the proposal he made 
earlier, he wishes us to deal with the bill on the clarity 
tonight during the night shift. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> In the dark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> They want to enlighten the House but they 
want to do so stealthily, after normal working hours, when no 
one will follow the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a way, this is what the hon. member proposes to do. They 
refuse to let the committee travel to meet Quebecers and hear 
their views on the goal of the act, its contents and its 
effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we say that the act is for all Canadians, I believe it 
entails that we should travel to the nine other provinces and 
the territories also. I would like to know the opinion of the 
hon. member about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noted something else in the member's speech and I hope that 
other members will use different arguments to defend the bill on 
clarity, rather than using arguments saying that the Quebec 
government does not have the capacity to assume functions like 
passports and similar functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read the speech of the member. It smacks of colonialism. 
It is as if they are the only ones able to do something. Now, 
Quebecers are precisely asking to take charge of their own 
affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same issue exists with natives. Natives want to take their 
future into their own hands. What answer do they get? “No, 
you're not good enough”. 
This is the attitude of this government. I cannot believe it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, in reply to my colleague, the 
hon. member for Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, I will 
say first of all that the member knows as well as I do that the 
legislative committee will be the one to decide if the committee 
will travel or if witnesses will come here to Ottawa. Therefore, 
we will leave that decision to the chair of the legislative 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the hon. member asked me questions saying that it was an 
issue of clarity and that he wanted some clarification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, the purpose of the bill now before us is clarity. I think 
that all Quebecers have the right to demand clarity, and that 
includes aboriginal people and each and every Quebecer without 
exception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill basically explains what clarity means. 
I was with the hon. member for Beauharnois—Salaberry recently 
when someone asked him what is a clear question; he replied that 
a clear question is “Do you want Quebec to separate from Canada 
yes or no?”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a clear question, and I look forward to hearing my hon. 
colleagues tell us the exact same thing in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is now 6.29 p.m. We know 
that the debates must be adjourned at 6.30 p.m. You have the 
power to decide what time it is and move the clock forward by 
one minute and, voilà, we will resume debate in a coherent 
manner, with a whole period of time ahead of us, when the 
government sees it fit. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is a very 
generous attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go into the final stage I would like to just say a word 
of thanks to the translators.  I know how difficult it is, 
particularly to translate my French.  I think they have done a 
marvellous job and I thank them very much. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 6.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.)
