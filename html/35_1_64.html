Mr. Speaker, later today I will have the honour of leading a 
delegation of veterans to Italy. This pilgrimage will mark the 
50th anniversary of the Italian campaign of the second world 
war.
<P>
	Veterans from across the country representing all of the 
regiments and units which participated in the campaign will 
travel with me to sites throughout Italy. Together we will retrace 
the steps of Canadians who fought for democracy in Italy 
between 1943 and 1945 and pay tribute to those who gave their 
lives for freedom.
<P>
	The story of the Canadians in Italy is a special chapter in our 
history. The first Canadians stepped on to the beaches on July 
10, 1943. Well planned and decisive, the successful allied 
landings in Sicily marked an important turning point in the 
cause of freedom.
<P>
	Then came 20 long gruelling months of fighting in which our 
troops proved themselves time and time again-Ortona, Monte 
Cassino, the Liri Valley and the push to the Lombardy plains and 
the industrial north of Italy. These fierce battles tested our 
Canadians fully and in every case our troops showed their 
exceptional ability and determination. Their proud record 
brought them respect from friend and foe alike.
<P>
	All three of our services saw action in the Italian campaign. 
The flotillas of the Royal Canadian Navy successfully brought 
our troops ashore and, together with the merchant navy, kept 
them well supplied. The Royal Canadian Air Force provided 
vital air support, bombing strategic enemy positions. The 
infantry and armoured divisions of the Canadian Army renewed 
our country's reputation as the home of courageous and 
accomplished soldiers. The ``red patches'' of our Canadian 
Infantry Corps were some of the toughest troops in Italy.
<P>
	Our troops left Italy and went on to northwestern Europe 
where they gained further honours in liberating Holland. But in 
Italy the important role they played in driving back the German 
army contributed to the downfall of the Third Reich.
<P>
	I ask all members of the House to pay a very special tribute to 
the Canadian veterans of Italy who 50 years ago helped return 
freedom to Europe and brought such great honour to our country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like first of all to thank the Secretary of State for Veterans for 
taking the trouble to pass on to me, within a reasonable time, the 
text of his statement.
<P>
	As the Official Opposition critic, I will be privileged to be 
part of that pilgrimage which will take us to Italy, in order to 
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the campaign to free 
Europe from Nazi control, a campaign in which Canada 
participated.
<P>
	Certainly Canada must remember the incalculable price that 
the world had to pay in order to protect rights and freedoms. It 
must remember those efforts that were made in that terrible war, 
even at the cost of our innocent citizens' life. Veterans are still 
here to remind us of the courage that they showed in those 
events. So I agree with the Secretary of State that it is important 
to make sure that those events are never forgotten.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	Canada also has other duties toward its veterans. It must never 
forget the situation that they are living in today. It seems to me 
that their living conditions should be of prime importance, since 
that is the best way for us to show our gratitude to those who 
fought for the preservation of these values and these collective 
interests. If it is essential to commemorate our veterans' 
achievements, it is even more essential to guarantee them decent 
living conditions.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is proud to salute all these people who 
made sure, 50 years ago, that Italy found the road to freedom.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to congratulate the secretary of state for veterans affairs 
for taking the lead in organizing this, if I may, pilgrimage to 
Italy to recognize the contribution of the Canadian forces who 
participated in the Italian campaign.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3916"> 3916 </A></B>
<P>
	As has been mentioned, the Canadians landed in Sicily at 
Pachino Beach on July 10, 1943. After having assisted in the 
conquering of Sicily, they moved up the Italian peninsula. They 
were involved in the downfall of the famous Gustav line. On 
May 11 they commenced the attack on the Gustav line and four 
days later it collapsed.
<P>
	They moved on to the Hitler line and on May 23 they breached 
the line with the loss of 1,000 casualties. This enabled the allied 
forces to combine with the American forces who had landed at 
Anzio, just south of Rome prior to that. This campaign for the 
first time saw a Canadian corps in the field commanded by a 
Canadian general, in this case, General E.L.M. Burns who later 
became famous as the commander of the first peacekeeping 
force recommended by Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson.
<P>
	Moving up the Italian peninsula, the Canadians fought with 
great determination and great capability. At the Guthic line just 
south of Rimini on August 25, it took them five days to break 
through this last foothold before they moved into the plains of 
Lombardy.
<P>
	By 1945 the Italian campaign had pinned down 27 German 
divisions and unquestionably had a great impact on the outcome 
of the war with D-Day. During the Italian campaign, some 
92,757 Canadians served in the Italian campaign. Of those 
5,500-plus were killed, 20,000 were wounded and 1,000 were 
taken prisoner.
<P>
	Canada won three VCs, Victoria Crosses, the highest 
commendation during that campaign: Captain Paul Triquet of 
the Royal 22nd Regiment, Major Mahony of the Westminster 
Regiment and Private E.A. Smokey Smith of the Seaforth 
Highlanders.
<P>
	It is not only appropriate that this return to honour and 
commemorate the Canadians who participated in the Italian 
campaign should be done, but it is appropriate that all parties 
should be represented in it. This is non-political. It is a 
Canadian venture and I commend the secretary and the members 
of the party who are going to Italy. It is not only right but fitting 
that Canadians remember the Italian campaign.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve) </B>moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for its unacceptable delays in 
developing and implementing a genuine strategy for the conversion of the 
defence industries to civilian production, which would save and create new jobs 
in high technology sectors.</BLOCKQUOTE>
At the outset, Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the House that 
if the Official Opposition has felt necessary to use its allotted 
day to deal with industrial conversion mechanisms and propose 
solutions, as the government will see, it is because we believe 
there really is a feeling of urgency. The reason why I raise this 
feeling of urgency is that we remember that 10,000 jobs have 
been lost in Quebec in the sole sector of defence material 
production and in the sector of arms production and that as many 
and even more have disappeared in the rest of Canada, where it 
is said that 47,000 jobs have been lost since 1987.
<P>
	Despite the stagnation of markets, despite the urgency of the 
situation, the government is making no progress. This 
government, in spite of its commitments, and we will come back 
to that, has given no real indication of its will to go ahead in that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3917"> 3917 </A></B>
<P>
sector. There was no indication  whatsoever in the Speech from 
the Throne, nor was there anything in the Budget brought down 
recently.
<P>
	Of course, the difficulties that the defence material and arms 
industries are facing encompass much more than the national 
market. We of the Official Opposition are well aware, because 
we are responsible members, that the difficulties result from 
changes which have taken place in the international order. What 
kind of reality are we talking about when we deal with arms 
production? We are talking here about an international market 
worth $450 billion. Evidently, the streamlining, the adjustments 
made in these markets affect not only Canada but also Europe 
and the United States. I think it would be useful to point out that 
since 1987, Europe has lost 600,000 jobs in that sector and the 
United States 700,000. If you add that to the Canadian reality, it 
is easy to understand that the change is world-wide.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	This is even more of a concern because jobs lost in the area of 
armament or defence production are high technology jobs; many 
studies show that jobs found in the area of defence equipment 
and military weapon production generally are better-paying for 
the employees. It is even said that these jobs pay 36 per cent 
more than comparable jobs in civilian industry.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the causes of that streamlining are well-known. 
It began with the fall of the Berlin wall, which had been the 
symbol of the cold war for two generations. Because of the cold 
war various nation-states, including Canada, ratified a number 
of treaties providing for a limitation of the production of both 
nuclear arsenals and conventional weaponry. It is easy to 
understand that limitation treaties mean less contracts for 
producers.
<P>
	Let us take as an example our neighbour to the south. Five or 
six years ago, when George Bush was President, the Pentagon 
was told to prepare for a significant reduction of its purchasing 
power. Even though it was the main source of defence contracts, 
the Pentagon will nevertheless have its purchasing power 
reduced by 27 per cent between 1993 and 1997. Of course, the 
whole thing will impact on Canada and Quebec since we are 
closely linked to the American defence market.
<P>
	We must note also that arms deliveries to Third World 
countries dropped by more than 61 per cent between 1988 and 
1992. Up to now, rationalization efforts have mainly focused on 
ground-based systems. Contracts for such systems dropped by 
about 77 per cent. Also, naval contracts, for which Quebec had 
some expertise, were reduced by 26 per cent. Thirdly, the 
aviation industry, with an important production centre based in 
Montreal, registered a 23 per cent drop in its contracts.
<P>
	This is why the government should urgently propose a real 
conversion strategy. We should not forget-and we will keep 
reminding the government and the people listening to us-that 
while I speak, jobs are being lost and, despite the disappearance 
of tens of thousands of them, the government has not offered the 
slightest help, it did not propose anything to companies willing 
and even anxious to undergo conversion.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it might seem strange, but Canada, a medium 
power, a peace-loving country, which never was the main 
belligerent in any war, was nevertheless an important producer 
of arms and auxiliary equipment. In fact, Canada ranks eighth in 
the world when it comes to arms production.
<P>
	As for arms exports, we are ranked fourteenth in the world. I 
mentioned the difficulties experienced by the American market, 
and this is very relevant for Canada and Quebec since 70 per cent 
of the Canadian production of arms and military equipment is 
sold on international markets, and 80 per cent of that on the 
American market.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, the situation is worrisome, it is here to stay and it 
is structural. We cannot pretend that Canadian and Quebec 
defence industries are going through a temporary crisis. All 
indications point to a structural crisis caused both by the 
international situation and problems more specific to North 
America.
<P>
	If the Official Opposition chose to have this debate, it is not 
only because the stakes are very high for English Canada, but 
mostly because the streamlining process is of the utmost 
importance for Quebec.
<P>
	It concerns Quebec to the highest degree since there are some 
650 companies, either prime contractors or subcontractors, 
which are directly involved in contracts awarded by the 
Department of National Defence. Quebec firms had gained 
expertise in four specific areas, namely communications 
electronics, aerospace, shipbuilding, and ammunition.
<P>
	In spite of this expertise-which had been developed mainly 
through DIPP as we will see later-and Quebec's know-how in 
the four sectors I just mentioned, 10,000 jobs have been lost in 
Quebec since 1987, due partly to the international situation. As 
you can appreciate, the loss of 10,000 jobs in a market like 
Quebec is, to all intents and purposes, absolutely catastrophic. I 
say catastrophic, because these jobs, as was mentioned earlier, 
are in the high-tech field and if the conversion program is not 
implemented, there is no indication that Quebec will ever get 
them back.
<P>
	As a member from Montreal, one of, if not the nicest city and 
region in all of Quebec and Canada, I must point out that the 
Island of Montreal is the centre of defence arms and materiel 
production.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3918"> 3918 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I want to back up my statements and focus on 
specifics, so that the government cannot accuse us of being 
vague and of not basing our demands on concrete facts. As you 
know, I have always made it my duty when speaking in this 
House to deal in specifics. Therefore, the following facts are 
for the benefit of the Minister of Industry who is honouring us 
with his presence today and who, I am told, will be taking part 
later in the debate. I would like to remind him that Montreal 
is affected most of all by the current crisis since 60 per cent 
of all contracts awarded either go to or are carried out in the 
Montreal area.
<P>
	For example, between 1987 and 1992, a total of 15,000 
sole-source contracts were awarded annually to the Montreal 
region. For those who are familiar with this issue, and I could 
name names because there are people in Quebec who have 
studied the conversion question, Montreal is considered the 
leading centre of military production in Canada, accounting for 
26 per cent of all contracts awarded in the country.
<P>
	We are shocked, saddened, worried to see the Montreal 
region, a region which has had its share of hardship these past 
few years-Montreal was said in the committee on social 
programs reform to have become the capital of poverty-suffer 
a 40 per cent overall decrease in economic activity from the 
defence industry over the past six years, while for the whole of 
Quebec, the decrease was 25 per cent.
<P>
	So, there is a sense of urgency, an urgency that makes all the 
more unacceptable the attitude and inaction of a government the 
intentions of which in that respect are yet to be known.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	But, in the past, back in the days when they were in 
opposition, the Liberals, the big guns of this government, had 
made firm commitments in terms of reconversion. They were 
aware of the need and supported this necessary transition. This 
transition stage is required because the good old days when 
governments could award lavish defence equipment contracts 
are gone, for ever.
<P>
	If I may, I would like to quote three former members of Her 
Majesty's loyal opposition who had endorsed wholeheartedly 
the conversion process, but now seem conspicuously silent. I am 
referring to the current Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Mr. Axworthy, the current Defence Committee 
Chairman, Mr. Rompkey, who was the opposition's Defence 
critic at the time, and Mr. Jim Peterson, who was their Industry 
critic.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order! I would simply 
like to remind all members that whenever they refer to other 
members, the proper practice is to call them by their official 
titles, for example parliamentary secretary, or member for 
such-and-such a riding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize for this breach of 
order. But you will still allow me to quote these three members 
whose constituencies I do not remember.
<P>
	These people were saying, ``We must expand the mandate of 
Industry, Science and Technology Canada's $200 million DIPP 
from developing defence technology to helping the industry 
convert and diversify into areas such as environmental 
technologies and high-tech peacekeeping technologies''.
<P>
	That is smart thinking, Mr. Speaker. And that is what we in the 
Official Opposition are demanding. We are telling the 
government that there is an urgent need to act on defence 
conversion and that this could be done by adjusting a program 
not currently used for conversion. However, if the government's 
intentions are serious, there is a program that would allow us to 
make conversion budgets available to businesses. It is the DIPP 
or Defence Industry Productivity Program.
<P>
	We must never forget that this program, which in fact has 
promoted research and development, has been in place for over 
20 years. It enabled businesses to conduct market studies and 
refine technologies mostly aimed at the defence industry. We 
think that the program which kept Canadian industries 
somewhat dependent on defence markets should now help them 
to pull through.
<P>
	We say to the government that DIPP, which already had large 
budgets, $300 million in good years, but today it is more like 
$225 million, we say to the government that this is the vehicle to 
use. We will not accept an argument that DIPP is already being 
used for conversion. Because if they tell us that, we say to the 
government, ``If this vehicle is really being used for conversion, 
come with us and meet various companies in the Montreal area 
that are having these problems. You will see that with these 
funds, they cannot really convert.''
<P>
	We say to the government that any conversion solution must 
involve regionalization, given the obvious fact that Canada's 
military industries vary enormously from one region to another. 
Each region has developed its own military specializations, so 
that each regional specialization has its own needs.
<P>
	Obviously, an industry that makes munitions will not have the 
same needs, the same process, the same expectations for 
conversion as one that makes telecommunication satellites, for 
example. The Canadian reality is that each region has developed 
a very specific type of defence equipment production.
<P>
	We must keep in mind that this debate is about the future and 
shows how forward-looking the Official Opposition is. I see my 
colleague opposite nodding and I am pleased to see that he 
agrees that we see things right.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	One must never forget that conversion is a medium-term 
process, lasting five, six, or seven years. Now is the time to lay 
the groundwork for conversion. We must recognize that certain 
regions are further ahead  than others in their reflection process, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3919"> 3919 </A></B>
<P>
because they know, and this is a basic point to keep in mind, that 
no conversion is possible without hard and constant 
co-operative work. In Quebec, we have come quite a long way in 
this regard.
<P>
	We have come a long way with this co-operative work 
because, immediately following the recession of 1981, this 
approach to economic recovery was taken into consideration by 
the major players in Quebec, including the labour unions, 
starting with the CNTU, which just this last year organized a 
seminar on the subject. Even the Conseil du patronat, which can 
hardly be suspected of having any sympathy for sovereignty, 
apparently has easy access to ministers. There is also the current 
Quebec government; we are not talking here about some obscure 
future separatist government, but rather about a conventional 
federalist government ready for commitment, and which is 
asking the federal government to give its businesses access to 
available funds for conversion.
<P>
	The government will have no choice because of the direct 
relationship that exists. That is precisely what the Official 
Opposition is attempting to show today, namely that there is a 
direct connection between the dependency of Quebec businesses 
on defence industries and the lay-offs now taking place.
<P>
	I will give you six very real examples which should prompt 
the government to act much more speedily than it has up until 
now. I could have given about 50 examples, but I will only 
mention six, because of the limited time at my disposal.
<P>
	Between 1990 and 1994, Bendix Avelex, an avionics company 
which depends on the military market for 70 per cent of its 
production, laid off 35 employees. As you will see, the more 
dependent companies are on the military market, the more 
massive are the lay offs.
<P>
	Expro, which you will soon hear about in great detail, since 
the hon. member representing the region concerned will later 
make a presentation, makes ammunition. That company is also 
dependent on the military market for 70 per cent of its 
production and laid off 300 employees.
<P>
	Héroux, an aeronautics firm, is dependent on the military 
market for 80 per cent of its production and had to lay off 131 
people.
<P>
	MIL Davie, which is well-known and which we talked about 
several times in this House, depends on the military market for 
91 per cent of its production and laid off 2,740 employees-yes, 
Mr. Speaker, 2,740. This is unacceptable! It is a shame and a 
social disaster!
<P>
	Oerlikon, which is well known, builds ground-based and 
missile systems. It is 100 per cent dependent on the military and 
had to let go 410 employees. As for Paramax, it is 100 per cent 
dependent and it laid off 1,000 people.
<P>
	I do not know if the Minister of Industry is as shaken as I am, 
but I can hear him. I share his feeling of helplessness and I offer 
him my co-operation and that of the Official Opposition. We are 
telling this government that action is urgently needed. Stop 
procrastinating and let us work together; we, the Official 
Opposition, are willing to co-operate.
<P>
	In the past, government members have said that we were only 
concerned by issues affecting Quebec, that we did not have a 
national vision and that we did not truly assumed our role. Now, 
this is an issue which concerns all regions of Canada, and 
particularly Quebec. And what we are saying is that, if the 
government is really serious about this, it should recognize that 
it does have that instrument, which, if improved, could help us 
to truly support businesses that really want to proceed with a 
conversion process. And let me remind those who are listening 
to this debate that this instrument is the Defence Industry 
Production Program or DIPP. We will see how serious the 
government is, since important budgets are involved in this 
program; we are speaking of $225 million.
<P>
	For the program to be efficient, this budget must take into 
account local factors as well as local stakeholders, the main 
people concerned, who must work together and cooperate to 
achieve conversion.
<P>
	You indicate to me that my time is up, Mr. Speaker. I simply 
want to tell the government that we want nothing more than to 
co-operate on this issue because we truly and honestly believe 
that time is of the essence.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I begin by saying through you to the 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve that we welcome this 
debate today and we welcome the spirit and tone that he has put 
forward in his remarks. We too are going to be constructive and 
specific in responding.
<P>
	By the way, I do share the hon. member's view that his riding 
in Montreal is one of the most beautiful parts of our country. 
One day when he comes to Toronto he will share the view that I 
have of my city.
<P>
	The conversion of military technology to peacetime use is 
something to which we in this government are committed. The 
member cited many examples of how people through layoffs, et 
cetera, were in a disastrous state, unemployed, highly skilled 
people. We are aware of that. We are moving.
<P>
	We have to expand our thinking and maybe look at new types 
of instruments to help in this conversion. I want to give a 
specific example. Amortek is a company in Stratford, Ontario, 
that made military fire trucks. About a year and a half ago the 
need for military fire trucks was really not there. It converted to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3920"> 3920 </A></B>
<P>
making an  environmental garbage truck that handles wet, dry, 
and recyclable garbage all in one unit.
<P>
	It used its skilled labour to do the conversion. It did not get 
any grant money from the Government of Canada. What it did 
was enhance its marketing team by one or two people and 
participated in a few more trade shows in South America and the 
United States. It used the resources of the Export Development 
Corporation for credit lines and guarantees and a combination of 
those instruments, plus its banks are becoming a little bit more 
receptive to this type of environmental technology that is 
exportable. Right now the company has so many orders it cannot 
fill them.
<P>
	I think it important that we communicate to those people who 
are in this conversion mode that they cannot just rely on the old 
system of funding because we are in a very difficult fiscal 
framework and we have all acknowledged that. I know the 
member acknowledges that.
<P>
	Could the member not see that we could use the existing 
instruments like the Export Development Corporation, the 
chartered banks and some of the new creative funds they have 
and the enhanced marketing services of the export marketing 
development unit of the department of the minister of trade. 
Maybe through a little bit more creative thinking we could 
bridge that transition and that could help us get people back to 
work a little more quickly without adding further to the deficit 
and debt.
<P>
	Could he consider that as a possible option?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, as you know, it is always a 
pleasure to debate with the member opposite, probably the most 
faithful listener I have, but I think the hon. member is mistaken 
on several counts. First of all, I specifically stated, at the 
beginning of my speech, that the tightening of the market is 
closely linked to international conditions. Now, I feel the 
question put by the hon. member is somewhat partisan, since it 
implies that the businesses I talked about are a little passive, that 
they depend on the government and are not really unhappy about 
the whole situation.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	I found that a bit strange, Mr. Speaker. Do you not think that a 
business which has been operating on a specific market and 
which has to lay off 600, 700, 800, 900, or 1,000 workers would 
have, all by itself, considered developing a strategy plan to find 
some new niches and some new markets?
<P>
	In fact, in some cases, businesses have, on their own, 
presented the government with a conversion plan. In a number 
of cases, the government was provided with conversion plans, 
and there is supporting material to prove it. However, according 
to professor Bélanger, whom I hope the hon. member will have 
the privilege to  meet some day, there are structural obstacles to 
conversion.
<P>
	First, in many cases, these firms do not know the new markets 
as well as the ones they used to operate on. Very often, in order 
to proceed with the conversion process, they need to change 
their production technology, which requires significant capital 
expenditures, something they cannot always afford.
<P>
	But should this whole debate not rather deal with the fact that 
the DIPP, for historical reasons which cannot be denied, tried to 
maintain in a state of dependency a number of businesses 
involved in research and development in the military sector? Is 
it not socially responsible for the Official Opposition to 
argue-notwithstanding trade fairs, which I know the hon. 
member likes a lot-that there will be no conversion without a 
comprehensive approach, without the government's support?
<P>
	Nobody says that that conversion process has to be the 
exclusive responsibility of business; no company says that 
either. Professor Bélanger interviewed people from over 80 
companies. They are ready to play their part, they are aware that 
there is an element of strategic planning involved, and they also 
know that it is incumbent upon them to take the first step. No 
company denies that.
<P>
	But we have to recognize that the government has a 
responsibility. It must take a comprehensive approach to this 
issue, provide a tool that will give impetus to the process and 
make funds available because of the studies that often have to be 
conducted. I am not talking here about annual funding. I am 
talking about funding a process over five to seven years.
<P>
	I partly agree with my hon. colleague, and I will conclude my 
remarks by saying that, yes, businesses must take the initiative 
of looking for new markets, but they have the right to expect the 
government to provide them with a tool, and we are telling the 
government that the tool they need is the DIPP.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I would 
like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve for the soundness of his remarks.
<P>
	We, in the Bloc Quebecois, consider the conversion of 
defence industries to be of great importance and we think that 
government members too, when sitting in the opposition, 
believed that to be important. It seems that changing sides in the 
House also means suddenly changing argument.
<P>
	So I have a question for my hon. colleague. I would like him to 
explain the position of the Bloc Quebecois and also the different 
stages it would be important to go through. Government 
members opposite keep saying they want to listen; so I hope that 
at some point, after we have explained to them one last time 
what it is they should do, they will stop listening and finally take 
action.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3921"> 3921 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve has only a few minutes left. He 
should keep his answer short.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, in school I was always told I had 
an exceptional talent to sum things up. My colleague is quite 
right when he says we should remind the government that three 
main steps should be taken.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, is the hon. member across the way trying to 
interfere systematically so I have less time to give my answer? 
So, there are three main steps.
<P>
	First of all, the government should make tools available to 
businesses which, in many cases, have specific conversion plans 
in mind.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I do not understand what the minister is saying.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I regret to interrupt the 
member, but the period reserved for questions and comments is 
now over. The Hon. Minister of Industry has the floor on debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when the hon. member suggests that we make tools available to 
these companies, what he really means is a cheque book. That 
perhaps is where I should begin.
<P>
	I would like to make a few general remarks about what the 
hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve has said this 
morning. I do welcome this debate. It is an opportunity for us to 
talk about an important aspect of industrial policy, that being 
defence conversion, but I want to put it in the broader context.
<P>
	I have a few comments though arising from the hon. 
member's remarks. First of all, let me say how pleased I am that 
the Bloc Quebecois members are interested in talking about 
defence conversion. Realizing that their political objective is to 
create a new country, one which would have no army, navy or air 
force, one would have expected they would be anticipating 
massive expenditures on defence itself. If they succeed in their 
objective they may as well anticipate that. Therefore defence 
conversion is not what they should be concerned about, but in 
fact the creation of a defence industry.
<P>
	Second, it occurs to me from listening to his remarks that he 
described the loss of jobs in this sector as a social catastrophe. I 
agree with him, if he means that any unemployment is 
catastrophic to the persons involved.
<P>
	We have experienced over the last number of years many job 
losses in Canada in many sectors. We have seen it most recently 
in the fisheries in Atlantic Canada. We have seen it, although it 
is recovering well right now, in the automotive sector in 
Ontario. We have seen it in industries in western Canada. As we 
live at the moment with 11.5 per cent unemployment, 1.5 
million Canadians out of work, for those people it is a 
catastrophe.
<P>
	I suggest however it is no greater catastrophe for those in the 
defence industry than for those in any other industry. What we 
really are talking about-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I know that 
members feel very strongly about these issues. Of course this is 
the place for that debate to take place, but I think we all want to 
do it in such a fashion that we maintain the respect of all our 
constituents.
<P>
	In all fairness to members on either side of the House, given 
the strong views, I would ask members to allow one another to 
debate and I will do my utmost to maintain that debate in the 
most respectful fashion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have three children at home. I am 
used to talking when others are talking, so it is not really a 
problem for me and there are children here too.
<P>
	The other comment I make arising out of the remarks of the 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is the notion which 
appears to underlie his basic thesis which is that we should give 
money to individual firms in order to assist them in converting.
<P>
	He mentions DIPP and that is an important tool of industrial 
development. In fact it has historically given money to firms. As 
we revise DIPP, and I will say more about this in a few moments, 
what we have been doing is essentially making DIPP a 
refundable, repayable contribution to assist firms in developing 
products for markets.
<P>
	There is quite a distinction between a strategic approach to an 
industrial sector and one which focuses on bailing out particular 
firms by writing cheques for taxpayers' money.
<P>
	As we talk about defence conversion most members will agree 
that what we have here is a very complex process. I do not think 
there are simple answers or formulas. Furthermore Canada's 
position with respect to defence conversion is unique among 
industrialized nations. The hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and many of his colleagues need to 
be informed about exactly what it is we are attempting to do. Let 
me try to provide some perspective on just where we are coming 
from in Canada in this area of industrial conversion.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	In the red book we stated that many opportunities are 
available for industries which recognize and exploit the trends 
in global markets. We knew that the time had come to help 
defence industries to make the transition from high tech military 
production to high tech civilian production.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3922"> 3922 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are determined to achieve this objective. For that matter, 
we have made great progress in developing an effective strategy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our defence conversion program has three major 
components: first, redefining Canada's defence policy; second, 
rationalizing the military infrastructure in Canada; and third, 
rationalizing the defence industrial base. Really what we are 
talking about here is the third of these points, rationalizing the 
defence industrial base.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our defence industry is largely composed of fully diversified 
businesses, most of which depend only moderately on military 
markets. For these businesses, the rationalization of our defence 
sector does not pose major problems. Sales of military material 
will be maintained at a relatively high level, but companies like 
CAE Electronics, Canadair and Spar will be able to make gains 
on both commercial and military markets.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have a second group of companies capable of further 
diversification. These companies have the technology, skills 
and the manufacturing base to achieve long term growth in 
non-military markets. However, they may need assistance in 
analysing the most advantageous areas for diversification. This 
is where a broadening of the criteria for the defence industry 
productivity program, DIPP, will be particularly applicable.
<P>
	We have a third group of companies. They are the strong niche 
players in the global military market. They fully expect to 
continue to grow and prosper in this market and nothing will be 
gained from attempting to discourage this growth. While they 
may remain primarily defence oriented they nonetheless are 
innovative and contribute to the advancement of technology 
which often leads to substantial commercial applications.
<P>
	Finally, we have a fourth group of companies whose futures 
are very much in doubt. These are companies that are heavily 
dependent upon the domestic defence market, companies with 
little or no readily commercialized technologies. They have 
little export potential and may not be able to compete in the 
international marketplace. Conversion for these companies 
would likely be cost prohibitive and their futures must be 
managed on a case by case basis.
<P>
	While we can make predictions about each of these groups of 
companies and their future prospects for growth and 
diversification, there are very few certainties. What it really 
boils down to is the fact that the future of defence companies in 
Canada will hinge on the defence market itself and the ability of 
companies to diversify into other product lines.
<P>
	The future demands of the domestic defence market will not 
really become clear until we have completed a defence review. 
That is not something which is done overnight or even over a 
couple of months.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is clear that we cannot wait for the completion of the 
defence sector review. Canadian businesses cannot wait. We are 
all very well aware of the fact that competition is intensifying on 
international markets; no one can afford to wait for the results of 
a review to be published. Therefore, the government must go 
ahead, resolutely.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our main objective is to reduce the dependence of Canadian 
firms on defence sales. We want to encourage a greater focus on 
research and development, on dual use technologies to support 
product development and on improving market access.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	In pursuit of these objectives there are a number of principles 
that I believe will guide us toward success.
<P>
	First, the process must be industry led. It only makes sense 
that industry is in the best position to determine how it will meet 
the challenges and recognize the opportunities presented by 
defence conversion. There is a role for government in all of this, 
and it is a very important role. The government can facilitate 
that conversion by providing some assistance in identifying 
market opportunities and removing barriers to growth.
<P>
	Second, defence conversion should not imply massive 
subsidies. There is no room for bailouts, for attempting to rescue 
companies that have suffered through market disruptions. 
Simply put, such an approach would be fiscally irresponsible 
and in the long term would do no one any good. What resources 
the government does have at its disposal-and I do not think I 
need remind anyone in the House that those resources are 
limited-should be focused on support for entering new 
promising markets. They should be focused on innovative 
projects and initiatives that will continue to contribute to 
economic growth and the creation of high value employment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government is aware that its primary responsibility is to 
the citizens of this country, the taxpayers of Canada. They would 
not accept massive financial help programs because it would go 
against the present thrust which is to try and reduce our huge 
deficit. But, they need not worry about that, the government will 
not launch such programs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To that end we will be utilizing to the extent possible existing 
programs. That does not mean they will be infused with a flood 
of new funding. We are looking at what works, what does not 
work, and what can work better. We are asking industry to be 
innovative, and we intend to be equally innovative in the design 
of policy and program initiatives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3923"> 3923 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If we ask the Canadian industry to diversify its activities, if 
we exert pressure to achieve conversion, we must help 
companies respond to the needs of the military as well as the 
requirements of the commercial markets.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In order to do this we will work to introduce early into the 
procurement process industry views that can shape 
specifications to meet military requirements and diversify into 
production for commercial requirements.
<P>
	Simply put, there is no room for the one-off, one of a kind 
military products of the past. No one can afford them. They do 
not fit into any logical equation for promoting competitiveness, 
innovation and economic growth.
<P>
	It is no secret that governments, any governments, are always 
ripe for a little simplification of procedures and administration. 
This is an area we are looking at very closely. It is an area where 
changes will have to be made. The system as it exists now in 
Canada makes it difficult, if not impossible, for companies to 
support efforts in both military and commercial markets.
<P>
	In fact the U.S. is already moving in this area and we will be 
following in the same direction.
<P>
	I have a couple of final points to make, if I may. In no way do 
we intend to pursue a course that is defence conversion merely 
for the sake of defence conversion. By that I mean that the 
government has no intention of subsidizing the conversion of 
defence industries into commercial activities and commercial 
sectors that are already effectively serviced by existing firms. 
This is one of the dangers in the argument that was being made 
by my friend from Hochelaga.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I will not go any further into that, but I will just point out that 
when people try and criticize the government for not doing 
enough to help defence industries switch to civilian production, 
their arguments only underline the fact that this is a complex 
question, that many did not take the time to research fully.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	No one gains when the end result of conversion is oversupply 
in another commercial sector. In fact the results would likely be 
more damaging than they would have been had there been no 
conversion effort at all.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, job creation is still an absolute priority of the 
government and yes, certainly, the process of conversion of 
defence industries could result in the creation of new and very 
interesting jobs. However, we should not forget that this will 
lead to disruptions within the labour force. The market will take 
care of some of the affected workers and many of the highly 
qualified defence industry workers will find jobs in other 
sectors.
<P>
	There is no doubt, however, that there will be some problems 
with less qualified workers. In those cases, to help the workers 
involved, the government will use, as much as possible, its 
industrial and community adjustment programs as well as 
programs geared to human resources.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I only mention this because it is an element of the whole 
question of defence conversion that is often ignored by those 
who wish to give advice or criticize. There are some knowledge 
gaps out there. There may be some knowledge gaps in the 
House. Over the course of the debate I hope we can perhaps fill 
some in.
<P>
	For my part I am eager to hear the recommendations and 
suggestions of opposition members on this matter, especially 
those who have within their constituencies companies or sectors 
that have been affected by the changes in the international 
environment, particularly with respect to defence acquisition.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I should add that when we talk about the private sector we 
should remember that the shareholders and the managers of the 
companies also have obligations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Shareholders and managers of companies have an obligation 
to invest in their own strategic development, to invest in 
marketing and to foresee changes that are coming.
<P>
	We stand here today in 1994, almost five years after the Berlin 
wall fell. The fact that companies in the defence sector face 
significant challenges should not come as a surprise this year or 
last year to those companies. Government is prepared to work 
with companies that are trying to make conversions, trying to 
develop products that have dual use, or trying to find new 
markets for their goods.
<P>
	Let us never lose sight of the fact that governments do not 
solve problems for firms. Firms, individual enterprises and 
individual shareholders have a big responsibility to help solve 
their own problems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will try to keep my cool, but it will not be easy. I will 
do it out of respect for the Chair.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3924"> 3924 </A></B>
<P>
	I feel I have been watching excerpts from a movie which got 
rave reviews in Quebec. It was called ``The Unbearable 
Lightness of Being''. With all due respect to the minister, I 
cannot understand his discourse. No later than March 26, 1993 
A.D., Mr. Speaker, the Liberals, who were then getting ready 
to assume power, were calling for the solution we are offering 
in part today.
<P>
	Because the Official Opposition claims that the government 
must play an important part in the conversion process, the 
minister began his remarks as follows: ``The hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve-yours truly-suggests that the 
government make its cheque book available to these 
companies''. In part, Mr. Speaker, in part. We do not see 
anything wrong in doing so; as a matter of fact, we believe it is 
acting responsibly. Why do we think that the government should 
give them money? Because, through DIPP, these companies 
have become dependent on government funding.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	Does the minister not agree that most companies facing the 
difficult task of converting, have adopted or presented the 
government with their own conversion program? Today, the 
minister follows a laissez faire approach and tells us that it is up 
to the private sector to adapt. Yet, the Liberals were even more 
interventionist than we were, because in addition to 
recommending adjustments to the DIPP, they demanded the 
following in the second part of their press release entitled 
<I>Liberals Announce Defence Conversion Policy</I> issued on March 
26 of 1993: ``The establishment of an Economic Conversion 
Commission, with the participation of industry and labour, to 
facilitate and coordinate the process of conversion in the 
100,000-job defence industry''.
<P>
	One would think from this press release that the Liberals 
agreed with our position that state intervention was essential to 
the conversion process. Therefore, I cannot understand the 
government's lack of commitment or why it has backed off and 
flip-flopped on this issue. We do, however, agree with the 
minister about one thing, and that is that unemployment affects 
everyone. Happiness, they say, may be the absence of misery. 
This is the kind of sophistry that is served up to us here today.
<P>
	I will agree with the minister that unemployment is 
catastrophic for everyone, but will he agree with me that the 
money spent by the government on the conversion process will 
spare some people their jobs and allow them to continue 
investing in the economy? I fail to understand why no 
connection is being drawn between implementing a strong, 
immediate and urgent conversion strategy and the benefits that 
would accrue from it, in terms of national production and 
unemployment. I hope that the minister will review his position, 
that he will take a much more interventionist approach and that 
he will show some leadership. I have been told that he can count 
on the co-operation of his colleague, the Minister of  Finance, 
and I know that the two ministers are prepared to work closely 
together. Their co-operation and the will of the opposition will 
ensure that we work together on this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is trying to 
misrepresent what I said. In my remarks, I tried to explain that in 
a strategy for the conversion of defence industries, we need to 
have, first of all, in the private sector, the sort of initiative that 
can provide direction to every company affected.
<P>
	Take for example Paramax, now Unisys GSG, the prime 
contractor for the helicopter contract the government cancelled 
on November 4.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am quoting from a Canadian Press article published in the 
<I>Gazette</I> of April 19, 1994:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Paul Manson, president of Unisys GSG-says the company may end up better 
off than it might have had it carried the multibillion dollar helicopter contract 
through to its conclusion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``We've gone through the worst of the setback from the helicopter'', he said.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The articile goes on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He said Unisys is using the expertise gained in military work for commercial 
contracts, especially in the field of total systems integration. ``Once you would 
sell a mainframe or a mini-computer or a PC and then walk away'', he said.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Now we're involved in the whole package-maintenance, software, 
systems and integration.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The article goes on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The cancellation cloud may have had a silver lining in that it forced Unisys 
into diversification at a time of ``intense downward pressure on defence 
budgets''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My point is simply that I hope this indicates a success for the 
particular company. It has a highly motivated very professional 
manager as president, Mr. Manson. He has done a good job 
trying to anticipate where his company can find new successes. 
He spent a fair bit of time discussing strategy with Industry 
Canada. We have tried to be helpful to him as a government 
should be in identifying opportunities and in looking for 
possibilities.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Indeed the DIPP fund may prove useful in this exercise again 
as a repayable contribution to research which will lead to the 
production of new products to sell into new markets.
<P>
	This is a very clear strategy. It is not a do-nothing strategy as 
the hon. member has attempted to characterize it. It is a practical 
pragmatic strategy that reflects two things, first of all the 
important contribution that these firms make to Canada's base 
of highly skilled, highly educated technical people. Second, it 
reflects the reality of the fiscal situation of the Government of 
Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3925"> 3925 </A></B>
<P>
	With all due respect to the hon. member who makes 
quotations from press releases at a time when the government 
in office was projecting $30 billion deficits, times have 
changed. Any government is forced to see how it can make most 
effective use of the resources that it has available.
<P>
	If he has practical suggestions on that or if he would like to 
come forward and say that he thinks the DIPP fund should be 
increased by another $250 million and here is where we take the 
money from then let him suggest that. So far, other than his 
ranting and raving I have not heard any specific suggestions 
from him as to what it is exactly he wants us to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
mine is a very brief intervention because I know the time is 
short. I would ask the minister if he could provide us with the 
figures on the DIPP program as to how much was invested and 
what the payback was in the most recent figures he has 
available.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am afraid I could not answer that 
question off the top of my head but I will certainly undertake to 
get that information to the hon. member as quickly as possible.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Resuming debate. I will 
take the occasion to remind all members on both sides of the 
House that for a member to be given the floor he must seek the 
floor and of course that means to rise at your chair. We speak 
about or refer to these unofficial lists that we have, which are 
somewhat helpful at times, but in the end members seeking the 
floor of course are those who will be recognized by the Chair.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 
reading the Bloc Quebecois motion, I have more questions than 
anything else. The motion reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for its unacceptable delays in 
developing and implementing a genuine strategy for the conversion of defence 
industries-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This certainly raises questions. I am pleased to say first of all 
that some of my questions were answered by the first speaker, 
the Bloc critic, and also by the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	Before listening to this morning's speech, I had decided that I 
should speak for the motion for one part and against it for 
another, based largely on the interpretation of certain key words 
in the motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In listening to the first speaker, the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, some of the answers came clear to 
me. One was that first of all he was making a very Bloc 
Quebecois statement, one that is enshrouded a little in mystery. 
In fact, it was partly brought out by the Minister of Industry 
saying: ``Why are they talking about this defence industry when 
their long term motivation is to withdraw and perhaps have no 
armed  forces at all''. That part of it is still a bit of a mystery to 
me.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	I noted also that the speaker talked really only about Quebec. 
He did mention regionalism. I think regionalism is a very great 
consideration to all Canadians partly because we do not see 
sufficient consideration on the part of the government about 
regionalization or the necessity for developing different 
regions. We see a total concentration, it seems to me, on one at a 
time and giving way to political considerations rather than 
human or industrial ones.
<P>
	The main question I had in listening to the Bloc spokesman 
was what is the motivation behind the motion. I think that came 
very clear that the motivation was to get money for industry in 
Montreal. I do not think that is sufficient. Perhaps it needs 
money. Perhaps it needs help. Perhaps it needs government 
leadership. However, to just say: ``Let's have more money for 
Montreal or for Quebec'' is not acceptable. It should be put in 
the context of what is needed in the rest of the country.
<P>
	I heard the statement by the Minister of Industry in response. I 
have to say that the thrust of his statement was good. I did agree 
with a good part of what he said. He said there should be no 
question of just giving cheques to industry, that industry must 
take the initiative itself.
<P>
	I would put a little caveat in here in saying that the 
government must show some leadership for industry, but the 
minister said it correctly in saying that the defence market has to 
take care of its own. It has to be market driven and, he said very 
clearly, there must be no major subsidies or bailouts. I could not 
agree more with what the minister says in that regard. He wound 
up in effect saying the whole process must be industry led. I 
agree with that also.
<P>
	Having in a cursory manner described what I heard from both 
of these presentations on the part of the Bloc and on the part of 
the government, I have to admit that my own thought processes 
on this process were much more objective. I am looking at the 
context of the world situation, of Canada's foreign policy, 
Canada's defence policy and what industry has to do within that 
whole milieu.
<P>
	Let us see how objective I am.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The motion introduced by the Bloc Quebecois refers to 
unacceptable delays in developing a genuine strategy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3926"> 3926 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My comment on that is that some delay is inevitable in that it 
must await the evolution of foreign policy and defence policy. 
That review is under way now. We will not see anything until the 
end of September. There is an inevitable delay there.
<P>
	Having said that I have to criticize the government for some 
of its dealings with defence policy. For example, that it did a 
whole base closure program before the defence review was 
done.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	That does not make good sense to me. I know the government 
was under the gun to save money. I agree with the government 
and compliment it in the sense that it has allowed the 
Department of National Defence to rationalize its own 
infrastructure. The government did well in that regard, but there 
is a certain backwardness to putting the closures ahead of the 
defence review.
<P>
	Coming back to the motion, let us talk about the development 
of policy. Here the point to be underlined I would think is that 
government leadership is required. The government should be 
talking very seriously with industry, not but bailing it out but 
saying here is what we foresee, here is what is falling out so far 
from the defence review, which incidentally I understand is 
being done in a pretty non-partisan way by the special joint 
committee on that and good for them.
<P>
	The government nevertheless can take some leadership here. 
It should be talking with industry, perhaps it is but we do not 
know about it, saying here is what we see in the medium term 
and the long term. Let us look ahead 5 years, 10 years, 15 years 
and let us build on the strengths of Canadian industry today as 
demonstrated in the field of electronics, communications, 
extrasensory perception-not ESP, sorry-but the remote 
sensing as practised by and developed by firms like MacDonald 
Dettwiler of Richmond. These are the areas where Canada is a 
leader. Government I think should be sitting down with industry 
and saying, fine, how can we exploit the advantages that we have 
in this country in these industries to give us a long term benefit 
of employment.
<P>
	While at it the government should make a firm resolve to have 
no political patronage or interference once the policy has been 
decided. If you look back over a number of governments, Mr. 
Speaker, that is precisely what you will find. When the Bloc 
talks about contracts for Quebec, what I have seen from a 
western point of view is the scandalous putting aside the 
contract of Bristol Aircraft of Winnipeg on the F-18 
maintenance and giving it through pure political patronage to 
Canadair in Montreal.
<P>
	That sort of thing has to stop. I hope the government will take 
a lesson from the past and say yes, it is resolved to do that.
<P>
	In the development of policy I would urge the government to 
do a continuous strategic review of our defence policy, update it 
from year to year. The government should not leave it hanging in 
the balance for five years at a time and then say, now we must do 
a review. It should do a continuous, ongoing strategic policy 
reassessment year by year so that we do not have to make these 
sudden shifts, some of which of course affect industry. If 
industry cannot see what the long term prospect is and be able to 
adjust year by year to smooth things out, it does not know where 
it is.
<P>
	The final point in the development of policy is that I would 
encourage the government to please get more public input. The 
public of Canada is very supportive of defence and the armed 
forces in time of war, but it is not that supportive as it is 
uninformed during most of peace time. Therefore I would 
encourage the government please to get the public more 
involved in the review of policy.
<P>
	We have been talking about developing policy. In 
implementing this policy the emphasis must be on industry 
rather than government. Again I take the words of the Minister 
of Industry and emphasize them.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Government must emphasize research and development. It 
has a role to play. We have a fairly sizeable research and 
development expense year by year in national defence. I suggest 
that it should be more tightly attuned to what is going on in 
industry to give us more bang for the buck.
<P>
	I agree with the motion when it calls for more jobs in high 
tech. That is the direction in which we must be going. Look at 
what has happened in the past because of government policy. 
Look at the Avro Arrow. The Avro Arrow has been talked to 
death over the years but I would like to bring it back as a 
reminder. It had wonderful potential for Canadian industry but it 
was chopped and thousands of jobs were lost because of a 
political decision. That sort of thing should not happen.
<P>
	Closer to our time, perhaps not as severe but nevertheless of 
high impact is the EH-101 helicopter decision. I understand 
clearly that the government of the day, the Liberal Party, as part 
of its election campaign, said that it would cancel the contract. It 
stuck to its promise. By sticking to its promise, it hurt the 
country and it hurt industry. I am not sage enough to say how the 
government could have got around breaking its promise but if it 
had had an all party review of that project, perhaps that would 
have given them the answer.
<P>
	The predicament the government got itself into by cancelling 
the EH-101 contract is that it says: ``Fine, we are probably 
liable to $250 million in cancellation charges'' but the word is 
that perhaps those cancellation charges will be as high as $1 
billion. Whatever the figure is, we have nothing for our money 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3927"> 3927 </A></B>
<P>
and yet we still are going to have to pay out hundreds of millions 
if not billions of dollars to acquire a replacement helicopter.
<P>
	The Bloc is talking about good paying jobs and high 
technology and they were there with the EH-101 contract. Ten 
per cent of the manufacturing of every helicopter produced 
worldwide would have been done in Canada. That would have 
meant a lot of jobs and a lot of money.
<P>
	People will say that we are at peace. We are not at peace and I 
will come to that later. I remind members that some of the 
applications of this helicopter are peaceful as well as warlike. It 
had a naval version, a transport version and a passenger version 
and I think we are going to see more of this helicopter in the 
future.
<P>
	I have heard estimates there is a market for 800 such 
helicopters. More recently I heard that the U.S. marine corps is 
thinking of buying 500. Think of the market that Canada has 
lost. Think of the jobs. Think of the high tech job creation we 
have lost by putting that behind us.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us talk generally about the defence industry. When anyone 
says defence industry it sparks emotion. It sparks emotion on the 
part of the general public which says it does not want a military 
industrial complex. I agree with the public that we do not want a 
military industrial complex that drives the government, such as 
we saw in the former United States model. We do not need that in 
Canada.
<P>
	At the same time, however, we must be realistic and recognize 
that there is a defence industry. It will continue, we can be a 
contributor, and government should take its leadership role in 
asking industry what it can do best and how can government best 
encourage it without necessarily giving them dollops of money.
<P>
	The idealism that gets involved, the exaggeration that is 
involved when one says defence industry, should really be 
moderated in Canada. It is too much of an extreme view when we 
hear people saying: ``Oh, you can't even say the word defence 
industry because it is bad''. The fact is there is a positive role for 
the defence industry, not just in employment but in creating new 
products for the good of all people. The government's role 
vis-à-vis the defence industry must be one of preserving a 
minimum base for that industry throughout the years ahead.
<P>
	In this connection there is an organization called the Canadian 
Defence Preparedness Association, which I understand gave 
testimony to the joint committee in the last day or two. It has a 
real role to play with the government. Its objectives, if I may 
read it, are ``to foster an industrial framework to achieve both 
the sustainment of forces in being and a modest mobilization 
capacity in times of conflict.'' I think that is a worthy objective.
<P>
	What government can do in conjunction with a group like the 
Defence Preparedness Association and other defence minded 
groups is to look ahead and ask how they may co-operate. Can 
we have the production of aircraft, for example, that are stressed 
so as to land on rough terrain but have an application, a use, in 
time of peace but are available to the government, to the 
Canadian forces in time of emergency?
<P>
	The answer, if the government looks long term, is yes we can 
have things like that. Can we have, for example, roll on roll off 
ferries that are in day to day use, let us say with B.C. Ferry 
Corporation in British Columbia, subsidized to a degree by the 
Canadian government? If we can have these used in peacetime 
but also available in time of emergency, we have something that 
is a good combination for peace and war, if you will.
<P>
	There are other things that the government can do in its 
leadership role vis-à-vis organizations such as the Defence 
Preparedness Association. One such is legislation. It should be 
listening to these organizations and asking how we can best 
support the militia or members of the militia by ensuring that 
they have a job once they come back from either peacekeeping 
operations or militia training. Things of that order can be done.
<P>
	Implicit in the Bloc motion, or at least my interpretation of it, 
is that we are now in a time of peace. If that is so, I have to say 
we are not there yet. You simply have to look at Rwanda, the 
situation in Somalia and the situation in the former Yugoslavia. 
You can look anywhere in the world and if there is no trouble 
there right now, you can see it coming in the future.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	In summary, there is good and bad to be said about this 
motion. I was cheered by the reply of the Minister of Industry. I 
think the government is going in the right direction. However, 
government can do much more in the planning sphere to create 
jobs and to make better life for us all.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to comment on what the hon. member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan said about the F-18.
<P>
	I think it would be a good idea to remind the hon. member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan of the historical facts on the F-18. We 
need to place the F-18 events in their historical context. In this 
regard, we must remember that during the referendum debate, 
after our friends opposite got involved, in particular the hon. 
member for Saint-Maurice, who was already a minister in Mr. 
Trudeau's Cabinet, Quebecers were promised a carrot: ``If you 
vote against the Parti Quebecois' proposal to give them the 
mandate to negotiate eventual sovereignty with all related 
commitments, we promise you, first of all, that the 
superspecialized F-18 will be built in Quebec''. That was the 
carrot.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3928"> 3928 </A></B>
<P>
	And I remember in the 1980s seeing follow-up analyses 
saying that, according to the experts, the promises were never 
kept. Either I misunderstood the member from the Reform Party 
or he does not know-that is his right-but I hope we will no 
longer hear such remarks, as though Quebecers' concerns were 
whims, to use once again the words of the hon. member for 
Saint-Maurice.
<P>
	I would like to suggest to my dear colleague from 
Nanaimo-Cowichan, who is responsible for recruiting Reform 
Party members in Quebec, that such comments will not help him 
in his task.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, I obviously did not express myself 
clearly in English because the hon. member misunderstood me 
or he does not understand the F-18 situation.
<P>
	First of all, there were no promises to build the F-18 in 
Quebec; it was to be built in the United States but a few parts 
would be built here in Canada. The contract I mentioned was 
only for the maintenance of this plane and it was awarded to 
Winnipeg-based Bristol Aerospace, which had it in the bag but, 
as the hon. member said, the government decided that it should 
still give Quebec something even if it lost votes in the West or 
upset Westerners. It did not matter; they had to give it to 
Quebec.
<P>
	The contract was awarded for political reasons, and that must 
stop in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want to 
tell the hon. member that indeed, and Quebecers are aware of it, 
there are frustrations in Western Canada, where people may 
have the impression that Quebec gets more than its fair share. 
However, I want to remind the hon. member that, among large 
provinces, both in terms of population and size, Quebec is 
undoubtedly the province with the highest unemployment rate 
and the largest number of poor in cities. It is a state, or at least a 
province, where there are numerous problems. And I personally 
do not think that Quebec is asking for more than its fair share, 
far from it.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	I want to point out to the hon. member one thing which was 
overlooked. If we proposed to discuss today the conversion of 
defence industries, and if Bloc Quebecois members talk more 
specifically about Quebec, it is because a consensus already 
exists in our province between the City of Montreal, the Quebec 
Liberal government, the unions and the Conseil du patronat.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the situation in Quebec is such that we must 
absolutely find a way to ensure the conversion of this industry. 
As my colleague from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve mentioned 
earlier, out of 57,000 jobs, 11,000 have disappeared since 1988.
<P>
	The situation is disastrous and even catastrophic. The Reform 
Party member did not say that we are in times of war, but he 
seemed to imply that there are conflicts everywhere. We must be 
serious and believe that it is possible to have peace. I think it is 
reasonable to say that we are less in danger than we were 20 
years ago, and that the need for arms is also less than it was 20 
years ago.
<P>
	I find it somewhat unfortunate to think that we must continue 
to arm ourselves. In conclusion, I want to tell the hon. member 
that there are frustrations in the West. However, the Bloc 
Quebecois is well aware of those frustrations and we have a plan 
for the future of Canada which will eliminate those frustrations 
once and for all. Our plan will ultimately put an end to the 
constant bickering between us by creating parallel systems, in 
harmony. This is what Quebecers hope.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would agree with my hon. 
colleague that indeed we want to work side by side in peace not 
just with Quebec and all of Canada but elsewhere in the world.
<P>
	Absolutely there is no one who likes peace more than a 
professional military person. Having put in my 35 years, having 
seen the terrible results of war, I could not agree more. Let us go 
for peace.
<P>
	Having said that, I look around the world. I look at the two 
Koreas. I look at the situation in Vietnam and Cambodia. I look 
at Sri Lanka, the Tamils vis-à-vis the rest of India. I look at the 
Kashmir situation, Afghanistan, on and on. You cannot look at 
any part of the globe and say there is peace around the world 
because peace is not there. Therefore the assurance of peace is 
certainly being threatened. Anyway, that is getting far too much 
into philosophy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are aware of the unemployment problem in Quebec, but I 
wonder why the problem is more acute in that province. I believe 
Quebec has all the necessary tools: intelligent people, hard 
workers, industries, the river, transportation, everything.
<P>
	So, if unemployment is more severe in that province, I wonder 
if it is not partly a matter of policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
industry critic for the opposition, I am very pleased to take part 
in this debate on a motion put forward by my colleague, the hon. 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, for which I want to 
congratulate him. His motion concerning industrial conversion 
reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for its unacceptable delays in 
developing and implementing a genuine strategy for the conversion of defence 
industries to civilian production, which would save and create new jobs in 
high-technology sectors.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	This motion shows how concerned we, in the opposition and 
in the Bloc Quebecois, are about this whole issue of industrial 
conversion, given the current situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3929"> 3929 </A></B>
<P>
	You have to realize that the problem is very acute and the 
situation is very serious. During the last few years, defence 
expenditures have decreased. In fact, in only seven years, from 
1987 to 1994, they have dropped by 10 per cent. According to 
some experts, defence expenditures are expected to fall by 
another 25 per cent in the next few years. This 10 per cent drop 
in activities has had devastating effects throughout the West. In 
Europe, for example, 600,000 jobs have already been lost. In the 
United States, 700,000 jobs disappeared in five years. By the 
year 2000, about 1.6 million jobs will have been lost because of 
the reduction in military production. Here, in Quebec, as was 
mentioned earlier, 10,000 workers in the defence industries 
have already lost their jobs.
<P>
	According to some analysts, in Quebec, there are about 650 
businesses directly or indirectly involved in military 
production.
<P>
	Around forty of those are mainly and fundamentally involved 
in military production, a high-tech sector where much emphasis 
is put on research and development. So, we are talking about 
highly-qualified workers, who are highly paid, and, as you 
know, for every job in this high-tech industry, there are five 
indirect jobs.
<P>
	Faced with this very serious problem, there is only one 
conclusion to be drawn. We urgently need a strategy for the 
conversion of defence industries to civilian production. The 
nature of manufacturing must be changed.
<P>
	Here is Canada's position in the world market: in 1992, 
Canada was the eighth arms producer in the world, with a 
production value ranging from $3 to $7 billion, depending on the 
products. We should know that 70 per cent of these products are 
exported and that 80 per cent of our exports go to the United 
States.
<P>
	In view of the reduction of military activity that was talked 
about earlier and that has caused the loss of 700,000 jobs in the 
United States, we can already see how the situation is 
threatening for Canada and Quebec, since the market is 
constantly shrinking.
<P>
	Once again, that is another way of seeing the urgency of the 
situation and the need to redirect all military production effort at 
the present time.
<P>
	We should also know that the federal government's 
intervention in military production has been specifically a type 
of intervention called the Defence Industry Productivity 
Program, better known as the DIPP. The DIPP is defined as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The main mission of this program is to support businesses in the defence 
industry, mostly in aeronautics and avionics, to facilitate and consolidate 
research and development activities, to establish suppliers networks in 
by-products and components for these sectors, and to promote investments and 
exports in these high-value added manufacturing sectors. The objectives of the 
program are to assist defence businesses in remaining competitive in the world 
markets and the Canadian market.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In 1989-90, three years ago, the DIPP had a budget totalling 
$300 million.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	In 1992-93, the budget was only $226 million, a reduction of 
a little over 25 p. 100. This means that Quebec received $168 
million dollars in 1989-90, and only $80 million in 1992-93, a 
reduction of 52 p. 100, whereas the total budget has been 
reduced only by 25 p. 100. Given this, the Opposition now feels 
that this program must be revisited and that the DIPP mandate of 
military equipment promoting agent must be changed, so that 
part of this budget will be allocated to the conversion of defence 
industries into civilian production.
<P>
	The Opposition is not saying anything new when making such 
remarks. For once that we agree with the Liberal Party, let us 
capitalize on that. I believe we agree with them more than they 
agree among themselves. This may be the difference between 
this side and that side. On this side, one can make remarks, on 
the other side, one must implement them. This is not always 
easy. Power is painful and difficult to assume. We understand it.
<P>
	The press release of March 26, 1993 says a lot about the 
intentions of this government. This press release was cosigned 
by the leader of the Opposition, now prime minister, the present 
minister of Human Resources Development, the present 
member for Labrador and his colleague for Willowdale, who 
was then the critic for industrial affairs. It states three major 
commitments. ``Expand the mandate of the Defence Industry 
Productivity Program (DIPP) of the Department of Industry, 
Science and Technology, which has a budget of $200 million, in 
order to add to it a support element that would facilitate the 
conversion and diversification to areas such as environment 
technology and advanced technology for peacekeeping''.
<P>
	Second recommendation: ``The creation of a commission of 
economic conversion in co-operation with industry and labour 
in order to facilitate and co-ordinate the conversion of the 
military industry which today employs some 100,000 workers. 
Sign conversion agreements with the United States, which 
import 80 per cent of our military equipment production''. And 
finally, ``the conversion of military bases'' which has already 
started. We can already see the position taken by the Liberals.
<P>
	There is one aspect that I would like to draw to your attention 
because I think this is the source of the hesitation of the 
government regarding the role of the state in that area. Yet, the 
Liberal Party was very clear at  the time, that is only 14 or 15 
months ago which is not a whole life time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3930"> 3930 </A></B>
<P>
	I would now like to quote the second paragraph on page 3 of 
their press release: ``The Liberal Party believes-and we are 
reliably informed that this is the cause of the hesitation of the 
government-, believes that the mandate of the state is to take 
initiatives that are in line with the evolution of the international 
scene and that create jobs for Canadians. A plan must be adopted 
to encourage our military equipment industries to turn away 
from that type of production and export. We commend the 
sub-committee of the House of Commons on arms exports 
which adopted our view in its report of September 1992 and 
made useful recommendations that were in good part inspired by 
liberal ideas''.
<P>
	Being consistent, the Liberal Party underlines this fact in its 
red book, which led many Canadians to support them especially 
in Ontario and in the Maritimes. The red book, on page 55, reads 
as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The defence industries today employ directly and indirectly over 100,000 
Canadians. The end of the Cold War puts at risks tens of thousands of high-tech 
jobs. A Liberal government will introduce a defence conversion program to help 
industries in transition from high-tech military production to high-tech civilian 
production.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Specifically, a Liberal government will expand the mandate of the Defence 
Industry Productivity Program (DIPP) to assist in a conversion and 
diversification.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	That is what the Liberal Party says.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>DIPP is the primary grant and loan program designed to influence the 
development of a defence industrial base in Canada. Administered by Industry, 
Science and Technology, it aims at developing defence technology and 
strengthening Canadian and North American defence industries.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So, the Liberal Party was already agreeing to fund the defence 
conversion using the DIPP budget.
<P>
	Oddly enough, we have not heard a single word about that 
since the red book has been released, neither in the Speech from 
the Throne nor in the Budget Speech.
<P>
	The Bloc position is more or less the same. I will explain it 
briefly. It aims at creating, in three steps, a conversion fund 
flowing from the industrial diversification fund. The fund would 
mainly consolidate and complement the assistance coming from 
existing programs in order to provide military facilities and 
businesses with adequate and long term support in their 
conversion and diversification process. It would also bring 
about consultative committees on conversion at local and 
regional levels, when the scope of conversion and 
diversification activities would warrant them. It would help in 
establishing an independent committee that would review the 
various existing programs that could be helpful and to put 
forward amendments and other improvements that could be 
required. That committee will propose a framework to ensure 
coordination between the different levels of government in 
order to avoid overlappings.
<P>
	Besides, Mr. Speaker, I can remind you of the position taken 
by the Bloc that was largely inspired by the position taken 
during the campaign in the debate on the cancellation of the 
helicopters contract. The Bloc Quebecois supported the position 
of the Liberals, who sensed that power was within their grasp, 
and said that the contract should be cancelled provided that, let 
us not forget that, the money earmarked for this contract and the 
know-how needed to build the helicopters was transferred to a 
civilian project which would benefit a lot of people. The Bloc 
had clearly indicated that a high speed train linking Quebec 
City, Trois-Rivières and Windsor met both criteria.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the government acted upon only one of those 
two recommendations, and cancelled the helicopter deal. Since 
then, Canadians and Quebecers have been left hanging, without 
any compensation whatsoever.
<P>
	Therefore, DIPP should be modified so that, instead of 
promoting defence production as it does now, it helps military 
industries to convert to civilian production.
<P>
	One must realize that, in Quebec, there is a solid consensus 
among all the stakeholders in this vast project, including the 
Quebec government which has expressed its impatience several 
times already through its Minister of Industry, Trade and 
Technology, Mr. Gérald Tremblay. No matter how federalist and 
Liberal he is, he did not mince his words and said, on April 11 
last:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In its red book, the federal government promised to make available to DIPP, 
significant sums of money for converting defence industries to commercial 
production. We are presently negotiating with the federal government. We want 
to know how much money will be made available, when and for which 
company.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These are the very words spoken by the Quebec Minister of 
Industry, Trade and Technology.
<P>
	The Conseil du patronat du Québec, which-you will admit, 
Mr. Speaker-is not necessarily a natural ally of the Bloc 
Quebecois, is another stakeholder. A few months ago, precisely 
in September 1993, it held a symposium entitled ``Rendez-vous 
économique 1993'', and came up with two main 
recommendations pertinent to our present debate. 
Recommendation 31 said that the federal government should 
provide adequate financial support for the conversion of 
industries dependent on military contracts.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	This financial help would last as long as it takes to adapt, 
convert and diversify defence industries.
<P>
	The implementation of conversion and diversification 
activities would be planned by conversion committees, made up 
of representatives from industry and labour in the affected 
communities and representatives from the Government of 
Quebec. This is the position of the Conseil du patronat which, in 
its first 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3931"> 3931 </A></B>
<P>
recommendation-and this is very relevant to the concerns of 
the Official Opposition-said that the federal  government 
should give MIL Davie a contract for about $6.5 million to 
design, and then another contract for $200 million over three 
years, according to the figures of the Conseil, to build a 
prototype of the ``smart ship'' we hear so much about.
<P>
	This ship would fill urgent and recognized needs of some 
federal departments, but it would also be the prototype of a 
series of similar ships for the international market, a promising 
and expanding market. This is the position of the Conseil du 
patronat, but it is supported by the CNTV and the FTQ. So, the 
Government of Quebec, the Conseil du patronat and the two 
largest unions in Quebec all agree on that point. The CNTV said 
in a press release dated October 31, 1993:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Between 1987 and 1992, Quebec lost 11,000 of its 57,000 jobs in the military 
sector. Jobs are still disappearing. Since more than 60 per cent of contracts are 
awarded to companies in the Montreal area, it is essential that forces stick 
together to obtain a realignment of government industrial policies, especially in 
the military sector which comes under federal jurisdiction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Two days earlier, on October 29, Mr. Fernand Daoust, then 
president of the FTQ, had said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Considering that the future government wants to cancel the helicopter 
contract, we want to know the projects which will be put in place to provide the 
8,000 jobs for 12 years that the Prime Minister is going to abolish without 
serious analysis of the issue.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As we were told a moment ago, the decision to cancel the 
helicopter contract, without any compensation, demonstrated a 
total lack of vision.
<P>
	To show you how serious the situation really is in Quebec, I 
will quickly give you the level of dependency of companies. Let 
me name a few just to show how serious the situation is: Bendix 
Avelex Inc. depends on military contracts for 70 per cent of its 
production; Canadian Marconi, 55 per cent; Héroux, 80 per cent; 
MIL Davie, 91 per cent; Oerlikon and Paramax, 100 per cent in 
both cases and SNC Technologies, 95 per cent.
<P>
	As far as job losses are concerned, Bendix lost 350 jobs, 
Anachemia Canada Inc. 68, Marconi 1,480, MIL Davie 2,740, 
Oerlikon 410, Expro Chemical Products Inc. 300, Héroux 131, 
Paramax 1,000, Pratt and Whitney, 200 and I could go on and on; 
Vickers lost 350 jobs.
<P>
	This goes to show how much we hope the government will 
abide by the promises it made to the public; when governments 
shamelessly treat commitments that way, I think we have a right 
to be worried about democracy. It could mean they can say 
anything to the constituents but after election day, fight shy of 
their commitments and I think this is very serious. When we 
speak like this, the figures do not seem like much but we must 
remember that when we talk about unemployed people, we are 
also talking about human lives, families, careers, educated 
people leaving the country, brain drain or the outflow of 
know-how.
<P>
	Somebody told me this morning we can even use the term 
hemorrhage. In my view neither the economy of Quebec nor that 
of Canada can afford such a hemorrhage.
<P>
	In conclusion, if, as we wish, the government takes action to 
help the DIPP and point it in a new direction, I hope it will do so 
according to generally accepted practices and will respect 
conventions. The minister mentioned it before, it is not enough 
to talk about manpower adjustment committees; I know these 
committees, I worked with them for eleven years; they give 
good results in traditional circumstances.
<P>
	The money given must be administered by committees where 
the employer and the union concerned will be duly represented, 
along with representatives of the region. The context must be 
considered and the government of Quebec has to be consulted, 
since it is very sensitive to that issue and very interested. These 
committees must study the situation on a case by case basis, 
according to the type of activities carried out until now. Indeed 
we must realize that manufacturing ammunition and making 
satellite telecommunication devices are two operations that are 
very different.
<P>
	These committees should examine the situation, ensure that a 
dialogue is initiated and reach a consensus about the new 
orientations and the changes that need to be made to everyday 
management practices. This is a proven formula that should 
work. I really hope the government will act upon the positive 
proposal put forth by the opposition today, which is to see that 
the situation improves. It particularly makes sense if we recall 
the government's pretensions, with its slogan ``jobs, jobs, 
jobs'', and the 11,000 jobs lost in the high technology sector. We 
have to demand a minimum of consistency on the part of this 
government.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I begin by saying to the member that 
the unemployed people of the member's community are as 
important to us as people in any other community in this 
country. Whether it is someone unemployed in the defence 
industry or any other sector of the economy, we feel that it is our 
responsibility as a government to do our very best to put 
everyone back to work. That was our campaign, putting people 
back to work, and we are looking at this in a comprehensive way.
<P>
	I want to pick up on something that the Minister of Industry 
said earlier in his speech. It had to do with the responsibility of 
management of defence industries to develop a strategic 
approach and to look at new markets for new opportunities for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3932"> 3932 </A></B>
<P>
their highly skilled and highly trained staff. I think that he hit on 
something that is very important for all of us to dwell on.
<P>
	I go back to an experience I had when I was in the private 
sector for a while after I left here in 1984. I worked for a 
multinational organization called Magna International. There 
are many unique qualities of the Magna Corporation. One of the 
unique qualities of the management team that I noticed at that 
time was it began a conversion from defence production in 1982. 
In 1980 it was an organization with about $400 million to $500 
million in sales. About one-third of its sales were in defence 
related products, radar systems and machine guns.
<P>
	I think most people would recognize that in terms of the 
quality of its products it is probably ranked with anyone in the 
world. In 1982 the directors of Magna said: ``We are going to do 
a full conversion into the automotive parts manufacturing 
sector''. It was a very tough transition period. It was tough for 
management, tough for the toolmakers and tough for everyone 
on the shop floor. They were entering, even though there was 
some foundation experience because the company had been in 
the automotive parts business for about 25 years at that time, 
into a whole new field because the technology in the automotive 
parts business was becoming very sophisticated with computer 
aided design and computer aided manufacturing. The 
management team at Magna decided that it would move into the 
new economy, become highly specialized, get the latest 
equipment, develop systems and components, and be the most 
competitive in the world.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	This story is not based on theory. Over the next 10 or 12 years 
we saw a company grow from about 3,000 employees doing 
about $600 million in sales to today where it is employing 
approximately 20,000 people and doing over $4 billion in sales. 
The relevance of this example is that the leadership of the 
corporation took the leap into the new economy, searched for 
new markets and searched for new products.
<P>
	I had the pleasure of working there for two years from 1984 to 
1986. What impressed me aside from the conversion and the 
commitment to the conversion of the highly skilled staff was the 
management shift. Management moved out of the traditional 
markets of North America in terms of the auto industry because 
prior to the conversion from defence most of their orders were 
going to General Motors, Chrysler and Ford. When they decided 
to do the full conversion they knew they could not just rely on 
those three manufacturers of automobiles.
<P>
	The leadership of that company went to Japan, went to Toyota, 
and said that it had a company that could make a quality product 
at a price as competitive as Toyota. It asked for an opportunity. It 
said that it had the highly skilled staff and the technology. Lo 
and behold it was successful. It brought back orders from Japan 
and Germany.
<P>
	That is a principle or an approach many companies in the 
defence industry have to look at. That was the point the minister 
was trying to make today in part of his speech.
<P>
	It is not a question of the government saying that it would not 
help or that it would leave them alone. The minister said in his 
speech that DIPP would be redesigned and would be more on a 
loan basis. We are also using other instruments of government 
for support like the Export Development Corporation. That is 
the kind of message members of Parliament have to 
communicate to industries that are having a difficult time 
making the conversion.
<P>
	It was interesting that as I was sitting here a couple of other 
examples were brought to my attention. The story of Securiplex 
Technologies of Montreal is about the successful conversion of 
a company that was well established in the defence industry. 
Recently it obtained a $26 million order for a control system 
from Bombardier in Belgium.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	There is another example. ATS was founded on Montreal's 
south shore in 1979. It originated as a small company 
specializing in the testing of ammunition. Recognizing the fact 
that it had limited business opportunity, the company sought to 
take its considerable expertise in developing software systems 
to new markets.
<P>
	Today the original business is history. The future of the firm is 
in an entirely new market that it could claim to have invented: 
the simulation of air traffic control towers and control rooms. 
There is an incredible market all over the world for this 
company that reinvented itself.
<P>
	We inherited a very difficult fiscal framework. The minister 
said in his remarks that during the campaign we talked of some 
$30 billion in deficit and now we are hitting over $40 billion. 
This is a shock to the budgetary system of the country very few 
of us expected.
<P>
	When I say leadership I do not just mean the chief executive 
officer. I mean the production manager, the lead tool maker and 
the people on the shop floor. Securiplex, Magna and ATS had to 
take on a leadership thought process. Companies going through 
conversion should do this, along with having a redesigned DIPP 
and the banks beginning to look at the new economy and 
knowledge based industries. We have heard time and time in the 
last two to three weeks in the industry committee that the banks 
were beginning to look at small and medium sized 
organizations, not at the strength of their balance sheets but at 
the strength of the mind and the character of the persons 
involved.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3933"> 3933 </A></B>
<P>
	When we are dealing with companies going through this very 
difficult period we have to help them along the path to new hope 
by showing other examples. I say to the member for 
Trois-Rivières, as a former employee, as a former senior 
officer of Magna, that I know the former chairman went many 
times to help companies in Quebec with conversion. Today 
there would be leaders in Magna who would be happy to share 
their experiences with companies in the member's riding that 
might be having difficulty in making the conversion.
<P>
	Companies that basically were successful making the 
conversion remember the pain. They remember the experience. 
By and large most of them are willing to share it. That is the type 
of direction we have to take.
<P>
	I hope the member realizes that we cannot write grant-type 
cheques for any industry in trouble. We do not have the room to 
do so because of our tight fiscal framework, but the minister said 
that DIPP was being redesigned to become more of a loan 
situation. We will help them through it in that way, combined 
with other resources. I believe that is the approach we must work 
on over the next conversion period.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Questions and comments. 
I recognize the hon. member for Trois-Rivières.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No, no.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes, go ahead.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. The hon. 
parliamentary secretary may have directed questions to other 
hon. members in his remarks, but having concluded his remarks, 
if the hon. member for Trois-Rivières wishes to ask a question 
or make a comment on the hon. parliamentary secretary's 
remarks at this time, he has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot 
help but disagree with what my distinguished colleague just said 
because it contradicts the Liberal Party's own platform.
<P>
	In view of the disastrous economic situation we are facing, 
with 11,000 high-tech jobs lost in Quebec alone over the past 
five years, we are being told that it concerns only the private 
sector. Personally, and it was also the Liberal Party's position 
last fall, I consider the public interest is at stake and that the 
state-and I could quote again from the document I read 
earlier-should play a leading role in promoting recovery.
<P>
	What we are saying is not to spend without thinking, but 
rather-that is at least how I see things personally-that the 
minister should ask companies where jobs are continually lost 
because they are no longer able to obtain contracts: ``Where is 
your conversion plan? Show us a decent plan, a plan that is well 
thought out, well structured and pragmatic, a plan with a vision 
and we will help you.''
<P>
	The government's present position however is more along the 
lines of washing its hands of the matter, leaving it up to free 
market and free competition and relying on companies that have 
proven more innovative than others such as Magna International 
Inc., a Montreal business mentioned earlier. Perhaps these 
companies have had a keener eye, more business acumen and 
more vision. Perhaps not all companies are to blame, but I think 
that this government has the duty to question these people in the 
public interest, because we cannot let this go on, with engineers 
and skilled technicians finding themselves out of work and 
possibly getting ready to put their skills to the service of foreign 
economies. Our economy may never recover from that.
<P>
	I think it is the role of government, not only that of the private 
sector, to manage the economy sensibly, like a reasonable man 
as we used to say. The Liberal Party said, and I agree: ``The 
government obviously has a social responsibility in this 
matter.''
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess I 
have not put enough emphasis on government participation for 
the hon. member. I was not saying that the government should 
walk away and not assist businesses in the process of 
conversion. We never have. I was suggesting that the balance 
should be one where we do not ignore other success stories in the 
conversion process.
<P>
	In other words, as a government we should not think we are 
the only ones who have the solution. We will aid. We will 
support. We must bring into the discussion people who have 
already had success in the conversion exercise.
<P>
	The member is not opposed to that. My point is that we have to 
start. We have to make sure that we do not create a sense of false 
hope. In other words we are not running away. However it must 
be much more of a joint venture with government giving advice, 
government giving some form of assistance where possible, 
maybe not in grants but through some loan guarantees and 
bringing in other experts who have achieved success. That is the 
point I was trying to make to the hon. member.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree 
with the hon. member that this is a complex issue. That is why, 
as I mentioned in my statement, we must approach it as tactfully 
as possible, and abide by the rules. We must call upon all 
existing resources of businesses that have already had the 
foresight to proceed with conversion. These resources should be 
used by businesses planning to convert. As I said, when a 
business intends to convert with the help of the state, all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3934"> 3934 </A></B>
<P>
stakeholders must be genuinely and completely involved, that is 
the employer, labour unions and regional players because this 
process can sometimes have a tremendous impact on a region. 
The Quebec government must also  be involved because of its 
thorough knowledge of this question within the Quebec context.
<P>
	Of course, this does not preclude-and this is the way the 
issue is set out-seeking out all those who have some expertise 
in this field to help speed matters along and ensure that case by 
case, the situation improves and production is geared to new 
markets. I think this is one point on which we all agree.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
beginning to agree. The approach that the member for 
Trois-Rivières just suggested is essentially what I was trying to 
communicate in my remarks.
<P>
	As the minister said, we need to develop a strategic approach 
and that is what we are attempting to do. We cannot just look at 
these difficulties in isolation from the work that the minister of 
human resources is doing. It cannot be looked at in isolation 
from what the industry committee is doing or what the Minister 
of the Environment is doing.
<P>
	In my view we have not spent enough time today talking about 
the potential in environmental technologies. We must become a 
nation that measures its strength not by its armaments but by our 
environmental technologies. That is an area where I think most 
people would agree there is terrific potential.
<P>
	There is another thing, a final point I want to make. This is 
actually a plug. On May 17 a group of members of Parliament 
from both sides of the house, 10 of us, are going to Beijing with 
people from over 100 small and medium sized businesses, not 
the big businesses that tend to go on these missions. We will be 
looking for new markets, new opportunities.
<P>
	We all know that the Asia-Pacific region is just exploding 
with opportunity especially for small and medium sized 
business. There might be all kinds of opportunity for people who 
are currently in the conversion process and looking to that 
region of the world for new markets and new potential.
<P>
	As the Minister of Industry said earlier this morning, it has to 
be a comprehensive approach. We have to get the financial 
institutions on side. The Export Development Corporation has 
to be working. The human resource component is helping people 
get retrained for the new economy. We have to beef up our 
ability to go out and sell abroad. We are not very good hustlers in 
this country. We tend to be staid. We are not as aggressive as 
some of our American friends to the south or the Germans or the 
French. One of the things that we as parliamentarians have to do 
is encourage our small and medium size business community to 
hustle a little more beyond the boundaries of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	I realize I only have a minute, but that is something that we as 
members of Parliament can do to support the small and medium 
size business sector. We go with them.
<P>
	The only problem that I have is that members of the Reform 
Party do not want to come with us when we take these small and 
medium size business people on these trips to try and forge new 
markets because they do not think these trips are that 
productive. However, I hope eventually they will see that they 
are very important to the small business community and they are 
not junkets.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on the motion before us. 
First of all, I would like to say that last week, on an opposition 
day, we had a motion with which I showed the Liberal 
government's inaction on agriculture. I spoke last week to show, 
with supporting figures, that this government was really not 
doing enough about agriculture in Canada, especially in Quebec.
<P>
	This week, we are speaking up to denounce again this 
government's inertia on the whole issue of the conversion of 
military industries to the manufacture of useful civilian items. I 
care about this issue and that is why I chose to participate in the 
proceedings of the defence committee, to look at the whole issue 
of defence more closely. What interested me on the defence 
committee was the whole issue of the conversion of military 
factories to civilian uses.
<P>
	To my great dismay, this famous committee has met at least 
fifteen times, if not more. First, I must say that there was a 
standing committee, which I joined, and then the government 
called for the addition of a joint committee, made up of MPs and 
senators, besides the standing committee on defence.
<P>
	At every meeting I attended of either committee, I always 
added the whole question of industrial conversion to the agenda 
because it was never there. Every time I asked the question on 
one committee or the other, they wondered whether the defence 
committee was the one to deal with conversion and today they 
again raise the question as to whether the defence committee 
will discuss conversion or will pass it on to the industry 
committee.
<P>
	It is total confusion now. In the end, we do not know which 
committee will have to deal with defence. The government has 
already been in office for six months. Many military factories, 
especially in Quebec, have to work with their employees every 
day to try to keep those jobs, and we are still discussing which 
committee, the standing committee on defence or the joint 
committee on defence or the committee on industry, is to deal 
with industrial conversion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3935"> 3935 </A></B>
<P>
	I noticed that the joint committee was much more concerned 
with preparing trips to Oslo, Brussels and eastern and western 
Canada. Take a good look at the schedule of the joint committee 
for the coming weeks and months, Mr. Speaker, and you can 
see for yourself. I think that five, six or seven trips have been 
planned to see how other countries in the world go about 
defining a new defence policy. I have nothing against that but, 
in the meantime, there are men and women working in our 
defence factories and we should talk about conversion for their 
sake. Meanwhile, we are discussing the trips we will have to 
make to see how other countries deal with the end of the cold 
war, how they will redesign their defence. This may have to be 
done but not at the expense of conversion.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Certainly, since the end of the cold war, people throughout the 
world are calling for a disarmament and peacekeeping policy 
rather than an armament policy. And this makes me the happiest 
man in the world. If every country in the world could pursue a 
disarmament and peacekeeping policy, I think that, as the 
evidence shows, disarmament and not war makes people 
happier. Except that it has major economic repercussions.
<P>
	We know that for many years the richest countries in 
particular built defence factories to arm themselves. They 
armed themselves to the teeth. Until the east bloc collapsed, we 
lived with the stress of the cold war between east and west. In the 
meantime, of course, our defence factories were kept busy. 
People were hired to make ammunition, guns and shells. They 
were working but not, in my opinion, for a good cause. I prefer 
disarmament to armament and so much the better if we are 
already there. Except that, as I was saying earlier, one of the 
economic repercussions of disarmament may be unemployment. 
It has already started.
<P>
	But, at that time, the government was proud of the factories 
making its guns, ammunition and shells. And it was making 
them work at what was called ``cost plus''. They were told, 
``Make the equipment and we will pay you whatever it costs''. 
Since these plants could take the time they wanted or just about, 
the workers were not very efficient because they were not 
competing against other countries.
<P>
	The country that had built these plants bought the equipment 
at cost. So if workers took one and a half instead of one month to 
make a gun, they were paid for a month and a half. 
Consequently, defence industries now wanting to switch to 
civilian production have to improve the profitability of those 
new products which will compete on the market.
<P>
	I listened to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Industry and he seemed to evade his responsibility by saying 
that the issue concerns the private sector and not the 
government. Yet, the government was quite pleased to have 
these industries when it needed them. Now that it does not have 
the same  need for these companies, it lets them down. The 
government has a duty to ensure that these defence industries 
are able to switch to civilian production.
<P>
	As you know, arms production has been experiencing difficult 
times since the late eighties. This is an enormous market 
estimated at over $450 billion worldwide. Indeed, it is a market 
which involved billions of dollars. There has been a drop since 
1987, and especially in 1994. It is expected that this $450 billion 
figure will drop by 25 per cent in the next few years. As a 
consequence of that pattern, 600,000 jobs have disappeared in 
European defence industries since 1987.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	In the United States, the figure is 700,000, while in Quebec 
the drop is proportionally the same. This sector is in a state of 
collapse. It is being abandoned but the government cannot let 
down all these plants, employers and employees, chemists, 
engineers and qualified workers after using them for its needs 
and the needs of its military forces.
<P>
	Now that we no longer place orders, we do not have the right 
to abandon these industries. That is why I urge the government 
to take money out of the defence budget, or the environment 
budget, or any other budget for that matter, since it all comes out 
of our pockets anyway, and to use that money to provide these 
plants not with hand-outs, but with assistance in areas like 
research, development, expertise, or capabilities. I urge the 
government not to let these plants down, because in the next few 
days, weeks and months, these plants will need to turn around 
their whole production.
<P>
	The jobs in those sectors were mostly in Quebec, and 
especially in the Montreal area. The impact on its economy is 
significant. The cancellation of the famous helicopter deal did 
hurt for sure, but we, in the Bloc Quebecois, were all for it, 
except that the government forgot one thing. After cancelling 
the deal, which saved Canadians $5 billion to $6 billion, the 
government should have used parts of the savings to set up an 
Industrial Conversion Assistance Fund, which it chose not to do.
<P>
	The government let the defence industries down and pocketed 
the $5 billion to $6 billion it saved by cancelling the helicopter 
contract. Yesterday, I was watching televison and I saw the 
prime minister who was taking stock of his first six months in 
office, and bragging. He said ``one of our first achievements'' is 
the cancellation of the helicopter deal, which he had promised to 
do during the election campaign.
<P>
	And at one point, reporters asked the Prime Minister who had 
just enumerated his good deeds if he did not make mistakes. The 
Prime minister scratched his head and said: ``I cannot think of 
any.''

	If I had been next to the Prime Minister, I would have 
whispered this to him: ``Mr. Prime Minister, during the election 
and even before that, when you were in the opposition, you gave 
us a lot of hope and made a lot of great promises concerning 
industrial conversion programs and when you cancelled the 
helicopter contract, you should have proposed that program, but 
you did not.'' That is a mistake the Prime Minister should have 
mentioned to the reporters, yesterday, when he was taking stock 
of his first six months in office.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and the Liberal government on the other 
side have so-I am tempted to say-lied to us, if I may, although 
it may be too strong a term in this House, but this is almost the 
case. I could quote government members when they were in the 
opposition, as well as provincial members. When it was in the 
opposition, the Liberal Party was a keen advocate of conversion. 
They wanted an assistance program that would help businesses 
to take over other markets than the defence market.
<P>
	So, they promised to develop a program to help businesses 
move away from military production. The Liberals reiterated 
their promise in the red book. Almost every day in Question 
Period, the Prime Minister continuously refers to his red book 
and the need to create jobs, jobs and more jobs.
<P>
	And yet, once in office, all these good intentions went 
unheeded, so much so that even the Martin budget said nothing 
about a conversion program for defence businesses.
<P>
	On the other hand, the Prime Minister speaks a lot of his 
famous infrastructure program. If it creates jobs, that is great.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	The infrastructure program will create about 45,000 jobs. But 
what good will it do to create 45,000 jobs, temporary jobs that 
will last six months or a year, if the government allows 60,000 
existing jobs to be lost in our military industries and allows 
plants to close permanently? I think that the government could 
have kept a portion of the one billion dollars it will invest in its 
infrastructure program and used it to help the 60,000 workers in 
the defence industries keep their jobs. What good will it do to 
create one job if two are lost elsewhere? We are not moving 
forward by doing that, we are going backwards.
<P>
	On March 26 1993, some MPs, namely Mr. Axworthy, Mr. 
Rompkey and Mr. Peterson, said-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I simply want to 
repeat once again that, in this House, people must be referred to 
by their title, such as parliamentary secretary or hon. member 
for such-and-such a riding, and not by their name.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
not sure if I should name them, but I am reading a text dated 
March 1993, when these people were not in government. 
Anyway, it is these three Liberal members, who were in 
opposition at the time, who said that the military businesses 
assistance program had to be reformed for the conversion of 
these businesses to civilian production.
<P>
	They said jointly: ``It is necessary to expand the mandate of 
Industry, Science and Technology Canada's $200 million 
Defence Industry Productivity Program (DIPP) which is aimed 
at developing defence technology''. There already is a $200 
million assistance program for military businesses, but as the 
members said at the time, it was necessary ``to add to that 
program a new component that will help the industry convert 
and diversify into areas such as environmental technologies and 
high-tech peacekeeping technologies''. The Liberals said that. 
They were encouraging our defence industries to penetrate the 
environmental sector.
<P>
	Let us take as an example a business in the riding of 
Beauharnois, Expro, which manufactures gunpowder and shells 
and which, for the past few years, has been taking part in a soil 
decontamination program. Those people are now struggling to 
survive, since 70 per cent of their orders were government 
defense production orders. Now that they hardly get any such 
orders, they have to redirect their operations. They are now 
working on a soil decontamination program, which is related to 
the whole question of environment.
<P>
	However, they need support, they need studies and research, 
and the government could and should get involved in that area. 
Otherwise, what will happen to those people who worked for 
many years at making gunpowder and shells and who are hardly 
making any today? We know also that the company had major 
sales on the United States market; they had many orders from 
the United States. But the Americans too are tightening their 
arms program and have significantly reduced their orders, and 
therefore the orders for Expro are going down.
<P>
	Going further than what the Liberals were saying when they 
formed the Opposition, the present Prime Minister did not 
hesitate to say that defence industries were industries of the 
past. Liberals were saying that Canadians deserved a 
government that could show the way, a government that could 
bring forth new ideas and new strategies, a government that 
could help them adapt to change.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	The defence conversion policy is an example of how a Liberal 
government intends to meet the needs of Canadians in the 1990s. 
That is what the present Prime Minister constantly repeated 
during the campaign and when he was Leader of the Opposition. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3937"> 3937 </A></B>
<P>
After having said such things, it is unacceptable to abandon the 
defence  industries that cry out for government assistance. The 
government is turning a deaf ear to their pleas.
<P>
	Finally, the then opposition critic for Industry, Trade and 
Commerce admitted realistically that unless we develop a 
defence conversion policy for the 1990s, we could lose tens of 
thousands of jobs. If the present Liberal government is aware of 
all that, why does it not take action? They said so, they seem to 
have all the relevant information, they are aware that we will 
lose jobs, that we are already losing some-11,000 have been 
lost already-and it is escalating, but they take no action. 
During the last campaign, the key words for the Liberal Party to 
get elected were jobs, jobs, jobs. The government should make 
an effort in that area, they should give more assistance by 
making funds available to help defence industries make a 
conversion they are only too willing to make.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, these 
are comments of a general nature. The hon. member may wish to 
comment and he may not.
<P>
	It seems to me when we stand in this House and challenge the 
government, there is also an obligation upon us to provide some 
constructive alternatives as to how government approaches the 
matters of the day, the problems and issues facing all of us.
<P>
	In the hon. member's statements for example he mentioned 
that the military industry is an industry of the past. That may be 
true but an alternative, and one perhaps the government should 
look at soon, is to redefine the role of the military in Canada.
<P>
	Rather than challenging and saying the government is not 
doing anything, it would be far better to say it is time that 
government looked at some alternatives for using our military 
personnel. It should look at how our defence industry can be 
changed to meet the new environment in the global 
considerations facing us today. There was not a single 
constructive alternative for Canada that I heard in the hon. 
member's presentation, not a single one.
<P>
	The hon. member is asking questions about conversion, but 
what about the root problems that face Canada today: high 
taxation, a huge debt, an unstable dollar, an insecure economic 
community, high unemployment. There was not a single thing I 
heard that was a constructive alternative to addressing those 
issues and those are the root problems facing Canada today.
<P>
	We can talk about committees in this House that dither around 
in deciding that maybe they will do this today, maybe they will 
do that. Maybe it will be the defence committee that will look at 
the issue today or maybe it will be trade and industry. However it 
is our obligation and responsibility as members of this House to 
start looking at some of those root problems. We must start 
providing the government with some constructive alternatives 
rather than standing and complaining about a particular position 
Quebec is dealing with.  Unemployment in Quebec is every bit 
as much an issue for all of Canada.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to respond to those comments if 
he so wishes. I would be interested to hear what the hon. member 
has to say.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member who asked this question could read everything the 
Liberal Party said when it was in the opposition.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	All the alternatives are there. In my remarks, I blamed the 
government for its inaction. I did not criticize it for not doing the 
impossible. There are indeed ways to ease the conversion of our 
defence industries. The Bloc Quebecois suggested the 
establishment of an assistance fund. Incidentally, the Liberal 
Party agreed that such a fund should be set up to help the 
conversion of defence industries. Labour unions, the CNTU and 
the FTQ, and the Quebec Liberal government are waiting for 
some action on the part of the federal government, but I am sorry 
to say that nothing is forthcoming.
<P>
	In my riding, there is a plant that manufactures shells and 
gunpowder. Purchases by the Canadian army represented 70 per 
cent of its order book, but the Canadian army is buying less and 
less. That firm decided to convert its operations to cleaning up 
contaminated soil. It has professional engineers, architects, and 
chemists. A whole group of qualified employees work on that 
project, but they need government support. They do not 
necessarily need money, maybe just technical help, but they do 
need it. Yet, the government turns a deaf ear to their requests. 
True enough, we have a $500 billion debt, and we should not let 
it increase unduly. But we are letting unemployment rise. In the 
manufacturing industry, we lost 11,000 jobs in the last four 
years.
<P>
	The government spends $1 billion without flinching to create 
45,000 jobs, supposedly, through its infrastructure program. We 
are not asking the government to spend $1 billion on 
restructuring defence industries, but only to offer some kind of 
help to the people in those plants. Waiting for the plants to close 
and creating more unemployment is not going to help the 
economy either.
<P>
	We already have much too much unemployment, so this 
government should make it its duty to help the workers whose 
job is at risk before they lose it. As I was saying earlier, what 
good is it for the government, with its infrastructure program, to 
create jobs, on the one hand, if it does not help the defence 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3938"> 3938 </A></B>
<P>
industry workers and loses twice as many jobs, on the other? 
That is not progress, it is a setback.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to be given this 
opportunity to rise on this issue which is extremely important 
for many Quebecers.
<P>
	I would like to thank the hon. member opposite for drawing 
attention to the future of defence industries. Over the years, 
these industries have been creating many jobs in our province 
and will continue to do so.
<P>
	The future prosperity of defence industries is essential to 
Quebec's future prosperity as a part of Canada and North 
America. Quebec and its industries can adapt to technological 
changes and developments that are occurring in the world.
<P>
	Once again, I congratulate the hon. member for the interest 
that he is showing in asking this question, and I would like to 
speak on that major issue for a few minutes.
<P>
	In defence industries in Quebec, there are many small 
businesses and less than 20 medium or large businesses. These 
industries are very concentrated and the majority of sales are 
made by medium and large businesses.
<P>
	All these businesses, regardless of their size, have seen their 
defence product sales progressively decreased over the last 
years. And, in view of the shrinking of international military 
markets that is projected, we can assume that this trend will 
continue.
<P>
	Sales of defence products on European markets have radically 
decreased, causing the loss of 150,000 jobs in the last three 
years. This represents 10 per cent of the labour force in the 
aerospace and defence sector.
<P>
	In America, the experience is similar with large reductions in 
military procurement matched by significant job losses, more 
than 3,000 in the last three years. Both European and American 
industries have been faced with a serious industrial adjustment 
problem. In various countries, the government has responded in 
various ways. It is tempting to look to solutions such as those 
proposed in the United States for the problems facing Quebec's 
aerospace and defence industry.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	I believe we can learn from others. I am confident that some of 
the lessons we might learn from others in defence industry 
conversion are universally acceptable. For example, there are a 
number of internal and external obstacles to defence industry 
diversification and conversion. These include a narrow client 
base, lack of experience in export or commercial markets, 
over-engineered products and small product runs. External 
obstacles include shrinking global defence markets, difficulty in 
attracting capital and market protectionism among others.
<P>
	The various approaches adopted worldwide by governments 
to deal with their defence industry conversion problem all 
address these common elements but the approaches are often 
tailored to the particular circumstances unique to their defence 
industries.
<P>
	As a general rule, none of these programs envisage getting out 
of military markets. Instead the first goal of diversification is 
normally to retain a viably industrial base. Many governments 
have dealt with this issue in a regional or community 
perspective and have given their support accordingly.
<P>
	Many of them have set up committees where all parties 
concerned are represented, including governments, unions and 
the industry. The so-called dual use technologies-that have 
both civilian and military applications-are often a criterion on 
which governmental assistance for research and development is 
based.
<P>
	One of the key objectives of all those programs consists in 
maintaining knowledge-based industries and quality jobs 
related to the high technology which is part of those industries. 
The efforts we are making to help in the conversion of the 
defence industry in Quebec are within the spirit of that 
objective.
<P>
	Even though several of the approaches that I have just 
described could apply to the Quebec defence industrial base, I 
think that it would be wrong to use, for example, an 
American-style solution in Quebec. There are some noteworthy 
differences in the conversion of the defence industrial base in 
Quebec, in the United States and in other parts of the world like 
Europe.
<P>
	Basically, the conversion of the Canadian defence industrial 
base in Quebec is different and unique. Many Canadian defence 
industries in Quebec could be described more appropriately as 
aerospace and defence industries because, unlike many other 
countries, Quebec has diversified a lot of its production. It 
produces a great variety of commercial products and, of course, 
defence materiel.
<P>
	The Quebec industry is different, too, in another important 
area. The aerospace and the defence industries sell many of their 
products and services to world markets. Therefore, in order to 
succeed, it must produce first quality materiel at competitive 
prices. Like other Canadian industries in the aerospace and 
defence area, Quebec industries are looking for a ready market 
for high-tech products. They export sub-systems and 
components that are sold mainly to principal contractors in the 
aerospace and defence materiel area all over the world.
<P>
	This is remarkable. A country as small as Canada is sixth in 
the world for the sales of the aerospace and defence materiel 
sector, which exports between 70 and 80 per cent of its total 
production. We should be proud of those dynamic firms and 
their workers who bring a high contribution to the economy of 
the province of Quebec and of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3939"> 3939 </A></B>
<P>
	As my remarks show, Quebec industries in the area of 
aerospace and defence materiel are different in several regards 
from similar industries in other countries. I realize that several 
aerospace and defence materiel industries are facing an 
uncertain future in the years to come. Nevertheless I have 
reasons to believe that because of their achievements, the 
aerospace and defense materiel industries in Quebec are able 
and willing to meet that challenge.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	I hope I have clearly explained today the significance of 
recognizing the unique character of Quebec industries in the 
aerospace and defense materiel area. By building upon their 
relative force compared to the majority of the industries in the 
rest of the world, Quebec industries are well on the way to the 
diversification of their production and the conversion of their 
technology.
<P>
	As was announced recently in the budget, the federal 
government intends to change the Defence Industry 
Productivity Program in order to support the changes that the 
Quebec industry of aerospace and defense materiel is carrying 
out. I am confident that support from the federal and provincial 
governments for Quebec's aerospace and defence industry will 
help create the proper environment for the changes to continue.
<P>
	As I said before, given the very unique situation existing in 
Quebec, it is probably not appropriate to think about 
implementing solutions adopted in Europe and the United 
States. We all recognize that production diversification in the 
defence equipment industry presents many challenges. As we 
said earlier today, the task is not an easy one and there are no 
miracle cures. But it certainly does not mean problems are 
unsolvable. There is a solution and there will always be one.
<P>
	Some major efforts are being made in the private sector in 
Quebec and they benefit the aerospace and defence equipment 
industry. The government will continue to fully support those 
efforts to make sure this industry can continue to face the 
challenges and seize the opportunities which will arise in 
Quebec, in Canada and all over the world.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would like to know if the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General still intends to 
share his time with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Transport.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon 
(Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine):</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Very well. There will be a 
five minute period for questions and comments to the member 
who just spoke.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the speech of my colleague, a member from Quebec. 
I think he drew a good picture of the situation. He presented the 
facts globally, discussing the problem that could ensue.
<P>
	I have a question for him. Is it not the role of a responsible 
government to stimulate, encourage and assist the 
implementation of policies that could facilitate the conversion 
of defence industries? In this perspective, as a member of his 
caucus, is he committed to promoting such action so that 
ultimately, in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada, we really get a 
conversion policy that will allow regions to survive?
<P>
	As you know, 11,000 jobs have been lost in Quebec since 
1988. It is most important for us that the government, of which 
my colleague is a member, come up with solutions. It is about 
time they stop telling the House they are aware of the problem, 
that they know all about it. Everybody knows the problem but 
we are waiting for the government to take a firm stand. We 
expect this government that was elected to govern to present us 
with policies that would bring about a fast recovery in this sector 
and the conversion of the defence industry. I would like to hear 
his comments in this regard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this government has presented its job creation program 
in its Budget and, these last few weeks, through the Minister of 
Human Resources Development. New technologies are the order 
of the day, of course. The government would like Canadians and 
Quebecers to get more involved in sciences.
<P>
	I believe that diversification is in the cards for the near future. 
We know all about the defence industry, or rather its sorry state 
brought about by the end of the cold war. Since 1989-90, we 
have been living in a new world, a different world, and I believe 
that the government is committed to bringing about a greater 
diversification of Canadian industries to increase our 
competitiveness. I think that what we have achieved in the past 
six months-we have been in office six months already-for 
instance, the infrastructure program, the job creation program, 
the youth programs, the budget cuts, shows a certain maturity 
and exemplary fiscal responsibility. I believe that we are going 
to stay the course with regard not only to the military sector, but 
also to the Canadian industrial sector as a whole.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity to speak 
on this topic which is so important to a large number of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member opposite for focusing attention on the 
future of the defence industry. It is an industry which over the 
years has provided much employment across Canada and will do 
so in the future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3940"> 3940 </A></B>
<P>
	The future prosperity of the defence industry is vital to the 
future prosperity of Canada. As a vibrant part of Canada and 
North America, its industries can keep pace with global change 
and technological advancements.
<P>
	I applaud the interest of members in raising this question and I 
would like to speak for a few moments on this matter.
<P>
	European markets for defence sales have dropped remarkably 
leading to a loss of 150,000 jobs over the last three years. That is 
10 per cent of the workforce in the aerospace and defence sector.
<P>
	In America the experience is similar with large reductions in 
military procurement matched by significant job losses, more 
than 300,000 jobs in the last three years.
<P>
	Both European and American industries have been faced with 
a serious industrial adjustment program. In various countries 
governments have responded in various ways. It is tempting to 
look at solutions such as those proposed in the United States for 
the problems facing our industries.
<P>
	I believe we can learn from others. I am confident that some of 
the lessons which we might learn from others in 
defence/industrial conversions are universally applicable.
<P>
	The term defence/industrial base defies easy definition. 
Companies that make military products are obviously included 
but it is important to consider the broader picture. These are 
many firms that market commercial and dual-use products in 
addition to the military sales. Of course the military itself uses 
many of these products. For example when our peacekeeping 
troops needed a soft desert boot, not a normal item in the 
Canadian forces supply system, we bought commercial 
products.
<P>
	Another reason the defence industrial base is hard to define is 
that like all products military ones are composed of many 
components. When you get down to basics these components are 
pretty small, things like screws, nuts, bolts, washers, and rubber 
gaskets. One would not normally think of these as defence 
products but in fact we could not build military products without 
them.
<P>
	Having made these cautions I would like to provide a brief 
overview of Canada's defence industries. Canada's defence 
industrial base is quite small by world standards. Depending on 
how widely it is defined it contributes about 1 per cent to 1.5 per 
cent of Canada's GDP and about 70,000 jobs. That is about 1 per 
cent of the Canadian labour force.
<P>
	A large majority of the firms are small or medium in size, 
having sales below $100 million per year.
<P>
	The defence industry is largely foreign-owned, about 60 per 
cent, especially the larger firms.
<P>
	This is not to say that the defence industry is not important. 
While small it nevertheless contributes to Canada's economy in 
important ways. The products it produces generally fall within 
the realm of high technology, many of these at the leading edge.
<P>
	As a consequence it generates highly skilled, highly paid jobs 
which are not only nationally important but which also make a 
substantial contribution to both regional and local economies.
<P>
	Another main benefit derives from the fact that these 
companies are highly export oriented. These revenues help our 
balance of payments. The defence industry is highly specialized 
in niche markets such as subcomponents in aerospace, 
electronics and communications sectors.
<P>
	Our companies are well respected in specialized fields such as 
major aircraft components, flight simulators, satellite 
subsystems, unmanned air vehicles, armoured vehicle fire 
control systems and magnetic anomaly detection systems. Their 
successes in both the civilian and military markets improve the 
overall competitiveness of the Canadian economy.
<P>
	Along with the aerospace industry defence firms perform 
more R and D than the rest of the Canadian industry although 
somewhat less than their competitors in other major western 
nations. One finds defence industries throughout the country 
and the regional distribution has been slowly changing over 
time.
<P>
	The munitions sector is a small sector which produces 
excellent ammunition and small arms. Companies involved in 
this sector include SNC and Expro, Bristol Aerospace, and 
Diemaco in Ontario. This sector is naturally highly dependent 
on DND purchasing. Exports and export potential are modest. 
Reduced spending in this sector by both Canada and the U.S. 
presents a special challenge in this sector.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, Canada's defence and defence related 
industries are small but a vital sector of our economy. While the 
defence industry could never be considered to drive the 
economy it does make an important contribution in crucial high 
tech sectors.
<P>
	While Canadian shipyards have historically focused on the 
domestic market, St. John's Shipyards is currently exploring 
other marketing opportunities. In addition to its expertise in the 
commercial sector St. John's Shipyards has acquired valuable 
expertise in constructing naval vessels as a result of its contract 
for the Canadian patrol frigate. This expertise will assist the 
company in its search for offshore sales.
<P>
	The military vehicle sector is a very small, highly specialized, 
subset of the Canadian automotive sector. Two companies are 
currently producing vehicles for DND. Western Star located in 
Kelowna, B.C. produces DND's fleet of light trucks. In the great 
city of London, Ontario the diesel division of General Motors 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3941"> 3941 </A></B>
<P>
produces light armoured vehicles, the best in the world, with 
huge export markets.
<P>
	Efforts to market these vehicles internationally have been 
very successful. They are being sold in the United States and 
Saudi Arabia and further exports are likely.
<P>
	On the aerospace side it is estimated that the top four 
companies, Bombardier, Pratt and Whitney, Bell Helicopter and 
Spar, account for some 45 per cent of production. Defence sales 
represent about 25 per cent of their revenues. On the defence 
electronic side it is estimated that 80 per cent of the output is 
exported. There is significantly greater reliance on defence 
sales for revenue.
<P>
	This sector, particularly the aerospace side, is well positioned 
to survive reductions in defence spending. The defence 
electronic side is less well positioned and smaller companies 
with limited product lines and a high dependence on defence 
sales face greater challenges.
<P>
	The shipbuilding repair and marine equipment sector relies 
mainly on government procurement. There are few commercial 
opportunities. Despite the rationalization of shipyards in 
Ontario and Quebec and rationalization currently under way in 
B.C. excess capacity still exists in Canada.
<P>
	Historically, due to population density and patterns and the 
need for concentration of manufacturing for the war effort 
Canada's defence industries were highly concentrated in 
Ontario and Quebec. The defence industrial base is generally 
conceived as consisting of four main sectors. The largest sector 
is the aerospace and defence electronic sector which produces 
complete aircraft, various aircraft components and parts, 
navigation and space equipment and other defence electronic 
equipment. This is the most diversified sector by producing a 
mix of commercial, dual use and military products.
<P>
	I think it is important to note that this government's 
commitment is to ensure that the high skilled, high tech jobs that 
we have in the defence industry are maintained, that in fact we 
work toward transition of those industries where possible. But 
we must not forget that Canada needs a strong defence industry. 
Where applicable and where appropriate we will continue to do 
what we can to maintain that, but at the same time look at 
opportunities to be able to move into transition for those defence 
related industries which may find lesser and lesser markets in 
the future. We must make sure that we have adjustment 
programs for the workers, adjustment programs for the 
industries and take advantage of the great high skills that the 
workers have, as well as the high technology that the defence 
industries now have.
<P>
	We welcome this opportunity to debate this very important 
issue.

	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very 
carefully to my colleague opposite and I noticed that 
parliamentary secretaries speaking on this motion are fond of 
talking from an historic perspective. They paint a clear picture 
of the situation, which shows that they are well informed. 
However, as I said earlier, the government was elected to make 
decisions. Unfortunately, they are well aware of the problems. 
They know what is going on. Perhaps they should be sitting on 
this side of the House.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	However, since Canadians chose them to form the 
government, I think it is high time for them to stop reviewing the 
situation. While this government seems to have a very clear 
picture of all that is wrong, Canadians and Quebecers expect it 
to make decisions and to move forward.
<P>
	This morning, the minister spoke to us about the deficit. He 
said that he could not make any decisions at this time because of 
the deficit. During the election campaign, it was the 
Conservatives who focused on the deficit. The Liberals, on the 
other hand, talked about the jobs, jobs, jobs that they were going 
to create. But that does not seem to be happening now. The 
feeling in Canada is that we have simply traded in one 
government for another identical one. As far as this debate is 
concerned, nothing substantive has been put on the table.
<P>
	In conclusion, I have a question for my hon. colleague. Does 
he not feel that it is important for a government to stimulate, 
encourage and help private enterprise? In this particular area, 
11,000 jobs have been lost in Quebec and I think the government 
should be doing something. I would appreciate his comments on 
this point.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fontana:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question of the 
hon. member. He should realize that we have only been in 
government six months. We understand and our commitment to 
jobs has not wavered at all. In fact, some of the announcements 
that we have already made as a government with respect to the 
infrastructure program or support for small business or support 
for research and development will pay big dividends in terms of 
job creation.
<P>
	Our commitment to jobs is not any less today than it was 
before the election. Our red book talked extensively about a 
change in the economy. One of the changes in the economy is 
with respect to the defence sector. I think historically we should 
realize, and I tried to point this out in my speech, that in terms of 
what is happening in Europe and in the United States, Canada in 
fact is facing some of the same challenges.
<P>
	I hope the member is not suggesting that we close down the 
whole defence industry in this country because that is thousands 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3942"> 3942 </A></B>
<P>
and thousands of jobs. We realize there is a need for defence 
industries and we have some of the  best in the world right here 
in Canada, including in London, Ontario where we have many.
<P>
	In Quebec and B.C. we have great industries. They are serving 
a useful purpose. Whether or not that purpose is still justified 10 
or 15 years down the road no one knows. I think our red book 
says, and I would point this out to the member, that defence 
conversion consists really of three points: (1) redefining 
Canada's defence policy and the role of the military. As he 
knows there is consultation now on what that defence policy 
should be; (2) the rationalization of defence infrastructure, and 
that means looking at how we can assist these industries, 
communities and workers. As I said, these workers are very 
highly skilled, in high paying jobs. We need to look at how we 
can have adjustments for these workers; (3) the conversion of 
the defence industrial base to reduce the dependency on defence 
sales. I think that is important. We cannot cast out those 
industries and those workers just like that. We need to work with 
those companies, utilize their highly skilled workers, utilize 
their high technologies and be able to look for commercial 
applications of those things.
<P>
	The member should realize, as I tried to define in my speech, 
that certain materials and certain parts produced by certain 
companies are not only defence related industries. They, in fact, 
serve a dual purpose. We ought to take advantage of making sure 
that this country faces the new economy by relying on the high 
skilled jobs that the defence industries have and also their 
technology.
<P>
	We are prepared to work with those members and all members 
to ensure that we provide employment in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the whip of the Reform Party I would like to advise the 
House that pursuant to Standing Order 43(2) our speakers on this 
motion will be dividing their time.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Before I speak to the motion, I would like to address some 
remarks made earlier by the member for 
Beauharnois-Salaberry who evidenced some concern with the 
aspect that the standing joint committee on defence was not 
addressing the problem that we are dealing with in this motion 
today.
<P>
	I would like to go on record as saying that my concept of the 
standing joint committee on defence policy is to establish what 
it is that Canadians want from their defence department. He 
mentioned that we are travelling across the country and this is 
true. We are travelling from coast to coast. We are visiting every 
capital with the view of seeing informed Canadians on the 
aspect of defence and also to talk to people off the street who 
want to come in and make their views known.
<P>
	We are also going to Europe and to the United States to 
establish with the appropriate agencies the importance of the 
Canadian defence contribution to their plans and our plans for 
mutual defence and obviously now in security.
<P>
	The main thing I think that we want to do is establish a criteria 
whereby the security of the world is enhanced and thereby 
Canada's ability to operate in the world both industrially and 
tradewise will be better.
<P>
	As I see it, the motion submitted by the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is basically a demand for more funds 
to support industrial conversion. There is in my mind a defence 
aspect to this, but a very minor one. This is basically a matter of 
industry.
<P>
	The defence aspect of it I will discuss a little later, but right 
now I would like to speak to the industrial aspect of it. The 
defence industry productivity program, a program whereby the 
federal government gives some $200 million-plus to various 
defence industries to support research and development and 
defence aspects, has been in place for some time.
<P>
	In point of fact during our election campaign, the Reform 
Party was against this program. The rationale for that was that if 
private industry and private citizens do not see the value of 
investing in such programs, why should the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	Since my election I have been approached by a number of 
people in these industries and they have pointed out that there is 
a very valid reason for this. In fact there is a good repayment 
program. I accept this and am willing to look at it again, but I 
also know that in some cases this money has been granted to 
very dubious projects and that there has been a tremendous 
amount of this money that has just disappeared never to be 
returned to the Canadian government.
<P>
	The defence industry covers many sectors. Among them I 
would mention aerospace, electronics, ship construction, 
aircraft construction including many components, avionics and 
communications mainly involved in the defence area in 
command and control but very, very adaptable to civil industries 
as well.
<P>
	Many of these companies have international links which 
provides them access to merging technologies and global 
markets. A great deal of Canada's high tech industry in fact has 
evolved from defence research and development or procurement 
projects. There are some 800 companies employing over 60,000 
people who are active in the defence related industries in 
Canada.
<P>
	The Canadian Defence Preparedness Association provided a 
briefing to the standing joint committee the day before 
yesterday. They represent some 60 companies and said 
categorically that they have had great success at conversion.
<P>
	The Aerospace Industries Association of Canada, which 
represents a large number of companies in this field, is evidence 
again of a very successful conversion program from defence to 
civil industries. In the past their ratio of output went from 70 per 
cent defence and 30 per cent civil to today, where it is exactly 
reversed. Their output now is about 30 per cent defence and 70 
per cent civil.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3943"> 3943 </A></B>
<P>
	This is where I am getting back to the impact of how industry 
impacts on defence. Obviously there are certain industries 
where Canada must retain a defence production capability and 
it is in those areas that I think the government should be 
involved. They may not be completely economical but they are 
of overriding importance to our ability to maintain a defence 
posture and government may have a place in there. It is not only 
prudent but necessary that government may do this.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	However I think basically it should be left to the managers of 
industry to decide how they run their businesses, what products 
they get into and which avenues they should follow.
<P>
	It brings a question to mind that if government directs the 
conversion of industries from defence to civil, does the 
government also then have to assume some responsibility for the 
success of those companies? If they move them from an area 
where there has only been a defence relationship into a civil one 
and the company fails, does that mean the government has to 
pick up the tab for that? I do not think that is the way it should 
be. I think that is an industry situation which should be covered 
by the industrial manager.
<P>
	Indeed if the conversion is into an area where there is already 
a surfeit, too much capability, it could in fact result not only in 
the company that converted into that area failing but also other 
companies that were in there. There is a rollover effect there.
<P>
	I think it is without any question the responsibility of the 
managers of industry to find and occupy the appropriate niches. 
If I may use the analogy, there is not much call for chariots any 
more, so a chariot manufacturer would not be a very viable 
occupation or a business. But that company might very well 
develop into bicycles or cars. On the other hand they have to 
accept the fact that there are many other competitors and they 
would have to be prepared to meet that competition.
<P>
	It is the responsibility of the industry concerned to say this is 
no longer viable and where are we going to go to maintain our 
industry.
<P>
	I think there is a place for government in industry in providing 
support. That support should be in the areas of perhaps 
providing a strategic analysis, to say to industry: ``This is where 
we see Canada emerging, this is where we see the marketplace 
going, this is an area that you might look at to exploit in future''.
<P>
	I think government, as the minister said earlier, should be in 
the business of, wherever possible, removing barriers to trade. 
We should enhance the ability of our industries to compete on 
the world market. We should not subsidize them; we should 
enhance their ability to do it on their own.
<P>
	I think probably the most tremendous impact the government 
could have on our industry, whether it be defence, whether it be 
civil or whether it be the conversion thing, is to bring the 
spending habits of the government back into line to balance the 
budget, to lower taxes. This in itself, in and of itself, would 
create a far more vibrant industry, it would result in far greater 
employment and to a large extent it would solve the problem that 
we are dealing with.
<P>
	In conclusion I would just like to say that I do not believe that 
the government has too much place in the conversion from 
defence to civil industries. Certainly as I have mentioned, there 
is a road clearing process that it could do to remove the barriers, 
to enhance the trade, to indulge or enter into trade agreements, 
reciprocal agreements with other countries and other areas. 
Other than that I think the industrial base of a country should be 
run by the industrial managers who are concerned with it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
if I may have the indulgence of my hon. colleagues in the House, 
I would like to read the opposition motion. For those watching 
on TV who might have just joined us, it might be interesting for 
them to know exactly what we are discussing.
<P>
	In the affairs of this House the opposition parties from time to 
time have the opportunity to bring forth subjects of debate. We 
get relatively short notice. I think it is quite interesting that we 
get relatively short notice, perhaps as much as a day in some 
instances, and we then debate the issue brought forward by the 
opposition.
<P>
	Today the Bloc has brought forward this opposition motion 
which is being debated in the House:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for its unacceptable delays in 
developing and implementing a genuine strategy for the conversion of defence 
industries to civilian production, which would save and create new jobs in high 
technology sectors.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not know if I want to condemn the government for not 
doing this. There are many, many things we could condemn the 
government for, but I do not think this is one of them.
<P>
	It is my opinion the government should keep its fingers out of 
business and out of the marketplace. It should let the 
marketplace decide who will be the winners, who will be the 
losers, who will be successful and who will not. It is survival of 
the fittest.
<P>
	Why was it such a big shock to the defence industries that they 
were going to have to change? Was it because it happened 
overnight? Did we have this incredible industrial military 
complex that drove the economy and the country? No, it did not; 
and no, we have not.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3944"> 3944 </A></B>
<P>
	Canada has never had a particularly large military industrial 
complex. Most of our sophisticated military equipment was 
purchased offshore. Many members would know, as would 
those watching, that one of the blackest days in the history of 
our country, at least in my opinion, was the cancellation of the 
Avro Arrow. By and large that put Canada right out of the high 
tech aerospace industry. Ever since that time we have been 
trying to force feed industry into areas of the country that may 
or may not need it, that may or may not get the industry because 
of political connections, political power, or power of the voter.
<P>
	I submit that our country can no longer afford to artificially 
pick winners and losers. The fact of the matter is that if our 
world has changed and our country's defence posture has 
changed to the extent that the defence industries in a particular 
part of Canada, whether it is in Ontario or Quebec, are harmed 
because things change, then so be it.
<P>
	It is up to those industries to convert or to find another use for 
their capital, for their people, for their industries. If they do not, 
they have every right to go out of business just like anybody 
else. Were this not the defence industry, if this were an industry 
of garment makers in Winnipeg, would we be having a debate in 
this House today that this House would condemn the 
government for not supporting garment workers in Winnipeg? I 
think we would not.
<P>
	I want to acknowledge the help given by the Canadian 
Defence Preparedness Association in preparing the background 
paper I am using in my debate. It is interesting to note that 
Canada's defence industry, like most industry in Canada, is 
concentrated in Ontario and Quebec. For example, western 
Canada and Atlantic Canada each contain about 15 per cent of 
the total defence industry, whereas 70 per cent is in Ontario and 
Quebec, with 40 per cent in Ontario and 30 per cent in Quebec.
<P>
	It is generally a high tech industry which is research and 
development intensive. That is particularly and precisely the 
kind of industry we want. However research and development in 
high tech industry is industry that depends upon the people who 
are part of that industry to stay alive. It is a fast moving industry. 
What is unique and innovative today could be tomorrow's hash 
browns.
<P>
	We cannot have the government deciding where the high tech 
industry is going to be. The marketplace has to decide where the 
high tech industry will be and who will be the winners and 
losers.
<P>
	It is also very interesting to note that according to this paper 
70 per cent of the output of the manufacturing of the so-called 
defence industry in Canada is for the commercial or the civil 
market. At the same time, 70 per cent of this defence market we 
have in Canada supplies 70 per cent of the requirements for the 
Canadian defence department. That tells me that our defence 
industries in Canada by and large are already fairly diverse. 
They are  not, as they are for example in many places in the 
United States, entirely dependent on the manufacture of one 
item, such as an aircraft. For instance, in Canada we have seen 
nothing like the decimation of the aircraft industry in San Diego. 
It was highly dependent on military contracts for all of the 
research and development. The defence budget in the United 
States as compared to ours is just absolutely enormous.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	We do not have the same critical mass in the defence industry 
to start with and our defence industry, although concentrated 
primarily in Ontario and Quebec, is fairly balanced between 
these two provinces. It is not totally 100 per cent dependent on 
military manufacturing to stay in business according to this 
paper. That seems to me to be a fairly solid and a fairly good way 
to run a business.
<P>
	Historically as a nation there are some areas where we have 
decided we were going to pay a premium in order to maintain an 
industry of our own. One is ammunition manufacturing. I think 
there is a place in Toronto that manufactures ammunition. 
Ammunition could be purchased offshore but we buy our 
ammunition at home.
<P>
	I wonder whether free trade and the relationship we have 
under the GATT, but particularly under NAFTA, would allow for 
this kind of protectionism anyway.
<P>
	I would also point out to my hon. friends that one of the 
reasons that people in other parts of Canada who do not directly 
benefit from the manufacturing heartland of central Canada, 
being Ontario and Quebec, just go crazy is the fact that it always 
seems to be necessary to protect the manufacturing base in 
central Canada. We have this insane situation even as I speak 
that we have to negotiate to break down interprovincial trade 
barriers.
<P>
	We have 11 governments at the table trying to negotiate the 
decimation of these insane trade barriers. Think about it. That is 
more people at the table negotiating the removal of trade 
barriers within Canada than were sitting at the table to negotiate 
the removal of the trade barriers between the United States, 
Mexico and Canada. There were only three parties at that table 
and we have 11 in Canada.
<P>
	We are debating a motion on whether our government, our 
taxpayers, people earning 10 bucks an hour, paying two or three 
bucks an hour taxes, should come to the federal government so it 
can decide who will be the winners and who will be the losers 
and we find ourselves subsidizing an industry for which there is 
no need.
<P>
	We have to break down the trade barriers within Canada so we 
can be competitive within Canada. If we cannot be competitive 
within our own borders how on earth can we presume to be 
competitive in the world environment?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3945"> 3945 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us put the horse before the cart. Let us get rid of internal 
trade barriers. Let us get our construction, our manufacturing, 
our capital resources, our people working together, and let us 
let the marketplace pick the winners and then compete 
world-wide. I submit that if we take that kind of approach we 
will be winners the world over because we can compete without 
government help, without government subsidy in any market 
in the world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope one 
day people like the hon. member for Calgary Centre will give up 
their ideological vision and understand the real economic 
situation in Canada and other countries.
<P>
	The hon. member said that the military sector is 
fundamentally a high-tech industry, and we know full well that 
it will become less and less important in the years to come in 
North America, and even more so in the United States than here, 
in Canada. We should not forget that the American companies 
are our main competitors.
<P>
	For many, many years, most of the federal research and 
development subsidies went to defence industries, in areas like 
telecommunications, development of new products or 
aeronautics. Governments used a good deal of their research and 
development subsidies for military purposes, because they 
wanted the armed forces to be in the vanguard of progress in 
aviation and telecommunications. Also, the development of new 
products was always crucial to the other two sectors. That is why 
the United States have a competitive edge in these sectors, 
where research and development is concerned. Now, of course, 
we must seek new ways of doing things. We are indeed in favour 
of the reduction in military production, but at the same time we 
must ensure that all of the research and the discoveries that can 
serve civilian purposes are not abandoned simply because some 
of these businesses go bankrupt tomorrow morning, after the 
government decides all of a sudden to cancel major contracts, 
like it just did with the helicopter deal.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	For our country to be competitive at the international level, 
we need more than rhetoric; we cannot only tell the government 
never to interfere. We have to take into account the source of our 
competitiveness. Obviously, for years, the defence industry has 
been one of the main sources of our competitiveness in the 
non-military sector. The Americans set up a program for the 
conversion of defence industries to civilian production. They 
also developed alternative national strategies in areas like R and 
D, telecommunications, development of new products and 
aeronautics. They now have alternative strategies to replace the 
defence industry as instrument of R and D.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is only suggesting today that the 
government give us precisely what our competitors are getting. 
We can talk about being competitive at the international level 
and revel in rhetoric, but 80 per cent of our business, especially 
in the industrial sector, is with the United States. Thus, we need 
the tools, we need a transition process to maintain our 
competitiveness.
<P>
	As you said it yourself, these businesses have already decided 
to go for the civilian market. We just have to get things moving 
toward conversion from defence to civilian production, since we 
must cut substantially our military spendings to reduce the 
government's budget and deficit. And this must be achieved 
without ever losing our competitiveness in the high tech sector. 
That sums up the precise and straightforward position of the 
Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I respect my hon. colleague's 
opinion and I share some of the opinions he just put forward.
<P>
	However there is a contradiction. I recall in my presentation 
saying that if there was an epiphenomenal moment in Canada 
where we said goodbye to high tech it was when we said goodbye 
to the Avro Arrow 35 years or so ago. We were world leaders and 
we said goodbye to it. Ever since that time we have relied on 
offshore industries for our high tech aircraft or high tech 
defence materiel. The nucleus, the germ of it comes from 
offshore. I agree 100 per cent.
<P>
	Therefore, if I agree with that and the contention that my hon. 
colleague brought forward, he must also agree that if we are 
getting that high tech initiative offshore we cannot also be 
getting it onshore. We cannot depend on both. The defence 
industry has been a high tech driver in Canada. Of that there is 
no question.
<P>
	We look at the satellites and Canadarm and those kinds of 
things. They could be considered defence and defence oriented, 
but those things are not going to come to an end. We are still 
going to have satellites going up. We should all say a prayer for 
Anik E2 up there somewhere. God knows what it is doing. 
However, the whole high tech industry is not going to dry up and 
go away.
<P>
	We need the vision of the people who are the shareholders of 
those companies that were in that business. That is what their 
job is. The job of the directors of those companies is to 
anticipate, to see where they should be putting their energies in 
the future. Perhaps it is in the environment. Perhaps it is in 
extracting minerals from difficult places.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	My point is that it is not the role of government to decide what 
that initiative should be. It should be the role of industry and the 
owners of industry. They will do a far better job than we will. 
When we went through our orientation, no one said all of a 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3946"> 3946 </A></B>
<P>
sudden when we passed  through these doors that we would 
become venture capitalists with the ability to pick winners and 
losers in the marketplace. It did not happen.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this topic 
which is so important to a large number of Quebecers. I would 
like to thank the hon. member opposite for focusing attention on 
the future of the defence industry. It is an industry which over 
the years has provided much employment in the province of 
Quebec and will continue to do so.
<P>
	The future prosperity of the defence industry is vital to the 
future prosperity of Quebec. As a vibrant part of Canada and 
North America, Quebec and its industry can keep pace with 
global change and technological advancement.
<P>
	I applaud the interest of the member in raising this question 
and I would like to speak for a few minutes on this important 
matter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Quebec defence industry is made up of many small 
companies and fewer than 20 medium to large ones, the vast 
majority of sales being made by the latter.
<P>
	All these companies, small and large alike, have seen their 
defence sales dwindle over the past few years. In light of the 
falling business activity on the defence markets, it is reasonable 
to assume that this trend could well persist.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	European markets for defence sales have dropped remarkably, 
leading to a loss of 150,000 jobs over the last three years. That is 
10 per cent of the workforce in the aerospace and defence sector.
<P>
	In America, the experience is similar, with large reductions in 
military procurement matched by significant job losses, more 
than 3,000 in the last three years. Both European and American 
industries have been faced with a serious industrial adjustment 
problem.
<P>
	In various countries, government has responded in various 
ways. It is tempting to look to solutions such as those proposed 
in the United States for the problems facing Quebec's aerospace 
and defence industry.
<P>
	I believe we can learn from others. I am confident that some of 
the lessons we might learn from others in defence industrial 
conversion are universally acceptable. For example, there are a 
number of internal and external obstacles to diversification and 
defence conversion.
<P>
	These include a narrow client base, lack of experience in 
export and commercial markets, over-engineered products and 
small product runs. External obstacles include shrinking global 
defence markets, difficulty in attracting capital and market 
protectionism among others.
<P>
	The various approaches adopted world-wide by governments 
to deal with their defence industrial conversion problem all 
address these common elements but the approaches are often 
tailored to the particular circumstances unique to their 
particular defence industries.
<P>
	As a general rule, none of these programs envisage getting out 
of military markets. Instead the first goal of diversification is 
normally to retain a viable industrial base. Many governments 
have approached this question as a regional or community issue 
focusing their support accordingly.
<P>
	Many have formed committees involving all of the 
stakeholders concerned including government, trade unions and 
industry. The so-called dual use technologies, commercial and 
military, are often a criterion for government R and D support.
<P>
	One key objective of all these programs is to maintain 
knowledge, intensive industries and the high quality, high 
technology employment which is part of it.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member has just begun her statement 
and she will have priority when we resume debate.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House 
will now proceed to Statements by Members pursuant to 
Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the week of May 1 to May 7, 1994 is Spinal Health Week. The 
program was established in 1985 to initiate and maintain good 
spinal health habits in children.
<P>
	It is sponsored annually by the Ontario Chiropractic 
Association, a voluntary membership organization that 
represents more than 1,350 Ontario chiropractors. Its objective 
is to provide public education and promote research to improve 
the quality of health care for the citizens of Ontario.
<P>
	Eight out of ten Canadians suffer from back pain during their 
lifetime. The incidence is increasing. A healthy lifestyle 
including proper posture, exercise and good nutrition is the key 
to prevention.
<P>
	Please join me in wishing the Ontario Chiropractic 
Association a very successful Spinal Health Week.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of 
the promises contained in the infamous red book pertains to 
accountability. However, when key questions of importance are 
asked in question period relating to federal overspending, health 
care, native self-government and criminal justice, the 
government consistently demonstrates an unwillingness or 
inability to answer.
<P>
	The only time the government answers any questions is when 
one of its own members asks the Liberal question of the day.
<P>
	We on this side of the House are asking legitimate questions 
affecting the lives of Canadians. Where is the accountability and 
when will question period become answer period? Canadians 
want and deserve straight, hard answers to these questions. 
Reformers will keep demanding the government fulfils its 
promise to be more open and accountable.

Israel and the PLO signed in Cairo an historical agreement 
regarding Palestinian self-government.
<P>
	Following several decades of political and military conflict, 
Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat have agreed on an action plan 
for the creation of a Palestinian territory in the Gaza Strip and in

	This agreement marks the begining of the end of a long and

apprehensions persist on both sides, but it is now up to the 
parties to show their good will and lay the foundations for 
co-operation between the Israeli and Palestinian people.

year the Canadian Forestry Association bestows on a 
municipality the title of forestry capital of Canada.
<P>
	I am proud to inform the House that the city of Edmonton was 
chosen as the 1994 forest capital. I am delighted that the people 
of Edmonton have been recognized for their commitment to 
promoting the  contribution of urban and rural forests to the 
city's environment, economy and social development.
<P>
	Edmonton is a green city, noted for having one of the largest 
urban parkland areas per capita in all North America. These 
forested areas are enjoyed by local residents and by numerous 
visitors. Edmonton is also the gateway to the huge northern 
forest lands of Alberta which are becoming increasingly 
important to the diversification of Alberta's economy and to 
Canada's forest sector as a whole.

We must welcome in our country these children held captive of a 
blind war which turns their lives into hell on earth. We cannot 
remain insensitive to their plight because by failing to act, we 
would in fact be condoning this war and its inhumane 
consequences.

children of Bosnia. All the children of Bosnia will carry the 
psychological scars for many years to come.

	Do those who have unleashed this madness in the name of 
some twisted notion of a greater nation not realize that the 
welfare and happiness of children is the future of their nation? 
Do they not realize that inflicting the suffering they have on

<P>
	Violent fighting continues between the Rwandan army and the 
rebels. This massacre which has already killed at least 200,000 
people must stop. However, the UN assistance mission to 
Rwanda, now reduced to some 449 soldiers, is completely 
overwhelmed. Faced with his humanitarian responsibilities, the 
UN Secretary General has asked the Security Council to send 
peacekeeping reinforcements to Rwanda.
<P>
	Can the Deputy Prime Minister tell us whether Canada 
intends to support the request of the UN Secretary General and 
make a direct contribution to the reinforcements requested by 
Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali?

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

Affairs clearly stated yesterday that Canada intended to call on 
the UN Secretary General to help find a solution to Rwanda's 
problems.
<P>
	We are very, very concerned about the thousands of people 
now in refugee camps and also very, very disappointed with the 
continuing massacre. We are currently talking about the 
possibility of broader intervention.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, beyond concern and disappointment, I think that 
Quebecers and Canadians expect the government to indicate 
clearly what it intends to do,  especially with regard to a very 
specific proposal from the UN Secretary General himself.
<P>
	So what is Canada's position on this request: is it yes or no? In 
particular, I would ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether she 
admits that, without a UN intervention force, it is totally 
impossible to set up any medical or humanitarian operation that 
Rwandans so urgently need.

continue to be on the ground both with a physical presence and

Canada because of our international policies and aid programs. 
We have had a presence in that country for close to 100 years. 
What are we doing to prevent this slaughter? Some rivers are 
now jammed with the bodies of the people killed. We must go 
beyond words.

force would prompt the rebels and the Rwandan army to 
negotiate a ceasefire that would end these barbarous events

by the Federal Court of Appeal on the taxation of child-support

Act was discriminatory, because it treated differently divorced

support and custody?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

suggesting another referendum but I think he is.
<P>
	Probably in the long run this is going to depend a lot on how 
the aboriginal people govern themselves. The way they govern 
themselves now is to always go back to the people. They go back 
to the people much more than we do. They have more 
self-government now. I see some of the hon. members nodding. 
Anybody who has done aboriginal work realizes that they are

they are now.

question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Yesterday, in his 
press conference, the Prime Minister, far from being more 
sympathetic to the provinces' reluctance regarding the social 
program reform, said that he would go ahead with it.
<P>
	Will the Deputy Prime Minister confirm that her government 
intends to proceed with the social program reform one way or 
another, as the Prime Minister said, and even without the 
provinces' support?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

said yesterday is exactly what he has been saying since the 
beginning of our mandate. We are negotiating in good faith to 
find a solution. Obviously, if we cannot come to a solution, we 
will proceed only in those fields which are under federal 
jurisdiction. This is exactly the position adopted by the 
Opposition leader when he disagreed with his government 
during certain negotiations, in 1989.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can the 
Deputy Prime Minister reconcile her comments with the fact 
that, except for unemployment insurance, all the other areas 
which would be included in the reform are under provincial 
jurisdiction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

keeps saying that he wants to find good solutions. What is most 
important to him, and what should be most important to all 
politicians, is to have jobs for workers. Unemployed people in 
Montreal, Shawinigan or Dolbeau are very interested in 
government projects but less interested in federal-provincial 
bickering. We are trying to use a fair and equitable approach and 
we are negotiating in good faith.

climate created in this House is the one the member from the

<P>

an important document for job creation in this country. It just so

millions and millions in Canadian investments for projects in 
Quebec which will give jobs to real workers and not to those who 
refuse to work and just keep bitching.

question is for the President of the Treasury Board. I certainly 
expect an answer, not like that last outrage that my colleague 
got.
<P>
	A recently released Treasury Board report indicated that the 
federal government spent $5.2 billion last year contracting out 
services. Talk about a place to cut in this budget. That report did 
not indicate who received the contracts, on what basis the 
contracts were issued, and how values for these contracts were 
established.
<P>
	To clarify this situation I would like to ask the President of the 
Treasury Board to immediately table all information that his 
department has currently. Also, will he indicate from 1990 on 
what those contracts were?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the information that the member refers to is part of the review of 
efficiency of programs that we are undertaking with the public 
sector employee representatives, the unions, in an effort to find 
savings in government spending so, as we said in the budget, we 
can help to shorten the period of the wage freeze. Information 
was provided to that extent.
<P>
	We are still undergoing our review of contracting and 
contracting out. I might add that that $5 billion does not just 
include the kind of contracting out that the unions are concerned 
about but includes all contracting; everything from doctors for 
aboriginal communities in the north, for example, to the 
repairing of planes and ships for the Department of National 
Defence.
<P>
	Certainly whatever information we can provide for the 
member and for other hon. members of the House we are quite 
willing to provide as part of the review of contracting out which 
will be dealt with not only by the Treasury Board but also by the 
government operations standing committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I thank the hon. 
minister for a decent answer, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	More than 36,000 of these contracts were issued in 1992-93 
alone. Some suspect that the contracts were given to friends of 
government rather than being issued on the basis of merit. This 
report also indicates that contracts were granted without public 
scrutiny and almost half were issued without a tender process.

	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board

<P>
	There has been more troubling revelations regarding the 
Canadian Museum of Nature. This morning, at a press 
conference, representatives of the science community asked that 
the questionable lay-off of several scientists be investigated in 
view of the fact that it has far-reaching consequences. It gives a 
bad name to the museum and jeopardizes its research activities 
as a whole.
<P>
	Given these new facts, is the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
willing to reconsider and, without delay, ask for a public inquiry 
with a view to hearing the testimony of all the people involved in 
this matter?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I have already had the opportunity to speak several 
times on the problems that have been brought to light regarding 
this museum.
<P>
	The person I rely on in this matter is the Auditor General of 
Canada who has the trust not only of the government but also of 
this House. He said he would perform a special in-depth audit of 
the museum's operations and finances. I understand that the 
museum board of directors has requested that this audit be 
conducted without delay. Once we have all the facts and the 
Auditor General's conclusion, we will be able to pass 
judgement.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr.

responsibility in Canada to perform basic, theoretical and 
applied research, and that any delay, given the time it will take 
the Auditor General to conduct an audit and elected 
representatives to hold a public inquiry, seriously jeopardizes 
the mission of the museum and its reputation in the scientific 
community?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member's remarks, which are more a comment 
than a question, start from the premise that the museum is guilty 
as charged, even before we have the facts and know what is

	The future of the Canadian military Sea King fleet is once 
again before the public with the recent crash of a Sea King at the 
cost of two lives with two other airmen seriously injured.
<P>
	Although meticulously maintained many of these aircraft are 
older than the pilots that fly them and there is a need for the 
government to make a decision soon to replace this fleet.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of National Defence if he can assure this 
House of the airworthiness of the remaining Sea King fleet and 
indeed will he give a commitment that this government does 
intend to replace these aircraft?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
would like to acknowledge that we extend our sympathy to the 
families of the two airmen killed and the other two that were 
seriously injured in this particular crash.
<P>
	I know it is of great concern to the hon. member because these 
helicopters are based at CFB Shearwater in the hon. member's 
constituency. These helicopters are well maintained, otherwise 
we would not fly them.
<P>
	This party in the election campaigned against the EH-101 
helicopter because we felt it was too expensive a solution for the 
helicopter needs of the government. We never denied that there 
would have to be some replacement at some point in time for the 
Sea Kings. The Sea Kings are airworthy until the year 2000.
<P>
	I want to assure the hon. member and other colleagues in the 
House that we intend to fly them. They will do the search and 
rescue work and other naval reconnaissance and anti-submarine 
patrols. They will keep flying until the year 2000 because they 
will be well maintained.

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

Minister for Human Resources Development launched an 
analysis of the whole issue of how we work.
<P>
	In fact not only limitations on overtime, but job sharing, 
flexible work hours and different ways of working are 
challenges that we have to face to meet the needs of the real 
workforce.
<P>
	I happen to know in my own constituency at the steel company 
there are many people who would like to be called back to work, 
but unfortunately overtime sometimes prevents that. That is one 
of the things that the minister's panel is looking at but there is 
certainly no legislation proposed at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister's 
statement of yesterday implies that hard working people are the 
cause of unemployment.
<P>
	Using the minister's logic, if the Deputy Prime Minister 
herself worked overtime she would be contributing to 
unemployment.
<P>
	Will the Deputy Prime Minister not agree that her minister's 
logic and her own logic are flawed and do not address the real 
problem in this country, that high taxes are forcing people to 
work longer hours and high deficits and debt are causing 
unemployment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

Human Resources Development is recognizing is what many 
Canadians are recognizing and that is the workforce is changing 
drastically.

	In the old days we could expect to work specific hours of the

time? Is it possible for us to look at job sharing so that for 
example women who may have home responsibilities could 
comfortably combine those with paid work outside the home?

to hold a public inquiry. Yet, some troubling points remain and 
since the minister wants to know the facts, does he not think that

conclusions of the report?
<P>

	The <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> and the member for Waterloo have both

question is for the justice minister.
<P>
	Today, if Scott Farion from Edmonton were alive, he would be 
celebrating his 18th birthday. Instead, his life was cut short 
when he became Edmonton's first murder victim of 1994. So 
today his parents are grieving their loss rather than enjoying his 
birthday.

violent crimes among other things. I have made that clear.
<P>
	Let me go on to say that in the face of such tragedies, it is 
important in my respectful view to bear in mind that the simple 
change of a statute or enacting another law is not going to 
change much unless at the same time we come to grips with the 
conditions that lead to this kind of offence.
<P>
	This government is committed not only to the kind of 
effective legislation we need, and the member will see it soon,

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt):</B> 
Madam Speaker, one key objective of the government in 
introducing these programs is to maintain knowledge in 
intensive industries and the high technology employment which 
is part of it. This, of course, is also an objective of our efforts to 
assist in the conversion of the Quebec defence industry.
<P>
	While many of the approaches which I have just outlined 
would be applicable to the Quebec defence industry, I believe it 
would be a mistake to try to impose, for example, a U.S. style 
solution to the Quebec situation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A number of quite marked differences exist in terms of 
defence industry conversion between Quebec and the United 
States and even other parts of the world, like Europe.
<P>
	Basically, the Quebec defence industry conversion is unique 
and different from any other. A fair number of defence 
industries in Quebec would be more appropriately referred to as 
aerospace and defence industries. I say this because, unlike 
many of its international competitors, the Quebec defence 
industry has already diversified its production considerably. It 
is producing a wide range of commercial and defence products.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Quebec's industry is unique in another important respect, one 
in which we should all take pride. Quebec's aerospace and 
defence sector sells a large proportion of its products and 
services in world markets. To do this successfully it must, and in 
fact do, produce world class products at competitive prices.
<P>
	Like the rest of the Canadian aerospace and defence industry, 
Quebec firms focus on high technology market niches. They 
export subsystems and components sold primarily to aerospace 
and defence prime contractors in countries around the world.
<P>
	This is a remarkable achievement. A country as small as 
Canada ranks sixth in the world in total aerospace and defence 
sales, with between 70 and 80 per cent of all production exported 
to other countries.
<P>
	We should be proud of these companies and of the workers in 
these dynamic industries who make this significant contribution 
to the economies of Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	As my comments indicate, Quebec's aerospace and defence 
industries are in many ways different from their counterparts in 
other areas of the world. I realize that many aerospace and 
defence firms face uncertain prospects in the years that lie 
ahead. But I am also confident that based on their past track 
record Quebec's aerospace and defence industries can and will 
rise to this challenge.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I hope I have demonstrated today the importance of 
recognizing how unique the Quebec aerospace and defence 
industries are. By building on their relative strength in relation 
with the majority of industries in the rest of the world, Quebec 
industries are well on the way to diversifying their production 
and converting their technologies.
<P>
	As mentioned recently in the budget, the federal government 
intends to change the Defence Industry Productivity Program 
(DIPP) in support of changes in the Quebec aerospace and 
defence industry. I have good hope that all the support provided 
by both the federal and the provincial governments to the 
Quebec aerospace and defence industry will foster conditions 
favourable to the pursuit of changes.
<P>
	As I said earlier, given the unique circumstances of Quebec, it 
may not be appropriate to consider applying in that case 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3960"> 3960 </A></B>
<P>
solutions used in the United States or in  Europe. We all 
recognize that product diversification in the defence industry 
presents multiple difficulties. As indicated earlier today, this is 
no small task and there is no quick fix.
<P>
	But this does not mean that problems cannot be resolved. 
They can and will continue to be resolved. Major efforts are 
already being made by the private sector, efforts which are 
proving successful in the Quebec aerospace and defence 
industry.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government will continue to be a full partner in these 
efforts to ensure that this industry continues to deal successfully 
with the challenges and the opportunities which will come to 
Quebec in the future.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister):</B> Madam Speaker, we have had much discussion on 
the commitment of the government to defence conversion. 
Indeed we have indicated in both the Liberal plan for Canada 
``Creating Opportunity'' and the budget the important role that 
the defence industry productivity program will play in this 
commitment.
<P>
	I would like to mention some of the principal aspects of the 
role which the defence industry productivity program, or DIPP, 
can play in defence conversion. We believe that the effective use 
of this tool can contribute to the continuing reduction of the 
industry's dependence on defence sales.
<P>
	DIPP, created in 1959 under the auspices of the 
Canada-U.S.A. defence production sharing agreement, supports 
the federal policy of participating in international co-operative 
production sharing agreements. It also plays a major role in 
supporting Canadian high technology defence related industries 
like aerospace.
<P>
	Today Canada's defence industries are characterized by the 
international scope, high risk and intense competition both in 
Canada and abroad from subsidized foreign firms.
<P>
	Under the current program DIPP makes repayable 
investments to qualified firms for research and development, 
source establishment, buying against production machinery and 
for conducting market feasibility studies. The program is 
market driven and industry led.
<P>
	The government considered these as essential and desirable 
features which will continue in any new conversion program. 
These features can ensure that Canada remains internationally 
competitive.
<P>
	The defence industry productivity program has been 
instrumental in the success in building high technology 
industries and generating substantive exports and creating jobs 
across Canada. Since its inception 35 years ago the program has 
brought extraordinary benefits to Canada. I would like to 
mention a few.
<P>
	Seventeen hundred projects have been completed. The 
Government of Canada has contributed $3.4 billion to those 
projects. The program has leveraged $280 million from other 
governments, primarily the U.S.A.
<P>
	Canadian industry itself has invested $6.8 billion. These 
projects have generated sales for Canada of between $25 to $40 
per DIPP dollar invested primarily to the export markets.
<P>
	In total around 60,000 person years of employment, most of it 
high tech, have been maintained in Canada's aerospace and 
defence industry sectors.
<P>
	The program has been reviewed by the industry and considers 
it extremely successful as well as essential for their future 
growth and development.
<P>
	The introduction of a viable defence conversion 
diversification component under DIPP must take into account 
the global context within which the program is situated: the 
substantial reductions of defence expenditures by major 
industrialized countries; the worldwide restructuring of the 
aerospace and defence sectors; Canada's obligations toward the 
GATT and other agreements; Canada's fiscal constraints in 
industrial infrastructure.
<P>
	The challenge therefore is to introduce a defence conversion 
and diversification component that will best help firms wishing 
to diversify while at the same time ensuring that the projects 
being supported will have a reasonable chance of success.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Although the program was not specifically designed for 
defence conversion, it has nevertheless reinforced the 
conversion of Canada's defence industry through its flexibility 
and responsiveness to market conditions.
<P>
	For example, sales of the aerospace and defence sector are 
now 70 per cent commercial versus 30 per cent military. This is 
the reverse of the mix that we had in the 1960s. However, in view 
of the new global realities, we must intensify and focus our 
conversion efforts so that we can attain the new objectives.
<P>
	Consultations so far have raised a number of important issues 
that we will have to resolve before we finalize the new 
component. We will have to recognize that some firms in 
successful niche markets may not wish to convert and that some 
may be inconvertible. We may have to modify standard existing 
DIPP performance criteria to accommodate defence 
conversions. Repayment options are also to be considered.
<P>
	From the analysis to date the government is considering the 
following five activities as candidates eligible for support: 
defence conversion market feasibility studies, research and 
development assistance for new technologies, limited capital 
assistance for tooling and retooling on an exceptions basis, a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3961"> 3961 </A></B>
<P>
training component through Human Resources Canada, and 
change of corporate culture perhaps for such activities as total 
quality management.
<P>
	At the moment low on the list of potentially eligible activities 
are such items as software development, joint ventures, 
acquisitions, strategic partnerships, and shutdown of a 
production line or facility.
<P>
	Although the new components of contribution programs such 
as DIPP will continue to assist companies in identifying new 
opportunities and in developing dual use technologies and 
commercial products to meet new opportunities, we will have to 
be careful. As members on all sides of the House are very much 
aware, Canadians want governments to spend carefully and look 
for high value for money spent to ensure maximum benefits at 
least cost. They also want us to put our best efforts into long 
term job creation.
<P>
	The defence industry productivity program has indeed been 
one of the most productive programs which the government 
provided to benefit companies, employees and communities 
across the country.
<P>
	As we heard earlier in the debate, since DIPP came on stream 
35 years ago the success stories have been many, varied and 
extraordinary. The program can be a most effective tool for 
reducing the dependence of our industries on defence sales and 
for expediting the conversion of companies from defence 
production into commercial success in the new global 
marketplace. We can look forward to the defence industry 
productivity program serving as a catalyst to help ensure our 
economic future.
<P>
	In Etobicoke-Lakeshore we look forward to those programs 
in our midst. As Canadians we will share in the challenge, 
fulfilment and prosperity which await those who respond to the 
needs of our training partners around the world in the 21st 
century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the hon. member's speech. Now, in this 
debate on conversion, I could not help making a little aside on 
Oerlikon, of course, which is a major company in my riding, and 
I will have a question for the hon. member.
<P>
	Oerlikon is a pathetic situation. I admit, I also have a 
confession to make. At the time, I was in the peace movement 
and when Oerlikon came to Saint-Jean, even if it provided 700 
jobs, what we foresaw as a long-term scenario is happening.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	When a company stops making military equipment, very 
often it just closes down and moves elsewhere. Even if attempts 
at diversification have been made, and I will come back to that, 
the apocalyptic scenario which we feared is taking place in 
Saint-Jean. Perhaps parts will continue to be made for another 
year, to be stored in warehouses for future supply needs, but 
once that is over, I think that Oerlikon is likely to close.
<P>
	At one time, it maintained a certain level of employment. In 
the riding, 735 jobs depended on Oerlikon, and now it is down to 
325. When the contract ends, none will be left.
<P>
	I remind you that Oerlikon produces low-altitude air defence 
systems, that is guns which can hit planes invading a territory. 
With the changed international situation, of course, these 
contracts are worthless. Although Oerlikon has made a big effort 
to sell a lot elsewhere in the world, I think that this equipment is 
no longer needed today. Only $90 million is left for the final 
year of operation of a $1-billion contract. Then nothing will be 
left.
<P>
	I want to point out that unfortunately the federal government 
did not do its share when Oerlikon wanted to diversify. I thought 
that there was an attractive opening at the time. They wanted to 
diversify 25 per cent of their production to laser treatment for 
environmental protection. That was an interesting approach to 
diversification. Unfortunately, the federal government did not 
support it.
<P>
	I agree with my hon. colleague on DIPP, but would the 
solution not be an industrial conversion fund instead? Would the 
hon. member promise to defend within her party the idea of a 
military industrial conversion fund? That industry has 
tremendous brain power and human resources and also money 
invested in infrastructure, so there is surely a way to capitalize 
on this immense human potential and on that infrastructure.
<P>
	Can she at least tell us if she can make her caucus realize that 
the way to diversify is really to have a military industrial 
conversion fund?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Madam Speaker, I say to the member that 
maybe he has given us a bit of history and maybe that history 
predates the present government.
<P>
	The company is currently pursuing export markets. There is 
support from the present minister to ensure that Oerlikon can 
diversify and look at all the options before it.
<P>
	The government is providing full support for all marketing 
efforts. It will review all the proposals. It is working with 
everyone in terms of coming forward with as many proposals as 
possible to work toward diversification.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Madam Speaker, as the member 
for Lévis, I am pleased to participate in this special debate, 
which results from an Official Opposition motion, on the 
conversion of defence industries to civilian production.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3962"> 3962 </A></B>
<P>
	In my riding, there is an extremely important company which 
is in jeopardy because of the existing situation. I am referring 
to the MIL Davie shipyard. In fact, until just a few years ago, 
this company was the largest shipyard in Canada.
<P>
	The conversion of defence industries is undoubtedly an 
important issue for Quebec. As you know, military equipment 
industries have been experiencing difficulties since the end of 
the Cold War. It is estimated that, since 1987, the demand on the 
international market has dropped by close to ten per cent. 
According to international experts, this drop may very soon 
reach 25 per cent. In Quebec, since that same year, 11,000 of the 
57,000 jobs in that sector have already disappeared.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	If there is a company which illustrates the urgent need to 
convert military industries, it is the MIL Davie shipyard. One 
year ago, the company developed a business plan to switch from 
military to civilian production. This plan is not only designed to 
give back to MIL Davie its status of best shipyard in Canada, but 
also to make it a leader at the international level. The plan 
includes two transitional contracts. One concerns the 
construction of a ferry for the Magdalen Islands, for which there 
is a demonstrated need, while the other provides for the 
construction of a multi-purpose strategic ship for peacekeeping 
missions and environmental interventions, called ``smart ship''.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the shipyard and the thousands of related jobs 
are in jeopardy because of this government's apathy. MIL Davie 
urgently needs to convert to civilian production, since this 
shipyard is among those Quebec industries which rely the most 
on military contracts.
<P>
	Let me give you some interesting data compiled by the 
Groupe de recherche de l'industrie militaire et de reconversion, 
which is affiliated to the Université du Québec à Montréal. Until 
now, 91 per cent of MIL Davie's production has been related to 
military equipment contracts. MIL Davie is also in fourth place 
among the 16 companies identified by the UQAM group, after 
Oerlikon, which has so far been dependent on the military 
market for 100 per cent of its production, as well as Paramax and 
SNC Technologies, which depend on that market for 95 per cent 
of their production. Yet, the Liberal government only offers 
lame excuses to justify the delaying of its decision on the 
transitional contracts for the Magdalen Islands ferry and the 
``smart ship''.
<P>
	The latest of these excuses is the one provided by the Minister 
of Transport who, in early March, demanded a copy of MIL 
Davie's business plan before making a decision concerning the 
two contracts. But, as I said earlier, this business plan has been 
available for a year already.
<P>
	Obviously, before making such a decision, the government 
must ensure that there is a real need for these ships. However, 
that need has been demonstrated in both cases.
<P>
	Let us first look at the Magdalen Islands ferry. The useful life 
of the ferry which has been in use for over 28 years, the <I>Lucy 
Maud Montgomery</I>, will end in less than two years. After that, 
the ship will not be safe enough to get its certificate of 
seaworthiness, which is required by the federal government.
<P>
	The Magdalen Islanders also consider that the <I>Lucy Maud 
Montgomery</I> is bad for business in their area, because the ship 
no longer meets the needs of the people. For example, the 
tweendeck is not high enough to accommodate some types of 
trailers and trucks.
<P>
	On February 11, the mayors of the Magdalen Islands 
communities toured MIL Davie main dockyard, the only 
world-class dockyard in Quebec for now. All of them 
unanimously recognized the need to replace the <I>Lucy Maud 
Montgomery</I>. On February 22, these same mayors and 
representatives of the Coopérative de transport maritime et 
aérien, the company operating the ferry service, reached a 
consensus and all agreed that a new ferry was needed.
<P>
	I am going over all of this because there seems to be some 
confusion created by the hon. member for Bonaventure, among 
others, about the possibility of replacing the ferry by a used 
ship. In January, and more specifically on January 18, the day 
after the opening of this session, the minister of Transport 
stated, in answer to questions put by our colleague, the hon. 
member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans and myself, 
that, where the Magdalen Islands ferry was concerned, an 
announcement would be made soon. Following pressures made 
by stakeholders, we were told that when the minister said soon, 
he really meant a couple of months. That was on January 18.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	The only other time I heard the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine comment on this very 
important issue for his constituents was in an article run by the 
local newspaper, <I>Le Radar</I>. The hon. member had nothing else to 
say but complain that the whole issue of the ferry service was his 
responsibility, not the responsibility of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	To tell the truth, he must have been outraged by one of the 
headlines in a previous issue of <I>Le Radar</I>, where it was said that 
never before had the Magdalen Islands been talked about so 
much since the arrival of the Bloc Quebecois in Ottawa. If I had 
been the hon. member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine 
I would have felt piqued as well.
<P>
	Nevertheless, March and April have come and gone. We are 
still waiting for an answer while the workers are being laid off 
by the hundreds and while Magdalen Islanders are wondering 
what their member and their government are doing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3963"> 3963 </A></B>
<P>
	If a decision is made shortly, the new ferry could be delivered 
in time, that is when the <I>Lucy Maud Montgomery</I> has to be 
replaced. I will take 9 to 10 months to prepare the final 
drawings. Then, construction will take 12 months and sea trials 
another month. The Liberal government has dragged its feet 
long enough, it must act now.
<P>
	Let us now talk about the smart ship, a multi-purpose supply 
and general transport ship. The Canadian Armed Forces and the 
Department of Environment need that type of ship, the former 
for peacekeeping or humanitarian aid operations, the latter to 
intervene in case of a major spill. This project is by far the most 
important for the future of MIL Davie, because it would allow 
the development of a new organizational culture and new modes 
of production.
<P>
	The concept was developed by the MIL Davie shipyards of 
Lévis. Plans, modelling and prototype development are done 
under the direction of an associated company, MIL Engineering 
System.
<P>
	The construction of this type of ship would fit into the review 
of the Canadian defence policy, a review made necessary by the 
end of the cold war and the increase in the number of 
peacekeeping or humanitarian operations because of local 
conflicts.
<P>
	The new international environment, a result of the end of the 
cold war, might very well increase the risk of such conflicts and 
Canadian Armed Forces have developed a sought after 
know-how in the area of peacekeeping. As matter of fact, the 
Canada 21 Council gave another boost to the smart ship project 
on March 16. This private council has been commissioned to 
review the Canadian defence policy in the new context of 
international relations. Its membership includes former 
politicians of various affiliations, some fairly well known like 
Donald MacDonald and Gérard Pelletier, both former Liberal 
ministers; former military officers like Admiral Robert H. Falls; 
and business people and economists of renown.
<P>
	The Canada 21 Council recommends that the Canadian 
government cancel the planned purchase of three submarines 
and acquire instead three multi-purpose supply ships, or smart 
ships, to provide operational support to peacekeeping missions. 
These three ships proposed by the council would replace the 
AOR combat support ships, such as the <I>Protecteur</I>, which are 
nearing the end of their operational lives, and which are not 
multi-purpose and cannot transport vehicles nor launch small 
landing crafts or amphibious vehicles in great numbers. As a 
matter of fact, they are only used to supply navy ships at sea.
<P>
	Moreover, the smart ship can be used for a whole range of 
logistic operations. It can be used as an aircraft-carrier and hold 
up to 24 transport helicopters and 600 troops for airborne 
operations. Such a capacity could be a real asset if, for example, 
Canadians or citizens of allied countries had to be evacuated on 
a moment's notice, as in Rwanda, for example.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	At the present time, to transport the equipment of Canadian 
troops, we have to charter private ships, mainly foreign. And 
then it takes several weeks before our soldiers receive their 
heavy equipment and their combat vehicles. One smart ship 
could transport one battalion group with its equipment, 
armoured vehicles, tanks and artillery. It would have been very 
useful for our mission in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	In the event of a natural disaster, the smart ship can be quickly 
transformed to carry a whole range of vehicles such as trucks 
and ambulances, building materials and equipment, water tanks, 
fuel tanks and bridgelayers.
<P>
	Close to 200 containers holding food, clothing, tents and 
other supplies can be stored on the main deck. This feature 
would have been appreciated especially in Somalia and in 
Florida, after hurricane Andrew.
<P>
	Moreover this ship can carry chemical dispersants, and 
devices to contain and absorb spills. It can accommodate a 
clean-up team of 600 and be used as a command, control and 
communications ship.
<P>
	Recently, a director of MIL Davie told me that the Department 
of National Defence has enough information available to it this 
spring to convey its decision right away to government officials. 
A favourable decision would allow MIL Engineering System to 
proceed to build a model of the ship at a cost of only $6.5 
million.
<P>
	Time is of the essence here. It is highly probable that most of 
MIL Davie's competitors are now familiar with the smart ship 
concept. Rumours are swirling that other shipyards have taken 
up the idea and intend to have their own engineers take a look at 
the concept.
<P>
	If we delay too long, someone will steal our idea, possibly 
foreign competitors who already possess the necessary 
technology to apply the concept developed by MIL Davie.
<P>
	The smart ship project is the most important transitional 
contract, one which would allow MIL Davie to proceed with 
conversion. By building the smart ship, MIL Davie hopes to 
develop new production modes and to change the way shipyards 
in Canada operate.
<P>
	The challenge ahead is a formidable one. The company hopes 
to be able to build this ship in 390,000 hours, instead of the 
normal 800,000 hours. The Danes have accomplished this feat 
and if a strategic agreement can be reached with them, MIL 
Davie could rely on help from a shipyard in Denmark, which 
currently ranks third in the world in this field.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3964"> 3964 </A></B>
<P>
	MIL Davie would need new, more powerful cranes and its 
staff would have to be trained in computer-assisted design and 
production techniques and in the use of new procedures such 
as plasma welding.
<P>
	The Quebec Minister of Industry and Trade has expressed his 
concern about the federal government's commitment to defence 
industry conversion and with good reason. However, the Quebec 
government is not alone in supporting conversion. The <I>Conseil 
du patronat du Québec</I>, not known as an advocate of 
sovereignty, also supports this process.
<P>
	I would like to call to mind the resolution passed by 
<I>Rendez-vous économique 1993</I>, an economic summit meeting 
organized by the <I>Conseil du patronat</I> in Montreal. This 
resolution called on the federal government to extend adequate 
financial support for conversion to all industries that depend on 
military contracts. This financial support would continue for 
however long it took to complete the adaptation, conversion and 
diversification process.
<P>
	In recommendation 1B, the <I>Conseil du patronat du Québec</I> 
also called on the federal government to award a $6.5 million 
design contract and three-year $200 million construction 
contract for the smart ship prototype. This would also be the 
prototype for a series of similar ships for the international 
market, a highly promising and expanding market.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	With the expertise acquired in building the smart ship, MIL 
Davie wants to enter the international market for commercial 
ships between 40,000 and 70,000 tons. It is estimated that half 
the current fleet of oil tankers and bulk carriers should be 
scrapped and replaced in the next few years. Moreover, the rise 
in global demand due to the increase in international trade is 
estimated at 2.5 per cent until 2005.
<P>
	Under these conditions, average demand should grow by 30 
per cent from an average of 780 ships per year in the last ten 
years to an annual average of 1,025 ships until 2005, with peaks 
of 1,500 ships weighing over 2,000 tons. Since the average ship 
lasts 23 years and almost half the fleet is 15 years old or more, 
large orders are to be expected.
<P>
	When they were in opposition, some influential members of 
this government's Cabinet, like the current Minister of Human 
Resources Development who was the critic on External Affairs, 
clearly stated that the Defence Industry Productivity Program 
had to be redesigned for the conversion of defence industries.
<P>
	In a March 26, 1993 press release from the Office of the 
Leader of the Opposition, the current Minister of Human 
Resources Development noted: ``Canada has a golden 
opportunity to stake out new market niches for the Canadian 
defence industry in peacekeeping and environmental 
technologies''. We can only conclude that the Liberal 
government is suffering from amnesia today.
<P>
	On April 19, I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Defence whether the contract for building the smart ship 
would soon be awarded to MIL Davie. He told me it would not 
happen before 1995. This answer shows this government's lack 
of concern for the tens of thousands of defence workers whose 
jobs are threatened. At MIL Davie alone, excluding companies 
like CAE, Canadian Marconi, Oerlikon, Paramax and many 
others, nearly 2,800 jobs would be lost. The shipyard would 
probably have to close for an indeterminate period of time or 
even permanently. Another 8,000 indirect jobs would vanish in 
the Quebec City region. So it is very important.
<P>
	While I have a few minutes left, so you will not feel that MIL 
Davie and Quebec complain or demand too much, I will quote 
some figures concerning contracts awarded since 1986 to 
various shipyards in Canada. The ferry <I>Smallwood</I>, $130 million 
to MIL Davie; destroyer modernization, $286 million to MIL 
Davie but $1.2 billion to Toronto-based Linton; frigate 
construction, $400 million to MIL Davie but $6.2 billion to 
Saint John Shipbuilding; defence contract adjustments, only 
$263 million to MIL Davie; the Pictou ferry, $50 million to the 
Pictou shipyard; minesweepers, $450 million to Fenco Halifax.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to come back to the press release 
of March 26. Just before, I would like to say that I did not 
complete the list, but in all, $13 billion was invested in the 
marine sector, of which the MIL Davie shipyard got only $1.094 
billion, or about one thirteenth.
<P>
	I come back to the press release in which the Leader of the 
Opposition, who is now the Prime Minister, said this: 
``Canadians deserve a government that can lead the way, a 
government that brings new ideas and new strategies, a 
government that helps them adjust to change. Our defence 
conversion policy is an example of how a Liberal government 
would meet the needs of Canadians in years to come''.
<P>
	I have only this to say to this government in conclusion: 
``Prove to the workers of MIL Davie and the employees of the 
649 other defence companies in Quebec that what you said, Mr. 
Prime Minister, when you were in opposition was not just empty 
words''.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to address a brief comment to my 
colleague from Lévis. I know that he is familiar with the 
employer, MIL Davie, which is located in his riding. As the 
Minister of Industry and the Minister of Transport have already 
indicated in this House, the government is perfectly aware of the 
important role this company plays in the economy of the Quebec 
City region. The government has also received MIL Davie's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3965"> 3965 </A></B>
<P>
business plan, which has first to be approved by the government 
of Quebec as principal stockholder.
<P>
	Why does his party insist on raising this issue today, when the 
hon. member and his colleagues know the government has the 
matter well in hand, is working on it, advancing it? The hon. 
member and his colleagues know full well that we are looking 
into the problem of industrial technology transfer for the benefit 
of employers in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member, whom I 
know well given that he chairs the parliamentary committee on 
Human Resources, of which I am a member myself, for his 
question. What is the cause of my concern? Simply the facts. We 
heard that a business plan was tabled recently. I was not only 
concerned, I was also disappointed to hear the Minister of 
Transport mention just recently that he was waiting for a 
business plan. He even said so in a letter to the City of Lévis, the 
City Council of Lévis.
<P>
	Last August, a few weeks before the election was called, MIL 
Davie officials presented this famous business plan to the 
present chief of staff of the present Prime Minister, who was a 
candidate in Quebec City, and to all the Liberal candidates in the 
Quebec City region. Considering that the Prime Minister's chief 
of staff already knew about this business plan then, one cannot 
come and claim eight or ten months later never having heard of 
this plan.
<P>
	Like many other people of Lévis who took part in the election 
campaign and all the workers, I can remember the Prime 
Minister visiting Lévis days before the election and saying he 
agreed with the business plan. The fact of the matter is that this 
plan he had been shown minutes earlier provided for two 
transition contracts, that is to say the Magdalen Islands ferry and 
the smart ship, as well as for some infrastructure assistance. All 
this has been known since last August.
<P>
	Now, the government was elected a few months ago. It is 
understandable that it would take until January to settle in, but I 
will remind the hon. member that, when I rose in my place on 
January 18 to inquired about the ferry to the minister, his answer 
was: ``Soon''. Later we learned that for him, ``soon'' means two 
months. If I am not mistaken, two months from January 18, that 
would bring us to March 18. We are now in May. Two months 
may not seem like a very long time, but for workers loosing their 
jobs a hundred at a time every week-there were 3,000 of them 
this time last year, but at this rate there may soon be only 400 or 
500 of them remaining; that is 2,500 jobs lost, and it will be 
2,800 by the time December comes around-to hear the 
government answer it is looking into the matter is becoming 
unacceptable. Hundreds of workers are waiting for an answer.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	That kind of situation worries me. That is the reason why I 
wanted, as the member for Lévis, to take part in this debate on 
the conversion of military industries to civilian production. I 
rise not only for my own riding, but also because for the whole 
Quebec City region the MIL Davie shipyard accounts for a total 
payroll of $150 million. If you count all indirect jobs created by 
sub-contracting, it represents for the 10 ridings of the Quebec 
City region an economic activity of $600 million.
<P>
	As you know, that type of venture yields secondary benefits. 
Therefore it is extremely important. Besides, that issue has been 
recognized by the Conseil du patronat and by all economic 
organizations of Quebec as a top priority. The present Liberal 
government knew that when they were in opposition and during 
the election campaign. And they still know it today. We are now 
in the month of May 1994 and no answer has come yet.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the rumour has it that the contract might be given 
by tender and that there would be other shipyards, in the region 
of the hon. member by the way. And there is the smart ship-a 
concept that belongs to and was developed by the MIL Davie. At 
the beginning, that original idea was presented in a business 
plan in private but today it is becoming more and more public. 
But as months go by nothing happens.
<P>
	I am not the only one to be worried. The Minister of Industry 
and Commerce of Quebec, Mr. Tremblay-I guess I can call him 
by his title since he is not here-is also getting impatient. A few 
weeks ago, a coalition of all federal and provincial political 
parties, including the Quebec City members of the federal 
Liberal Party, supported the position of the MIL Davie. Despite 
that, there was no answer. This situation is indecent.
<P>
	I am once more urging the government-and it may be the last 
time-to respond at last and to stop penalizing the region of 
Quebec City because it has not voted for the Liberal Party. If that 
is the reason, it is dangerous. I have warned the government that 
there will soon be, in a few weeks, in a few months, a provincial 
election that could have major consequences for the future of 
this country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in this debate. Let me reinforce the 
comments made earlier today by the Minister of Industry with 
reference to defence conversion.
<P>
	The plan recognized that the time had come to help defence 
industries make the transition from high tech military 
production to high tech civilian production.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3966"> 3966 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are determined to reach that objective and we have already 
accomplished significant progress towards the development of 
an effective strategy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our defence conversion program has three major 
components: First, defining Canada's defence policy; second, 
rationalizing the military infrastructure; third, rationalizing the 
defence industrial base.
<P>
	Later today in this debate my colleagues will describe the 
government's policy and program for expediting the first two 
components of our overall strategy. We will also discuss the 
nature and direction for defence conversion of the industrial 
base.
<P>
	Conversion of defence production can be described as 
industrial adjustment with an added element of national 
security. To understand the scale and scope of the challenge 
which Canada faces one must appreciate the evolution of 
Canada's aerospace and defence industry.
<P>
	We have followed a path quite different from that of almost 
every other nation in the western world. We have long 
maintained a relatively small domestic military procurement 
budget. In order to sustain themselves and indeed to grow 
Canadian defence firms pursue two avenues. The first has been 
to focus on export markets. The second has been diversification.
<P>
	As I said the Canadian aerospace and defence industry 
pursued export markets as suppliers of components for the 
manufacturers of major military systems such as radar systems 
to detect low flying aircraft and military flight simulators. Their 
clients were generally not governments but defence companies 
world wide. Canadian manufacturers have designed, developed 
and sold world-class high tech products aimed at buyers of 
sophisticated, specialized equipment and our industries have 
produced these special components at competitive prices.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	By contrast most of the western world's defence firms have 
relied on large domestic military sales. They have produced 
entire systems for a closed and essentially less competitive 
market. They have had little export focus and have sold almost 
exclusively to their national governments.
<P>
	In many countries domestic military budgets were cut back 
severely at the end of the cold war. The shifts in geopolitical 
power required nations to re-evaluate their defence role.
<P>
	Suppliers in other countries which focused on a domestic 
market for major weapon systems found themselves suddenly 
without a traditional market. Add to this equation the fiscal and 
budgetary problems facing all western governments and the 
result has been what might be described as a double whammy of 
radically different requirements and a rapidly shrinking market.
<P>
	The inevitable results: Significant downsizing, 
rationalization and large layoffs, what we all too readily identify 
with defence conversion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	But here in Canada, defence industries are faced with a very 
different reality. Most have concentrated on export sales. The 
size of world markets, as well as the number of world suppliers, 
are diminishing.
<P>
	The reduction of military spending at the international level 
could put out of business some competitors of Canadian 
companies and thereby create new market opportunities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadian industry reliance on Canadian government 
procurement is already small by world standards and it is 
declining. In aerospace for example, 30 years ago defence 
products comprised 65 per cent of total sales. Today defence 
sales are less than 30 per cent of sales and projections indicate 
that by 1997 the percentage will fall to 25 per cent.
<P>
	These figures indicate that in Canada defence conversion has 
been going on as a gradual process for almost 30 years.
<P>
	The sudden and precipitous changes taking place in the 
United States and Europe in the defence industries will not occur 
in Canada to the same degree. For example, between 1991 and 
1993 in the United States the aerospace and defence sectors lost 
almost 300,000 jobs. That is 10 per cent of their workforce. In 
Europe the experience has been similar. Over the same period, 
150,000 people have lost their jobs in defence and in aerospace.
<P>
	In Canada, in marked contrast, we have lost 5,000 jobs in this 
sector and forecasts indicate they will be regained by 1998.
<P>
	Our successful Canadian manufacturers aim at small niche 
markets around the world. The export focus of Canadian 
manufacturers of subsystems and components has cushioned our 
industry from the worst of the fallout occurring in the United 
States and in Europe.
<P>
	As I stated earlier, the other major factor in our success in 
avoiding severe contractions has been diversification.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A large number of defence industries have developed 
technology which can be sold for both military and commercial 
purposes. These companies have gained the necessary skills to 
successfully manage operations producing both military and 
commercial products.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3967"> 3967 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canadian defence industry is in a good position to make 
the necessary transition from a high tech military production 
to a high tech civilian production, as illustrated by the changes 
which have occurred in recent years.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada's defence industry comprises more than 500 firms. 
The majority of them have already begun the diversification 
process both in commercial and military production and in 
domestic and export sales. On average 60 per cent of sales by 
Canadian defence firms are for the commercial market and only 
40 per cent for the defence market. Many of these firms also 
have strong export sales. More than 80 per cent of all 
commercial sales are to export markets and 35 per cent of 
defence sales are abroad.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The only notable exceptions are the large shipbuilders in the 
Atlantic provinces and in Quebec and the munitions 
manufacturers in Quebec. In recent years they have depended 
almost entirely on defence production.
<P>
	In United States, defence conversion has been quite different. 
The U.S. defence industry has been a domestic market nearly 40 
times that of Canada. It produces large scale, fully integrated 
systems. These include, for example, military aircraft, 
submarines and sophisticated weapons systems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Until now, a large number of American defence industries 
have been almost totally dependent on domestic military sales. 
These industries do not follow the Canadian tradition of either 
diversifying, being geared to operations, or relying on an 
important volume of commercial sales.
<P>
	An American solution to a typically Canadian situation is a 
highly unlikely solution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, Canada's solution is threefold: first, a 
defence policy review which will of necessity take time to 
complete; second, the rationalization of bases and defence 
infrastructure, both of which elements will be addressed by the 
minister of defence; third, the rationalization of Canada's 
defence industry base, a complex question but one on which 
progress is being made.
<P>
	In the Liberal plan for Canada ``Creating Opportunity'' the 
government made a commitment to expand the mandate of the 
defence industry productivity program to assist in the 
conversion and diversification of the industry.
<P>
	I am pleased to say that earlier this year the government 
followed through with a provision in the budget to redesign, 
DIPP for 1996-97. This will help industry convert from defence 
to high technology civilian production. This is the first step in 
redirecting existing government programs and initiatives. We 
are also  proceeding on other fronts and will be announcing 
further initiatives soon.
<P>
	Some elements of the government's support program, 
however, must await the report of the defence policy review and 
therefore will not be fully developed for some time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This type of measured response will be problematic if the 
Canadian context for the conversion of military industries is 
similar to that of Europe or the United States. As I pointed out, 
the situation is very different in Canada. Generally speaking, 
Canadian companies are in the unique position of being much 
less vulnerable to military world market slowdowns than their 
foreign competitors.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is not to say that Canada does not face challenges in 
expediting a smooth transition. Rather the defence industry and 
therefore some Canadian workers face a unique situation.
<P>
	Canadian companies are generally well positioned in 
international markets. They have strong order books. They have 
good employment prospects. They have solid, diversified 
international export markets for both their commercial and 
defence product lines.
<P>
	There are some exception to the quite strong positions 
enjoyed by many companies in Canada. These exceptions 
include munitions and shipbuilding where a number of specific 
problems generally beyond the scope of a defence conversion 
program continue to cause concern. We will address these 
problems through a combination of defence conversion 
programs and other programs that can help provide solutions.
<P>
	I have outlined the unique challenge facing us in the matter of 
conversion of defence industries. In some, while the defence 
conversion problem in Canada is similar in scope to that in other 
parts of the western world, it is not by any means of the same 
scale.
<P>
	Sales and employment prospects vary by company: some 
positive, some neutral, sadly some negative. Specific problems 
affecting a particular firm require specific solutions. We do not 
need to embark on sweeping programs offering sweeping and 
expensive solutions. Programs that are carefully targeted 
require careful preparation.
<P>
	Targeted programs take time to develop but in my view are the 
most effective in the medium term. It would be naive to assume 
that the defence conversion problem in Canada can be solved 
overnight.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3968"> 3968 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The solution which the government is in the process of 
developing will be responsive to market forces, fiscally 
responsible, properly directed and effective.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As specific elements of the program take shape in the near 
future, the government will be providing information on the 
scope of its provisions.
<P>
	The member who brought forth the motion also brought to the 
attention of the House a most important question. As I pointed 
out, companies in the Canadian defence industry have long 
diversified their products and their markets. They have been 
carrying out, some of them for as long as 30 years, what the 
defence industry in other countries is just beginning to try, that 
is to produce other products and to market in other markets.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government is determined to continue on the path to 
success with policies and programs which meet the needs of all 
the Canadians who are part of the industry.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Those companies in sectors where the challenges have been 
more demanding and more difficult are to receive the attention 
and assistance of this government which understands the 
problems and intends to contribute to the solutions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to oppose the motion put forward by the 
Bloc. However I want to say at the start that I am personally 
concerned for the jobs of some 137,915 persons who the 1986 
census showed were employed by the defence services sector. 
Their employment is threatened by the Liberal strategy of 
slashing defence spending before it has completed a full study of 
Canada's defence needs.
<P>
	The Reform Party caucus believes that announced cuts of $7 
billion to the Department of National Defence over the next five 
years prejudged and pre-empted the outcome of the defence 
review and should not have been made until Parliament, 
together with the Canadian people, had determined the mission 
of the Canadian Armed Forces for the 21st century.
<P>
	Once the mission is determined we can make careful and well 
planned decisions on the military's main functions and 
organizational structure and on Canada's long term needs for 
hardware, bases and personnel.
<P>
	The cuts announced by the government are already having 
impact on the defence industry. As I have said I strongly object 
to the government's action of cutting defence first and asking 
questions later.
<P>
	I strongly oppose any suggestion that the government should 
fund the changeover of defence companies to civilian 
production. I oppose using Canadian tax dollars for this purpose 
for several reasons, not least of which is that half these firms are 
foreign owned.
<P>
	I would also oppose using Canadian tax dollars for this 
purpose because as a Reformer I do not think on general 
principle we achieve anything good by providing grants to 
private industry. On the contrary, it goes against the grain that 
taxpayers should on the one hand be trying to operate their own 
companies while on the other hand competing with a company 
their own tax dollars may be propping up.
<P>
	For instance, over recent years it has been a tactic of the old 
line political parties to spend some $160 million per year 
through the defence industry productivity program, which is 
almost like a regional development program, to dole out tax 
dollars to the military industry concentrated mainly in southern 
Ontario and southern Quebec. Such grants should be quickly 
phased out.
<P>
	To understand this particular motion we must first define what 
we are talking about when we discuss Canada's defence 
industry. I note that figures being quoted in the House today 
have varied greatly so it is hard to know whose figures are 
correct.
<P>
	Despite the discrepancy in figures we need to try to get to a 
general understanding of what the defence industry produces 
and how it compares on the world scale. In analysing 
world-wide arms production, nations are generally divided into 
three tiers or levels of production. The first includes nations like 
the U.S., which basically produces and sells anything it or its 
allies need. The first tier accounts for some 60 per cent of the 
arms transferred in the past decade.
<P>
	Canada is in tier two with such countries as France, Italy and 
Spain, which together account for some 25 per cent of annual 
global arms exports. These countries do not have a big enough 
home market to benefit from economies of scale and must 
depend on exports to be competitive. Canada exports in large 
measure to the United States with which we jointly produce 
many weapons.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	There is a third tier of wild card arms producers like China, 
India and Israel that can produce large amounts of less 
sophisticated, functional but cheap weapons on short notice. 
Among global arms producers Canada ranks about eighth, 
producing some $3 billion worth of military goods per year or 
about one per cent of the world total. Regarding more 
conventional weapons, according to the Stockholm 
International Peace Research Institute and for the period 1986 to 
1990, Canada was the 14th largest exporter of major 
conventional weapons in the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3969"> 3969 </A></B>
<P>
	Concentrated in southern Ontario and Quebec, the Canadian 
defence industry involves about 1,000 companies with special 
experience in what is called the new knowledge based industry, 
specifically aerospace electronics and communications.
<P>
	Robert Gillespie, former assistant deputy minister in the 
Department of National Defence, gave the following description 
of the defence industry:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our industry is composed of only a few large companies with sales in excess of 
$100 million per year. The vast majority of firms are in fact quite small and very 
few of those produce purely military products. The industry is over 50 per cent 
foreign owned with U.S. companies dominating the group and is very heavily 
dependent on the export market.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There has been great fluctuation in Canadian military exports 
over the period 1959 to 1991. For example, 1974 and 1975 were 
low years, each at $280 million. In 1985 the industry hit its 
recent peak at $1.9 billion in exports, with a similar amount in 
1991 during the gulf war build-up and actual combat.
<P>
	Research was based on three factors: first, public domain 
listings of unclassified prime military contracts awarded by the 
Department of National Defence; second, military export 
contracts arranged by the Canadian Commercial Corporation on 
behalf of foreign governments, primarily the United States; 
third, Pentagon contracts placed directly with Canadian 
companies, together totalling about 80 per cent of all Canadian 
military production.
<P>
	According to research covering those three factors the top six 
Canadian military prime contractors are: SNC Industrial 
Technologies Incorporated and Bombardier, both of Montreal; 
Computing Devices Company of Ottawa; Standard Aero 
Limited of Winnipeg; Allied Signal Aerospace of Rexdale, 
Ontario; and Bristol Aerospace of Winnipeg. All six companies 
had total value reported prime contracts during fiscal year 
1990-91 in excess of $100 million. For three of the six, their 
estimated or reported military sales were less than half of total 
sales.
<P>
	Of the top 20 Canadian military prime contractors, 
accounting for some 60 per cent of reported military prime 
contracts in Canada, according to the same three factors which I 
listed earlier, 11 companies of the top 20 had estimated or 
reported military sales of less than half of total sales. 
Incidentally eight of those top 20 companies are located in 
Quebec. I believe we can see the source of the Bloc's concern 
with this issue.
<P>
	What kinds of things do these companies produce? Although 
Canada does rank 14th in world-wide production of 
conventional weapons, the Library of Parliament has provided 
me with a list of some 180 companies engaged in producing 
defence electronics and avionics. These folks produce a whole 
lot of things that most people cannot even pronounce, let alone 
manufacture. Many of them are part of the new  knowledge 
based economy, their employers being well educated, not to say 
out and out brilliant.
<P>
	Because of the brilliance of these people and the highly 
specialized nature of what they produce, I seriously doubt that a 
notoriously inefficient federal government could do anything 
really helpful for these industries and would only end up 
throwing tax dollars at them, an approach which I strongly 
oppose.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Moreover, as I have shown, a large number of defence 
industry companies have less than 50 per cent of their 
production going into military purposes. Hopefully they can 
convert a greater percentage of their operations to non-military 
purposes. Because of the talents of the employees of these 
particular high tech companies, it would be a great loss to 
Canada if the employers were to shut down and the employees 
moved to the United States. Remember, we are talking about an 
industry that is already half foreign owned.
<P>
	However, I am certain the sales and marketing offices of the 
bigger companies and probably the presidents of the smaller 
companies have long since smelled the coffee in so far as the end 
of the cold war is concerned. Certainly they have been hard at 
work tracing and developing new markets which could increase 
their non-military sales.
<P>
	Even the average man or woman on the street is well aware of 
the remarkable growth in the knowledge based industry for such 
things as fax machines, personal computers and the 
transportation industry. Given the great land mass of Canada, we 
truly have become a world leader in communications, a 
technology needed all over the world for everything from 
moving information, people and goods to distributing TV 
signals or predicting the weather. I have great faith that 
Canada's technological leadership in this sector of the world 
economy cannot only be maintained but will grow steadily.
<P>
	In conclusion it is high time for the government to smarten up 
its own overall defence planning. I also believe one of the worst 
things any of us could do to a given industry would be to 
encourage the government to increase its involvement and 
further upset the functioning of a free market economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened with some interest to the remarks on 
this motion by the hon. member for Okanagan-Shuswap.
<P>
	I found it somewhat strange that he would mention a concern 
on behalf of his party for the defence cuts which the government 
introduced in the budget. At the same time as saying that these 
cuts were premature he argued that we should not support the 
conversion of our defence industry to civilian purposes and to 
help in the redirection of that technology into areas of greater 
demand.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3970"> 3970 </A></B>
<P>
	Perhaps the member could elaborate on what seems to be a 
paradoxical position from his party's perspective. Why is he 
opposing cuts? Is that not what is party has been calling for? 
Why is he opposing economies which have been made with 
great difficulty and after much soul searching by this 
government? What other cuts is he proposing in order to keep 
the defence budget higher than this government has 
recommended?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Madam Speaker, we have always stated that 
there have to be cuts in military spending, but we have also 
stated that the studies should be done before and not after the 
cuts. It is rather foolish to make the cuts and then say they have 
to put them back in place again. The studies should be done 
before the cuts are made. That is what we are saying on that 
level.
<P>
	As far as subsidizing an industry that was subsidized coming 
in is concerned, remember this industry was subsidized coming 
in and now government wants to subsidize it going out.
<P>
	If the government is looking at subsidization levels what 
becomes more important here? Private enterprise tries to 
compete. It pays taxes but those tax dollars are being used in 
many cases to form a company that it has to compete against. It 
is pretty tough when a company is not being subsidized to 
compete against a subsidized company. They do not have the 
same worries, many times not even the same responsibilities.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	I would like to raise another fact when talking about 
subsidization. We have to have priorities. Can anyone in this 
House answer this question: Why are we subsidizing companies 
in direct competition with companies in private enterprise when 
we are shutting down hospitals? This absolutely makes no sense 
to me, nor to anybody else in the House, but I am willing to 
listen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am very pleased to take part in this debate because major 
aerospace firms and Canadian Forces Base Winnipeg are located 
in my riding of Winnipeg St. James.
<P>
	In the red book this government identified the world-wide 
restructuring of the defence industry as a major issue for 
maintaining high technology jobs in Canada.
<P>
	In speaking to the government's commitment to defence 
conversion, I must first be clear that it is not a passing fancy or 
for that matter a platform for simplistic grandstanding. The 
global market for the defence industry is already in the process 
of restructuring. This government will encourage a sound and 
structured response that will hold up for the long run, that will 
meet the needs of industry and the highly skilled workers in that 
industry.
<P>
	The need to change is being driven by global markets for 
Canada's defence industry is particularly vulnerable to change. 
This cannot be otherwise when 50 per cent of the Canadian 
defence industry is foreign owned, mostly by U.S. companies. 
That has already been pointed out in this debate. The majority of 
Canadian defence firms supply subsystems and components and 
carry out subcontracted manufacturing for prime U.S. 
contractors. Indeed, most Canadian exports go to the United 
States.
<P>
	The global giants, the American prime contractors, have been 
rationalizing their organizations and just as important for 
Canadian suppliers, their manufacturing processes. They are 
starting to drive this process down their supply chain, down to 
the suppliers of subsystems and components where Canada has 
developed its edge.
<P>
	Furthermore the giants are diversifying into commercially 
advanced technology markets, squeezing our smaller and more 
diversified companies. The aerospace and advanced electronics 
industries in Canada could be vulnerable and they must be ready 
to adapt. This government is preparing to assist positively and in 
concert with industry.
<P>
	I can assure members of this House and in particular the 
member for Nanaimo-Cowichan who suggested this morning 
that the government should talk to the industry leaders in the 
west that this government has been doing just that.
<P>
	On March 3 of this year the hon. Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification, the parliamentary secretary for 
finance and I all met with the chief executive officers of 10 
leading western aerospace and defence companies. We 
discussed the sector's views on defence conversion in the 
context of science and technology policy and the new long term 
space plan.
<P>
	This broad focus is part of the western economic 
diversification's new direction to work with industry and the 
provinces through strategic initiatives, that is to deal with 
structural economic issues at their root and on a co-operative 
basis rather than treating the symptoms as they appear in 
individual companies.
<P>
	The March meeting was the first of what will be a series of 
meetings on the subject and which will include an expanded list 
of companies right across the west. The next meeting will be 
later this spring at which time the private sector will present a 
broad strategy along with recommendations for specific 
activities required to facilitate defence conversion in western 
Canada.
<P>
	We are listening to the leaders of industry and working closely 
with them as part of a broad concern for the health of the 
aerospace and electronics industries in the west. For instance we 
are fully sensitive to the immediate impact that can be felt from 
the defence cuts. We have worked closely with industry to 
ensure a smooth transition to new requirements.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3971"> 3971 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	This has been done with specific companies such as Bristol 
Aerospace which is located in my riding. We have also worked 
with Bristol and other companies in the west to help as they 
pursue opportunities in international markets.
<P>
	All of this is part of the national issue of restructuring the 
Canadian defence industry. It is done to safeguard the positive 
contributions the industry has made and continues to make to 
Canada's economic well-being, while building something 
viable and sustainable for the long term future without 
side-swiping in the process the advanced technology companies 
that have already diversified and have already taken action for 
the future.
<P>
	The blueprint for defence conversion contained in the red 
book sets out a program to pursue strategic and fiscally sound 
alternatives for high tech job creation. The program is to focus 
on alternative military requirements, dual use products and 
sustaining research and development.
<P>
	Two major objectives were set, namely conversion of military 
bases to alternative uses, and economic conversion and 
diversification of the defence industry toward alternative 
military and civilian goods, including the development of 
peacekeeping technologies.
<P>
	This government has already started down the defence 
conversion road. Those base closures that were long overdue 
have been announced as part of the recent budget. An example of 
the concrete conversion action being taken as a result of the base 
closures is the activity surrounding Defence Research 
Establishment Pacific in Victoria, sometimes referred to as 
DREP.
<P>
	Defence Research Establishment Pacific is to close on March 
31, 1995 as part of the reduction of defence infrastructure. 
However, there is tremendous potential here to build upon the 
critical mass of ocean industry and science which is resident in 
Victoria and centred at DREP.
<P>
	For example, there are many companies both large, such as 
MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates, and small, such as 
Barrodale Computing with just 10 employees, which have 
transformed the science contracts they have undertaken with 
DREP in the past into major commercial opportunities.
<P>
	To maintain this flow from research into a commercial 
business, western economic diversification in the next few days 
will commission a study of the opportunities open to the ocean 
industry based upon the critical mass existing in both the private 
and public sectors in Victoria. Science does exist at Defence 
Research Establishment Pacific. Highly competitive, high 
technology companies, world-class firms are already in place.
<P>
	The Department of National Defence wishes to see the 
technology transferred to industry and the academic 
community, such as the University of Victoria, and is anxious to 
build further momentum. What better ingredients could be 
found for converting a defence establishment into a sound 
commercial enterprise than this one which is focused upon a 
growing, vital ocean industry?
<P>
	Our defence conversion blueprint also set out the objective of 
diversification toward alternative military and civilian goods. 
This too is already getting under way with a number of alternate 
use concepts being actively examined by industry itself and 
government. This goes beyond program and policy responses on 
a broad sectoral front to the specific activities of individual 
companies which are right now pursuing the opportunities that 
are presenting themselves.
<P>
	An example of government support to a winning defence 
conversion strategy is EDO Canada Ltd. of Calgary. This 
company has been manufacturing fuel tanks for the CF-18 
fighter jets using composite materials.
<P>
	In January of this year it won its first major commercial 
contract by which it will supply lightweight natural gas fuel 
tanks for General Motors 1994 Chevrolet Caprice and Corsica 
models. This contract will be worth $2.5 million to $5 million 
annually. To quote company president Doug Moore from a 
Calgary <I>Herald</I> article of January 12, 1994: ``The contract is the 
result of the commercialization of our aerospace technology''. It 
is also the result of this government's application of the 
industrial and regional benefits policy to defence conversion.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	General Motors as part of its contractual commitment to the 
federal government for the sale of light armoured vehicles has 
agreed to undertake millions of dollars of industrial benefits in 
Canada.
<P>
	The agreement of the government to allow IRB credit for GM 
or to GM for the EDO sale helped to cement for EDO a strategic 
alliance that it had been working on for some time. This is part 
of an ongoing government program with continuing discussions 
which could lead to a similar kind of contract for another 
growing western high technology manufacturer. Again IRB 
credits from the light armoured vehicle purchase could be an 
incentive to solidify the deal.
<P>
	I want to conclude by saying that this government knows what 
defence conversion does not mean. It is not moving defence 
companies into mature commercial markets. It is not intended to 
be done in isolation from other economic activity and it cannot 
happen instantly. It most certainly cannot mean wiping out the 
existing defence industrial base.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3972"> 3972 </A></B>
<P>
	I have described what defence conversion is or is not. This 
government has an equally clear understanding of what it 
should be and can be with a carefully planned program. Defence 
conversion can help defence dependent companies reduce their 
dependency on limited products and customers. It can be a 
co-operative effort between industry, labour and government 
to foster strategic alliances for pursuing international markets.
<P>
	It can be an opportunity to work with our counterparts in the 
U.S. especially in fostering the development of dual use 
technologies. I assure members that it will broaden the 
industrial base for overall economic growth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois has introduced a motion saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for its unacceptable delays in 
developing and implementing a genuine strategy for the conversion of defence 
industries to civilian production, which would save and create new jobs in 
high-technology sectors.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I congratulate the hon. members from the Bloc Quebecois for 
thinking about jobs. I hope they will raise, in Canada and in 
Quebec, concern for Canadian jobs. When I refer to Canada and 
Canadians, I mean all provinces, including Quebec. Their 
objective of separation is certainly not the ideal recipe for job 
creation. We need to belong to a strong community, a strong 
family, large and co-operative enough to develop its own 
industries.
<P>
	We were informed today of the policies and programs which 
would guarantee the success of the conversion of defence 
equipment manufacturers into companies active on 
international markets. However, it is not simply a question of 
policies and programs. The main factors are the entrepreneurial 
spirit, the measures taken and the results achieved.
<P>
	There are many examples of success. One of them is 
Securiplex Technologies of Montreal. This is the story of a 
successful conversion by a company which was well-known for 
its defence equipment. Recently, they had the good fortune of 
getting a $26 million contract from Bombardier BN, in Bruges, 
Belgium, for the production of a control system.
<P>
	This system will electronically detect and extinguish fires in 
the 254 shuttle-cars that will be used in the Chunnel.
<P>
	It is based on the system designed by Securiplex for damage 
control on warships and presently installed on 12 new Canadian 
frigates and ships of the British Royal Navy.
<P>
	This system uses microprocessors to monitor and control the 
sensors and fire-extinction devices, as well as other security 
systems. It was developed under a procurement contract 
negotiated with the Government of Canada through the Defence 
Industry Productivity Program.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Since the completion of this project, and with the help of 
Industry Canada, Securiplex marketing has been targeting 
commercial companies. This firm is actively pursuing the 
industrial security market, especially in North America, Europe 
and the Middle East.
<P>
	Among its achievements are the contracts it won to supply 
sophisticated fire detection and extinction systems for the 
headquarters of the European Economic Community in 
Brussels, the Alba power plant in Bahrain, in the Middle East, 
and the Hibernia drilling platform off Newfoundland.
<P>
	ATS is a rather impressing example. It was created on the 
Montreal South shore in 1979. Originally, it was a small 
company specialised in ammunition testing. Aware of the 
limitations of this activity, it sought to put its considerable 
expertise to good use by creating software for new markets.
<P>
	Today, this company has nearly entirely changed its field of 
activity. Its future lies now in completely new opportunities it 
created, namely air control tower and room simulators. Training 
air controllers is of the utmost importance, and yet nothing has 
been done to update training methods.
<P>
	Presently, ATS is executing major contracts awarded by 
international customers. DIPP played a crucial role in the 
development of this firm's technological capacity. ATS was 
awarded its last contract in January 1992, and since then it has 
not asked for another loan.
<P>
	The common denominator to these success stories is the fact 
that these manufacturers of defence equipment were able to 
adapt to the new reality and meet the demand of a new market. It 
is also our government's commitment to help these industries 
diversify. The pessimistic outlook of some concerning the 
future of our aerospace and defence industries does not reflect 
reality. As a whole, the news regarding defence industries is 
rather good.
<P>
	For example, many members know that one of the leading 
Canadian aerospace and defence electronics firms is CAE 
Electronics Limited of Montreal. This company is a world-class 
operation in every respect. It is the main supplier of commercial 
aircraft flight simulators and records important sales to similar 
defence markets.
<P>
	CAE Electronics employs more than 3,000 people, with 
scientists, engineers and technicians accounting for half of the 
workforce. Annual sales of nearly $350 million are made by the 
Montreal offices and the figure is expected to increase next year. 
The company has been experiencing tremendous growth and 
expansion for the past three decades. Annual sales now in excess 
of one billion derive primarily from exports.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3973"> 3973 </A></B>
<P>
	The company is now busy expanding its facilities in order 
to welcome clients from around the world who will attend 
courses focusing on some of the most advanced technologies 
in the world, from aircrafts to ships. Several years ago, CAE 
Electronics acquired a major U.S. competitor called Link. This 
company is now truly world class with a diverse client base. 
Nevertheless, it continues to manage the electronics side of the 
business from its offices in Montreal.
<P>
	However, CAE Electronics still needs the support of the 
government. This is especially true in the case of the project 
which it is carrying out with the American National Aerospace 
Administration and which involves exploring the application of 
virtual reality in the cockpit. Without the support of the Defence 
Industry Productivity Program, projects like this which are 
vitally important to the future of CAE Electronics would be 
impossible to carry out.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	That is why the federal government has indicated in the red 
book it was determined to maintain this important program. 
CAE also takes an active part in other defence conversion 
projects, some of which in sectors far removed from traditional 
defence activities. It is currently involved in a marketing project 
for an artificial heart designed at the Heart Institute in Ottawa.
<P>
	However, CAE still considers defence as an important part of 
the corporate strategy in its business plans. Defence contracts do 
account for the best part of its commercial activity and offer 
unique opportunities to explore the limits of technology applied 
to training and simulation.
<P>
	The federal government plans on continuing its partnership 
with CAE as well as with a number of other innovative, creative 
and flourishing companies. The Canadian taxpayers' 
investments in companies such as this one have never been more 
important. CAE and the Montreal area can expect to prosper 
thanks to these investments. CAE has undertaken to design, 
develop and market new products and new services to meet the 
needs of the population in the 21st century.
<P>
	There are many more success stories in the defence industry, 
stories of companies that have expanded their lines of activity 
and prospered by identifying a need and meeting it 
commercially.
<P>
	Defence conversion is nothing new for many Canadian 
companies, and their success is envied by their competitors.

	As you know, Madam Speaker, my region of Granby has been 
hit hard by the unemployment problem plaguing the country. In 
this speech, I want to express my support for the defence 
industry conversion program. I strongly support the motion of 
my colleague from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, which condemns 
the government for its inaction in this vital sector with the 
potential to create high-tech jobs.
<P>
	How can the government sit on its hands on such an important 
issue after making firm commitments in this regard in the last 
election campaign? As you know and since they talk about it all 
the time, these commitments can be found in the Liberal Party's 
red book and in a March 26, 1993 press release.
<P>
	What is now left of these moral commitments? To impress 
upon the government the meaning of the words ``active'', 
``alert'' and ``enterprising'', I will quote the motion of my

	The main reason underlying my position is that, with the 
collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war, 
spending on defence industries is no longer based on the initial 
strategic foundation. Thus, as a member of the Joint Committee 
on Defence, I still maintain that the amount spent on military 
defence is quite high and we need a moratorium to stop the waste 
of public funds. However, in making cuts in military spending, 
we must act fairly to the provinces and the various components 
of the defence industry.
<P>
	Although the EH-101 helicopter project promised economic 
benefits for Quebec, we in the Bloc Quebecois were opposed to 
this program, but we insisted on the need to ensure economic 
and industrial benefits for Quebec through a project like the 
high-speed train, and these benefits are not yet forthcoming.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3974"> 3974 </A></B>
<P>
	In fact, the government is dragging its feet on several issues 
that are important for economic recovery. They often quote the 
red book but they do very, very little. Nevertheless, the 
companies that were penalized when this helicopter contract 
was cancelled urgently need government support to convert 
their defence activities. Since the new world order began, 
military industries have had a rough time, as everyone here will 
agree.
<P>
	The arms production market, estimated at over $450 billion 
worldwide, has dropped significantly since 1987, by almost 10 
per cent. International experts say that it could drop another 25 
per cent in the next few years. The main exporting countries, 
including Canada, are thus directly affected by this problem.
<P>
	As you probably know, Canada exports about 70 per cent of its 
production to international markets, of which 80 per cent goes to 
the United States. Under Canada-U.S. agreements, we are thus 
tied to this market. Since the late 1980s, the U.S. defence budget 
has steadily declined. What will the impact be on our local 
industries?
<P>
	In this specific sector, the most conservative estimates are 
that more than 1.6 million jobs will be lost throughout the world 
by the year 2000. That is a lot. This prognosis is hardly 
promising for Canada's military industry. In Quebec alone, 
more than 650 companies of all sizes work directly or indirectly 
in military production.
<P>
	In Quebec, the most dynamic sectors are communication 
electronics, aerospace, shipbuilding and munitions. More than 
11,000 jobs in Quebec's military industry have been lost since 
1987. The impact is considerable.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Here are some specific examples of layoffs between 1990 and 
1994 in Quebec companies that produced weapons or 
components: Marconi, 1,480 layoffs; MIL Davie, 2,740 layoffs 
since 1990; Oerlikon, 410 layoffs; Paramax, 1,000 layoffs; Pratt 
&amp; Whitney, 200 layoffs; Triplex, 200 layoffs; Vickers, 350 
layoffs; and there are others. This is scary! It is unbelievable! 
Just compiling these figures is an exacting process. Between 
1990 and 1994, no less than 7,391 jobs have disappeared in those 
Quebec companies which are formally identified as producing 
systems or subsystems for military use.
<P>
	These figures, which merely represent the tip of the iceberg, 
confirm the dramatic drop in military production for Quebec 
alone. You can imagine what the figures are for all of Canada.
<P>
	This illustrates why the need to convert military industries is 
so urgent and vital for the survival of our manufacturing and 
high tech industries.
<P>
	We must act quickly to ensure the conversion of defence 
industries to civilian production. The elected government has a 
fundamental role to play in this sector of the economy. So far, 
federal government support to  our defence industry has 
essentially taken the form of procurement contracts and direct 
assistance to industries.
<P>
	This support is mainly given through the Defence Industry 
Productivity Program, or DIPP. It seems that it is through this 
program that support for the conversion of defence industries 
will come.
<P>
	The program aims at helping military industries remain 
competitive on international and Canadian markets. 
Considering the collapse of world and domestic markets for 
military equipment, a thorough review of the program is a 
logical and necessary step.
<P>
	The most appropriate solution to help our defence industries 
is undoubtedly the implementation of a conversion program 
funded with DIPP's budget.
<P>
	In fact, the House of Commons Sub-committee on Arms 
Export asked, in its recommendation 18, that the DIPP be 
extended so as to include assistance for conversion and 
diversification. The Liberal members who sat on that 
sub-committee signed the report, thus confirming their party's 
position when they formed the opposition. Is it possible that 
such a change could occur when you change sides in this House? 
This is incredible! It is unacceptable!
<P>
	Considering that stand from the Liberals, and given the need 
to implement a conversion program to help defence industries, it 
is important that the DIPP plays an accessory role in this 
transition from military to civilian production.
<P>
	While ideas seemed to have been developing for some time, 
and while consultations seemed to support a quick 
transformation of this program into a conversion program, it 
now seems that the Liberal Party is hesitant to launch such a 
support program. The Liberals are now undecided. What 
happened to them since they took office? It is hard to tell. What 
happened to those nice promises made on every platform by the 
Liberals during the election campaign?
<P>
	Even the leader of the Liberal Party, the current Prime 
Minister, tried to outmatch everyone else in a press release dated 
March 26, 1993, where he said: ``Canadians deserve a 
government which can show them the way, come up with new 
ideas and new strategies, and help them to adapt to change. Our 
defence conversion policy is a good example of how a Liberal 
government'', as he put it, ``would meet the needs of Canadians 
during the 1990s.''
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, I must say that all these promises went 
unheeded, so much so that, in his budget, the Minister of 
Finance kept quiet about all the new programs the Liberals had 
promised.
<P>
	If the government does not develop a defence conversion 
policy for the years to come, Quebec and the rest of Canada 
stand to lose tens of thousands of jobs in technological indus-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3975"> 3975 </A></B>
<P>
tries. Our capacity to create jobs will  keep eroding, and the 
government is very much aware of the situation.
<P>
	Recently, when questioned by my colleague, the hon. member 
for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, the Minister of Industry was 
rather smug and cynical. He said that the federal government 
already has all the tools needed to promote conversion and that 
the existing programs were enough to help them fill their 
mandate. Is this the new tactic the Liberals are going to use?
<P>
	The Minister of Industry probably confused the support 
provided to military production within the DIPP program with a 
conversion program that the government has yet to develop.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry should, as soon as possible, review 
the existing programs. He would notice a difference between 
what he thinks is out there and the conversion program we are 
proposing.
<P>
	By the way, I urge my colleagues opposite to read the 
statement released, on March 26, 1993, by the office of the then 
leader of the opposition, now the Prime Minister of Canada.
<P>
	With the help of the current Minister of Human Resources 
Development and others, they came up with these proposals, 
while they were sitting in the opposition. People say life is 
easier when you are in the opposition, but still, if you are 
serious, when you are in office you try to do what you said you 
would do. At the time, the government promised Canadians jobs 
and now all it is talking about is the deficit. It was the 
Conservatives who talked about the deficit during the election 
campaign, not the Liberals. The Liberals promised us jobs. 
What happened?
<P>
	The Liberal government has fallen into the trap. Caught 
without any conversion policy, the government must, once 
again, trust the market forces. Can you imagine? They keep 
telling us: ``Wait and see. Wait and see.'' That is exactly what we 
are doing. We are waiting.
<P>
	For its part, the Bloc Quebecois firmly believes that the 
government must take initiatives that can provide jobs for our 
fellow citizens.
<P>
	A plan to encourage manufacturers of military equipment to 
move away from this type of production and export and onto 
other fields. A well-defined strategy is the key to success for the 
conversion of high-technology defence industries to civilian 
production.
<P>
	Defence industries are a pillar of the high-technology, 
research and development sector, and our competitiveness and 
our future depend in part on high technology. That is very 
important.
<P>
	A strong industrial fabric is essential to economic prosperity 
and job creation. High technology offers high-paying jobs and, 
furthermore, it uses our natural resources as well as products 
and services from our enterprises.
<P>
	I want to enunciate the three main recommendations of the 
strategy we advocate. First, the government should create a 
conversion fund as part of its comprehensive industrial 
conversion strategy.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	The main mission of this fund would be to improve and add to 
the assistance provided within existing programs, with the 
objective of ensuring defence facilities and businesses an 
adequate and long-term support in their conversion and 
diversification undertakings.
<P>
	Second, the government will have to create conversion 
advisory committees at local and regional levels. Finally, the 
government will have to form an independent committee to 
examine the different existing programs that could be used.
<P>
	Needless to say that this strategy must be aimed first and 
foremost at completely reforming the DIPP.
<P>
	The federal government must assume a part of the 
responsibilities. When you are elected, you must assume 
responsibility for these businesses' dependency towards arms 
production.
<P>
	My intervention today indicates well that we will continue our 
representations, and I hope that the federal government will 
respond as soon as possible to the legitimate expectations of 
businesses from Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased to know that the member opposite has read our red 
book and is now aware of this government's priority which is job 
creation.
<P>
	It is what we have been trying to achieve over the last six 
months, since we came to power. I think we have been quite 
successful.
<P>
	Not to mention all the programs we have created, the 
infrastructure program has been implemented to help the small 
and medium-sized businesses that need our support.
<P>
	I also want to stress that the Minister of National Defence has 
stated that the whole defence policy is now under review, 
including the industries that need to diversify their activities 
and produce other goods than nuclear equipment. We all agree 
that Canadians do not want any more production in that area.
<P>
	The member mentioned that between 1990 and 1994 there has 
been a great number of layoffs. Why have we been elected? 
Because the previous government did not have a job creation 
program. Nor dit it have a Canadian vision for this country. 
There has been a problem in the area of job creation. We have 
been elected on that platform. Job creation is in the red book.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3976"> 3976 </A></B>
<P>
	As far as Quebec is concerned, as a member coming from 
that province I can say that on this side of the House we are 
not concerned only with Quebec but with all of Canada and the 
unity of this country. If members opposite want to help job 
creation, they have to help us first with the programs aimed at 
creating jobs all over Canada and stop talking only about the 
Constitution or splitting up this country.
<P>
	We have not changed our minds even if we are not sitting on 
the same side of the House. We are true federalists. Job creation 
has always been one of our priorities.
<P>
	Could the member tell me why the current program does not 
meet the needs of businesses in Quebec or elsewhere in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to thank my colleague for her statement which seems very 
honest.
<P>
	Let me deal first with the infrastructure program. It is true that 
program was implemented by the new government and it is an 
excellent program. You all know that what we need now in 
Canada is job creation.
<P>
	That program will create jobs, but there are conditions.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	First, there are small municipalities, in my riding and 
elsewhere, which cannot respect all of the program's 
requirements and have problems obtaining a program because of 
that.
<P>
	Second, the infrastructure program will not develop high 
technology for the future of Canada and Quebec; let me say I am 
happy to mention the two together because the Bloc Quebecois 
is a sovereignist party, yes it does want sovereignty, but not a 
brutal and independent one. We wish to maintain relations with 
the rest of Canada. Since you are also from Quebec, my 
province, Madam Speaker, you know there will always be close 
relationships between Quebec and the rest of Canada.
<P>
	However, Quebec is different. Everybody knows it. We hear it 
all the time. Just listen to the people sitting next to us, that is 
what they say. We are different. The day it will be accepted as a 
fact, everything will be easier. There is one important thing for 
the government, for the party in office. The Liberals are in office 
now, so they are able to consult the most intelligent and most 
competent persons in Canada and in Quebec and ask them what 
to do. If the government does not know what to do, it holds the 
necessary authority to at least do that.
<P>
	I think the problem with our government is that it consulted a 
lot without presenting us with a legislative agenda equal to our 
expectations. As for the DIPP, all I can say is that we are 
experiencing delays. It is not functioning. Funds are frozen. We 
have the funds; now we should invest them the right way.
<P>
	I think if the government is serious, it must consider the 
motion of the Bloc Quebecois and act upon it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I find it amusing to see the hon. member for Shefford 
panic and think that things are going from bad to worse in 
Quebec. That would be true if the sovereigntist government 
were to go off to sulk in a corner and to do as it pleased. The hon. 
member did not do his homework. When he did his research, he 
forgot to read the budget. If he had done so, he would know that 
the Liberal government will broaden the DIPP criteria to include 
more industries.
<P>
	I would like to remind him what Paul D. Manson, a former 
Canadian Forces Chief of Staff and now the president of 
Paramax, said about his company: ``Nearly two years ago, we 
created a task force to explore business opportunities in the 
civilian sector. We identified four or five very promising areas. 
Our parent company also extended its support and increased our 
budget for research and development. We answered some calls 
for tenders and, before the end of the year, we should have good 
contracts.''
<P>
	The hon. member, who is a sovereigntist and a separatist, 
should be trying to create a Canadian industrial family, instead 
of sulking and trying to leave us. He should be doing something 
constructive and positive, such as creating interactive jobs 
throughout Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened to the 
remarks of my colleague and I found them quite cynical. I think 
both sides of the House will agree that this hon. member's 
attitude was rather carefree in the past. Contrary to the hon. 
member, I think that the best that can happen is for Quebec to 
finally opt for self-determination.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	On the other hand, you can quote all the letters from all the 
company presidents in the world, this will not change the fact 
that 11,000 jobs were lost in Quebec. Each and every person who 
was laid off did not necessarily write a letter, but the fact 
remains that 11,000 jobs were lost. What we want is for the 
government which was elected to create jobs to roll up its 
sleeves and finally get things going for the benefit of our 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate today, 
for a few minutes, and particularly so as a member of the 
government party.
<P>
	Since the election, last October, the Liberal government has 
taken to heart the commitments in our red book, the 
commitments that had been presented to Canadians after much 
reflection and debate within our political party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3977"> 3977 </A></B>
<P>
	For this government, jobs are the priority. Since its very first 
day in office, the new government began to keep its promises 
and implement policy initiatives designed to create jobs, to 
revive the economy, to spur economic growth, all things that 
Canadians had been deprived of during the last years of the 
Conservative government.
<P>
	The February 24 budget we presented to the Canadian public 
was a continuation of the initiatives the government had begun 
to put implement. There was the infrastructure program that will 
create jobs directly, renew the infrastructure across Canada and 
kick-start the much needed economic growth. In the last budget, 
the government put the emphasis on small and medium-sized 
businesses as the engine of the economy, with several initiatives 
designed to sustain them across Canada, so that they can create 
jobs.
<P>
	We also put the emphasis on the electronic and high tech 
sectors, which in our opinion are other engines of the Canadian 
economy. We have started to examine several areas of 
government policy and activity through in-depth reviews of 
foreign policy, defence and social security, a field I am involved 
in as chairman of a House committee.
<P>
	We have taken measures to build up the confidence of 
Canadians in political and governmental institutions. Canadians 
have responded, as can be seen in the polls and in the decreased 
contempt they feel for politicians and the government. These 
measures have been taken under the guidance of a Prime 
Minister who is a man of experience, who feels a strong and 
sincere passion for Canada and the future of Canada, and who 
sees how this country can become one of the guiding lights of 
the 21st century.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	Quebecers have benefitted from federal programs and 
initiatives. The recent budget included measures to promote job 
creation in Quebec. That province was largely spared when 
severe cuts were made in Atlantic Canada, for whom defence 
spending is very important. It is not easy for those provinces.
<P>
	The federal government took part in many joint programs 
with the Quebec government and Quebec firms to create jobs, 
particularly in the defence and high technology industries in 
Montreal, Quebec City and elsewhere.
<P>
	It seems strange that the official opposition, which wants to 
take Quebec out of Canada, should always be saying, through 
this motion and its remarks today, that the federal government 
does not give enough money to Quebec and does not give enough 
contracts to Quebec firms. This is ironic and even inconsistent 
for a party dedicated to Quebec separation.
<P>
	When the official opposition talks that way, it should think 
about the benefits for Quebecers of the presence of Quebec in 
the Canadian federation, and it should try to co-operate with the 
government in order to create jobs  that will keep the economy 
going. It should strive to build a better Canada instead of 
breaking up this great country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Madam Speaker, the member for 
Cape Breton Highlands-Canso, whom I know well since he is 
chairman of the human resources committee, of which I am a 
member, today criticizes the role of the Official Opposition and 
links it to sovereignty. Before doing that, however, he talked 
about a few things, and I would like to refresh his memory on 
certain facts. He said that Quebec was spared by the Budget in 
terms of cuts.
<P>
	I would like to ask him, after the many demonstrations made 
not only by the Official Opposition, but the Government of 
Quebec as well, if he really believes that the federal government 
spared Quebec when it closed the Collège militaire royal in 
Saint-Jean, the only francophone military college.
<P>
	I will not restart the debate held earlier, but I am still 
anxiously waiting for the government to take action in the MIL 
Davie case. There was no response, as we said a little earlier. I 
do not want to restart the debate, but we had no answer whatever 
on this subject.
<P>
	As for the helicopters, the government speedily cancelled the 
contracts that the Conservatives had made. However, unlike Bill 
C-22 on Toronto's Pearson Airport, which we are now 
discussing, there was no compensation.
<P>
	Formerly, when the federal government withdrew from 
certain projects, it created a regional development fund, as in 
the case of Laprade. But in this case, there was nothing of the 
sort. Yet, the jobs on the line were very high-tech ones.
<P>
	In this respect, you know, the member should share his 
concerns with us because his region is having problems with 
unemployment and fishing. He should himself be worried about 
the situation. I understand that this afternoon, he is on the other 
side, he is a member of the government, he does not dare to 
express his concerns. According to what I heard, I do not think a 
lot of progress was made in his province, Nova Scotia, since the 
Liberal Party's election, because unemployment is still very 
high. Quebecers are preoccupied because they lost 11,000 
hich-tech jobs. It is up to the government to respond.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	We, in the opposition, proposed this debate today because we 
feel that the conversion from military to civilian use is 
extremely important. Maybe it is not the most important issue, 
but it is one of the most important. Therefore, instead of 
accusing us of debating on the Constitution, the member should 
stick to today's issue, which is the problem of defence industry 
conversion.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3978"> 3978 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. LeBlanc (Cap-Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> Madam 
Speaker, first of all, I wish to thank the hon. member opposite 
for his question and also for his participation in the Human 
Resources Development Committee, where he made a very 
useful contribution on behalf of his party. But in responding 
to some points that he has raised, I said that Quebec had been 
considerably spared by the defence cuts in the budget. I say this 
because it is true and because other parts of Canada have 
suffered much deeper cuts in terms of funds, dollars and jobs.
<P>
	If we had followed his party's guidelines, the cuts would have 
been much deeper in Quebec and elsewhere. But I think that 
what the hon. member must remember is that, for example, on 
the MIL Davie issue, I am not an expert on that, but from what I 
understand, it is under discussion by both levels of government. 
There is a plan and both governments are discussing it, and that 
is what they have to do in a country such as ours. And that is 
what we need in order to find solutions to our problems. With 
that, I think the hon. member should, as he has been doing on the 
committee, and his party also should participate constructively 
in solutions that we must all bring to the problems, not only in 
Quebec, but in other areas of this country as well.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to ask the hon. member this. The motion relates to the 
unacceptable delays in converting the national defence industry 
to civilian production, but minimum reference was made to that 
actual approach in his presentation.
<P>
	I would like him to expand on that theme a little bit, if indeed 
there is a program along this line and if there is some delay in 
this that could possibly be speeded up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her question. To my 
knowledge the process of defence conversion is well under way, 
as has been mentioned by previous speakers. The government is 
assisting this process.
<P>
	I did not feel the need to go into a great deal of detail since 
those points have already been made by those closer to the issue 
than myself.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	We are well aware that parallel to a restructuring in the 
defence sector, which is proceeding and which will be informed 
by the debate and by the review on defence policy now taking 
place, as well as other initiatives which the government is taking 
to promote the high technology and information sectors of our 
economy, that we will assist and support the conversion of 
industries currently developed to focus mainly on military 
production, into other activities.
<P>
	It is not something that takes place overnight. It is a process in 
which the government is assisting. We are not following the 
Reform Party's approach which would have  been, as I 
understood it, not to cut defence and not to support conversion, 
which I find rather contradictory certainly in the light of the 
changes that are taking place not only in Canada but around the 
world in this very important sector of our economy.

	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan):</B> Madam Speaker, 
my question would probably be for the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Development of Human resources.
<P>
	Since February 20, 400 employees of the QNS &amp; L of 
Sept-Îles in my riding of Manicouagan are locked out. Federal 
law does not forbid the employer, the IOC mining company, to 
hire scabs, which naturally makes the situation extremely tense 
and even ready to explode.
<P>
	Since nothing hinders its activities, the company refuses to 
negotiate with its employees even if they want to work.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	I would like to ask the Liberal government if they agree that 
the absence of a federal anti-scab law is the reason for the 
deterioration of negotiations between QNS &amp; L and local 9344 
of the steel workers' union. I would also ask the government if 
they intend to intervene in that labour dispute and thus help the 
workers?

thank him for taking such an interest in the workers in his

<P>
	The question of restricting the use of replacement workers 
during legal work stoppages raises a number of complex issues, 
including the need to ensure that necessary services are 
provided to the Canadian public. Protecting the public interest is 
of particular relevance in the federal jurisdiction as the Canada 
Labour Code governs many industries which provide necessary 
services.
<P>
	While the code does not prohibit the use of replacement 
workers, it does provide protection for workers engaged in legal 
work stoppages. The code prohibits an employer from 
disciplining an employee for engaging in a legal work stoppage. 
As well, an employer cannot discipline an employee for refusing 
to perform the duties of another employee who is involved in a 
legal work stoppage.
<P>
	Once a work stoppage is terminated, employees are entitled to 
return to their employment in preference to any persons hired to 
replace them.
<P>
	Despite the complex nature of labour relations within federal 
jurisdiction, the existing system generally works as intended. 
Most collective bargaining negotiations are settled by the 
parties in direct negotiations. Of those that do require 
conciliation officer assistance, more than 90 per cent-many 
people do not realize this, Madam Speaker-are settled without 
a work stoppage.
<P>
	Part I of the Canada Labour Code has been designed to 
balance the rights and responsibilities of labour and 
management. This careful balance ensures that the collective 
bargaining system functions effectively in the vast majority of 
cases. For this reason it is important to consider the issue of 
restricting the use of replacement workers during work 
stoppages only in the context of a comprehensive review of the 
code.
<P>
	At a future date in the context of the full review, extensive 
consultations will be held and full consideration will be given to 
all representations on this subject.
<P>
	I hope this answers the hon. member's concerns.

	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a bit 
reluctantly and a bit, if I may say, obscenely, that I would ask the 
following question to the Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, because of the horror and the deep sadness of 
the intolerable events that are occurring in Rwanda. It is really 
hard for us, here, in this House, to imagine the situation out 
there. Let us just think about the 1,500 Rwanda nationals who 
live here, in Canada, and fear for the life of their families and 
friends.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I know the Canadian government is taking action in this very 
difficult situation. I asked the minister the other day if it was not 
possible to conceive of a surgical strike, a surgical operation 
whereby someone could go into Kigali and at least allow the 
innocent civilians who are trapped there in this incredible 
situation an escape route.
<P>
	I asked the minister to use his best efforts to see whether 
through the United Nations this could be done. We have heard on 
the news that the United Nations is talking about this. Well, the 
talking is going on and the killing is going on.
<P>
	We know that this situation requires a regional solution. We 
know that the Organization for African Unity is there. The 
Organization of African Unity needs some political will behind 
it. The Canadian government has earned a great deal of respect 
and goodwill in Africa. It can provide a political impetus to the 
process. It can also provide logistical support to the process.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	What is being done at this time to try to resolve this situation? 
I have spoken of a surgical operation and providing the 
logistical and political motivation to the Organization of 
African Unity so it is able to step forward. We can give it the 
strength, give it the ability to carry out an operation which only 
it can achieve.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to end my question, Madam Speaker, the way I 
started it. Africa is far away, but I believe that what we will do in 
this situation will determine how that Canada will respond in 
similar situations that are likely to occur in this more and more 
unstable and troubled world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Madam Speaker, unfortunately the civil war 
continues to claim numerous lives in Rwanda. We are in contact 
with the UN, the Organization of African Unity, friendly 
countries and other NGOs in order to determine how best to 
come to the aid of the Rwandan people.
<P>
	Next week the Prime Minister will be meeting with the 
president of the international committee of the Red Cross to 
exchange views on the provision of humanitarian assistance.
<P>
	CIDA has already provided $3 million in emergency aid since 
April's outbreak of violence. General Dallaire I must point out 
again continues to play a key role in leading the United Nations 
assistance mission to Rwanda. As an intermediary between the 
warring factions and as a participant in the humanitarian 
operations he has done his utmost to attempt to obtain a 
ceasefire with the assistance of the other seven Canadian 
soldiers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3980"> 3980 </A></B>
<P>
	Before deciding what action to take, the Security Council is 
awaiting a reply from the African countries to the 
Secretary-General's request for assistance. Canada's eventual 
contribution will be considered in light of the Security 
Council's decision.
<P>
	The Security Council is apparently leaning toward a regional 
solution with OAU participation funded by the United Nations. 
The RPF and representatives of the government have travelled 
to Tanzania to negotiate a ceasefire but are not talking to one 
another. However, they talk separately to the Tanzanian 
facilitator.
<P>
	The Department of Foreign Affairs received the Rwandan 
ambassador earlier this week to encourage his government to 
negotiate in good faith and end the killing once and for all. A 
similar message has been transmitted to the RPF via his 
representative in New York. Politicians of both sides were told 
that Canada will have a long memory toward those who exert 
responsibilities and do not use their power to put an end to these 
massacres.
<P>
	The Canadian Forces Hercules operating out of Nairobi into 
Kigali was shot at this morning after landing in Kigali. There 
were no injuries and damage was superficial. Flying has 
temporarily ceased until the situation at the airport has 
stabilized.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for Rosedale for bringing this crisis 
to the attention of Canada's Parliament. I also want to 
congratulate him on the excellent work he is doing in the whole 
area of foreign affairs.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FLUVACCINE">FLU VACCINE</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Madam Speaker, last 
April 26, I questioned the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services about the purchase of flu vaccine. His 
answer reflected his decision on that issue. However, everything 
was not said about the purchase of that vaccine. There are still 
some questions left concerning the role of the minister as buy 
broker for 4 million units of vaccine for the benefit of the 
provinces and territories. I would like to state a few disturbing 
and somewhat troubling facts about the process which led to the 
federal government's decision on that issue.
<P>
	In 1993, the contract for the supply of the flu vaccine was 
awarded entirely to Bio Vac. The call for tenders for 1994 was 
issued on December 8, 1993. The tender closing date was 
January 7, 1994 at 2 p.m.
<P>
	Two bids were received; Bio Vac from Laval was offering the 
vaccine at $1.70 per unit and Connaught from Toronto was 
offering a made in the U.S.A. vaccine at $1.46 per unit.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	Connaught's bid being lower, the federal minister who bought 
the vaccine seemed to prefer its American vaccine. That is when 
dumping allegations were made to the effect that Connaught was 
selling this very vaccine for close to $3 in the United States, but 
charging us $1.46 for it. Faced with this dumping issue the 
minister extended the bidding period from January 7 to 18. At 
that time, we were well aware the government was hesitant and 
delaying its decision. We knew the situation was rather tricky 
considering that jobs were at stake, as well as a large investment 
in biotechnology, proposed by Bio Vac in Laval.
<P>
	Another extension was announced, from January 18 to 
February 3. All this time, the Minister was under pressure to 
rapidly award the contract to BioVac. In a letter dated January 
27, the Quebec Minister of Industry, Commerce and Technology 
asked Minister Dingwall to decide quickly in favour of BioVac.
<P>
	On March 25, the minister told the House that he was looking 
for a Canadian solution to a serious Canadian problem. On April 
20, the minister announced that he had decided to split the 
difference and that his Canadian solution was to buy two million 
American vaccines. The minister, as a Canadian broker, was 
responsible for the lay-off of 26 employees with his Canadian 
solution, jeopardising at the same time a $32 million investment 
in biotechnology in Laval.
<P>
	This unacceptable decision raises some questions. What 
explanation can the minister give for the fact that his 
negotiations increased the average cost of the vaccine from 
$1.58 to $1.77, causing an additional expense of more than 
$750,000 to taxpayers?
<P>
	Second, given that the minister will now pay $1.77 per dose, 
why did he refuse, on January 7, 1994, at the close of the first 
call for tenders, to award the full contract to BioVac at $1.70 per 
dose?
<P>
	Third, can the minister tell us why, as a Canadian broker, he 
buys American vaccines at a cost of $1.69 per dose while 
BioVac's initial bid was $1.70? How can he explain such a 
cheeseparing saving of 1 cent on two million doses of vaccine, 
or $20,000, compared to 26 jobs lost? Has the minister analyzed 
the economic cost of these 26 job losses? Finally, why is he 
buying vaccines made in the U.S.A. when they could be entirely 
produced in Canada? The minister's Canadian solution is a bad 
joke.
<P>
	To add a final touch to this already gloomy picture, rumour 
has it that the minister asked BioVac to sign a letter stating its 
satisfaction with the deal. What unmitigated nerve on the part of 
the minister!
<P>
	The federal broker-minister is not transparent in this case. He 
acted in such a way that he penalized a Canadian firm and 
disregarded the taxpayers' interests. His decision is senseless 
and thoughtless. We ask the minister to disclose all the facts and 
to table, if he has the courage to, all documents pertaining to this 
case.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Before recognizing the 
hon. parliamentary secretary, I just want to remind the hon. 
member for Laurentides that she should not use the name of 
a minister but his or her title instead.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to be able to respond to the 
hon. member and clarify yet again the federal government's role 
in this important matter.
<P>
	All members will surely agree that the availability of 
influenza vaccine for school children and the elderly across 
Canada is an issue which should be far removed from partisan 
political considerations. The health and safety of Canada's 
children and the elderly is this government's first priority. I 
hope the same is true for my friend across the floor.
<P>
	I am proud of the role that the department of the minister to 
whom I am parliamentary secretary and the federal government 
have played for the past twenty-one years on behalf of the 
provinces and territories.
<P>
	With Public Works and Government Services acting as the 
purchasing agent of the vaccine on behalf of a joint 
federal-provincial-territorial committee, we have been able to 
achieve the economies of scale which bulk purchases represent. 
The price per dose for one large national order is lower than if a 
number of smaller purchases are made by the different 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	The result is a sterling demonstration of joint 
federal-provincial-territorial cooperation and efficient use of 
taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Members should note that the value of these purchases is now 
approximately $7 million per year, of which 99 per cent is paid 
for by the provinces and territories. The federal government 
uses and pays for less than 1 per cent of the vaccine.
<P>
	As has been announced in this House on several occasions, 
and following a competitive process, an agreement in principle 
was concluded on April 13, 1994, between the 
federal-provincial-territorial committee and two Canadian 
drug manufacturers. The contracts will be split 50/50 between 
IAF BioVac in Laval, Quebec, and Connaught Laboratories in 
Willowdale, Ontario. These contracts are scheduled to be signed 
later this month. I should point out to the House that the hon. 
member mentioned that there was a significant reduction in one 
particular year, but if we look at the average for the last three 
years, the proportion has gone from 38 per cent then to 50 per 
cent now. That is 12 per cent more.
<P>
	Prices are lower than in past years, and they are going down. 
This year's price of $1.77 per dose is lower than the 1992 and 
1993 prices.
<P>
	To reiterate, both companies, the provinces and territories 
have agreed to this arrangement. In questioning the government 
on this issue, the member and her party have made a number of 
factual errors. If  one did not know better, one might conclude 
that there is a deliberate attempt to mislead members of this 
House and the Canadians we represent.
<P>
	I sincerely hope that this is not the case.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="2002OLYMPICGAMES">2002 OLYMPIC GAMES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Madam Speaker, on April 22, I 
asked the Deputy Prime Minister a question about the federal 
contribution to Quebec 2002. That was a two-part question. 
First, I asked her when her government would appoint a 
negotiator to determine with Quebec 2002 the amount of 
funding needed.
<P>
	``Soon'', answered the Deputy Prime minister. On this issue, I 
am quite satisfied, since the daily newspaper <I>Le Soleil</I> reported, 
on April 30, that the federal government had appointed, a day or 
two before, Mr. Laurent Tremblay, executive director of the 
Quebec office of the Department of Canadian Heritage, to act as 
spokesperson for the federal government. One week is not that 
bad a delay and we are satisfied with this part of the answer.
<P>
	But we fail to see why it took six months and a question in the 
House for the federal government to reply to an organization's 
request. Six months is a long time. Will we need to press the 
government in the House on all issues so that they finally reply 
to organizations' requests?
<P>
	We were satisfied with the answer we got this time. A 
negotiator was appointed within a week. Unfortunately, 
negotiations have not started yet and the deadline for Quebec 
2002 has not been changed. Indeed, the final bids must be in by 
August 18. They would like a definite answer from the federal 
government within the next month, by the middle of June.
<P>
	That was the second part of my question. I asked the Deputy 
Prime Minister if she was prepared to give a mandate to a 
negotiator modelled on what was done for Calgary in terms of 
federal assistance when it bid on the 1988 Winter Games. I have 
not received an answer to my question, either from the 
government or from the negotiator.
<P>
	I would like to remind this government that although 
governments do come and go, it does have some responsibility 
since in 1992, the former prime minister did make a verbal 
commitment. However, since a new government is in office, this 
commitment needs to be reaffirmed and confirmed, since we are 
dealing with relatively tight deadlines.
<P>
	Calgary received $240 million in financing guarantees. I 
cannot understand why the federal government is so reluctant to 
commit to a similar amount when a study has shown that this 
project would generate in the neighbourhood of $200 million in 
terms of direct and indirect jobs, the GST and so on. Why is the 
government taking so long to decide when it could earn these 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3982"> 3982 </A></B>
<P>
kinds of revenues? Quebec is asking for equal consideration for 
the 2002 Games, that is $240 million in financing guarantees, 
without any indexation.
<P>
	This financial guarantee is extremely important to the 
residents of the Quebec City region in terms of helping them 
prepare and present their bid for the Olympic Games. They need 
some assurance that federal assistance will be forthcoming. A 
great many concerns are being expressed at the local level. 
Without assurances of the usual government assistance, people 
are getting worried.
<P>
	I hope that I will receive a clearer answer today than I did last 
time.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Madam Speaker, on several 
occasions in the past few months, the government of Canada has 
expressed support for the group of Quebec residents promoting 
Quebec City's bid to host the 2002 Olympic Games. This is a 
very important issue which must be considered carefully to 
ensure the success of the entire operation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The federal government has already committed $2.8 million 
toward supporting Quebec's international bid efforts before the 
International Olympic Committee. The Minister of Canadian 
Heritage led a Canadian delegation in February to Lillehammer 
while promoting Quebec's bid for the winter games.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The federal government's financial commitment could add up 
to several hundred million dollars. You will agree this is a 
substantial amount. That is why this commitment has to be 
considered carefully beforehand. Not only has the Minister of 
National Heritage asked his officials to work diligently on this, 
but before a final answer can be given to the organizing 
committee, he will have to consult with his Cabinet colleagues 
whose departments will be involved.
<P>
	Hosting the Olympic Games in Quebec City in 2002 requires 
major financial support from the various levels of government, 
but this project must also receive unequivocal support from the 
local people; without this support, holding a sports event of that 
magnitude would be unthinkable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	IOC will make its final decision in Budapest in June 1995, 
after making a preselection in January 1995 when it will invite 
four finalists to pursue their bids.
<P>
	The member can rest assured that the minister is taking the 
August 18, 1994 deadline for the preselection applications into 
account. An answer will be announced as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 5.59 p.m. this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 5.59 p.m.)
