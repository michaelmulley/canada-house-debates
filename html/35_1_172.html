	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
1966 the United Nations declared March 21 the International 
Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Since 1988 
this date has been officially recognized and celebrated in 
Canada for this purpose.
<P>
	While that date has passed, it is important for us all to 
remember that the purpose of this day is to promote racial 
tolerance and understanding. There is no place for racism in 
Canadian society. Prejudice and discrimination are problems 
that must be acknowledged and addressed. They must be 
stamped out. As Canadian citizens, we must take individual 
responsibility in the elimination of racism and racial 
discrimination.
<P>
	Our greatest legacy to the world, if we so choose, is to develop 
a model bilingual and multicultural society where each 
Canadian is valued, where each and every one of us learns to 
work and celebrate together in a spirit of harmony and unity.

	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
October 1945, Hector Racine, then president of the Montreal 
Royals, announced that Jackie Robinson was joining his 
baseball team. This signalled the beginning of the end of racial 
segregation in American and Canadian professional sport.
<P>
	Yesterday, as we marked the International Day for the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Montrealers paid tribute 
to Jackie Robinson, the first black to play baseball 
professionally.
<P>
	Mr. Robinson played one year with the Montreal club, in 
1946, before joining the Brooklyn Dodgers for a remarkable 
professional career.
<P>
	On behalf of all those who remember Jackie Robinson, I 
would like to pay tribute once again to this great adopted son of 
Montreal, who led his team to victory in the international league 
in 1946.

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
gentleman, a hard working fellow cannot sleep one night. He 
decides that rather than twist and turn in bed he would get up, go 
to his jewellery store in a small Ontario town and get a head start 
on the day's work.
<P>
	It is dark at 3 a.m. The 81-year old jeweller is quietly working 
in the back of his shop when suddenly a loud crash startles our 
law-abiding shop owner. His heart stops as he turns and sees two 
young, strong vandals coming in through the broken window in 
the front of his shop.
<P>
	He is frightened. He worries about physical harm and that his 
private property will be stolen. The frightened shop owner 
reaches for the revolver which has been inside his shop for many 
years. Out of fear for his personal safety he fires it to scare away 
the vandals.
<P>
	The next morning the elderly shopkeeper has more to worry 
about. He is now the criminal. He is now facing charges far 
worse than those who were attempting to rob or possibly injure

will result from the abandonment of the Crow benefit and the

	The minister of agriculture has decided in his wisdom to 
include summer fallow in the calculation for the payment but 
not the 10 million acres or more of cultivated lands that are

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Conciliation commissioner Hope's report clearly states that 
the main cause of the rail dispute is the attitude of the railway 
companies which, throughout the negotiations, refused to give 
any consideration whatsoever to union demands. It says that, at 
most bargaining tables, union demands did not receive any 
consideration, even though it is clear that these demands are 
serious and have merit.
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is this: Why is the 
government so intent on rejecting at all cost the official 
opposition's offer to settle the rail dispute very quickly while 
respecting the rights of workers, who could not be heard? Why is 
the government so inflexible toward the workers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bloc members seem to be overlooking the whole 
process. Negotiations in this sector have been under way for 
over a year, first with a conciliator and then with a conciliation 
commissioner.
<P>
	We stand before a fait accompli: Railway operations are 
completely paralyzed. This has a huge economic impact from 
coast to coast. Even in Quebec, more plants shut down today. I 
am asking the Bloc Quebecois to be a little more sensitive to 
Quebec's economy, if they are unable to be sensitive to Canada's 
economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to remind the Minister of Labour that if she wants to settle the 
dispute without trampling on workers, we are ready to 
co-operate right now.
<P>
	It is not the official opposition but the conciliation 
commissioner who said that union demands did not receive any 
attention. The minister should read his report before opening her 
mouth.
<P>
	Does the government's insistence on imposing diminished 
working conditions on CN workers at all cost mean that its 
intention to privatize CN is forcing the government to settle the 
matter of working conditions quickly and at workers' expense, 
in order to attract potential investors?

<HR>
<B><A NAME="10829"> 10829 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us look at the facts. We should try to stay neutral in 
this dispute-and I think that is what the government is trying to 
do-and avoid siding with either the unions or the employers. I 
think it is up to them to negotiate their collective agreements. 
We want the unions to participate in the collective bargaining 
process as well.
<P>
	Let us be realistic: Kruger is closed, while Bécancour, Alcan 
and Petromont are in the process of shutting down. Let us do 
something, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can 
the Minister of Labour say so candidly that we should let the 
parties negotiate among themselves? That is exactly what our 
proposal calls for. We should let the employees go back to work 
and negotiate with their employers. That is what we are asking 
the minister. Did the minister not understand any of this?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder who does not understand anything in this 
case. Negotiations have been under way for over a year in this 
matter. All the Bloc Quebecois can do is tell me to forget about 
results, offer to talk some more and ask for mediation.
<P>
	This government wants to achieve results. We are currently 
facing a major crisis from coast to coast and the government has 
a responsibility to take action instead of simply talking and 
trying to avoid the real problems.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. Obviously, the government's 
commercial and financial interests are directly affected by the 
CN strike. Indeed, in spite of the Prime Minister's claims, with 
the rapid imposition of less favourable working conditions, 
CN's market value is much higher in case of an eventual sale.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister is serious when he claims that the 
government's commercial interests do not have priority over the 
rights of workers, why does he still reject the official 
opposition's proposal, considering that a negotiated settlement 
is much better than an imposed agreement?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have nothing to add to the comments made by the 
Minister of Labour. Negotiations went on for months and now 
there is a strike. Thousands of jobs are affected throughout 
Canada and that strike causes serious injury to our country's 
economy. Our government is not concerned about its own 
economic interests, but about those of Canadians, including 
manufacturers of goods and agricultural producers, who must 
ship their products to market. This is our top priority and it will 
not change.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
Monday, we have been proposing conditions which would 
ensure a quick return to work. Considering that conciliator Hope 
states in his report that there is collusion between the 
government and the employers,  how can the Prime Minister 
claim that the arbitration commissions will do justice to the 
workers, since two of the three members will be appointed by 
the government and the employers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is quoting from a conciliation report 
that did not resolve the problem. She is asking us to enter into 
conciliation again, to have 60 more days of that. We have been in 
a strike situation now for many days. We will start over in 60 
days? No way. They have to go back to work right now.

question yesterday. I made it very clear the government's 
ultimate objective is to go to zero. I also made it very clear, and I 
will be confirming this to Moody's, we are going to be doing this 
with a series of short term targets because we feel it is the best 
way to get there.

question is directed to the Prime Minister. Half a dozen Spanish 
ships are now on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks off 
Newfoundland, fishing for Greenland halibut or turbot, despite 
the moratorium requested by Canada. Both Canadian and 
Spanish armed vessels are now patrolling this area.
<P>
	Since the Canadian government has stated repeatedly that it 
would resort to seizures again if necessary, could the Prime 
Minister indicate what his government intends to do to make 
Spanish ships stop fishing on the nose and tail of the Grand 
Banks off Newfoundland?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday I had a chance to speak to President Santer of 
the European Union, and Prime Minister Gonzalez of Spain. Mr. 
Santer had indicated earlier that he hoped we would be able to 
negotiate a settlement to the dispute as soon as possible. That is 
what we intend to do.
<P>
	It is true a number of ships are fishing at this time. There were 
49 and now there are six. Yesterday I spoke to Mr. Gonzalez, and 
I told him to ask the Spanish fishermen to withdraw, because we 
have ordered our own fishermen to stop fishing and the same 
should apply to Spanish fishermen. I will be talking to Mr. 
Gonzalez again later today. Canada takes the position that a 
settlement should be such as ensure that in the future, fishing 
regulations will be complied with both outside and within the 
200-mile zone. That is our goal, and in the interest of 
conservation we hope to attain it as soon as possible.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
although apparently there was a cordial exchange between the

Canadian government's strategy for resolving the dispute with

economy. We are looking to find a way so that we will not be 
trapped in this situation all the time.
<P>

accepted some strikes because the situation was justifiable, but 
at this time the combination of strikes is too much for the

work can resume as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can 
understand the governing party is having trouble handling the 
situation but the Canadian people do not have any patience with 
it. We have had 15 strikes in 15 years.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the Minister for 
International Trade. Forty per cent of Canadian exports depend 
on railways to move to market. The government's inaction on 
the issue last week led to significant financial losses for 
exporters.
<P>
	Will the Minister for International Trade impress upon his 
colleague, the Minister of Labour, that Canada cannot afford 
further damage to our reputation as a reliable supplier?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

its position. If we had not been faced with the opposition of the

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Defence.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of Defence announced the creation of 
a commission of inquiry on the deployment of the Canadian 
Forces to Somalia. However, despite repeated requests from the 
official opposition, the minister refuses to broaden the 
commission's terms of reference to include other troubling 
events that have occurred at the Petawawa base.
<P>
	How does the minister explain that the commission's terms of 
reference cover only the deployment of the Airborne Regiment 
in Somalia and that they contain no other provision regarding 
other events that have occurred at Petawawa and that have 
considerably sullied the reputation and the honour of the 
Canadian Forces?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
called the inquiry as promised to deal with the very serious 
problems that occurred when our troops were deployed to 
Somalia some two years ago.
<P>
	The inquiry is public. It is headed by a civilian, a Federal 
Court judge, and will look into all aspects of the deployment to 
Somalia.
<P>
	If the hon. member has other troubling questions that he 
would like to pose with respect to any other aspect of the armed 
forces, he should be specific, do it in the House, write to me or 
put an order paper question down, and I will be pleased to 
answer.
<P>
	We are not going to have an investigation or an inquiry into 
every aspect of the Canadian Armed Forces and the Ministry of 
National Defence. We are restricting the inquiry to the events of 
1993, the deployment of Canadian troops to that theatre.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
given that the minister undertook to bring all of the despicable 
events at Petawawa to light, are we to understand that the 
initiation rites and the display of the flag symbolizing white 
supremacy and the banner of the Klu Klux Klan openly and with 
the knowledge of senior officers constituted preparation for the 
mission to Somalia and will therefore be investigated?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if there 
is anything in the preparation of the Canadian airborne regiment 
for its duty in Somalia that needs to come to light, it should be 
investigated by the inquiry.
<P>
	The terms of reference are exceedingly broad. The three 
commissioners are civilians of great repute. I have no question 
in my mind that they will get to the bottom of any question the 
hon. member has or the Canadian public has.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased that the Minister of National Defence has 
seen the wisdom of conducting the Somalia investigation under 
the Inquiries Act rather than the National Defence Act.
<P>
	My concern now is for members of the Canadian forces who 
may have pertinent information but hesitate to bring it forward 
for fear of career implications.
<P>
	What provisions has the minister made to protect such 
individuals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
dealing here with a very serious matter. We have an inquiry 
under part I of the Inquiries Act.
<P>
	Any Canadian with any evidence has a right and a duty to 
come forward to that inquiry and no impediment must be put in 
his or her way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr.

Canada, Bernard Bonin, set a dangerous precedent when he 
endorsed the analysis and conclusions of a prereferendum study 
carried out by the C.D. Howe Institute which concluded that 
Quebec's separation would provoke a serious economic upset 
and a capital drain which would force Quebec to mint its own 
currency.

senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada to become 
publicly involved in a political debate?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

been attacked by the Bloc critic. Personally, I intend to defend 
Bernard Bonin.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr.

direct my supplementary question to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister, who as he said yesterday is the only 
one to have access to the ethics counsellor, intend to submit the 
case of the senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada for an 
opinion and then report to the House on this important, serious 
and grave issue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe that the 
Bloc should listen to the message instead of attacking the 
messenger.
<P>
	I am a little disappointed to hear what the opposition critic, 
who, by the way, is an honest man, has to say. The separatists 
have threatened to refuse to have anything to do with the banks 
or currency traders that tried to make economic forecasts 
regarding separation, they have stated that in their view 
allophones should not have the right to vote, and they rejected 
outright the C.D. Howe Institute's and Marcel Côté's analyses.

	I need some Liberal senators who will have more sense than 
the ones who are blocking legislation that is very important and 
in the interest of taxpayers so that we will not give more money

<P>
	I also remind the Prime Minister that with provincial 
elections from time to time, in this case New Brunswick, the 
cost factor would be low and democracy is worth it.

after the fact that the chairman of the National Capital

<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister reconcile the opinion given by 
his ethics counselor, his personal counselor who maintains that 
this behaviour is in compliance with the code of ethics, when 
section 33 of the Public Service Employment Act states, and I 
quote: ``No deputy head shall engage in work for or against a 
political party''? I would like an answer.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there have been court rulings on this and I must add that 
the Quebec referendum is not a partisan issue, but an 
opportunity for every Quebec citizen to say whether or not he or 
she wants to remain in Canada. This is not necessarily a matter 
involving work for or against a political party.

of the very serious issue before the House.
<P>
	One week of lost rail service has the impact of holding up 
500,000 tonnes of grain shipments through the Canadian Wheat 
Board valued at $83 million. When we add in the non-board 
grains the total goes up to very close to $100 million, plus $15 
million in losses for domestic oilseed processors, plus another 
$5 million in losses for flour millers. The cost of that is in excess

It is a hunt by landsmen only. It is within the current quota that

appointment of two senators, aroused my ire to some extent.
<P>
	I hope you will understand, Mr. Speaker, that we have had 
some experiences recently with the Reform Party commenting 
on the appointment of Acadians to various positions in 
government.
<P>
	I want to withdraw the remark I made to my colleague. I 
withdraw it unequivocally.

Speaker, in light of the very serious crisis facing the country, 
namely the national rail strike, that is ongoing and which the 
government is seeking to end, I think you might find unanimous 
consent in the House for the following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, notwithstanding any standing order, immediately after the completion 
of private members' business on this day, the House shall revert to Government 
Orders for the purpose of continuing consideration of Bill C-77, an act to 
provide for the maintenance of railway operations and subsidiary services at the 
second reading stage, in committee of the whole, at the report stage and at third 
reading stage, provided that the House shall not adjourn this day except 
pursuant to a motion by a minister of the crown.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There is not unanimous consent.

	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
want to make it clear that while there is opposition on the 
opposition side of the House to the motion, it comes from the 
Bloc Quebecois and the NDP and not the Reform Party.

member for Mackenzie, is this a comment on the unanimous 
consent which I sought?

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great honour and pleasure that I rise pursuant to Standing Order 
36 to present a petition regarding the parliamentary prayer in 
this House. The petition was originally signed by 20,593 people. 
The majority are from my riding of Saint John, New Brunswick, 
as well as from Newfoundland, Ontario, Saskatchewan, B.C., 
across this whole nation.
<P>
	Due to various inaccuracies some were just certified today. I 
am presenting a petition signed by 15,268 names. I find the 
process to be a little questionable in that we decertify some 
petitions because of a lack of an-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sure the hon. member knows that we have 
a procedure in the House which is followed. This procedure was 
agreed to by the House of Commons. I would deem the petition 
to be presented by the hon. member and I accept it as such. I 
hope that the hon. member would keep her final comments very 
brief.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Wayne:</B> These petitions state that the opening prayer in 
the House of Commons should retain the traditional reference to 
Jesus Christ and that the traditional Lord's Prayer be reinstated 
at the closing of the opening prayer.
<P>
	Therefore, the petitioners call on the House to close the 
prayer, ``through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'' They call on 
the House to act on this request. I wholeheartedly agree with the 
petitioners and would request-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, last week I asked hon. members to 
refrain from saying whether they agree or disagree with a 
petition. That takes a little of the sting out of the petition for 
some members who may or may not want to agree with it. I 
would ask hon. members if they would please consider this when 
they are presenting petitions.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MAINTENANCEOFRAILWAYOPERATIONSACT,1995">MAINTENANCE OF RAILWAY OPERATIONS ACT, 1995</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> 
moved that Bill C-77, an act to provide for the maintenance of 
railway operations and subsidiary services, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the 
Maintenance of Railway Operations Act, 1995. The primary aim 
of this bill is to put an end to the work stoppage paralysing the 
railway industry and to permit the resumption of activities in 
this sector. The bill also provides a solution, through a 
mediation-arbitration process, to the matters remaining in 
dispute between the companies and various unions.
<P>
	My colleagues in the House are certainly aware that a major 
disruption in Canadian railway operations can have grave 
consequences on various sectors of the economy and on the 
thousands of railway passengers.
<P>
	I had hoped we could avoid such a measure, but the 
government hardly has a choice anymore. Government 
intervention in this dispute has become unavoidable. We would 
be lacking in our duty to the people of Canada if we allowed a 
work stoppage in the railway sector to threaten the stability of 
our economy and the jobs of the thousands of workers affected 
by this dispute.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	During negotiations between the railway companies and the 
unions concerned, it became clear that because of the position 
taken by the employers that substantial cuts in labour costs were 
necessary, it would be a long and arduous process. To cut costs, 
the railway companies are seeking major concessions with 
respect to job security and more flexibility in the distribution of 
tasks.
<P>
	Negotiations between the employers and the unions have been 
going on for more than a year, and in most cases, the parties were 
assisted by a conciliator and a conciliation commissioner. My 
predecessor, the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
appointed Mr. Allan Hope as conciliation commissioner for the 
purposes of collective bargaining on eleven agreements 
involving the three railway companies. The report prepared by 
the conciliation commissioner was transmitted to the parties on 
February 22, 1995. This report proposes ways to reach a final 
settlement on issues on which the parties have failed to agree.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the issue of job security was central to the 
concerns of the employer during these negotiations. If we look 
at the situation in the three railway companies concerned by the 
bill before the House today, CN and VIA Rail have proposed a 
gradual phasing out of this benefit, while Canadian Pacific 
suggested restructuring the provisions on job security so as to 
restrict employee eligibility.
<P>
	The unions expressed their frustration with the emphasis 
placed on this issue during the bargaining process and were 
quick to point out that, from their point of view, job security was 
an advantage that had been obtained through collective 
bargaining in return for various concessions and trade-offs. The 
representatives of the unions, who see this advantage as a way to 
protect employees against loss of employment due to structural 
and technological change, maintain that the employer wants to 
remove this protection at a time when the job security of their 
members is threatened.
<P>
	On the other hand, agreements concluded recently by 
Canadian Pacific with three of the unions that represent smaller 
bargaining units within the company are a clear indication that 
the process can work. The three unions-the Transportation 
Communications International Union, the International 
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Rail Canada Traffic 
Controllers-managed to agree with the company on wage 
increases, conditions relating to job security and a number of 
improvements to social benefits.
<P>
	I have tried to give hon. members a quick rundown on the 
events that have taken place so far and the situation we are now 
facing, despite assistance provided on a massive scale to the 
parties, in an attempt to avoid any disruption in railway 
transportation and its consequences for Canadian producers and 
manufacturers whose economic survival depends on this mode 
of transportation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10840"> 10840 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As hon. members may be aware, I met with representatives of 
the rail companies and the unions in Montreal on Sunday 
afternoon. At that meeting I acknowledged their efforts in 
attempting to achieve a resolution of their respective 
differences.
<P>
	I expressed concern over the economic damage which was 
being inflicted on the Canadian business and agricultural sectors 
as a result of the work stoppages. I asked the parties to give the 
negotiation process one final push in order to achieve either 
tentative settlements of the issues in dispute, or agree on a 
binding process to solve their differences and avoid the need for 
legislated intervention on the part of the government.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately the companies and the unions have failed to 
reach any type of agreement on these matters. We are left with 
no choice but to assume our responsibility to the Canadian 
public and bring this feud to a conclusion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the bill entitled Maintenance of 
Railway Operations Act, 1995, is to ensure that railway and 
subsidiary services continue or are forthwith resumed at 
Canadian National, Canadian Pacific and VIA Rail.
<P>
	With respect to the dispute resolution process, the bill before 
my hon. colleagues calls for a mediation-arbitration 
commission to be established in respect of each bargaining unit 
prescribed. Each commission shall consist of one representative 
appointed by the employer, one representative appointed by the 
union and a chairperson appointed by the Minister of Labour.
<P>
	Within 70 days after its establishment or such longer period as 
the minister may allow, each commission must endeavour to 
mediate all the matters referred to it, then hear the parties on the 
matters on which it was unable to bring about an agreement and 
render an arbitration decision on these matters. It must also fix a 
date for the termination of the new collective agreement, which 
date may not be earlier than December 31, 1997.
<P>
	To ensure that each commission carries out its mandate with 
impartiality, the bill requires each commission to be guided by 
the need for terms and conditions of employment that are 
consistent with the economic viability and competitiveness of a 
coast-to-coast rail system in both the short and the long term, 
taking  into account the importance of good labour-management 
relations.
<P>
	I am convinced that this bill will not make all parties involved 
happy, but I know that it provides for a dispute resolution 
process that is both fair and speedy. With this legislation, the 
government sends a clear message to the railway companies and 
the unions. It is telling them that, while believing in the 
collective bargaining process, it is not prepared to let work 
stoppages in the railway sector interfere with the normal 
operation of the Canadian economy. I urge all hon. members to 
support this position by ensuring that this bill is passed as 
quickly as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
know that we currently bear a heavy responsibility, but it is 
because the Bloc Quebecois takes its role as the official 
opposition very seriously that it cannot support a special piece 
of legislation that denies both the right to strike and the right to 
negotiate. On Monday, we proposed amendments that would 
have allowed the employees to go back to work without 
undermining the ability to negotiate for those who exercised 
their right under the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	Why must this special bill single out the workers and some of 
the strikers? Why must it undermine negotiated settlements by 
outlining a general and drastic worsening of working 
conditions? Why is the government itself not acting on the 
substance of the report by Commissioner Hope, who was 
appointed to advise the government and did so by working hard 
and producing a comprehensive report? Why did the 
government actually undermine the significance of the Hope 
report? Why is it satisfied with a hollowed-out Hope report?
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Labour's position is certainly not impartial 
and I will show that. Is the minister acting like a sorcerer's 
apprentice because of inexperience, ignorance or bad faith? Let 
us at least put the question.
<P>
	The government is in a hurry, but it has difficulty hiding the 
fact that it is taking advantage of a serious situation to protect 
interests which are not the economic interests it is referring to. 
The government does not care about establishing conditions 
which would promote co-operation. It imposes a bludgeon law 
which does not even leave room for mutually agreed 
settlements. The government also treats differently the three 
companies, at the expense of the workers affected by the strike 
and the lockout.
<P>
	The proposal which we made on Monday seeks to preserve the 
future: everyone goes back to work; mediation takes place 
according to the Hope formula; a public report is released and 
recommendations are made to this House to try to restore a 
balance which was destroyed for workers by the action and 
inaction of this government.
<P>
	Since the strike started, its settlement has become a national 
issue. We feel that, in the context, the two sides  may have a new 
desire to reach a settlement. Such an example of conditions 
promoting fair and healthy work relations would be a definite 
asset for the future of the country that this government claims to 
want to build. However, in the meantime, what Canadians and 
Quebecers see, is a government taking advantage of a serious 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10841"> 10841 </A></B>
<P>
situation to promote its partisan interests. That is not from me: it 
is from the Hope report.
<P>
	We had to protect the interests of Canadian workers who used 
their right to strike, as provided in the Labour Code. I said it on 
several occasions:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If the Canadian economy cannot afford the Canada Labour 
Code then it should be said and something should be done in 
order to avoid the sort of mess we are in. The workers will be the 
ones who will pay and we know many persons who are not 
responsible for that. The government and the House cannot have 
blind eyes on that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The right to strike is a fundamental right in every democratic 
society. In the context of labour relations, it plays a major role in 
bringing about a settlement between the parties, a mutually 
satisfactory settlement through which the level of productivity 
sought by companies and workers, and society as a whole, can be 
achieved.
<P>
	Never has forced settlement brought about innovative ideas to 
deal with new situations. Solutions imposed on the parties only 
repeat patterns that cannot be adapted any more to particular 
situations. But there are no short cuts when it comes to looking 
for solutions together. Every time we failed to do so-and, as we 
know, this has been a problem in the public service-we ended 
up paying a much higher price in terms of loss of productivity, 
because it becomes impossible under such circumstances to 
finds mutually acceptable solutions.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	This is not an attack on companies, on the contrary. But 
businesses worthy of the trust the public puts in them must know 
that they cannot claim to be reorganizing in order to compete if 
they do not take their employees into account. There are no short 
cuts.
<P>
	It is extremely unfortunate that the new so-called ``labour'' 
minister's second move since taking office is to undermine any 
chance of real corporate reorganization by putting in place 
mechanisms, traditional mechanisms, that have already proven 
ineffective in reforming the system. With these mechanisms, the 
minister condemns Canada to live through situations we had 
hoped never to live through again.
<P>
	I am telling you this as a Bloc member, because we take our 
role of official opposition seriously. After all, we could rejoice 
over the fact that a position perpetuating problems and making 
them worse can be put in place this way. But no, we are here to 
play a positive role as long  as we remain in this country and look 
after the interests of the workers as well as the companies who 
depend on a satisfactory settlement.
<P>
	The Hope report contains a wealth of information. I will try to 
give you a brief outline of the highlights that should have guided 
the government in preparing its bill, if it had really sought what 
it claims to be seeking. First of all, I will outline the main 
elements of the Hope report. The report says this: ``In summary, 
the dispute revolves around extremely complex collective 
bargaining issues raised under circumstances that do not lend 
themselves very well to negotiated solutions. Given the 
circumstances, the purpose of this report is to determine the 
possibility of initiating an ongoing process that would allow the 
parties to deal with these very complex issues through binding 
mediation or arbitration maximizing the parties' involvement in 
setting the conditions''.
<P>
	Mr. Hope took on the difficult task of defining the conditions 
in which solutions can be found despite the difficult situation. 
He reviewed the available literature on labour relations and 
administration, after stressing the labour department's basic 
tradition of neutrality and objectivity. That is what Mr. Hope 
himself said. I think he would be disappointed in the current 
situation. He noted that, according to the unions, the 
government, through the Minister of Transport, delayed the 
collective bargaining process, and that both the employers and 
the government seem ready to attack the rail employees' 
working conditions.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	It says that, in fact, the companies have already made 
demands of this kind in the past. They have already tried to 
obtain similar concessions during past rounds of negotiations. 
Their demands are so controversial and provocative because of 
the partisan role taken by the government, which supports the 
position of the railway companies, and because of the tenacity 
with which the companies have stuck to these demands. And, he 
says, their points of disagreement are complicated because we 
are now in a period of economic recovery and in a situation 
which management, the management of companies, has let 
fester for several years.
<P>
	Having said this, what did Mr. Hope propose in his report after 
reviewing the situation? He said that we could have let the strike 
go on. Because we find ourselves before two reconcilable 
parties. The minister says that there have been hours and hours 
and hours of negotiation, but what she really means is that 
people have been sitting at the same table for hours and hours 
and hours. Anyone who has ever been involved in negotiations 
knows that people can sit down face to face, side by side, yet 
negotiate nothing, put nothing on the table, because the parties 
refuse to put anything on the table as long as they are uncertain 
whether they will come out winners when they play their cards.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10842"> 10842 </A></B>
<P>
	It is true that the government has intervened so many times in 
the railway industry that the employers, and in some cases the 
unions, are just waiting for the government to step in. This 
undermines the effectiveness of a strike.
<P>
	By the way, the Hope report says that a strike cannot be 
stopped just because of interruptions in service; the right to 
strike can only be suspended in extremely serious cases. The 
report states that the worst case scenario for the unions would be 
if the government found itself forced to impose the railway 
companies' demands as a prelude to the rationalization process 
outlined in the reports.
<P>
	We now find ourselves in this worst case scenario. Why? Once 
the government decided to intervene, instead of following the 
recommendations contained in the Hope report, it decided to use 
a process which has already proven unsuccessful. In fact, what 
does the Hope report have to say about the government 
legislating employees back to work? The report indicates that 
dispute arbitration must be avoided at all cost, because such 
arbitration cases have prevented us from addressing the problem 
and often led us to copy old systems instead of looking for new 
solutions and making progress.
<P>
	Under what conditions could we allow the parties to break the 
current deadlock without a strike? We agree that the only means 
of settling the real issues is the right to strike.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Hope arrives at the following solution-he says there 
could be other ones, but this is the one he proposes: first, a 
mediation-arbitration stage to allow the parties involved to 
reach a consensus on what he calls the parameters but that I 
would describe as the overall situation of the companies.
<P>
	Let me explain. Workers are convinced that the companies 
make profits, but that they are mismanaged which results in 
waste, that Paul Tellier's salary does not allow him to teach 
lessons to others, that the government's plan-they hear about 
it-to streamline operations is a threat to them, that the Minister 
of Transport supports the companies and that he made offending 
comments, to say the least, when he said that railway employees 
with a grade eight or nine education should not be blamed for 
negotiating overgenerous collective agreements.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Shame.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde: </B>Real negotiations require that the parties 
meet. However, for the unions, the situation is the one which I 
just described. The unions feel threatened and they feel they 
have been had. They made major concessions in the previous 
collective agreements to preserve job security, since everything 
else was in jeopardy. Now, the companies show no regard for 
that right, acquired quite recently in some cases, and they want 
to eliminate it. In some cases, this job security,  which is said to 
threaten the survival of the companies, was gained in 1992.
<P>
	Ultimately, and not just for the workers and the companies but 
for all Canadians and Quebecers, the claims made by railway 
companies should be thoroughly examined. They claim that 
competition is fierce and that they can no longer continue to 
operate under the current conditions, that something must be 
done.
<P>
	The Hope report says that this issue should have been 
discussed first. Discussions should have taken place first, with 
an arbitrator, the workers and the employers, on the survival of 
the companies and on their competitiveness, taking into 
consideration the workers' demands. In other words, the parties 
involved should have tried to agree on the information. Again, 
in the labour relations sector, whether through strike action or 
through other means, if you cannot agree to share information, 
you cannot negotiate.
<P>
	The first phase of the mediation-arbitration process, which 
commissioner Hope expected to last two months, and which 
should have included a real debate to allow the workers to make 
their complaints and claims of waste, lack of organization, and 
to provide some explanations-because they got all the 
blame-was totally skipped. Had these discussions taken place, 
the workers might have agreed that, in some cases, some action 
was required, thus paving the way for true negotiations.
<P>
	The second phase proposed in the Hope report provided 120 
days to implement, in the various mediation-arbitration 
commissions, the parameters agreed on. The legislation only 
retains the second part of the proposal made in the report. It does 
not provide any means to try to reach a consensus, as proposed in 
the first part. Certainly not, because what constitutes one of the 
most serious attacks against the unions, who must feel that the 
employers and the government are both out to get them, is 
section 12. For some reason, the minister was very proud of this 
section, but I think this is just another indication of her lack of 
experience in labour relations.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	I will read it to you. Section 12 says: ``Each Commission shall 
be guided by the need for terms and conditions of employment 
that are consistent with the economic viability and 
competitiveness of a coast-to-coast rail system in both the short 
and the long term, taking into account the importance of good 
labour-management relations''. That sounds pretty good, or 
does it? Anyone with any experience in labour relations knows 
this provision has at least two major effects. First, it does away 
with the arbitrator's customary mandate to abide by the 
jurispru-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10843"> 10843 </A></B>
<P>
dence. Basically, this paragraph is a substitute for the two 
months of research to clarify the state of the railway system.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> This is because the government is in a hurry, 
for the reasons mentioned during Question Period. It is in a 
hurry because it wants to sell CN and can only sell CN if it 
makes drastic changes in the terms and conditions of 
employment. And because the government is in a hurry, it will 
not give the process designed by Commissioner Hope a chance 
to succeed. First, it says: You as arbitrators will have to ensure 
that terms and conditions of employment are consistent with 
employability in the short and long term.
<P>
	For decades the railways have been allowed to deteriorate, 
and now in a single collective agreement, as a result of section 
12, employees will have to pay for the disorganized approach 
and irresponsibility of the companies and the government. This 
is outrageous. Those who would blame us for the impact on 
small businesses and workers who suffer as a result of this right 
to strike should realize that the real culprit is a government that 
uses the situation to deal with problems it created in the first 
place, at the expense of the workers.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> The Liberals are to blame.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> But that is not all, it is not just by stripping all 
power from the mediation-arbitration commissions in clause 12 
that the bill completely sabotages the Hope report, on the 
contrary. It is worse than that because there is a mandate and, 
instead of doing what is customary and leaving the decision to 
one arbitrator, who can exercise judgment and refer to the 
jurisprudence, we teeter on the verge of the ridiculous either by 
being totally oblivious to the Hope report's contents or by acting 
in bad faith when we say that we accept the report. That is why I 
call it the ghost of the Hope report-the two do not even 
resemble each other.
<P>
	The second objection is that everything must be settled within 
70 days. The Hope report would give 60 days to hammer out an 
agreement on the difficult basic conditions and 120 days to 
apply them. But we are saying that the whole agreement should 
be signed, sealed and delivered in 70 days, just like that! Why 
the haste? Is it because we absolutely must have negotiated 
settlements? We are creating conditions which make that 
impossible. We are creating conditions under which arbitration 
will be carried out by a commission which has no real power and 
to which the government will appoint the arbitrator.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The workers would not even be consulted on the choice of 
arbitrator. So, what other clauses of this bill are utterly 
unacceptable? Just imagine being so confident that the process 
will be encouraged and adopted-by the way, a basic condition 
for even having an arbitration commission is that both 
management and the union appoint a representative to it-that if 
the parties neglect to name a representative, the government, the 
minister will intervene in their stead and name a competent 
person.
<P>
	Words fail me to describe such a situation. And that is not all, 
that is not all. There is the issue of deadlines. I already said this, 
but I must stress that the commissioner gave 60 days plus 120, 
and he took care to stipulate that he is limiting it to six months 
because it will be easier for the parties to come to an agreement 
once they have agreed on the parameters. In the bill, 70 is the 
total maximum. This means that the government wants a 
settlement to be reached quickly, and once again I ask why? I 
will finish on this note, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Other provisions of this bill are also unacceptable. Among 
others, there is the fact, and I must stress it, that the three 
companies are not treated equally and, as a consequence, all of 
the workers are not treated equally. Why? First, let us try to find 
out. Take the first party, CN. It gets an arbitration commission, 
70 days, a clause 12 which makes no sense, and a concluding 
clause which says: ``This Part- shall come into force on the 
expiration of the twelfth hour after the time at which this Act is 
assented to''.
<P>
	What about Canadian Pacific and Via Rail? ``This part shall 
come into force by order''. This means that, at CP, where there is 
a strike and a lockout, more importantly, at this point in time, 
workers or those who obeyed the picket lines have been laid off 
temporarily, punished, and the unions are no longer having their 
dues deducted because workers crossed the picket lines. And 
there is more: no one is saying that the working conditions will 
return to normal and that the workers will be rehired. No. No one 
is saying that.
<P>
	No one said that because the company arranged to maintain 
operations. It is working at 80 per cent of its capacity. At 80 per 
cent. I will read you part of a notice I received today sent by the 
company to its customers. It thanks them considerably for their 
patience and understanding. It goes on to say that 12,888 railway 
workers are working non stop. These railway workers include 
some 2,888 managers, supervisors and other, non-unionized 
employees, who were given special training to replace striking 
workers.
<P>
	Canada has no anti-strikebreaking legislation. This means 
that Canadian Pacific, which took steps and is operating at 
between 60 per cent and 80 per cent capacity-there is no 
agreement on the exact figure-is not subject to such 
legislation. There are examples of this in history. In 1987, in a 
similar situation, 400 workers who had been locked out and were 
therefore subject to a similar provision, waited four months 
without being called back to work. This means that the workers 
who were on strike were called back within 12 or 15 hours, and 
those who had been locked out were not called back for four or 
five months, since the company could operate. I have 
confirmation of this here from the unions concerned. This 
means that, when we say, by order, we let the company carry on.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10844"> 10844 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	As for VIA Rail, the minister says they are close to 
agreement. No, before looking at VIA Rail, I have other news on 
Canadian Pacific. Just a few small items.
<P>
	In 1991 or 1992, when the company closed the Angus shops, 
there was a serious problem, workers were in danger of losing 
their jobs. So, in order to shut down the Angus shops, the 
company promised, in a memorandum that was not part of the 
collective agreement, but that seemed to be ongoing in 
application, because otherwise it would have been meaningless, 
that the workers would indeed be paid but that they would 
remain in Montreal.
<P>
	Now, the Canadian auto workers who are negotiating with 
Canadian Pacific have been told-and I have confirmed this 
with the company-that if they do not agree to the 250 workers 
in question being moved to Calgary, first, that these workers 
will lose their job security, and second, that the company will 
not sign any agreement with the other workers. The workers in 
the rest of Canada are being pitted against the workers in 
Montreal. They want to find a solution to the dispute, but they 
say they want to restore order in the rail system, and we see what 
the conditions are.
<P>
	And finally, VIA Rail. The minister said that everything was 
fine at VIA Rail, that the negotiations were continuing. The 
union leaders tell me that there is no more negotiation going on 
here than anywhere else. They tell me that their biggest worry is 
that this would be done by order in council, because everyone 
knows that for reasons that are historic and that are explained in 
the Hope report, the passenger rail system is operating at a 
deficit, and that in reality when VIA Rail is not operating, it is 
losing less money than usual.
<P>
	So, on the one hand, the government is saying: ``This is 
terrible, we cannot provide service to passengers''. But, on the 
other hand, it does not ensure that the legislation makes it 
possible to take action when something terrible happens.
<P>
	All we hear is: ``This is terrible, simply terrible! We must 
bring in legislation''. But those who are supposed to make the 
terrible situation go away are not covered.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Incredible.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Terrible.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> It is terrible. But that is not all. This is not a 
simple matter, either, because some of VIA Rail's striking 
workers belong to the same local as some CN union members. 
Therefore, if CN resumes operations but not VIA Rail, VIA Rail 
workers on the same seniority list as their CN colleagues will do 
what union members do in similar circumstances, that is, engage 
in picketing. Just think about the consequences.
<P>
	I can therefore strongly emphasize, once again, that the 
government has used with malicious intent the dramatic 
situation that some people are going through. A strike is never a 
pleasant experience. It is not pleasant for the strikers, who are at 
the end of their rope, nor for those who must suffer the 
consequences.
<P>
	Instead of seeking permanent solutions-even if we take 
more time, as the Bloc Quebecois recommends-, the 
government is using the situation to resolve its own problems, 
which Commissioner Hope refers to as ``its partisan problems''.
<P>
	If we, in the Bloc Quebecois, dared to stand up at the risk of 
being unpopular, it is because we have a high opinion of what 
politics is, of what a country is, and even of what Canada is, as 
long as we are part of it.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
believe it was Yogi Berra who said, and if it was not Yogi I am 
sure he will not mind if I attribute it to him, it seems like déja vu 
all over again.
<P>
	Last week it was back to work legislation for the port of 
Vancouver and this week it is for most of the railways. I suggest 
the time has long past for the government to get serious about 
labour issues and come up with a long term solution that does 
not rest on the usual crisis management approach of back to 
work legislation.
<P>
	We can draw some comfort from the fact that Bill C-77 does 
contain a guiding principle which allows the commissioners to 
look at long term solutions. I am pleased to see that clause in the 
bill. However, since they have 70 days to file a report, I hope 
their suggestions are acted upon faster than those contained in 
the Fraleigh report, the Hope report, or even the long delayed 
and never seen Fraser study.
<P>
	Perhaps I am beginning to sound like a broken record. I have 
said it so often in this House, and I think it bears repeating. I 
want to impress upon this government that we have to look to the 
future and find better ways to deal with work disruptions.
<P>
	I want the House to know that the Reform Party is concerned 
and that is why my colleague, the member for Lethbridge 
introduced Bill C-262. That bill was specific in that it would 
have applied to the grain industry but the principle of final offer 
arbitration is one that can be applied in any labour dispute.
<P>
	When the bill came up for a vote on Monday, we discovered 
that the government has made an new ally with the Bloc and 
even the NDP, the very people who are responsible for holding 
up speedy passage of this bill, and as a result shot down Bill 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10845"> 10845 </A></B>
<P>
C-262. I was disappointed by the coalition that was formed 
against that very sensible bill.
<P>
	As is evidenced in Bill C-77, the government is putting its 
agenda first and perhaps labour issues second. The difference in 
the coming into force provision of CN, CP and VIA Rail, 
perhaps indicates that the government is more concerned with 
protecting the government's interest in CN than helping 
Canadian shippers, manufacturers, farmers and workers. The 
cost to the economy is maybe secondary. Securing a positive 
atmosphere for the sale of CN might be the primary goal here.
<P>
	Does it not matter as much that VIA is losing $1 million a day 
or that passengers are inconvenienced? Does it not matter that 
the transportation of goods in this country is paralyzed? Does it 
not matter that our international trade reputation is in jeopardy, 
suffering another blow that perhaps we cannot recover from this 
time?
<P>
	As we speak, container vessels are steaming out of Canadian 
ports and off to U.S. ports. The whole time the Bloc and the NDP 
are stalling, ports throughout Canada including Quebec are 
losing port fees and pilotage charges. The American 
longshoremen have been collecting the wages that Canadians 
are missing.
<P>
	The trucking companies are missing out on business that 
helps them and their workers to survive, to pay their bills and to 
feed their families. Our balance of payments with our free trade 
partner are tipping further in favour of the U.S.
<P>
	Now let us look a little closer at the real impact of this work 
stoppage. On the east coast the port of Halifax estimates that it 
has lost $1.25 million so far in this strike alone. Eight ships have 
already left for New York. We all know that the economy of 
eastern Canada just does not need nor can it sustain this kind of 
setback.
<P>
	On the west coast the port of Vancouver was just recovering 
and getting back on stride after back to work legislation when 
this disruption came along. Now the port of Vancouver is 
effectively grinding to a halt again. At the moment 22 ships are 
at berth in the port of Vancouver, four of which are grain vessels 
waiting for loads of grain. Ten more are at anchor, three of which 
are grain carriers. British Columbia coal miners are anxious to 
see their four coal carriers now at dockside loaded so that mines 
can keep operating and miners can keep working.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	The strike has tremendous spinoff and domino effects. It is 
not only the people on strike who are suffering or all the 
industries that depend on that form of transportation. The potash 
industry will soon slow down if the two ships waiting at anchor 
cannot load their cargoes.
<P>
	Why is it that we still cannot get unanimous support to 
provide speedy passage of the bill? Of course it is inevitable. It 
is just delaying the inevitable to hold up the bill.
<P>
	Vancouver's loss is Seattle's gain. Halifax's loss is New 
York's gain. Job losses are the order of the day in manufacturing. 
If car manufacturers cannot get their parts they have to lay off 
workers. If they are not supplying cars, dealers do not have cars 
to sell and have perhaps been laying off people in their 
dealerships.
<P>
	Farmers are extremely vulnerable to the whims of the 
transportation system. The only option they have is to hope the 
situation will be alleviated before it gets worse and worse. 
About all they can do at the moment is hope and sit back and 
watch their hard-won international contracts go down the drain, 
contracts that may be impossible to get back. After all, why 
would a buyer renegotiate a contract with a Canadian who could 
not guarantee the product will be delivered for the promised 
date? Buyers will go elsewhere, all because the government was 
slow to react and because the Bloc and the NDP did not care 
about the average Canadian worker.
<P>
	We were asking for the legislation a week ago. If it had been 
introduced a week ago we would be further down the path to 
having it passed and assented to than we are at this point.
<P>
	It is inevitable. I understand my colleagues in the opposition 
making a political statement. I suspect the statement has been 
made now. The real loser is the Canadian worker who gets laid 
off from his job simply because the system is backed up.
<P>
	We are putting the government on notice that the Reform 
Party will be watching to make sure it has the best interests of 
Canadians in mind and that it is not just out to protect and fortify 
the sale of CN.
<P>
	We want to know what criteria the minister will apply to her 
ministerial order to put CP and VIA workers back to work. Will 
she put them back to work when she thinks the levels of services 
have dwindled, or will she listen to the people who actually use 
the services such as the shippers and the Canadian Wheat 
Board? Will she be listening to those people? We will be 
watching to see that she does.
<P>
	We expect she will take into account the impact continued 
stoppage will have on the wheat board, car manufacturers, small 
business people, grain producers, coal miners, lumber producers 
and kids who will not get a new pair of shoes because their 
parents have been laid off from their jobs. Many people are 
having a very difficult time with their payments. Even a week 
off work can be catastrophic to them.

<P>
	As a Montrealer I am sure the minister can appreciate the 
problems faced by travellers and workers who are having 
difficulty getting themselves and their goods in and out of that 
city. When Toronto commuters are inconvenienced or late for 
work, their business, productivity and families are affected.
<P>
	We are prepared to give the minister the benefit of the doubt. 
We are prepared to believe the minister will do the right thing, 
that she will order CP and VIA back to work before there are any 
devastating disruptions if there have not already been some.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party intends to support the bill. I suggest the 
other parties in the House have made their political statement 
and have made their political point. Now we should all get 
behind the bill and do what is right for Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a Canadian I am disappointed that the Bloc 
Quebecois and the NDP have not seen fit to support the 
legislation. Perhaps they do not realize the economic impact of 
their stalling from coast to coast to coast. It is affecting the daily 
lives of Canadians. The economic condition of the country is 
deteriorating mainly because a party interested solely in the 
separation of Quebec is not acting appropriately. It is important 
to note that in this process.
<P>
	I will give some examples of the economic impacts Canadians 
have experienced in various sectors of the economy. The 
shutdown of CN paralyses approximately 60 per cent of the 
country's freight traffic. The country's freight traffic capacity is 
further reduced by the disruption at CP Rail, where services are 
maintained with workers not on strike and 2,000 managers and 
staffers at approximately 60 per cent of normal capacity.
<P>
	General Motors and Ford Canada employ some 21,000 
workers in the greater Toronto area. Two Ford plants have been 
closed, putting 3,000 employees out of work. Others are 
operating at half capacity due to a shortage of parts for their 
production lines. Further layoffs are likely if the strike 
continues.
<P>
	It takes approximately five trucks to replace one freight car. 
Ford Canada indicates that there are not enough trucks available 
to replace the shortfall in railway services.
<P>
	The core manufacturing sector is being affected to the tune of 
$200 million to $500 million in economic losses per week. A 
spokesman with the Canadian Manufacturers Association 
estimates production losses to the economy if the strike 
continues to the tune of $3 billion to $5 billion.
<P>
	Numerous companies that rely on rail transportation to ship 
both goods in the resources and manufacturing industries across 
Canada are suffering. The economic impacts of the rail 
shutdown are enormous.
<P>
	I mentioned the major auto manufacturing locations in 
Ontario. Some of the companies affected are in the province of 
Quebec. Kruger Paper in Trois-Rivières is shutting down 
Tuesday due to the lack of wood chips coming in. There is a loss 
of $1 million a day and 500 workers are affected. Stone 
Consolidated in Port Alfred was shut down on Monday. 
Petromont in Varennes will shut down on Wednesday. Shell in 
Montreal is burning the equivalent of four tank cars of liquid gas 
daily. Port of Bécancour will shut down on Wednesday. Several 
aluminium plants are experiencing a slowdown in production: 
Alcan in Chicoutimi, ABI, Reynolds and Lauralco in Baie 
Comeau.
<P>
	This is the message that the Bloc Quebecois should be paying 
more attention to instead of playing petty politics.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 4.54 p.m., pursuant to the 
order made earlier today, in accordance with the provisions of 
Standing Order 78(2) it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings 
and put forthwith every question necessary to dispose of second 
reading stage of the bill now before the House.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>

	The House resumed from December 14 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for St. Albert has 
three minutes remaining in his time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to finish the speech I began some 
weeks ago regarding the private members' bill of the member 
for Red Deer on the motion regarding access to information. The 
remarks I made I will leave at that point. I have concluded.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a few remarks to make on this bill. It is a 
pleasure to speak in support of the motion of my colleague, the 
member for Red Deer. His motion states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the Parliament and crown agencies should 
be subject to scrutiny under the Access to Information Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is a very appropriate motion as it would make these 
agencies more accountable to Canadians. If one thing was made 
clear by the results of the last election, it was that Canadians 
demand accountability from their governments and their 
institutions. They are no longer willing to accept governments 
and institutions that help themselves to the public purse. They 
are demanding value for their money instead of governments 
and institutions that take hard earned tax dollars for granted and 
make their deals behind closed doors.
<P>
	One of the best mechanisms currently in place to give 
Canadians some control over these institutions is the Access to 
Information Act. This act lets Canadians take a look at 
government books for themselves. This is only fair. In Canada 
we pay a very high amount of tax and we have every right to 
know how the government is spending the money.
<P>
	In this respect the Access to Information Act serves as a 
useful tool to keep an eye on the appropriateness of government 
spending. All members in the House can show they support this 
right of Canadians by supporting this motion. It would be a 
gesture very much appreciated by Canadians.
<P>
	As a farmer, I would like to use the example of the Canadian 
Wheat Board in speaking in support of this motion. I was 
shocked recently when I requested information on the pension 
plans and wages for Canadian Wheat Board commissioners and 
staff. Regarding the pension plans, I asked for a breakdown on 
employer versus government contributions as well as the age at 
which the commissioners and staff are eligible to receive 
benefits. My request was denied by Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Canada on the basis that the Canadian Wheat Board does not fall 
under the terms of the Access to Information Act.
<P>
	As a grain farmer and a member of Parliament I was appalled 
that I was refused information regarding pensions which I am 
responsible for funding. I can inform the House that the level of 
secrecy under which the Canadian Wheat Board operates is 
increasingly viewed with resentment by western farmers.
<P>
	It further makes me wonder why the Canadian Wheat Board is 
so insistent on secrecy when a notice that compensation figures 
for executives and managers of Canada's major banks was 
recently released, presumably with no danger to the future 
operation of these banks.
<P>
	Financial figures are available for the upper levels of just 
about every other corporation in the country and yet the 
Canadian Wheat Board insists on keeping its financial data a 
mystery. If banks can release this information, it shoots down 
the argument that the wheat board needs secrecy to remain a 
competitive player in the marketplace.
<P>
	I wrote to the wheat board urging them to reconsider its 
policy. At that time I stressed this would go a long way in 
re-establishing the trust and confidence of other grain farmers 
in dealing with the wheat board. In turn, I was contacted by the 
wheat board. It provided me with some general salary 
information, but not in the detail I originally requested. 
Moreover, I was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10850"> 10850 </A></B>
<P>
told that the general information is only available to wheat 
board permit holders.
<P>
	This experience shows how frustrating it can be for Canadians 
if they are trying to get financial information about a 
government agency that is not covered under the Access to 
Information Act.
<P>
	I am not alone in my frustration with the wheat board. 
Recently a publication called the <I>Prairie Agricultural Digest</I> 
featured an article that asked why things at the wheat board are 
so secretive. This newspaper wondered what makes the wheat 
board so different from virtually any other privately traded or 
government corporation. The only answer they could come up 
with is that the people running the wheat board are either 
arrogant or out of touch.
<P>
	The newspaper has embarked on a campaign to make the 
wheat board more accountable. Grain farmers can fill out a card 
directed to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. The card 
states: ``I am very opposed to the secrecy of the Canadian Wheat 
Board, and the board's consistent refusal to answer questions 
regarding the salaries, pensions and other benefits the wheat 
board commissioners and other employees receive. I oppose the 
Canadian Wheat Board being exempt from the freedom of 
information act''.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Apparently these clippings have been flooding into the 
newspaper office. This sends a clear message that farmers are 
fed up with the secrecy, but it is a sad comment that they have to 
take this drastic action in order to try and get accountability 
from an agency that is supposed to serve them.
<P>
	The wheat board has advertised a position described as fitness 
instructor. How much sense does it make to have a fitness 
instructor on staff but not have an access to information officer 
that could answer questions about how the board spends its 
money.
<P>
	The issue of accountability also becomes important when we 
look at the pasta industry in the country. Pasta producers in 
western Canada came to see me around the middle of November 
claiming heavily subsidized pasta from Italy was coming into 
the country and they could not afford to operate any more.
<P>
	When I showed my facts and figures to the prairie pools, they 
had no answers. The Canadian Wheat Board sells durum wheat 
to the Americans for the pasta industry and we also sell it to 
Italy.
<P>
	The Americans bring in 40 million kilograms of pasta for a 
value of approximately $84 million. This pasta costs about $2 
per kilogram. The Italians ship 17 million kilograms of pasta at 
$19 million, which is about half the price the Americans are 
charging for their pasta in this country.
<P>
	I asked the prairie pools if they could explain how we could 
sell durum wheat to Italy, ship it over there, have it 
manufactured and brought back into this country for half the 
price. Is it not subsidized? They could not give me a reasonable 
explanation.
<P>
	It makes you wonder what is going on when you do a little 
digging and come up with some of these figures. It creates a 
stronger argument for openness and accountability at every turn.
<P>
	The Winnipeg Commodity Exchange is a totally open process. 
A public gallery allows you to actually watch the trading. That is 
the type of openness the Canadian Wheat Board should be trying 
to achieve, otherwise we are left wondering to whom it is 
accountable.
<P>
	It is not just Canadians who are upset with wheat board 
secrecy. American farmers are getting very upset with having to 
compete with this bureaucracy. It is not the Canadian farmers 
they do not want to compete with, it is the large, secret dealing 
wheat board they see as an unfair competitor.
<P>
	I am not advocating the dismantling of the wheat board, but 
this illustrates how, when when operating with a shroud of 
secrecy, people automatically suspect that you are not playing 
above the board. By dropping this shroud of secrecy the wheat 
board could avoid many of these problems.
<P>
	When the wheat board came into being, it was a dual 
marketing system. That is what farmers want again. The time 
has come for the government to give Canadians the 
accountability it promised in its red book, and put an end to the 
secret dealings of government organizations like the wheat 
board.
<P>
	The Reform Party has always stressed the need to be more 
accountable and responsible to the people who elected us. We 
have always stated clearly that the common sense of the 
common people should be respected. They have the right to be 
consulted on public policy matters. They have the right to 
govern themselves through truly representative and responsive 
institutions.
<P>
	In the Liberal government's red book it states: ``People are 
disappointed by and irritated with the poor quality of service 
provided by many public institutions, given the cost of 
government and the taxes the government are taking out of 
citizens' pockets. A Liberal government will take a series of 
initiatives to restore confidence in these institutions of 
government. Open government will be the watchword of the 
Liberal program''.
<P>
	We have been waiting for evidence of that open government, 
but so far it has been lacking. Canadians have watched in 
frustration as billions of dollars were funnelled through crown 
agencies such as the CBC, Canada Post and the wheat board, and 
they are waiting for action.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10851"> 10851 </A></B>
<P>
	The time for that action is now. This non-partisan motion can 
be supported by all members of the House because it goes 
beyond party politics and achieves a purpose that is equally 
important to Canadians from coast to coast.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to 
address the motion raised by the member for Red Deer. I 
compliment him on raising the issue of public access to 
information held by crown agencies and Parliament.
<P>
	It is obvious from the debate that has ensued from the motion, 
and indeed from the voices of Canadians across the country, that 
there is need for greater openness and accountability in 
government. I agree with the spirit and objectives of the motion 
of the member of the Reform Party. I cannot, however, lend my 
support to it because I find it is lacking the comprehensiveness 
needed to achieve appropriate improvements.
<P>
	In keeping with our commitment to make government more 
accountable, open and honest while at the same time controlling 
costs, the justice minister fully intends to consult with 
Canadians to develop more comprehensive and up to date access 
to information legislation.
<P>
	My constituents in Etobicoke-Lakeshore along with other 
Canadians are calling for updated and forward thinking 
legislation. It must involve a careful examination of the 
complete framework of the Access to Information Act, with 
careful consideration being given to each institution. By 
expanding the coverage of the Access to Information Act to 
Parliament and crown agencies, as the member has suggested, 
all practical implications must be taken into account.
<P>
	In our efforts to control the deficit and achieve economic 
recovery the government has had to modernize programs, 
making them more effective and cost efficient. The values of 
openness must be balanced with fiscal responsibilities. I believe 
it is the government's role to assist Canadians in the evolution 
that is currently taking place across Canada and around the 
world. That is why the government is looking at ways to enhance 
public access to information.
<P>
	With the explosion of new technology and the evolution of 
government policies greater openness and transparency are 
needed to ensure that government structures and programs are 
geared to the highest priorities of Canadians. The Liberal 
government's policy defined in the red book is to promote more 
open and accountable government. Our commitment to it is 
demonstrated in the introduction of several initiatives aimed at 
restoring government integrity. The review of agencies, boards 
and commissions, the introduction of amendments to the 
Lobbyists Registration Act, and reduced costs in the operation 
of the House of Commons are just a few of the initiatives.
<P>
	Canadians are demonstrating faith in Parliament. According 
to an international poll conducted by the <I>Times Mirror</I> in the 
U.S., Canadians ranked highest among the eight of the world's 
richest countries in confidence in their legislative institutions. 
Our Prime Minister has said that we have managed to restore the 
prestige of this institution. It is a credit to all members of 
Parliament who were elected, whatever their opinions and 
options.
<P>
	With this in mind I believe we should look beyond the motion 
and support and participate in the justice minister's upcoming 
review of the access to information legislation. The opinions of 
access experts, the information commissioner and individual 
Canadians who have an interest in the act should be taken into 
account.
<P>
	Numerous recommendations have been made since the act 
came into effect in 1982 by the two successive information 
commissioners. Its effectiveness as a supporting tool to 
democracy has been monitored and assessed over the years 
through the courts and by a parliamentary committee of the 
previous government. Most recently recommendations have 
been submitted to the information commissioner advising a 
broadening of the access law. One by one the provinces have 
been enacting their own access legislation, including Ontario.
<P>
	This too must be assessed in the modification of this very 
important legislation. In our review we must be sure to look to 
the example of other foreign democratic governments that have 
developed similar legislation.
<P>
	The people of Etobicoke-Lakeshore continually remind me 
of the importance of incorporating new technologies into more 
efficient and open government. They tell me to remind the 
justice minister that his review must be sure to take into 
consideration the advice of the information highway advisory 
council and the blueprint for improving government services 
with new technologies. This thorough review will go steps 
further than the motion does. It is the best way to ensure 
enhanced openness of government for Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	I also question the addition of other agencies to the existing 
legislation. I agree with the suggestions of my constituents that 
the government consider improvements to the existing 
legislation rather than simply adding agencies to the current 
schedule list.
<P>
	The recent report of consultants to the information 
commissioner has recommended measures such as increases to 
request fees, swifter and more open responses, a reduction in 
years for accessibility to cabinet documents, et cetera. The 
recommendations should be considered, focusing on 
government account-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10852"> 10852 </A></B>
<P>
ability rather than, as the motion proposes, expanding the 
legislation to cover more independent agencies.
<P>
	Crown agencies independent of the government should be 
subjected to scrutiny. This is provided for in other ways. In this 
area of the legislation our priority should be planning for a 
modernized access act that benefits Canada through open and 
accountable government.
<P>
	The hon. member for Red Deer stated in his motion that he 
would like to see Parliament and crown agencies subjected to 
scrutiny under the Access to Information Act. The motion would 
give a general definition to crown agencies. This open ended 
wording does not define exactly or take into consideration the 
individual circumstances of the various agencies.
<P>
	Modified access legislation should take care to carefully 
define the specific relevance of institutions to the federal 
government. We would be wise to follow the listing methods 
contained in the majority of provincial access legislation. 
Different laws apply to different institutions and the different 
laws may constitute varying applications of the law.
<P>
	The wording of the motion could also lead to increased 
litigation in an already overflowing courts system. I can easily 
foresee differing interpretations of the law being used by an 
agency in an attempt to exempt itself from the access 
legislation. This would eventually end up in the courts, further 
burdening the legal system.
<P>
	In this manner the motion would only serve to decrease the 
efficiency of an institution while increasing the cost to 
taxpayers. That is not the goal of the Liberal government.
<P>
	Before considering such broad legislation suggested by the 
Reform Party member, one must take into consideration the 
implications of the motion on Parliament. It is important to 
protect the personal information of a constituent when 
considering applying the access act to the offices of members of 
Parliament and senators. All sorts of questions arise and we 
must ensure that greater thought be given to the privacy of the 
individual taxpayer. Any legislation must therefore be precise in 
its purpose and the motion is certainly not precise.
<P>
	I believe the motion was an excellent stimulant for initial 
debate on the subject of access to information and government 
openness. The motion offered general amendments to an act that 
requires more detailed reworking. Knowing that the justice 
minister is planning a more full and comprehensive review of 
the Access to Information Act I cannot support the member's 
motion. Further, I cannot emphasize enough the value I place in 
a thorough consultative process with the Canadian people.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise today to speak on Motion M-304 
brought forth by the hon. member for Red Deer with respect to 
the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act.
<P>
	The objectives stated by the hon. member for Red Deer tend to 
be very similar to those of my own party. As a matter of fact, in 
our view of democracy, it is very important that public financial 
management be characterized by transparency and openness.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	All the hon. members of this House were elected by people 
who want and have a right to know how their money is managed, 
this money we take off their pay cheques every week for taxes of 
all kinds. The people of Quebec in particular want to know what 
the Canadian government is doing with their money and what 
they get back in return.
<P>
	The Access to Information Act is one of the tools available to 
them and I think it should be amended to apply also to crown 
corporations such as Air Canada and Canada Post Corporation, 
government agencies such as the Senate as well as public office 
holders who report directly to Parliament, like the 
Commissioner of Official Languages and the Auditor General of 
Canada.
<P>
	As I said, the Bloc Quebecois firmly believes that public 
administration should be as transparent as can be in a 
democratic regime. But this is not always the case here. Too 
many government institutions are still not subject to the Access 
to Information Act and I think that it is high time that the scope 
of this act be broadened to force these institutions to operate in a 
more upright and honest way.
<P>
	The government continues to hide far too much information 
that could be useful to the public. Take the Senate for example. 
Partisan appointments to some of the best paid positions in the 
government are made by the party in office. The public has no 
say in the process, nor does it have access to the information 
circulating within the ranks of the government. That, in my 
opinion, is not very transparent.
<P>
	Yet, transparency is essential to regain the confidence of 
taxpayers who are increasingly wondering about the way their 
money is spent, considering the national debt and the numerous 
cuts to social programs and other government services.
<P>
	In his Throne Speech made in January of last year, the Prime 
Minister said, and I quote: ``The Government is committed to 
enhancing the credibility of Parliament. Changes will be 
proposed to the rules of the House of Commons to provide 
Members of Parliament a greater opportunity to contribute to 
the development of public policy and legislation''. The Prime 
Minister also 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10853"> 10853 </A></B>
<P>
said that, to achieve this agenda, integrity and public trust in the 
institutions of government were essential.
<P>
	It goes without saying that a relation of trust between the 
government and the public is vital. However, we realize that no 
such relation exists when we see the resentment shown by 
Canadians toward the federal government.
<P>
	This is an opportunity for the Prime Minister to give weight to 
his words by taking concrete legislative measures to ensure 
greater transparency within the public institutions and agencies.
<P>
	Of course, the Access to Information Act plays an important 
role in providing information to which the public is entitled. 
However, we must not forget that certain types of information 
must remain confidential so as not to prejudice the competitive 
position of certain Crown corporations.
<P>
	The relevant legislation, the Privacy Act, is particularly 
important because it has the effect of protecting information, the 
disclosure of which might be injurious to national security. That 
is why this confidentiality has been recognized by means of 
exemptions provided under the Act. It also protects the interests 
of individuals, both with respect to personal information and 
information of a commercial nature. However, it is probably 
true that the corporations and institutions exempted from this 
legislation are not necessarily motivated by concern that 
information might be disclosed to competitors but may be 
simply reluctant to reveal to the public certain threatening 
aspects of their activities.
<P>
	In any case, the complexities of a system for access to 
information on government administration are well beyond the 
scope of the motion presented by the hon. member for Red Deer. 
Here the concern is not, as it says in the motion, to require that 
Parliament and crown agencies be subject to scrutiny under the 
Access to Information Act. As we have seen, there are two sides 
to this issue: providing access to information while reinforcing 
measures to protect privacy.
<P>
	That is why the Bloc Quebecois, in the name of our 
democratic principles and in its resolve to increase the 
transparency of the present system, agrees with the report of the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Solicitor General released in 
March 1987, which recommended that the Access to 
Information Act should apply to all federal institutions, 
including administrative tribunals and the Senate.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois insists above all on the importance of full 
transparency, especially with regard to the Senate. As I said 
earlier in this House, people are entitled to have access to 
information issued by this non-elected level of government.
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians are dissatisfied with the present 
government, which keeps important information from them and 
which ignores them by not taking their views into consideration 
and dealing with important public matters in secret.
<P>
	They are unhappy with the treatment they receive from 
federal institutions, public servants, politicians and the 
government machine. This is why the Bloc Quebecois agrees 
with the essence of Motion M-304 and believes the Access of 
Information Act should apply to all publicly funded government 
institutions. It is time to get on with it and implement real and 
effective access to information legislation that will reflect our 
concern for true and just democracy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for Red 
Deer for putting this motion forward.
<P>
	At a time when Canadians are losing trust in their political 
institutions, all of us must be active in finding ways to promote 
more open and accountable government. However, in searching 
out these various ways to promote more open and accountable 
government, we must recognize that our institutions face a 
variety of other challenges equally important to Canadians.
<P>
	People in my riding of York-Simcoe and Canadians from 
across the country want government to cost less, to be more 
efficient and to operate in a more businesslike manner. In some 
cases, it may be necessary to balance the value of openness with 
these other values. Although I find the objectives behind the 
motion laudable, I cannot support this motion for three reasons.
<P>
	First, we must be concerned about the impact the motion will 
have on the competitive position of crown corporations. I do not 
say the impact is great or small, merely that before adopting this 
motion I would want to hear directly from those crown 
corporations on this issue.
<P>
	Second, in these times of fiscal restraint we must stop and ask 
what this motion will cost the taxpayers and how those costs will 
be paid. Processing access requests requires an access to 
information bureaucracy and costs money.
<P>
	The third reason I cannot support the motion is that it fails to 
distinguish between different kinds of crown agencies and 
different institutions of Parliament. The motion is too broadly 
worded. As such, it disagrees with the findings of the 1986 
parliamentary committee report ``Open and Shut'' and with the 
most recent report of the information commissioner.
<P>
	Returning to my first reason for opposing the motion, I am not 
convinced it has struck the proper balance between the compet-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10854"> 10854 </A></B>
<P>
ing values of open and accountable government on the one hand 
and the smaller, more efficient government on the other hand.
<P>
	The motion asks that crown agencies be subject to the scrutiny 
of the Access to Information Act. There are presently more than 
130 crown agencies subject to the act. I assume the hon. member 
means by crown agencies, those crown agencies not yet subject 
to the act. I assume he is referring at least in part to crown 
corporations.
<P>
	It is with respect to crown corporations that the balance 
between efficient, competitive businesslike crown agencies and 
open accountable enterprise becomes most important. The basic 
question is whether crown corporations which have mandates to 
operate in a businesslike fashion, sometimes in competition 
with the private sector, should have to work under different rules 
than their competitors.
<P>
	If we believe that crown corporations should act like 
businesses then why would we impose a different set of rules on 
them? Of course, if we believe crown corporations should not be 
competing with the private sector at all, that is a completely 
different question. Subjecting the crown corporations to the 
scrutiny of the Access to Information Act will not terminate the 
crown corporations, if that is the goal. It will simply make them 
less competitive, more expensive and less efficient.
<P>
	I would not want to make a decision on the motion before the 
House until I know more about the implications. I am not 
prepared to support the motion at this time.
<P>
	Also, I do not support this motion because we do not have 
enough information about what the potential costs to the 
taxpayers will be. Processing access requests costs taxpayers 
money. The most recent report of the information commissioner 
says that the annual costs of processing access requests is $20 
million and that the current fees are not designed to recover 
costs but merely to deter trivial requests.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	Adding institutions to be covered by the Access to 
Information Act is saying that the government needs to spend 
more money. Where will this money come from? How much will 
it cost? Whatever it costs, we know it is a cost that private 
business does not have to incur. Therefore it will make crown 
corporations less competitive, at least to the extent of the cost of 
processing access requests.
<P>
	I do not say that the costs of processing access requests cannot 
be justified. The information commissioner says that the $20 
million is a bargain for such an essential tool of public 
accountability and I think he is right. We should not adopt 
motions based on good intentions without first asking the basic 
questions of how much it will cost and who will pay.
<P>
	As well, I am reluctant to support the motion is because of the 
report of the parliamentary committee that examined the Access 
to Information Act in 1986. Its report is called ``Open and 
Shut''. That committee considered a broad range of entities 
which might be made subject to the Access to Information Act.
<P>
	The committee concluded it would not be appropriate for all 
crown agencies to be made subject to the act. It thought a 
definition of crown corporations should be developed and 
should be limited to corporations where the crown has a 
controlling interest and which provides goods or services to the 
public on a commercial basis.
<P>
	The committee thought there should be special exemptions 
for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in relation to 
program material.
<P>
	With respect to Parliament, the parliamentary committee was 
of the view that the offices of senators and members of the 
House of Commons should be excluded from the scrutiny of the 
act. It said that the relationship between such elected and 
appointed officials and the electorate is sometimes described as 
akin to solicitor-client privilege. Parliamentary privilege is 
involved and therefore the committee suggested their continued 
exclusion from the scope of the act.
<P>
	The committee thought that the Access to Information Act 
should not apply to the judicial branch of government and 
therefore not to the Federal Court, the Tax Court or the Supreme 
Court of Canada. Perhaps surprisingly, the committee thought 
the act should apply to administrative tribunals which perform 
quasi-judicial functions.
<P>
	The committee recognized that the federal government is 
involved in joint ventures with others, notably the provinces. In 
those cases it thought it would be best if there were negotiations 
with the provinces before making such joint ventures subject to 
the Access to Information Act.
<P>
	Here we have a parliamentary committee that studied the 
issues very carefully. The committee's considered conclusion 
was that it would go too far to include all crown agencies. At 
least in the case of the CBC, it saw merit in examining the 
special circumstances of crown corporations that would become 
subject to the act. It saw merit in excluding courts, MPs' offices 
and federal-provincial joint organizations.
<P>
	I am not prepared to say that the parliamentary committee was 
wrong in making these judgments. I think it goes too far to say in 
a sweeping statement that Parliament and all crown agencies 
should be subject to the Access to Information Act.
<P>
	I support a comprehensive careful review of the Access to 
Information Act. I will support amendments aimed at improving 
access to government information. I may well support extending 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10855"> 10855 </A></B>
<P>
the application of the Access to Information Act to crown 
agencies not yet covered by the act.
<P>
	However, I cannot support a motion that fails to distinguish 
between various kinds of crown agencies that might make the 
correspondence I receive from my constituents automatically 
subject to the act and that is voted on without hearing from 
executives of the crown agencies not presently subject to the act.
<P>
	The better approach is to take the Minister of Justice at his 
word that it is time for a review of the Access to Information 
Act. Let him draw upon all the expertise we can acquire and use 
the full parliamentary procedures, including committee 
hearings, to produce the best set of amendments possible.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to take part in this very important debate on 
Motion No. 304. This is a motion which I believe everyone in the 
House should support. What better way to show Canadians that 
we got the message the people sent a little more than a year ago?
<P>
	If we can ever say that when Canadians go to the polls they 
speak with one voice, it was in the results of the 1993 election. 
The electorate wanted fundamental changes to the way politics 
are conducted in this country. Canadians took great pains to 
ensure that a message was sent throughout the political world.
<P>
	If politicians ever thought they were above the people or in 
some cases above the law, that election proved to be a great 
leveller. Now that we are here, it is important we do not breach 
the trust which was placed in us.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	Parliament is subject to the charter of rights and freedoms. 
How can Parliament and the crown agencies establishes and is a 
shareholder in not be subject to the Access to Information Act? 
A committee in the last Parliament studying the Access to 
Information Act likened it to the charter as one of the 
fundamental tenets of our society. Therefore it seems to me that 
if we are bound by one we should be bound by the other.
<P>
	I know the Access to Information Act is used by opposition 
MPs and the press to dig up as much dirt as they can in order to 
embarrass the government during question period. The concern 
on the government side must be that if the access net is cast even 
further, that it will simply involve more work being put into 
question period presentations. The potential for embarrassment 
will simply be enlarged. That could happen.
<P>
	Is the answer not simply to ensure there is no potential for 
embarrassing matters to be brought to light under the access 
procedure by assuring that crown corporations are run in a sound 
and efficient manner? The answer is not to limit the application 
of the Access to Information Act but to ensure MPs and crown 
corporations act in a responsible manner with taxpayers'dollars.
<P>
	We are here to exercise a trust. That trust has been placed in us 
by the people of Canada. We are to be good stewards of the 
taxpayers' dollars. The money collected by Revenue Canada is 
not our money to do with as we please; it belongs to the people of 
Canada. If we keep this in mind every time we do something on 
this hill or in our constituency offices, then we have nothing to 
fear from the Access to Information Act. We have everything to 
gain.
<P>
	Suppose that tomorrow we all became subject to the act, then 
weeks go by without any stories in the press about 
mismanagement of public moneys or about trips being taken 
which could not be justified. Think about how that would raise 
the opinion of the electorate in this group it elected in 1993.
<P>
	Surely the same reasoning applies to crown corporations. 
With them not subject to the act, there is a perception that 
something is going on behind closed doors. All of us have been 
here long enough now to have participated in in camera 
meetings of committees. The perception is that once the doors 
are closed and the sound recording is turned off, real and 
momentous decisions are made which affect the life of this 
country.
<P>
	Those of us who have participated in those in camera 
meetings know that nothing is further from the truth. However, 
the perception is that we should open up the process; open up the 
process for both parliamentarians and crown corporations. 
Between us and the crown corporations billions of dollars of 
taxpayers' money are spent, presumably for the good of the 
country. If this is the case, then the public has a right to know. If 
it is not the case, then surely letting the public know becomes a 
first step along the road to cleaning up waste and 
mismanagement.
<P>
	The rule of law is the foundation upon which our system of 
government is built. It was established hundreds of years ago in 
Great Britain during the reign of the Stuart kings that no one, not 
even the crown, is above the law. This is the cornerstone of the 
rule of law. We are all equal under the law and no one is above 
the law. We are equal in that the law applies to every one of us in 
the same way. Be we rich or poor, white or black, it applies 
equally.
<P>
	Again, no one is above the law. No matter how high you have 
scaled the corporate ladder, no matter which political office you 
occupy either federally or municipally, when you look up, the 
law of the country is still above you.
<P>
	If these beliefs are true, and we all know they are, then how 
can we work here knowing that a law which is designed to open 
certain parts of government to public scrutiny does not apply to 
us and to the crown corporations? I do not believe we can justify 
this situation. We must act to ensure that laws such as the Access 
to Information Act apply equally to all, including politicians.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	This will send an important message back to the electorate. It 
will show that we have learned from the mistakes of the past. We 
have learned to listen to the people of Canada and act upon what 
we have heard.
<P>
	We have a message and the message is loud and clear: We are 
to be frugal stewards with taxpayers' money. We are not to 
receive anything more in the way of benefits than the ordinary 
taxpayer. And we are not ever to assume that we are above the 
law.
<P>
	Parliament must act and let the sun shine in. It must act in a 
positive way to tell Canadians it has nothing to hide. We have 
been good in this Parliament in this regard. We have opened up 
to scrutiny the meetings of the Board of Internal Economy which 
would have been unthinkable in years gone by. It is important 
that we send out the message that we are open to scrutiny 
ourselves. If we have nothing to hide then why put up barriers? 
If there is something to hide then we and the crown corporations 
are not acting in the best interest of the taxpayers. This deserves 
to be exposed.
<P>
	I urge all members from all parties to support the motion. The 
end result will be a strong message sent to the government to 
amend the Access to Information Act. It will then be up to the 
government to show that it still stands behind the promise of 
openness it made in the last election.
<P>
	I seem to remember the Liberals promised openness and fair 
play in that red book they keep talking about. They promised 
openness and fair play to the Canadian people. Passage today of 
motion 304 will help to do this.
<P>
	We on this side of the House will be waiting and watching. 
The people of Canada will be waiting and watching. If the 
government does not act on this matter we can rest assured the 
people of Canada will act at the next election and elect a group 
that will let the sun shine in on Parliament and its workings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is truly a 
pleasure to stand today to close the debate on M-304, a motion 
to extend access to information to Parliament and crown 
corporations.
<P>
	This will demonstrate the openness of Parliament and the 
accountability and transparency of government. I have been 
very impressed with the quality of the speeches and how many 
people have spoken positively about the motion.
<P>
	Basically four concerns have been raised which I would like 
to address very quickly. The first concern is that members' 
private business and budgets would come up for more detailed 
scrutiny. Mr. John Grace, the access to information 
commissioner, assures me there are protections within the 
present act so that would not be threatened.
<P>
	The second concern is that there will be changes to the Access 
to Information Act and that it is on the justice minister's 
timetable. The justice minister is extremely busy right now and I 
would question how soon access to information would come up.
<P>
	The third concern which has been raised is that the motion did 
not have enough detail in it. That concern was addressed 
probably better in the last Parliament when a number of Liberal 
members said that we did not need to have all that detail. 
Besides, this is a motion and the details can be added.
<P>
	The fourth concern mentioned was that the competitiveness of 
crown corporations would be affected. I would like to read this 
from the access commissioner to assure members that it would 
not be the case. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is my view that the existing exemption provisions provide the necessary 
protection for sensitive information in the hands of crown corporations. Sections 
18 and 21 provide ample opportunity for crown corporations to provide valuable 
information as well as corporate strategies and plans.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Therefore I do not believe that is a concern.
<P>
	Because those things are not a concern and because this is a 
non-partisan issue, I strongly ask that all members consider 
voting yes for M-304.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BASECLOSURES">BASE CLOSURES</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I should 
like to take this opportunity to pursue a question that I asked of 
the minister responsible for ACOA last week.
<P>
	I asked him if he would explain to the House why he cut 
millions of dollars from a national defence program set up to 
help Atlantic Canadian communities hurt by base closures.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10858"> 10858 </A></B>
<P>
	The Department of National Defence transferred the $30 
million program to ACOA because the regional agency is 
believed to be in the best position to deliver such programs in 
Atlantic Canada. The ACOA minister has turned around and 
slashed $10 million from the program.
<P>
	When I asked the minister to explain the cuts, the 
parliamentary secretary to the ACOA minister said that the 
government would take my concerns under advisement.
<P>
	That is not a good enough answer for the people's whose lives 
will be affected by the minister's actions. Maybe the reason the 
minister cannot offer an explanation is that he knows there is no 
way to justify what he has done. He is playing with people's 
livelihood. Even members of his party are appalled by his antics. 
The hon. members for Dartmouth and Moncton, just to name a 
couple, are on the record in their opposition to the ACOA 
minister's actions.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence has said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The $30 million is for base closure. The $30 million was given by defence to 
ACOA for base mitigation. Thirty million will be spent for base mitigation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The money was given to ACOA in trust to help people hurt by 
the base closures imposed by the government. It was supposed 
to help hard hit towns and cities attract industry to replace lost 
armed forces jobs and military spending, which is known as 
permanent infrastructure in the communities.
<P>
	The Prime Minister made a commitment to help these 
communities. It is not ACOA's money to take away, even if the 
finance minister has asked ACOA to make cuts to its own 
budget.
<P>
	In fact an editorial in an Atlantic Canadian paper put the 
minister's actions in very clear light. It said: ``If your father 
gave you $30 for your brother, you would have no right to keep 
$10 for yourself because your father also asked you to cut back 
on your own spending''.
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	The same is true of ACOA and the minister responsible for 
ACOA. ACOA was asked to do a task and does not have the right 
to redefine the terms of that task after the fact. However, it 
seems the minister believes he does not need to answer to 
anyone, at least not to the people who will suffer at his hands.
<P>
	The minister has cut the ACOA board, which is supposed to 
represent all of Atlantic Canada, and has put the focus of the 
board in his own riding of Cape Breton-East Richmond, known 
as the Cape Breton Enterprise Board. According to reports, he 
has handed out over 183 projects to his riding, totalling at least 
$15 million last year. He did that before he announced a change 
to the ACOA funding to allow for repayable loans.
<P>
	The minister has refused to tell the Saint John <I>Telegraph 
Journal</I> the findings of a 1992 company by  company job survey 
for ACOA, even though the federal information commissioner 
ruled in the paper's favour. Perhaps the minister believes that 
taxpayers do not have a right to information paid for with their 
dollars.
<P>
	I placed a question on the Order Paper about the financial 
assistance provided to each federal riding and Atlantic Canada 
by ACOA on October 4, 1994. That was 172 days ago and I have 
yet to receive an answer.
<P>
	Does the minister responsible for ACOA believe he should be 
accountable to anyone? Does he believe he should be 
accountable to Canadian voters who are also taxpayers? If he 
does believe this, then he would not only explain to Atlantic 
Canadians why he cut $10 million from a fund designed to help 
communities hurt by base closures, but he would also tell them 
how he plans to rectify the situation.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this has 
been a tough time and a tough budget. After 10 years of 
Conservative economic and fiscal management, or perhaps I 
should say mismanagement, these measures were long overdue.
<P>
	It was a fair budget. ACOA's continued existence is a 
testament to this government's commitment. The bottom line 
nevertheless is that ACOA was cut. Of the overall $562 million 
cut to regional development, ACOA was asked to absorb over 30 
per cent of that, or $173.5 million over the next three years.
<P>
	Consistent with the overall reduction, the base closure 
adjustment fund was reduced by $10 million, or 30 per cent. It is 
completely incorrect to refer to the base closure adjustment 
program as a trust fund. The base closure adjustment program is 
administered by ACOA and was thus included in the budgetary 
review process.
<P>
	Let us remember that after reductions there still will be $20 
million available to address adjustment measures in the affected 
communities. ACOA will take a leadership role in working with 
the communities affected by base closures and by these tough 
but fair budget measures. ACOA will strive to maximize 
benefits with the remaining $20 million. It will ensure that every 
effort is made to apply its full array of other program 
instruments to address economic development programs in 
these communities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38(5), the 
motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted.
<P>
	Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
