<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food)</B> 
moved that Bill C-26, an act to amend the Canada Grain Act and 
the Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties 
Act and to repeal the Grain Futures Act, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to introduce at second reading Bill C-26 which would amend the 
Canada Grain Act and the Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative 
Monetary Penalties Act and repeal the Grain Futures Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative reflects our government's willingness to meet 
the express needs of the grain industry.  The industry has had to 
evolve in order to deal with many challenges.  Legislation must 
also evolve to ensure that industry's efforts to meet these 
challenges are not hindered by arcane government regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by placing this bill within the framework of our 
government's priorities.  Agriculture and agri-food is a key 
sector of our economy that offers tremendous opportunities for 
Canadian producers and processors.  This industry is growing at 
an impressive rate.  Our exports continue to expand, as does the 
domestic market for our products.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Producers are generally optimistic about the future, investing 
in and diversifying their operations in order to benefit from new 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main objective of this government is to build a competitive 
and innovative economy that will create even more jobs and more 
economic growth for Canadians.  One of the ways to accomplish 
this objective is to work co-operatively at the grassroots level 
to ensure the views of stakeholders are incorporated at the early 
stages of discussions on policies surrounding new and emerging 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are committed to a policy of full consultation with both the 
agri-food industry and the provinces.  We endeavour to be 
responsive to the changing needs of the industry.  Together we 
are working to develop strategies for achieving this goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is particularly significant in light of our recently 
announced rural impact test, a policy which commits federal 
departments and agencies to consider the impact on rural Canada 
when formulating their policies, their programs and their 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This policy is part of our government's ongoing commitment to 
build stronger rural communities by ensuring that federal 
policies and programs support community development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the bill before the House is another example of 
our commitment to rural Canada.  It will allow easier access to 
the special crops processing industry and will therefore have a 
positive impact on rural employment opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal and provincial governments must also work together 
to avoid, wherever possible, overlap and duplication so that we 
can better serve Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having placed this bill in the context of the government's 
priorities, I would now like to review the major aspects of this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions of this bill were developed and recommended by 
the Canadian Grain Commission, the organization responsible for 
administering both the Canadian Grain Act and the Grain Futures 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Canada Grain Act the commission is responsible for 
regulating grain handling in Canada and for establishing and 
maintaining standards of grain quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Grain Futures Act the commission regulates grain 
futures trading in Canada by monitoring the activities and 
transactions carried out at the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the valuable 
contribution that producers and other members of the grain 
industry have made to this bill.  These amendments are the result 
of two separate sets of consultations throughout the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will outline this consultation process so that members can 
share the confidence I have that this legislation represents the 
needs, the expectations and the views of the majority of 
stakeholders from all sectors of the grain industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 Bill C-51, an act to amend the Canada Grain Act, was 
being moved through this House.  At that time there was 
considerable interest on the part of members to deal with the 
concerns of the special crops industry, especially those in the 
industry who wanted to become licensed special crops dealers. 
Therefore, it is with great pleasure that I talk to this bill 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grain industry categorizes crops either as standard crops or 
as special crops.  The standard crops are wheat, barley, oats and 
canola and these make up the bulk of agricultural production on 
the prairies.  Special crops production on the prairies is 
considerably less than standard crop production but includes a 
wide variety of agricultural products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by outlining the consultation process 
concerning the proposed special crops amendments.  The first 
round of consultations was undertaken by a panel of producers. As 
part of the special crops initiative funded by the commission, 
members met with a variety of producers and industry 
organizations to assess their regulatory needs and to make 
recommendations to the commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1994 the Canadian Grain Commission circulated a 
discussion paper to individuals and companies involved in the 
special crops industry on the prairies.  The commission met with 
individual producers and their organizations, processors, grain 
dealers and representatives of elevator companies.  The purpose 
of the discussions was to chart a new course for licensing and 
security in the special crops industry in western Canada.  A 
consensus on licensing and security emerged from those 
consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1995 the commission released a report reflecting that 
consensus. 
Following the release of the report, the commission provided 
support to an advisory committee consisting of producers and 
dealers representing the principal special crops organizations as 
they developed the basis for this legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me add for the benefit of members who represent ridings in 
eastern Canada that the special crops provision of the bill will 
apply to crops named in the proposed legislation and grown in 
western Canada.  Persons and companies dealing in eastern special 
crops will not be affected by the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special crops industry plays a significant role in the 
development of the rural economy of western Canada.  The bulk of 
the country's special crops production comes from the three 
prairie provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada figures indicate that special crops production 
on the prairies increased by about 300% in the last 14 years. In 
1984-85 production was approximately one million tonnes.  In 
1997-98 this figure has climbed to approximately three million 
tonnes.  The special crops market continues to expand. Both large 
and small players are contributing to its impressive growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special crops industry exports a considerable amount of 
product.  In 1996-97 the figure was 1.3 million tonnes.  This 
represents about 5% of total exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The western Canadian special crops industry has become one of 
Canada's export success stories.  Naturally, domestic seed 
cleaning plants are anxious to get into the business of buying 
and marketing.  On the other hand, producers want to expand the 
number of outlets for their special crops.  Moreover the entry of 
new players will stimulate innovation and the development of new 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Grain Act amendments relating to special crops 
involve three major elements:  a voluntary producer insurance 
plan; affordable licensing for special crops dealers; and a 
special crops advisory committee.  The first element of the 
proposed legislation is the financial protection that will be 
available to producers under a voluntary insurance plan.  If 
approved, the amendments will provide financial protection to 
producers who are prepared to pay for it and will be simple to 
administer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that the plan is voluntary.  This was a key 
recommendation of the majority of producers consulted and their 
representative organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In consultation with a special crops advisory committee, the 
Canadian Grain Commission will manage the producer funded 
insurance plan.  Producers can choose whether or not to 
participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only those producers who are members of the producer insurance 
plan will be eligible for compensation if a licensed company they 
deal with fails to meet its payment obligations.  Producers will 
be considered members of the plan and eligible for coverage 
unless they notify the Canadian Grain Commission in writing that 
they want to opt out. Producers who do not want to belong can opt 
out prior to the start of the crop year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All producers will pay a levy when they sell special crops to 
licensed dealers.  The initial levy will be a small percentage of 
the value of grain delivered.  It is expected that the initial 
levy will be 0.038% or 38 cents per $100 worth of grain.  This 
works out to between 50 cents and $1 per acre depending on crop 
price and yield.  It may be adjusted up or down in accordance 
with the level of losses and the costs of administration. 
Producers who have opted out of the plan will at the end of each 
crop year receive a full rebate on the levies collected from 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan has administrative benefits for companies.  The dealer 
takes a levy for each delivery, whether the producer is in the 
plan or has opted out.  For the industry this keeps paperwork to 
a minimum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Special crops dealers will remit levies to the Canadian Grain 
Commission, the agent for participating producers.  After 
deducting an administration fee, the commission will forward the 
premiums to an insurer. 
The Canadian Export Development Corporation has agreed to act as 
the insurer for the plan.  The insurer and the agent can be 
changed in the future if the special crops advisory committee 
recommends it.  I will talk about this committee in more detail 
shortly.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prospective licensees will have to demonstrate financial ability 
to receive a licence.  This protects producers and ensures the 
viability of the insurance plan.  It is expected that most 
producers will participate. To encourage their participation, 
startup funding of $500,000 will be made available from the 
Government of Canada to assist in implementing this new program. 
The insurance plan will be self funded after initial startup. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second element concerning proposed changes to the Canada 
Grain Act is affordable licensing for special crops dealers.  The 
handling of special crops is regulated under the Canada Grain Act 
which was initially designed to regulate the bulk handling of 
cereal grains.  The licensing and security system in place 
however was not designed to serve the unique needs of special 
crops dealers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current system, buyers and sellers of Canadian grain, 
including special crops, must be licensed by the Canadian Grain 
Commission.  They must also provide security for producers by 
posting a bond or letter of credit.  Security protects producers 
if licensed elevators or grain dealers default on their payment 
obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately for small companies in the special crops industry, 
the security that must be provided is expensive and depletes 
their available credit restricting their ability to buy special 
crops.  Security requirements are tough on small companies and 
prevent the special crops industry from developing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 800 seed cleaning plants operate on the prairies.  They 
are currently exempt from licensing, provided they do not buy and 
sell grain.  Only a few operators of seed cleaning plants are 
currently licensed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not uncommon in this growing industry for a seed cleaning 
plant to act as an agent for an established licensee.  This will 
not change in the future.  However it would be easier for them 
under the provisions of the bill to evolve to the next level, to 
actually become a grain dealer buying and selling special crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More special crops dealers would become licensed if they could 
satisfy the licensing requirements.  Because they cannot, they 
are constrained in expanding their operations.  Furthermore they 
are not in a position to offer the full range of services 
demanded by producers and provided by their licensed competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately there have been cases where dealers have ignored 
the legislation and bought grain without a licence.  This places 
producers at significant risk of not being paid if the dealer 
defaults on payments because no security has been provided to the 
Canadian Grain Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canada to make further gains in the special crops market, a 
regulatory environment is required that allows companies, both 
large and small, to participate.  The proposed legislation before 
the House this morning would reduce entry barriers for special 
crops dealers by making licensing more affordable and making the 
licensing requirements easier to satisfy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If approved, it is expected that the new special crops 
provisions will initially apply to the following special crops: 
beans, buckwheat, corn, fababeans, lentils, mustard seed, peas, 
safflower seeds, soybeans, sunflower seed and triticale.  This 
list could be expanded or reduced if the special crops industry 
wants this to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A special crops dealer will be defined as an elevator operator 
or grain dealer who buys only special crops from producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An amendment to the Canada Grain Act will create a class of 
licence called a special crops licence.  This licence will give 
companies the right to use official grade names when buying and 
selling special crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals and companies that also buy and sell standard crops 
such as wheat, barley and canola will continue to be licensed 
under current provisions of the Canada Grain Act. 
They will not have to obtain a special crops licence to buy and 
sell special crops but will have to collect levies from producers 
for a producer funded insurance plan.  However, the security that 
companies currently post in the form of bonds and letters of 
credit to cover their liabilities to special crops producers will 
be reduced correspondingly. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT5"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT5"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1025

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, special crops dealers will not have to post security to 
cover payment obligations to special crops producers.  This will 
remove a major barrier to owners of small companies who want to 
participate in the special crops industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new program will encourage companies currently operating 
without a licence to apply for one.  By making licensing 
affordable and by eliminating costly security requirements, this 
proposed legislation will allow the number of licensed special 
crops dealers to increase.  Both large and small dealers will 
operate on a level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third element concerning proposed changes to the Canada 
Grain Act is the establishment of a special crops advisory 
committee.  The committee will be appointed by the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food.  It will be composed of a maximum of 
nine members representing special crops producers, processors, 
producer-processors, and exporters.  Each prairie province and 
sector of the industry will be represented on the committee. The 
majority of the members will be producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special crops advisory committee will advise the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food on the operations of the special crops 
program.  The committee can recommend to the minister that the 
administrator of the insurance plan or the insurer be replaced. 
It can also make recommendations on the designation of new crops 
and on other issues referred by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now talk about our proposed amendments to the 
Administrative Monetary Penalties Act, AMPA, so that AMPA applies 
to the Canada Grain Act. The Administrative Monetary Penalties 
Act is legislation that was enacted in 1995.  It provides a broad 
range of enforcement options by allowing monetary penalties, 
fines, to be levied for non-compliance with regulations. The 
Fertilizer Act, Plant Protect Act, Health of Animals Act, Pest 
Control Products Act and Feeds Act are subject to this innovative 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main enforcement options now available under the Canada 
Grain Act are the suspension and revocation of licences and 
prosecution.  However, those sanctions have the impact of 
stopping business operations either temporarily or perhaps 
permanently.  Because their impact is so serious, they are seen 
as a sanction of last resort, not as a normal regulatory 
enforcement tool. The current options are also costly, lengthy 
and mean that strict procedural requirements must be followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this proposed change, the Canadian Grain Commission will 
have a broader range of measures to enforce its regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important feature of AMPA is that it allows for the issuing 
of warnings and negotiated solutions to non-compliance. 
Administrative monetary penalties can be reduced to zero if a 
violator takes immediate corrective action to comply.  In this 
way AMPA emphasizes compliance, not punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to move on to talk about our initiative to 
repeal the Grain Futures Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members may be aware, the Grain Futures Act is federal 
legislation that was created in 1939.  Under the act the Canadian 
Grain Commission is responsible for regulating grain futures 
trading in Canada which is done solely at the Winnipeg Commodity 
Exchange with trade clearing done by Winnipeg Commodity Clearing 
Ltd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spring of 1997 the Canadian Grain Commission completed 
its consultation process with nearly 70 stakeholder groups and 
companies involved in the trading of grain futures and options. 
The purpose of the consultations was to determine the extent of 
industry support for a proposal to repeal the Grain Futures Act. 
These consultations were triggered by a recommendation made by 
the board of governors of the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange in 1996 
calling for a change in regulator from the Canadian Grain 
Commission to the Manitoba Securities Commission. 
This recommendation stemmed from the exchanges plan to introduce 
trading in non-grain products. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT6"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT6"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1030

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is wide agreement that the Manitoba Securities Commission 
has the appropriate statute to effectively regulate all trading 
activities at the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange.  The province of 
Manitoba has enacted the Commodity Futures Act, giving the 
Manitoba Securities Commission the mandate to regulate grain 
futures trading.  The legislation is expected to be proclaimed 
very soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several strong messages were received as a result of the 
consultation process.  They included the following.  The current 
Grain Futures Act is outmoded and no longer meets international 
and domestic regulatory standards.  It does not have the elements 
or scope to be an effective regulatory tool for the futures 
industry today.  The act provides for only the regulation of 
grain futures contracts.  It does not provide the authority to 
regulate all trading current and proposed at the Winnipeg 
Commodity Exchange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This key prairie institution wants to get involved in non-grain 
contracts such as hogs.  Under the current legislation for 
non-grain commodities the WCE would be subject to provincial 
legislation and regulations.  Transferring regulatory 
responsibilities to the province of Manitoba will eliminate the 
unsatisfactory prospect of the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange being 
subject to regulation by both the province of Manitoba for grain 
and non-grain contracts and by the Government of Canada for grain 
futures contracts.  This scenario is inconsistent with our 
national objectives of avoiding overlap and duplication of 
federal and provincial activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Manitoba's regulatory body, the Manitoba 
Securities Commission, has the legislation to provide the 
regulatory oversight that meets national and international 
standards.  The Manitoba legislation features comprehensive 
regulation of all aspects of futures and options trading from the 
point of order taking by futures commission merchants to the 
transactions on the floor and the clearing of trade.  In contrast 
the Grain Futures Act provides for only the supervision of grain 
futures trading and the clearing process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Manitoba Securities Commission has also indicated that it 
will acquire additional expertise in grains futures by hiring 
experienced staff, giving it the necessary resources to do an 
effective job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Grain Commission intends to maintain an ongoing 
liaison with the Manitoba Securities Commission through a 
memorandum of understanding.  Preliminary discussions have 
already been held.  This process will ensure that a formal 
mechanism is in place to communicate grain industry concerns and 
to ensure harmonization of trading regulators with grain handling 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude by stating that this proposed 
legislation is our government's response to the express needs of 
the western agriculture industry.  If passed, the legislation 
would benefit the special crops sector by recognizing and 
addressing the following principles: that security should be 
available to all producers who are prepared to pay for it; that 
their participation in an insurance plan should be voluntary; 
that the regulatory system for special crops should encourage 
development of the industry and not impede it; and that the 
program should be affordable, simple to administer and should not 
impose any additional costs or bureaucracy on any sector of the 
special crops industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Repeal of the outmoded Grain Futures Act would recognize the 
following principles:  that the federal government supports the 
introduction of a comprehensive, contemporary regulatory 
framework that will allow futures and options trading on the 
Winnipeg Commodity Exchange to develop new contracts and that 
dual regulations should be avoided or eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principal amendments before the House represent what the 
industry and producers believe are necessary for the future 
growth of the agricultural sector.  I recommend that members of 
the House support Bill C-26.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak to Bill C-26.  As 
outlined by the parliamentary secretary, it is an act to amend 
the Canada Grain Act and the Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Administrative Monetary Penalties Act and to repeal the Grain 
Futures Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge government members across the floor to truly and 
carefully listen to what farmers have to say about Bill C-26. The 
parliamentary secretary spoke long and eloquently about the 
consultative process that led up to Bill C-26, but I believe the 
job is only half done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is true the government has a dismal track record when 
it comes to listening to either farmers or the Canadian people, I 
believe it has a chance to partially redeem itself through the 
legislation.  On behalf of farmers I encourage the government to 
seize that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have a chance to seriously consider concerns that producers 
of special crops have about this very complex bill.  After all, 
that is what MPs are supposed to be doing here.  Reformers place 
very heavy emphasis on consultation and feedback from Canadians. 
Reformers base their policies on what voters have indicated are 
their wishes.  We consult, listen and then we consult again.  The 
result is a product that provides the most accurate reflection of 
the will of the people ever seen in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consensus building is never easy but it will always produce 
better legislation than simply responding to lobbyists, special 
interest groups or bureaucrats, which seems to be the Liberal 
method of drafting policy.  The parliamentary secretary referred 
to the consultations he believes and the government believes have 
taken place, but I believe the job is not yet done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time Liberal MPs gave this process a try.  I realize 
it is a little against their natural tendencies but they might be 
surprised to find some pleasure out of newly found democratic 
ways.  From personal experience I can attest it is a great 
feeling to know one is accurately reflecting the views of 
constituents and those of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is due to this need for feedback and consultation that Reform 
MPs have given tentative support to Bill C-26.  I describe that 
support as tentative because it is in the early days yet.  The 
debate and analysis of the legislation has only just begun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While at the outset it appears as though parts of the 
legislation may reap positive results in the form of increased 
financial security for producers of special crops, we have yet to 
hear from the majority of those producers and from other 
stakeholders affected by the legislation.  We have yet to hear 
from the majority of producers of beans, buckwheat, corn, faba 
beans, lentils, mustard seed, peas, safflower seed, soybeans, 
sunflower seed and triticale.  The same goes for any other party, 
and there are other parties, that feel the legislation will touch 
them as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is members of these groups who are the experts.  We must 
listen to their expert opinions on how Bill C-26 will affect 
their livelihoods.  I have personally written to a number of 
these groups which represent special crops farmers asking them to 
send me their praise or their criticisms of the bill.  I have 
also sent an open letter to the editor of the <I>Western 
Producer</I> inviting persons affected by the legislation to share 
their views with me.  Hopefully it will find room in its next 
publication to print my appeal for input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will kick-start a process of consultation, an ongoing 
process that I am confident will result in some concrete 
proposals to actually improve Bill C-26.  This consultative 
process must be given the opportunity to achieve results.  That 
means that when the bill goes to the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food all members of that committee must be 
ready and willing to give sufficient time and opportunity for 
witnesses to come forward with their opinions and proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately this is not something we simply expect to happen. 
It should be something we should be able to expect as part of our 
democratic parliamentary process. 
However the government has shown us time and time again that this 
process can be manipulated and mutilated to the point that 
democracy can barely be seen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who are unfamiliar with the sad story of Bill C-4, I 
will tell them how that bill was rammed through committee stage. 
Grain farmers and farm groups whose livelihoods depend upon 
reform of the Canadian Wheat Board were given less than two 
weeks, or just six short meetings in Ottawa, to tell MPs on the 
agriculture committee what was wrong with Bill C-4.  They were 
lumped together, up to four at a time, in a round table style 
presentation.  These stakeholders who have the right to have 
their views heard by elected representatives were barely squeezed 
in to the Liberal members' agenda and once they were before the 
committee their comments were virtually ignored and their 
expertise was disregarded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform MPs on the committee, including myself, collectively had 
just seven minutes to question witnesses to garner a complete 
understanding of their position. By the time the sixth and final 
committee meeting allotted for Bill C-4 came along, it was 
apparent that Liberal committee members had no intention of 
making any of the substantive changes required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In less than two hours the entire bill was analysed clause by 
clause and returned to the House, not as improved legislation 
that reflected farmer feedback but as the same ineffective 
unanimously despised bill that was tabled by the minister 
responsible for the wheat board in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it had been immediately apparent that amendments would not 
be given fair consideration at committee, my Reform colleagues 
and I chose to table our amendments at report stage, hoping that 
all MPs in the House would take the time to thoroughly consider 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Liberals think of the amendments that were derived 
by farmers?  They thought they were a waste of time.  The 
government invoked time allocation and cut off debate on Bill 
C-4.  Consultation was certainly not to get in the way of the 
government's tight schedule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You can understand, Mr. Speaker, why I challenge government 
members to truly consult with farmers on Bill C-26.  I am 
understandably sceptical.  I am concerned for farmers.  I am 
concerned that their voices will be ignored as they were during 
the debate on Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I have little doubt that my Reform colleagues and 
I will be proposing amendments to Bill C-26 either at the 
agriculture committee or at report stage in the Chamber.  Certain 
problems with the bill are already apparent through the limited 
feedback we have received thus far.  As I mentioned, even if the 
government is not ready to consult with farmers Reformers are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to the responses to my invitation to 
comment on Bill C-26.  Based on those responses if the majority 
of farmers support the bill we will know it.  If the majority of 
farmers oppose the bill we will also know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a number of preliminary concerns about Bill C-26 that I 
believe should be addressed in coming days along with the 
concerns we will hear from farmers.  One of the most worrisome 
aspects of Bill C-26, which I hope can be addressed through 
amendments, is the lack of details outlining how the special 
crops industry insurance plan will function.  Instead of having 
these details put in place by parliament, meaning that they will 
undergo the scrutiny and debate of MPs and farmers, regulations 
will be put in place.  Regulations are not subjected to the 
consultation and approval required for legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passing Bill C-26 with the details of the insurance plan missing 
is like signing a blank cheque.  I am not prepared to sign off 
the legislation without at least setting up some essential 
parameters for the operation of the insurance plan.  Perhaps the 
government felt this task is too onerous or too complicated to be 
included in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the government and the minister of agriculture that 
producers of special crops will be willing to meet that 
challenge.  There is too much at stake to avoid the particulars 
and leave them to be determined through regulations.  Farmers' 
interests need to be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the insurance levy requires limitations.  The 
special crops rural initiative program or SCRIP committee, which 
includes producers and processors from the three prairie 
provinces, made a number of recommendations in the April 1996 
report, many of which are contained in the bill as the 
parliamentary secretary outlined. 
However, the SCRIP committee recommended that the insurance levy 
remain under 1% of the gross value of grain sale proceeds but 
there is no clause to reflect this limit in Bill C-26.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot be content nor can farmers to rely on the minister's 
word or assurances that in future regulations the levy will not 
surpass 1%.  Bill C-26 requires more certainty on this issue and 
on many other particulars of the insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern arises from experiences that tell us that 
government interference in agriculture can often be a hindrance 
to progress.  Bureaucracy and farming do not mix.  Whenever 
possible, the market and the private sector must be allowed to 
determine an industry's direction.  There are two examples in 
this legislation that run opposite to this philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is that the Canadian Grain Commission will run the 
insurance plan.  Perhaps during the formative months that the 
plan is being established the CGC could play a stabilizing role 
as administrator.  However, there is no reason that legislation 
should not call for the eventual return of the plan to one of the 
producer groups.  The insurance plan runs the risk of becoming 
bogged down in the infamous government bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a related issue, the insurance plan is insured by the Export 
Development Corporation, a federal government institution.  Why 
not allow a private insurance company to act as the insurer?  It 
is an option that must be investigated.  It is often found that 
private companies have premiums competitive to premiums charged 
by the federal government to ensure an insurance plan.  If that 
is the case then farmers and taxpayers would be better off if a 
private company were chosen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party favours fostering the development of private 
sector management strategies in the Canadian agricultural 
industry.  We need less government interference in agriculture. 
We need to support an increase in private enterprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further concerns will no doubt arise over the levy.  The CGC 
says the initial levy will be set at .0038 or almost four-tenths 
of 1% which is slightly higher than the SCRIP committee had 
originally suggested.  There will be questions about this 
increase in the levy.  The CGC also says that one-third of the 
levy will be consumed by administrative costs and two-thirds will 
go toward the premium on the fund.  Minimizing the administrative 
costs will be a priority for farmers and Reform MPs.  It has also 
been suggested that the deductible be set at 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind everyone that all these figures mentioned are not in 
the legislation.  They were either contained in the SCRIP report 
or in a press release issued by the CGC and this gives cause for 
great concern.  While it may be difficult to specify precise 
numbers and percentages, farmers will want some assurance through 
legislation that rigid guidelines are in place to prevent the 
plan from becoming too expensive or too administratively 
burdened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though levy rates deductibles are not found in any clause 
in Bill C-26 government MPs better be prepared to accept the 
reality that producers and processors will demand the opportunity 
to discuss them.  They will not be willing to leave the fate of 
their livelihoods to be determined solely by regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to some of the feedback that has come.  This legislation 
is really in its infancy even though there has been a 
consultative process under way for quite some time.  This 
legislation is quite new to this place.  Despite what the 
parliamentary secretary indicated during his remarks, I found 
many producers are not really aware that this legislation even 
exists at this point.  We have some feedback coming to us about 
Bill C-26.  I would like to read into the record a couple of 
letters I have received from groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is from the Foam Lake marketing club, a group of 
producers from Foam Lake, Saskatchewan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a February 19, 1998 letter to the minister on Bill C-26 they 
say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very concerned with the SCRIP portion of Bill C-26 and as 
such, request that it be withdrawn for further study or 
substantially amended.  Our request is supported by the following 
points: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1) There appears to have been a calculated effort by the CGC and 
the SCRIP committee to develop their proposal in secret. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is quite contrary to the opening remarks of the 
parliamentary secretary about the great consultative process that 
the government went through. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are very few farmers who know that the SCRIP bill is about 
to become law, let alone know the contents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2) There have been several large membership organizations which 
have rejected SCRIP at their annual meetings, (1) the 
Saskatchewan Canola Growers Association, (2) the Western Canadian 
Wheat Growers Association, (3) the Saskatchewan Pulse Crop 
Development Board and (4) the Western Barley Growers Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>3) The SCRIP proposal, while being promoted as voluntary, is 
nothing short of a worst case example of negative billing.  This 
of course could be made acceptable if it was made truly voluntary 
for both the special crop growers and the grain dealers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>4) The key reason for the various commodity groups rejecting the 
SCRIP proposal was the suggestion in the CGC briefing notes that 
cereal and oilseed crops may well be added at a later date. It is 
obvious from this that the federal government is anxious to 
absolve itself of the security responsibilities which are clearly 
spelled out in the Canada Grain Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On point 4, I believe the author is talking about this bill as 
being more unloading, more downloading of government 
responsibilities to the producers.  The letter goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>5) The other very troubling aspect of this proposal (which is 
left up to the regulators) is the fact that farmers will be 
paying a tax rather than a competitive cost item which would 
normally be built into the grain buyer's basis.  Our industry has 
far too many regulated cost items which are void of any 
competitive forces. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the author is referring to is competition.  There should be 
open competition.  Any time we get a situation where we have only 
one person supplying the insurance for an industry, without 
competition, we run the risk that the premiums and administration 
costs could be to high. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>6) The final concern we would like to raise with you is the 
recent aggression which has been initiated by the CGC.  Special 
crops dealers have indicated to us there have been a number of 
instances where the CGC has instructed the RCMP to seize records 
and close businesses down.  These RCMP raids would appear to be 
linked directly to the SCRIP legislation.  We urge you, Mr. 
Minister, to call off these scare tactics and allow the special 
crops industry to advance and prosper as it has done without the 
onerous regulations which are inherent in the grain industry in 
western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Foam Lake Marketing Club is a group of 20 commercial farmers 
who meet on a regular basis to keep abreast of commodity market 
trends and advance our vision for a less regulated and a more 
market responsive agriculture industry in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We trust you will respect our recommendation for withdrawal of 
SCRIP or make the necessary amendments to have it completely 
voluntary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sincerely, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill Cooper, President 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I briefly want to refer to another copy of a letter that came to 
me from the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association.  It is 
also about this particular legislation.  As I indicated, we are 
starting to get some feedback about Bill C-26. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This letter states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Minister: 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Re: an act to amend the Canada Grain Act and the Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Act and to the repeal 
the Grain Futures Act 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am writing today specifically on the issue of the Special 
Crops Rural Initiative Program (SCRIP) proposed under Bill C-26. 
The attached resolution, passed by delegates to the Western 
Canadian Wheat Growers Association (WCWGA) annual meeting earlier 
this year, clearly spells out the position of our association on 
this program.  Similar resolutions were also passed by delegates 
to the Saskatchewan Pulse Crop Development Board, Saskatchewan 
Canola Growers Association and the Western Barley Growers 
Association this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the passage of the resolution, the WCWGA took the 
initiative to meet with the Canadian Grain Commission (CGC) 
President Barry Senft and his staff as well as several members of 
the SCRIP committee to discuss our members' concerns.  Our 
primary concern with the program is with the insurance plan.  The 
mandatory payment of the levy at source is, in our opinion, a 
form of negative billing, and will be perceived as a tax on the 
farm community.  We would therefore suggest that the program be 
amended to ensure participation in the program is truly voluntary 
for both the special crop grower and the special crop dealer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on in that light.  Another concern he refers to is 
on page 2: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because a significant number of wheat grower members are growers 
of special crops, we are also compelled to comment on the fact 
that the CGC is considering including cereal and oilseed crops in 
this program.  If in fact the proposed legislation is all 
encompassing and only requires regulatory additions to include 
wheat, other cereals, and oilseeds, then we must demand that the 
SCRIP section of Bill C-26 be repealed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That letter was signed by Larry Maguire, president of the 
Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I noted during my remarks, what we have seen is some feedback 
already starting to filter back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure I can wrap up before question period. I have some 
other stories I would like to relate concerning this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns about this legislation and the fact that 
there is a need to have insurance and bonds posted by grain 
dealers, in this case special crops dealers, is that farmers 
always run the risk of having their product sold to a company 
that goes bankrupt.  The farmer is then left on the hook. 
Unfortunately we have seen that happen a few times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was told about a case where a company called Klemmer Seeds in 
Saskatchewan a couple of years ago went into receivership and 
some farmers were left on the hook and government and taxpayers 
had to come to their assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of involved in agriculture and follow the agricultural 
industry are very well aware of what happened in the last week or 
so with Palliser Grain going into receivership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform MPs from Saskatchewan showed great initiative recently by 
holding and hosting an open forum.  They invited farmers from 
Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and approximately 300 showed up. I was 
also at this forum and spoke to the farmers.  Many of the farmers 
approached me with concerns about Palliser Grain going into 
receivership.  Their immediate concern was for the grain the 
company had in storage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to give a bit of an indication of the 
magnitude of the disaster.  I had a couple of farmers tell me 
that they were unfortunately in a position where they had eight 
carloads of flax that they had unloaded sometime last fall.  The 
value of this, to put this in some perspective for a reasonably 
mid sized farm, is about $200,000.  This flax was with Palliser 
and they are unclear at this point, because they had opted for a 
deferred payment, whether they are going to be covered by the 
bond that Palliser was carrying.

out within 12 hours in 1994.  The 1994 disaster led to a major 
re-examination of DFO policy and gave a black eye to the 
department.  Now the minister is blaming some guy called El Niño 
and a host of other things rather than accepting responsibility 
for disastrous fishery management on both coasts, affecting the 
livelihood of tens of thousands.  This is despite clear evidence 
to the contrary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government refuses to hear the legitimate concerns of small 
depositors, small businesses and smaller communities on the 
megabank merger until after the task force on financial services 
reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In stark contrast the government rolls out the red carpet to the 
international financial elite.  The government cannot wait to 
fast track the WTO deal thereby throwing open Canada's borders to 
foreign banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government hide behind the task force on financial 
services when it comes to the megabank concerns of Canadian 
citizens and Canadian communities but rushes to accommodate 
foreign banks? 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have a committee studying the problem and we are 
waiting for the recommendations.  A few months ago banks wanted 
to have an approval right away and we said no, that they had to 
wait until we had a report and that in the light of the report we 
would make a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very clear.  They wanted to have an answer in the month

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister conveniently ignored the question about fast 
tracking foreign banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the financial services report is so important, why not defer 
the foreign banks issue as well until after the task force 
report? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we not consider foreign banks at the same that we 
consider the megabank merger?  Why does the government not cool 
its jets on foreign banks legislation until after the financial 
services task force report, or are the interests of Canadian

government as the interests of foreign banks and financial 
elites?

Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, the minister of Indian affairs has

aboriginal report on the royal commission.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday we asked the Indian affairs minister to 
appoint a judge to look into the tragic deaths on the Tsuu T'ina 
reserve near Calgary.  She ignored our suggestions.  She said the 
government already had the Royal Commission on Aboriginal 
Peoples, and it did not have to investigate any more. That 
commission produced 400 recommendations but the report has been 
on the shelf gathering dust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What specific recommendations from that report is the government 
applying to the Tsuu T'ina reserve? 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, obviously the member should take the time to read 
the government's response to the royal commission.  We are 
working very hard with all of the players, including the 
leadership of the national organization and the regional 
organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  More money for the chief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps:</B>  The member yells out “more money for 
the chief”.  I find it passing strange that in the Reform 
Party's last document on aboriginal peoples it planned on cutting 
$1 billion from programming that was going to help with housing, 
help with fetal alcohol syndrome and help with a number of the 
social problems they are facing. The Reform Party did not support 
the recommendations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
standoff and shooting, the Bruce Starlight affair and the poverty 
on the Tsuu T'ina reserve are symptoms of ongoing problems that 
need a solution now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs. If she will 
not appoint a judge, what specific recommendations from the royal 
commission will be used to solve the current crisis facing people 
on the reserve?  Will she act before the next tragedy occurs? 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is the sad thing about the Reform Party.  When 
there is a human tragedy it tries to exploit it for political 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer the Reform Party to an editorial in the Toronto 
<I>Star</I> where it says:  “It can be a short, frightening step 
from a police shooting on a native reserve to an eruption of 
violent anger.  That is why it is heartening to see Ottawa and 
Alberta responding quickly in this week's fatal shooting of a 
woman and her son”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party would be well advised to look at the broader 
issues and to try and work with aboriginal people instead of 
pointing the finger at a chief and individual and cutting a 
billion dollars of programming from aboriginal peoples' housing 
and social delivery.

down to make the operation more efficient and effective and at

what this is about. 
We have less resources now in national defence. We want to make

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the federal government has contributed to the

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member knows, Canadian highways are a provincial

of new major national toll-free highway projects and an 
examination of the potential for constructive collaboration 
between the federal, provincial and private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the minister to indicate to me if, for instance, he 
considers it important to upgrade the highway between the 
metropolitan Quebec and Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean regions, as a major 
pilot project, thus allowing us to link two large and important 
regions of this country?  Unfortunately, the Government of Quebec 
is still turning a deaf ear to any new approach.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to say that typically the Government of Canada 
invests its natural resources research budget on a regional 
basis. With respect to science and technology, 16% in total flows 
to the province of British Columbia.  Last year it was $34 
million for important projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On trade, I am working with the industry, with union leadership,

right off the roles.  We reduced the taxes for 14 million

those sufferers will die of the disease.

<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we 
will be answering Question No. 5. 
.[Text] 
<Question No. 5—<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the moment when chronometers in all federal 
Government information systems change from the year 1999 to the 
year 2000, (<I>a</I>) what is now being done and what will be done to 
prepare for this moment, (<I>b</I>) can the government assure the 
public that there will be no loss of data, no interruption in 
service or other systems malfunction, and (<I>c</I>) what is the 
estimated cost ensuring that computers will be able to cope 
effectively with the change of millennium? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK159"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and Minister 
responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> a) The federal government 
has defined the year 2000 compliance issue as a high government 
priority and is working aggressively on all fronts to monitor the 
level of year 2000 readiness within departments, implement common 
initiatives and encourage action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, the chief information officer, CIO, project office was 
established within Treasury Board secretariat, TBS, to 
co-ordinate and monitor activity across all federal government 
departments and agencies. In September of 1997, a government 
industry task force was formed under the Minister of Industry to 
help Canadian industry address this unique challenge. The task 
force is chaired by Jean Monty, chief executive officer of 
Nortel, and includes representatives from a number of key 
economic sectors including banking, insurance, transportation, 
manufacturing, telecommunications, information technology, small 
and medium size business, agriculture, and the retail and service 
sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIO year 2000 project office has completed two 
comprehensive, government-wide surveys and a third one is in 
progress. The results of the second survey indicate that all 
departments are aware of the issue and all departments with 
government-wide mission critical, GWMC, systems have active year 
2000 plans in place. Additionally, the level of readiness within 
government is consistent with accepted industry standards, and 
many departments are even further advanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>b) The CIO year 2000 project office is committed to ensuring 
that key federal government systems will continue the delivery of 
essential services to the Canadian public and its businesses, 
beyond the year 2000. Defined as government-wide mission critical, 
GWMC, these systems have a direct impact on the health, safety, 
security and economic well-being of Canadians, and are the 
government's first priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Departments are responsible for all year 2000 repair, testing 
and replacement work of their systems, but in order to ensure 
that there is no interruption of services, departments will be 
asked to provide full contingency plans for any systems that are 
deemed at possible risk by fall of 1998. At present, however, the 
focus and number one priority of the government is to ensure that 
departments complete the necessary repair and replacement work on 
GWMC systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>c) The Government of Canada recognizes that not addressing the 
year 2000 challenge could result in significant costs to Canadian 
taxpayers. Treasury Board secretariat estimates that the price 
tag for federal government year 2000 compliance will be $1 
billion. The total federal information tehcnology, IT, budget is 
$3 billion to $4 billion annually and it is anticipated that the majority 
of the $1 billion required for the year 2000 effort is being 
drawn from existing budgets during the conversion period.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have some answers which are long overdue.  On October 
28 Question No. 31 was asked, which was regarding the dropping of 
charges against the minister's friends in the Oak Bay Marine 
Group.  That answer is still outstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 2 Question No. 56 was asked, again concerning the 
Oak Bay Marine Group.  I wonder when I can expect a response on 
those matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have noted the numbers 
that the member mentioned and I will look into it as quickly as I 
can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that we have received roughly 800 questions to 
this point.  We have replied to well over half of them, but I

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>   Mr. Speaker, there is a deadline for 
responding to questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another question, Question No. 51, which was asked on 
December 1, 1997.  We asked for a list of aboriginal groups which 
received communal fishing licences or other authorization to 
fish, excluding commercial fishing licences of the same type 
issued to all Canadian commercial fleets in British Columbia and 
I have had no response to that one as well.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA GRAIN ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK163">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-26, an 
act to amend the Canada Grain Act and the Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Act and to repeal the 
Grain Futures Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  When debate was 
suspended the hon. member for Prince George—Peace River had 
approximately 16 minutes remaining on his time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when I was interrupted by question period I was relating 
to the House the potential magnitude of the Palliser Grain 
receivership disaster and I was trying to enlighten some members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from the heckling that constantly comes every time I 
stand to speak in this Chamber that there are some members across 
the way who do not wish to be enlightened about what farmers are 
saying in Saskatchewan, Alberta or anywhere else for that matter. 
They have a problem with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was relating the story about the Saskatchewan forum which was 
hosted by the eight Reform MPs from that province.  I was 
approached in my role as the official opposition agriculture 
critic.  I was approached by a number of farmers who had concerns 
about the Palliser Grain Company going into receivership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these farmers are facing very substantial losses if they 
are not covered by the existing bond or if they are not covered 
by a trust fund that has been set up for some deferred payments 
and which we have scanty details about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to explain the process for deferred payments. When 
farmers deliver their product—and this applies to special crops 
as well as other commodities—they can defer payment to sometime 
in the future.  It helps them to regulate their cash flow and 
even it out in different parts of the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that under the present regulations, in order 
to be covered, the maximum amount of time a farmer can have his 
product stored with a company is 90 days.  Then they have up to 
30 days to cash the cheque.  They basically have 120 days in 
which to get paid.  If they do not fall within that framework of 
120 days, in other words, if their product has been in storage 
for longer than that period of time, when a company goes into 
receivership it is questionable whether they will receive 
remuneration for their stored products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, my understanding is that government changed the 
rules in or about August 1995.  Prior to that farmers were 
covered up to one year if they had products stored with a 
company.  That was changed and shortened to 120 days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It brings to light this issue:  Is the onus entirely on the 
farmer to ensure that when he sells his product to a company he 
is going to be covered in this type of situation?  Or is there 
some responsibility on the part of government to ensure that the 
farmer is made aware that these types of changes have taken place 
or that there is some increased risk involved with deferring 
payment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It brings to light the whole issue of the buyer beware type of 
scenario.  In this case we have the situation of seller beware, 
where the farmer has to recognize the extent of the risk he is 
taking.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fairness to the farmers in the Palliser Grain situation, it 
is quite likely a lot of them did not understand that the 
insurance bond which Palliser Grain was required under 
legislation to carry did not cover them past the 120 days. It is 
certainly my hope and I believe the hope of all members that the 
issue can be resolved favourably for the farmers and that the 
trust fund which was set up for deferred payments will be 
sufficient to cover all those farmers who had product on storage 
with Palliser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason why I am relaying this story is directly linked to 
one of the major reasons for Bill C-26, the whole issue of grain 
buyers and grain buying companies carrying insurance against the 
disaster of having gone broke or having gone into receivership, 
and whether the responsibility should rest entirely with the 
farmers or if there is some inherent responsibility on the part 
of government to carry some of that risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the points I made during my speech is that under the 
present way that Bill C-26 is structured there will be no 
competition in providing that insurance.  The farmers who have 
approached me are quite concerned about the future risk of 
premiums being increased.  They are also concerned about the fact 
that it is a levy.  Although the parliamentary secretary said 
that it is voluntary, there are hoops that the farmer has to jump 
through. He has to wait until the end of the year to opt out.  He 
has to maintain his records to see exactly how much levy he has 
paid. He then has to total this up and request that money he paid 
into the levy fund from the governing body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is technically true that it is a voluntary process, it 
is, as I said in my speech, really negative option billing.  The 
farmer has no choice because it is deducted off his cheque when 
he actually sells his product to the special grains buying agent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to sum up by saying that the official 
opposition is constantly in a bit of a quandary when it comes to 
supporting or opposing certain pieces of legislation.  All 
Canadians recognize that most of the legislation that is placed 
before this House has certain good merits to it.  However, we are 
constantly having to decide whether it is more than 50% good or 
more than 50% bad and what position we should take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have the exact numbers but I think in the last 
Parliament, which was the first Parliament for me as a member of 
Parliament, the Reform Party supported the government's 
legislation about half the time. It may be a little more or a 
little less, but I think it was half the time.  I believe we 
ended up supporting about half the bills that came through this 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, as I relayed in my opening remarks on Bill C-26, 
we are caught in the middle of this at this point in time.  We 
are not sure whether to support it right now.  There are some 
good things in it.  As the parliamentary secretary indicated in 
his remarks, farmers, grain buyers and other stakeholders in the 
industry have been requesting this for quite some time.  Whether 
this is the exact approach to take we do not know at this point. 
We are certainly interested in getting a lot more feedback as we 
go through the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these comments which I have quoted from the various 
organizations and farmers run exactly opposite to each other but 
I wanted to demonstrate to members of this House that we as 
parliamentarians have our work cut out for us with Bill C-26. The 
feedback represents only a fraction of the input that we can 
expect to receive on this legislation.  Yet it is already obvious 
that there is a great deal of skilful legislative work required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will need to carefully listen, thoroughly examine, look for 
compromise and, in the end, be able to tell farmers that we have 
done our jobs and done our jobs well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak to Bill C-26, an act to amend the Canada Grain Act and the 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Act 
and to repeal the Grain Futures Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the new agriculture and agri-food critic for my party, I want 
to assure you that I will certainly be separating the wheat from 
the chaff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are again debating a bill that concerns only part of Canada, 
the prairies.  What, however, is at the heart of this bill? 
The summary of the text reads as follows, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment establishes a licensing system and an insurance 
plan for the special crops industry in Western Canada.  It 
provides for the licensing of all buyers of special crops and 
for the voluntary participation of producers in the insurance 
plan, which protects them against default of payment for special 
crops by licensees.  Outstanding payments for standard crops 
will continue to be protected by security given by standard 
crops dealers to the Canadian Grain Commission (CGC). 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a summary examination of this highly technical and 
specialized bill, I will most certainly be a participant in the 
debate bearing in mind the best interests of farmers and farming 
and recognizing that this bill does not concern Quebec farmers. 
This is the reason my speech will be brief.  I am not 
particularly concerned with a matter that is of interest only to 
western farmers.  I feel quite outside this debate, particularly 
having heard the previous speeches, including that of my 
predecessor, the member for Prince George—Peace River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important clause in this bill is clause 7. 
This clause provides for the establishment of an insurance plan, 
and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to insure producers of special crops who are holders of cash 
purchase tickets— 
</UL></UL>
<That is to say a document in prescribed form issued in receipt of 
grain delivered to a process elevator or grain dealer and 
entitling the holder of the document to payment by the operator 
or dealer. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—elevator receipts— 
</UL></UL>
<That is to say a document in prescribed form issued in receipt of 
grain delivered, subject to certain conditions contained therein 
or in the Canada Grain Act. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—or grain receipts against the refusal or failure of licensees to 
meet their payment or delivery obligations under the receipt or 
ticket. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If such a regime were to become law, this would allow a licence 
holder with an elevator operator or grain dealer licence to 
receive statutory levies from producers delivering special 
crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He would then remit the levies to the agent, who would use them 
to pay any premiums owed to the insurer, any expenses related to 
the administration of the insurance plan and any remuneration or 
reimbursement of expenses to which a member of the Special Crops 
Advisory Committee may be entitled under subsection 49.02(4). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty lies in section 49.02, which consists of four 
subsections setting out how the advisory committee is to be 
formed.  The first subsection allows the minister to establish an 
advisory committee by naming nine members for a renewable term 
not exceeding three years.  Is this not a way of making political 
appointments? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be better for these positions to be elected ones, 
especially since the committee is mandated to present 
recommendations regarding the designation of special crops and 
the selection of a person or organization as agent or insurer, 
and to advise the minister on any other issues concerning special 
crops?  This could easily become a conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the majority of the members of the committee must be 
“special crops producers who are not special crops dealers, 
grain dealers or operators of primary elevators”.  In other 
words, they cannot be traders.  I add this comment because the 
wording of the bill in French is rather ambiguous on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, members's remuneration is also fixed by the 
minister.  The agent must also reimburse them for any reasonable 
travel and living expenses incurred by them in the course of 
their duties while absent from their ordinary places of 
residence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can be seen that a number of questions arise concerning clause 
7, particularly subsection 49.02 and its paragraphs.  Other 
clauses also require some clarification, and this will be 
forthcoming, I trust, before we vote on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will, therefore, be on the lookout for the slightest comment 
from farmers on this bill, for they are the ones who must 
benefit from it first and foremost. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-26, legislation to amend the Canada 
Grain Act and the Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative 
Monetary Penalties Act and to repeal the Grain Futures Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation makes amendments to two acts and repeals a 
third.  It is really a rather detailed and complex piece of 
legislation.  In briefings from the minister of agriculture's 
staff we were told this bill is of a non-controversial and only 
housekeeping nature.  But looking closely at it we found 
something very negative and unsavoury about the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will now go to committee and frankly if we do not see 
some changes at that stage our party will have no choice but to 
vote against the bill at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I seriously question whether this legislation is 
really what the special crops industry wants.  The minister has 
provided us with some information that indicates a long period of 
consultation on this question, and in fact the consultations go 
way back to 1993 and straddled the last federal election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might well ask what has changed in the past five years, and 
we ask whether these old and dated assumptions are a true 
reflection of what farmers and the industry truly wants today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get to what we consider to be the major defects of Bill 
C-26 I will summarize the government's stated intent for the 
legislation.  First, we were told these amendments to the 
Canada Grain Act are intended to set up a licensing system for 
those businesses that purchase special crops from farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the legislation would allow creation of an insurance 
plan for the special crops industry. Third, the bill would repeal 
the Grain Futures Act, allowing responsibility for regulating the 
Winnipeg Commodity Exchange to revert to the Manitoba Securities 
Commission.  The exchange is now regulated by the Canadian Grain 
Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 applies only to western Canada because it relates to 
the jurisdiction exercised by the Grain commission in 
administering the Canada Grain Act, which does not generally 
apply in eastern Canada.  This legislation applies to special 
crops.  These crops include beans, buckwheat, peas, corn, faba 
beans, lentils, mustard seed, safflower, soybeans and sunflower 
seed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Special crops are of growing importance to farmers and to the 
economy of western Canada.  The so-called grain wars of the 1980s 
are painful memories in the minds of many farmers.  The United 
States and the European community used their immense treasuries 
to subsidize the production and sale of wheat and other major 
grains. This subsidization drove down world prices and drove 
thousands of western Canadian farmers off their land.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that farmers responded very creatively to this 
situation.  One way in which they did so was to diversify into 
peas, lentils, sunflower seeds and other special crops.  We in 
the NDP caucus are most supportive of any measures that will 
enhance the ability of farmers to prosper from growing and 
marketing their special crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also support measures that would put the entire special crops 
industry on a firmer financial footing.  The government claims 
the legislation will do that but my caucus and I are not 
convinced that it will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions that have to be asked are these.  Does the 
legislation benefit farmers and the entire special crops 
industry?  If there are benefits, what will they ultimately cost? 
The answers to these questions give us great cause for concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 is based on a number of premises.  One of them is that 
the businesses which most often purchase special crops from 
farmers are small firms that are frequently not licensed.  The 
reason posited for this is that the security required from 
special crops dealers in order to cover their payment obligation 
to producers has forced small companies to avoid taking out 
licences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In turn, this puts the producers who sell to these companies at 
risk if a company goes bankrupt or cannot meet its payment.  A 
further argument is that this uncertainty has limited the 
potential growth of the industry because it has prevented farmers 
from getting into special crop production in a bigger way.  The 
larger elevator companies that buy grains like wheat and barley 
naturally are licensed by the Canadian Grain Commission.  Of 
course this is important to Canada's reputation as a reliable 
supplier of high quality grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grain commission has the power to ensure that these large 
companies are always in a position to meet their payments to 
farmers who sell to them.  The commission also has the power to 
ask companies to secure bonds and can impose penalties on 
companies should they renege on these payments to farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument is made that regulations which make sense for large 
grain companies are not appropriate for smaller companies that 
purchase special crops.  For example, the government says that 
Bill C-26 would remove the onus on special crop dealers to post 
costly bonds against the possibility of their defaulting in 
payments to producers.  It has been argued that this is 
difficult, if not impossible, for small companies to post large 
security bonds and that consequently many of them simply are not 
licensed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 proposes a licensing system for these smaller 
companies.  In return for their being licensed they would not 
have to post large security bonds.  The legislation also allows 
the Canadian Grain Commission to impose penalties and fines on 
these smaller companies for violations of the Canada Grain Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation allows the grain commission to be more flexible 
and less punitive in the way it treats smaller grain companies in 
the event that they contravene the Canada Grain Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that a system of licensing developed 
specifically for the purchasers of special crops will encourage 
development of the industry.  We in the NDP support the 
development of the industry but question whether the legislation 
will achieve that end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second and related component of the legislation is a program 
that will insure farmers against non-payment by the businesses 
buying their special crops.  The government says that the program 
is voluntary but in actual fact it is not.  It is here that we 
begin to have some serious problems and I would like to go into 
them in some detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In clause 7 of the bill the government decrees that all special 
crops producers must pay an insurance levy on all crops sold to 
licensed dealers.  Farmers have to pay this levy.  Whether or not 
they want to participate in the insurance program they have to 
pay this check off at source.  They have no choice about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government calls this a voluntary insurance program, but it 
is anything but voluntary if it is a mandatory contribution at 
the front end.  In fact it amounts to sort of a negative option 
billing plan in actual fact, the same kind of plan that outraged 
Canadians when cable television companies tried to implement this 
a few years back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers will have to provide notice at the beginning of the crop 
year if they do not want to belong to this insurance plan.  Even 
if they give that notice in writing farmers still have to pay the 
insurance levy at the front end.  It is only at the end of the 
crop year and after doing a lot of paperwork and legal wrangling 
that farmers would get their money back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, they will not receive interest on the money 
being held by the government that they paid at the front end and 
have to wait to be refunded at the back end.  This type of 
negative option billing is simply unacceptable to farmers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our agriculture critic is already getting calls of protest from 
farmers who are beginning to twig to how the plan is really 
unfolding.  We are not satisfied that these measures are really 
what the industry wants or needs.  Certainly it is not what the 
farmers who have been coming forward want or need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 proposes a check-off on grain deliveries to pay for a 
wheat board contingency fund.  The proposed fund is extremely 
unpopular with farmers.  They cannot afford the check-off.  They 
do not see the need for it.  They do not want to pay for it.  Now 
the same government is proposing yet another check-off, 
compounding and piggybacking the other check-offs farmers pay. 
This time it is for special crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is in addition to the millions of dollars being 
collected by government from farmers in the name of cost 
recovery.  Farmers are paying twice for the increasing number of 
services they need: once through their taxes and again through 
cost recovery.  These are some of the problems we see with these 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caucus urges the minister to scrap his plans for this 
negative option insurance plan in the special crops industry.  I 
will read with great alarm some material from the minister's 
office dated November 7, 1997.  Page 4 of that document reads 
“The insurance plan could serve as a model for standard crops in 
the future and could lead to a producer funded insurance system 
for all crops produced in western Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than listening to the opposition to the plan, the 
minister seems to feel it is some kind of model or prototype he 
would like to expand from special crops to standard crops in the 
future.  This is seriously alarming to our caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sincerely hope the minister is not planning to extend his 
special crops insurance plan to all grains in western Canada. 
Surely he cannot be so out of touch that he would propose an 
entirely producer funded and negative option insurance program on 
all grains.  If the minister attempts to do this we suggest that 
he will face an out and out revolt by farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 repeals the Grain Futures Act which clears the way for 
the Manitoba Securities Commission to assume responsibility for 
regulating the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange. The exchange wants to 
trade commodities other than grains and wants the regulatory 
system to reflect this reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a logical request.  It is time for the province of 
Manitoba to be given power to regulate the exchange rather than 
have it done by the Canadian Grain Commission as the case has 
been.  We support this part of the legislation but it is 
unfortunately bundled with a larger legislative package that we 
cannot accept in its present form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he introduced Bill C-26 last December the minister said 
that it would provide a boon to rural economic development.  I do 
not believe that a negative option insurance program will create 
rural economic development.  Nothing in the arguments put forward 
by the government to date has altered that point of view on our 
part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look beyond the bill and ask what the government is doing 
to promote rural Canada.  We need to look no further than the 
budget that was introduced in the House on February 24.  The 
budget speech was entirely silent on agriculture.  It is 
significant to note that the minister spoke for 90 minutes and 
did not once utter the word agriculture.  I find that very 
revealing.  In a 275 page budget document which was tabled as he 
spoke there were a mere 16 lines about rural Canada.  Most of 
that space was devoted to reminding us that the minister had 
provided additional money to the Farm Credit Corporation, not 
this year but last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only current agricultural spending mentioned in the budget 
speech is $20 million spread over five years throughout several 
government departments.  The federal government spending in 
support of the agriculture and agri-food sector has declined 
drastically throughout this decade.  This year's budget confirms 
even further cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are dismantling rural Canada, closing post offices 
and allowing the railways to double freight rates on grain and to 
tear up their branchlines.  They have forgotten rural Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might ask what the minister of agriculture has been doing to 
represent the interests of rural Canadians at the cabinet table. 
The answer would appear to be not very much.  Now he is promoting 
a negative option insurance plan as a project for rural 
development.  Not only that.  He is saying he might extend such a 
plan to cover all grains grown and marketed in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all of this the minister is trying to pass Bill C-26 off as a 
mere housekeeping bill.  It is much more than that.  Unless there 
are significant changes to the bill we will work against it and 
we will vote against it.

rise on a point of order.  There have been discussions with 
representatives of all parties and I believe you would find 
consent for the following motion: 
<A NAME="LINK168">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, at the conclusion of today's debate on a motion for second 
reading of Bill C-26, the question shall be deemed put and 
adopted on division. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The House has heard 
the motion.  Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, before I go home for the weekend I want to correct the 
concept we heard from the government side regarding dynamic rural 
communities and dynamic agriculture and that somehow they were 
building rural communities.  In the area in which I live nothing 
could be further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen villages disappear.  Towns will soon disappear. 
Elevators are being bulldozed.  Railroads are being torn up. Just 
to show how undynamic it is, seven farms were auctioned off the 
last weekend I was home.  Four of them had young people in the 
same family that could take over the farm but because of the 
bleak agricultural outlook which has been brought on by the 
government opposite they are say no way.  This is happening all 
over Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for Bill C-26 is that farmers are trying to make a 
living from the traditional wheat crop.  They are trying their 
best.  They are doing everything to make a penny out of it.  The 
government, like the hon. member just said, never mentioned the 
word agriculture in the throne speech debate.  The most dynamic 
and still the major industry, not only in Saskatchewan but in 
western Canada, never received one word of mention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the government has come up with Bill C-26.  Farmers in the 
west are disillusioned.  They feel betrayed.  They have been 
betrayed by the crow rate, by the railways and by their own grain 
companies.  Farmers feel betrayed by the government.  They could 
not care less right now about Bill C-26. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they do care about is some way to pay their bills. Ranchers 
are asking for some way for them to pay for the increase of 
grazing land.  Farmers are asking for a way to return to farms 
that have been in their families for three and four generations. 
There is no hope.  The government has provided no hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the town in which I live the elevators will be gone by the 
year 2000.  The four curling rinks which surround the town have 
been closed.  The government should realize that Bill C-26 does 
not address the problem of ongoing depopulation in much of rural 
Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only compare it to another era in Saskatchewan, the dirty 
thirties when people simply gave up and moved out.  Because of 
the policies of the government and because of lack of planning by 
the government, the same thing is taking place now.  It is a 
disaster, but we have not hit the worst of it yet. The worst is 
yet to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In two years my daughter and her family will live over 80 miles 
away from the closest delivery point for grain. 
Over one-third of the cost of that ticket by the time they pay 
for the truck goes to freight.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Please, hon. parliamentary secretary, do not talk about Bill 
C-26 and its dynamics for rural Saskatchewan.  Do not tell me 
about how this great energizing is taking place in agriculture. 
The parliamentary secretary needs to go out there and look. He 
will see for himself.  Fifty-two towns had hospitals.  RMs are 
closing.  It is becoming a wasteland.  Those people who have good 
agricultural wheat producing land are going to have to sell that 
land for grazing prices and get out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a disaster.  This government comes in with Bill C-26 
which will do nothing to solve the real problem in Saskatchewan. 
I feel much better because I have said it.  I hope the people in 
my province are listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  This is a question 
and comment period.  The hon. member for Winnipeg Centre may 
comment if he wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes.  I did not hear a 
question as such, but I would like to maybe echo some of the 
sentiments I heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rural Manitoba, the province I am from is suffering from the 
depopulation, the flight of capital, the flight of families, the 
flight of people, industry, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker spoke very eloquently about this obviously 
from personal experience.  Nothing we see in this piece of 
legislation is going to stem that tide nor is it going to take 
any steps to address the issues that are really facing rural 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is significant to note that the budget did not talk about 
agriculture.  Also it has been very odd that in the eight or nine 
months I have been a rookie member of Parliament agriculture has 
been raised very, very few times. I understand a number of 
pressing issues from all across Canada compete for our interest 
but surely, in previous Parliaments, agriculture stood more front 
and centre than we see now in the House of Commons.

Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to 
address in my comments some of the concerns raised by the hon. 
member for Souris—Moose Mountain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would suggest that the hon. member for 
Souris—Moose Mountain talk to his party's agriculture critic.  I 
heard the Reform Party agriculture critic clearly say in his 
opening remarks that the Reform Party was prepared to offer 
“tentative support” for Bill C-26. Yes, the Reform Party 
agriculture critic had some concerns and some questions but he 
did say clearly at the beginning of the debate that his party was 
prepared to offer tentative support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Souris—Moose Mountain had better have a 
chat with his party's agriculture critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that Canadians, especially those who live in 
rural Canada, have the facts straight. The hon. member for 
Souris—Moose Mountain—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I believe that the hon. 
parliamentary secretary is supposed to be directing his comments 
or his question toward the hon. member from the NDP who spoke and 
not to my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Prince George—Peace River is correct.  It is the debate of the 
hon. member for Winnipeg Centre on which we are on questions and 
comments. However, the hon. member for Souris—Moose Mountain had 
a demi presentation should we say.  I felt it was very much in 
order for the parliamentary secretary to address that. The hon. 
parliamentary secretary can have 30 seconds to sum up. Then we 
will give the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre a minute in 
response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me just say that the 
hon. member for Souris—Moose Mountain was concerned about the 
rural economy.  All of us are concerned about the rural economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 which is before us now is intended to address one 
concern. 
The special crops industry on the prairies needs stimulation.  It 
needs space.  It needs an opportunity to enter into innovation. 
That is exactly what Bill C-26 is designed to do.  It will 
support the dealers.  And it will support the producers who want 
to do business with the special crops dealers.  Let us get the 
facts straight.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is nothing in the 
comments from the hon. parliamentary secretary that I would 
disagree with.  I concur 100% with his sentiments concerning 
rural Canada, however we do not believe that Bill C-26 actually 
addresses those concerns nor will it take us one step closer to 
those lofty principles. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on Bill C-26.  Our critic for this area, the hon. 
member for Brandon—Souris, could not be here today so I am 
taking his place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin with a little background on the bill.  We have 
divided it into three parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 4, 1997 the minister of agriculture tabled Bill C-26 
in the House of Commons.  The bill is composed of three parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First it would repeal the Grain Futures Act.  In essence it 
allows for the province of Manitoba through the Manitoba 
Securities Commission to regulate the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange 
instead of the federal government through the Canadian Grain 
Commission.  This is related to the Manitoba Commodities Futures 
Act which was enacted by the Manitoba government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was an idea that was suggested by the Winnipeg Commodity 
Exchange itself. The WCE wants to access the hog industry so 
instead of working with two separate regulators, the WCE will 
conduct all its business through the Manitoba Securities 
Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a positive change for the agricultural industry.  The PC 
Party will support this aspect of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second it would amend the Canada Grain Act to allow speciality 
crops such as soybeans to fall under crop insurance plans.  This 
would also permit the separation of licensing and security 
provisions for special crops dealers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government believes that the inability to separate these 
two activities has been the primary problem in developing an 
insurance plan for the special crops industry of western Canada. 
By forcing such a separation in law and by putting the 
administration of a voluntary insurance plan under the Canadian 
Grain Commission, Bill C-26 would remove the onus on special 
crops dealers to post costly security against the possibility of 
their default in payment to special crops producers. The Canadian 
Export Development Corporation, CEDC, would be the insurer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government may feel that this aspect of the bill is 
positive, there are many people in the farming community who will 
differ.  I will comment on the insurance program later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the bill will also incorporate the Canada Grain Act 
within the agriculture and agrifood industry, thereby allowing 
the Canadian Grain Commission to impose fines for most violations 
of the Canada Grain Act and its regulations.  This aspect of the 
bill also needs a closer look when the bill is sent to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of aspects of this bill that must be looked 
at closer for the House's consideration.  Before I do so I must 
mention to the government that there has been little discussion 
on this bill thus far in particular in the farming communities 
out west.  There are people in the farming communities who do not 
know anything about this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the responsibility of this government to properly inform 
Canadians about this legislation, especially when it comes from 
the House of Commons of Canada. It is the government's 
responsibility to effectively communicate to Canadians what is 
about to become law and what is going to affect their livelihood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I will comment on some of the aspects of the 
bill before this legislation goes before committee.  I will 
comment on some of the thoughts expressed by the farming 
organizations out west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A resolution was passed at the Saskatchewan Canola Growers 
Association annual meeting. Similar motions were also passed at 
the Western Canadian Wheat Growers convention, the Western Barley 
Growers convention and the Saskatchewan Pulse Development Board. 
The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the majority of Saskatchewan Canola Growers Association 
members also are growers of specialty crops; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the proposed Special Crops Rural Initiative Program 
would appear to favour the Canadian Grain Commission and not 
necessarily special crop growers; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Special Crops Rural Initiative Program is promoted 
as being voluntary, it is in reality a form of negative billing 
which all consumers reject (i.e. cable TV companies); and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the scheme has questionable support at the farm level; 
and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Saskatchewan Canola Growers Association rejects the 
compulsory nature of the Special Crops Rural Initiative Program; 
and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the special crops industry has flourished without such a 
program; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore be it resolved that the Saskatchewan Canola Growers 
Association inform the federal and western provincial ministers 
of agriculture of their concerns and at the very least that the 
Special Crops Rural Initiative Program be truly voluntary for 
both the growers and the special crops dealers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This resolution aptly describes what Bill C-26 fails to do.  It 
fails to give farmers choice, not unlike what the government did 
with Bill C-4 which failed to give farmers choice in how they 
sell their wheat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The compulsory nature of the special crops insurance plan is a 
form of negative option billing. Today's producers run large 
operations and should not have to apply to opt out and then 
receive their money back if they do not wish to participate. 
Farming businesses should have the right to decide themselves if 
they want to be bonded or licensed and if so, pay the bill 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 only adds more red tape and paperwork for farmers to 
be subjected to while placing extra costs on farm businesses 
already operating on small budgets.  Producers should have the 
choice to decide for themselves if there is too much risk selling 
to an unlicensed buyer.  Special crops producers would be better 
off having the choice between selling to large licensed grain 
dealers and small unlicensed grain dealers.  That would make 
sense.  I hope the government considers giving farmers this 
choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of elements of this bill which need to be 
looked at closer.  I expect that the committee will look into the 
bill in great detail when it does the clause by clause analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle the PC Party supports this legislation.  However, 
there are a number of changes that will have to be adopted at the 
committee stage with respect to choice before this bill is 
acceptable in full to the PC Party of Canada and to the farmers 
of western Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to make a couple of comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier the parliamentary secretary in referring to some 
comments made by my hon. colleague from Souris—Moose Mountain 
tried to leave the impression with the viewing audience that 
perhaps there was some division or contradiction in the position 
that I took versus that of my colleague the Reform member for 
Souris—Moose Mountain. I can assure the House and those viewing 
this debate at home today that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we have given this bill some very tentative support at 
this point, my hon. colleague from Souris—Moose Mountain was 
merely, as I and others in the opposition have done today, 
pointing out some very serious concerns our parties have with 
this legislation.  We all have the hope that the government will 
respond, unlike with C-4, and actually give this bill a good 
hearing in committee and possibly make some amendments to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note the PC member who just spoke also referred to the need 
for some amendments and changes before his party will support it 
any further than the position the bill is at right now, which is 
to refer the bill after second reading to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member referred to the compulsory nature of the check-off, 
the levy that is inherent in Bill C-26.  This reminds me of the 
compulsory nature in the way the Canadian Wheat Board operates 
where farmers do not have the freedom to choose how they are 
going to market their wheat and export barley.  It is the same 
case in C-26.  Farmers are not going to have the choice of 
whether or not to have this check-off come off their cheques. The 
levy will be deducted and then they have to jump through a bunch 
of hoops before they can get the money back at the end of the 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It almost reminds one of the inclusion clause in Bill C-4 
whereby the new board of directors for the Canadian Wheat Board 
is going to have the option of expanding the compulsory and 
mandatory nature of the Canadian Wheat Board to encompass and 
include other commodities.

Conservative Party.  He may have heard as well as I that there is 
some concern among farmers about comments made by the Canadian 
Grain Commission.  There is concern that it may expand this levy 
not only to those designated special crops, but at some point in 
time to include wheat, barley, canola and flax which are all 
major commodities, thereby removing the government's 
responsibility for ensuring bonds and insurance coverage by the 
grain companies and putting added financial burden on to the 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, those are some excellent 
questions from the member for Prince George—Peace River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been a number of sticky points in this piece of 
legislation.  Bill C-26 offers some promise, but as the hon. 
member already mentioned, the inclusion clause, as it exists in 
Bill C-4, the fear of such a clause being utilized in this act 
and the fear of other grain commodities coming under this 
legislation are all very important issues for the Progressive 
Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has tentative support.  The bill has merit.  If we go 
through it clause by clause it has a perfect chance of becoming a 
good law of the Government of Canada.  However, several serious 
changes need to be made to the bill before it gets to that point.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to make 
two very short comments.  We have made a very good start today, 
an excellent start.  We have tentative support from the official 
opposition.  We have support in principle from the Progressive 
Conservative Party.  That is a pretty good start.  This would be a 
very good juncture to move the bill to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Pursuant to order 
made earlier today the question on the motion is deemed to have 
been put and adopted on division. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and referred to 
a committee) 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  For our friends in 
the visitors gallery and those who are watching on television, I 
am about to ask the House for permission to see the clock at 2.30 
p.m. which is our normal time of adjournment.  What we are doing 
is allowing the House to adjourn at its normal time.  This is 
because Private Members' Business has been deferred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we have unanimous consent to see the clock as reading 2.30 
p.m.? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It being 2.30 p.m., 
the House stands adjourned until Monday next at 11 a.m., pursuant 
to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 1.02 p.m.)
