indeed my honour to present three petitions pursuant to Standing 
Order 36. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners from various cities and towns in British

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the second 
petition, a very lengthy petition and signed by members of the 
city of Kamloops as well as, interestingly, Fredericton, New 
Brunswick, points out a whole set of arguments against the MAI 
and simply calls on Parliament to urge the government to reject 
the current framework of MAI negotiations and instructs the 
government to seek an entirely different agreement by which the 
world might achieve a rules based global trading regime that 
protects workers, the environment and the ability of government 
to act in the public interest.

terms of what this retirement package could include, going on

Standing Order 36, I am pleased to lay before this House a petition 
signed by 71 residents of the riding of Charlevoix, and the municipality 
of Saint-Aimé-des-Lacs in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This petition contains the signatures of the mayor, fire chief, 
councillors, volunteer firefighters and citizens of the municipality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Volunteer firefighters often represent a community's only 
firefighting force. Not once since 1980 has there been an increase in 
the tax exemption for expenses incurred in discharging their duties.

exemption on volunteer firefighters' expense allowance from $500 to 
$1,000.

a petition from scores of citizens in the Peterborough area who 
are concerned about the continuing existence of nuclear weapons. 
These petitioners believe these pose a threat to the health 
and survival of human civilization and the global environment.

initiation and conclusion by the year 2000 of an international

another petition from some hundreds of citizens of the 
Peterborough area who are concerned that the people of Iraq have 
suffered untold hardship in the wake of the gulf war and 
subsequent sanctions with an estimated death toll of a million 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners call on the Parliament of Canada to reject the 
military option against Iraq and, in conjunction with those 
nations already committed to the non-military route, to patiently 
pursue diplomatic efforts toward solving the present impasse.

am pleased to present a petition signed by a number of Canadians, 
including Canadians from my own riding of Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that our 
police officers and firefighters are required to place their 
lives at risk on a daily basis as they discharge their duties and 
that when one of them loses their life in the line of duty, we 
all mourn that loss.  Often the employment benefits they have do 
not often provide adequately for their surviving families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to 
establish a public safety officers compensation fund for the 
benefit of police officers and firefighters killed in the line of 
duty.

Speaker, I was starting to think I should wave a flag to get recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am tabling a petition signed by 1,298 citizens of the riding of 
Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans and elsewhere in Quebec, who consider 
that using natural substances like herbs, plants, vitamins and minerals 
should be a free choice made by consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also consider that health professionals such as naturopaths, 
herbalists, phytotherapists, homeopaths and acupuncturists are trained 
to advise their clients on these natural products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These petitioners ask that the Government of Canada not restrict in 
any way the quantity or dosage of plants, herbs, vitamins, minerals and 
trace elements, so as to preserve the consumers' right to choose how to 
care for their own health and prevent disease and to consult with any 
alternative or allopathic health professionals they see fit.

a number of petitions to present this morning from a number of 
communities in my riding, Niverville, Steinbach and the Grunthal 
area, all dealing with the same subject matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are concerned about amendments to section 43 of the 
Criminal Code dealing primarily with the discipline of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is their view that the rights of parents are to be protected 
under these circumstances, that the best interests of the 
children are protected by parents and not the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I conclude on their behalf by saying therefore the 
petitioners request Parliament to affirm the duty of parents to 
responsibly raise their children according to their own 
conscience and beliefs and to retain section 43 in Canada's 
Criminal Code as it is currently worded.

presenting to this House a petition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This petition asks for the very prudent review of the mandate of 
the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission, 
the CRTC, to discourage the provocation of pornography and rather 
to encourage the broadcasting of ecclesiastical programming to 
support morality and wholesome family lifestyles.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA SHIPPING ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK41">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (for Minister of Transport, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-15, an act to amend the Canada Shipping Act and to 
make consequential amendments to other acts, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to Bill C-15, 
an act to amend the Canada Shipping Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will bring about much needed change to the principal 
legislation governing the shipping industry. It is the beginning 
of a two track overhaul that promises an up to date modern 
statute to benefit the marine sector in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transportation industry is a vital component of our economy. 
As we know, the marine industry operates in the context of an 
international and domestic environment which provides 
considerable challenges and opportunities for Canadians.  The 
industry and related services employ more than 400,000 Canadians 
and contributes more than $20 billion to our gross domestic 
product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every work day 2.3 million tonnes of freight are on the move in 
Canada.  A substantial amount of work has been done in an effort 
to modernize the national transportation system to meet the 
demands of a global marketplace and prepare this sector for the 
coming century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to achieve these objectives the government has pursued 
a number of initiatives in all modes particularly in the area of 
streamlining regulations and legislation.  It will become 
increasingly difficult for Canada to compete in the international 
market unless we pursue transportation policies that are 
consistent with other nations with whom we trade and compete. 
This is a significant reality for the shipping industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Shipping Act is the foremost piece of safety 
legislation governing the marine sector.  It is also one of the 
oldest pieces of Canadian legislation.  It has not been renewed 
since it was enacted in 1936 and is beginning to show its age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When enacted in 1936 this legislation was based on 1896 British 
merchant shipping law.  Still today it contains outdated 
provisions for such things, if you can imagine, as a $10 fine for 
being drunk, or providing a ship's master with the authority to 
auction off a dead sailor's belongings.  That is in that 
legislation. The Canada shipping community of course deserves 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The complete reform of the Canada Shipping Act is being 
undertaken with the following three goals in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One, to simplify the legislation by replacing outdated 
terminology using everyday language, harmonizing with other 
regimes and taking out excessively prescriptive details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two, to make the act consistent with federal regulatory 
policies.  These policies reduce reliance on regulations and 
permit alternative approaches such as compliance agreements, 
performance standards and voluntary industry codes which are much 
more consistent with today's regulatory practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three, to contribute to the economic performance of the marine 
industry.  By reducing prescriptive elements and the 
administrative burden imposed by current legislation, industry 
will have increased flexibility in maintaining the travelling 
public's safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is committed to action.  Our determination to 
reform the Canada Shipping Act is heavily influenced by 
industry's continued support for modern shipping legislation. 
Previous attempts to revitalize this legislation during the 
seventies were protracted and did not accomplish the necessary 
changes. With industry support this time the government cannot 
help but succeed in making these essential changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this juncture I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
those in the marine industry for their ongoing input and support 
of this initiative.  Their feedback during consultations not only 
helped direct this project but also will go a long way to 
ensuring the future success of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier our approach to reform is in fact a two 
track process.  The first track has evolved into Bill C-15 and 
enables us to achieve desired changes by adding a new 
introduction to the act and updating part I, which primarily 
deals with ship registration and ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new introduction to the Canada Shipping Act will modernize the 
statute and provide direction and focus for the remainder of the 
legislation. 
In addition, this introductory section will provide a general 
framework for the rest of the act.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed introduction clarifies basic ministerial 
responsibilities reflecting the reorganization of the Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans and Transport Canada and provides 
umbrella authorities for consulting with stakeholders, issuing 
directives and responding to emergency marine situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new preamble will make the Canada Shipping Act simpler and 
clearer to understand.  The minister and I have had the 
opportunity to meet with many stakeholders.  We have learned that 
it is the marine community itself which requested that the Canada 
Shipping Act contain a preamble which states up front the overall 
objectives of the act, as is often done with other pieces of 
modern legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes in Bill C-15 begin the modernization and 
streamlining of a statute that is in much need of an overhaul to 
eliminate the confusion and complexity it currently perpetuates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments in the bill will modernize the Canadian 
ship registration system by allowing for the introduction of an 
electronic ship registry system which can be more easily 
maintained.  This is a futuristic departure from the current 
paper log system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we have outstanding marine legislation on the agenda from 
the last session of Parliament, we have included several 
important provisions of former Bill C-73.  Other provisions will 
be incorporated into the second track of the reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the urgent items from former Bill C-73 includes 
amendments to the Quebec harbour pilots pension plan. In recent 
years there has been an extensive overhaul of the administration 
of pension plans.  One plan not affected by this overhaul was the 
pension fund administered by the Corporation of Pilots for and 
below the harbour of Quebec.  This initiative will bring some 
recognition to this plan and improve the protection of rights for 
members belonging to this plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes will make affected pensioners subject to recent 
legislative initiatives rather than rules which predate 
Confederation.  It will also improve the corporation's ability to 
manage the pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This two track approach is a beneficial way to proceed since it 
shows immediate progress on reforms in the first track while 
allowing departmental officials to continue the momentum in 
completing the second track of the reform. This approach has been 
taken to demonstrate the government's interest and competence to 
make quick, genuine and responsive progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to stress that the government is sensitive to 
concerns raised by stakeholders and quite frankly, members of 
Parliament on this side and that side of the House, pertaining to 
small craft or pleasure craft licensing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Transport gives his assurance that he is open to 
suggestions on improving the legislation at committee stage. In 
fact, he has even gone so far as to say we are going to be 
removing certain clauses in the bill at committee stage, 
particularly those dealing with the pleasure craft or small craft 
licensing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and I, having looked at the bill and these 
particular clauses, feel that improvements can be made and should 
be made.  That comes to us from the stakeholders and members of 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada's legislative initiatives remain consistent 
with the overall federal transportation framework which 
emphasizes a national vision of safety, security, efficiency and 
environmental responsibility.  These are the changes that the 
minister and I would like members' support in order to realize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my belief that Bill C-15 will help ensure that Canada's 
shipping industry has the necessary tools to operate effectively 
in the 21st century. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this new legislation which is listed as an amendment to part I of 
the Canada Marine Act is actually a replacement.  Much of the old 
act cannot be traced in the new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question the existing act is obsolete.  It was after 
all passed in 1936 when Canadian vessels were defined as British, 
when records were kept in ledgers and when prescribed fees for 
certain documents and government services were in the 25 cent to 
$1 range. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform cannot express opposition or support for this highly 
technical bill until we have heard from industry representatives 
in a committee.  This is especially true since we anticipate that 
the government has already drafted amendments which will be 
introduced at committee stage. 
It is our understanding that the government proposes to remove 
some problematic changes proposed with respect to the regulation 
of small vessels. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT6"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT6"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1025

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill contains two and a half full columns describing things 
which may in the future be regulated by governor in council with 
no reference to Parliament.  There was a lot of this in the old 
act, but Bill C-15 confers wider ranging powers to the governor 
in council to regulate registration, the marking of vessels, 
fees, fines and licences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would give the governor in council almost unlimited 
power over specifications for the manufacturing or modification 
of small vessels.  Hopefully that will be one aspect of the bill 
which the government proposes to withdraw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The replacement part I will modernize the ship registration 
system.  For example, the proposal to allow foreign owned vessels 
bare-boat chartered to Canadian entities to be registered as 
Canadian ships makes sense.  Conversely, Canadian ships bare-boat 
chartered to a foreign lessee will be barred from flying the 
Canadian flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 gives Transport Canada full authority and 
responsibility for ship registration and related activities 
currently performed by Canada Customs.  Another quaint Canadian 
custom is being eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course it would not be a Liberal bill without bestowing upon 
the minister another juicy patronage plum to be handed out.  In 
this case Bill C-15 empowers the Minister of Transport to appoint 
a chief registrar who will be responsible for establishing a 
Canadian register of ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be mandatory registration for all Canadian owned 
ships exceeding 15 tonnes gross tonnage and not registered in a 
foreign country.  The register will record the name and 
description of the ship, its official number, its tonnage, its 
owner's name and address, and the details of all its registered 
mortgages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief registrar will have the authority to establish the 
criteria for applying for registration and will be required to 
approve the name of a ship.  Canadians can rest easy because Bill 
C-15 gives the minister the authority to order that a name be 
changed if he believes the name would prejudice Canada's 
international reputation.  No risqué innuendoes will be allowed 
in either official language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The registry certainly needs updating.  There are currently 
45,000 entries on the ship registry, which is a physical 
impossibility.  There are not that many vessels in Canadian 
waters. Bill C-15 will enable suspension and closure of registry 
entries, so inactive and bygone ships can be taken off the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, there were no provisions in the antiquated Canada 
Shipping Act for an electronic registry, meaning that the whole 
thing had to be on paper.  Now the nation's ships, like its 
citizens, will be objects of computerized lists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The registration of a Canadian ship could be cancelled or 
suspended due to improper markings, expiration of the certificate 
of registry and a ship's loss, wreck or removal from service. 
Ships can be reinstated too.  A certificate of registry will have 
to be on board a ship in order for the ship to operate.  Don't 
leave home without your licence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current CSA certificates of registration do not 
expire.  Section 53(2) would keep certificates in place for up to 
three years in order to provide a transitional period during 
which ships can be brought under the new rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 continues the tradition observed in most maritime 
nations, except the U.S., that a ship be divided into 64 shares. 
The custom is variously attributed to the fact that ships 
traditionally had 64 ribs or the fact that under Queen Victoria 
shipowners were taxed 36% and were allowed to keep the remaining 
64%. Now we have progressed to the point that in Canada millions 
of ordinary folk have to hand over fully half of their incomes to 
three levels of government.  Under Queen Victoria they had 
taxation; under king Jean we have predation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will continue to appoint tonnage measures to 
calculate a ship's tonnage.  Shipowners and shipbuilders will 
continue to be allowed to mortgage their ships and have that 
mortgage placed on the register. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is a change in ownership, owners of Canadian ships 
will be required to notify the chief registrar.  If an 
unqualified person acquires a ship, an application for redress 
could be made to a court. 
For the record, a qualified person means a Canadian citizen, or 
permanent resident, or a company incorporated in Canada, or a 
province.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old CSA exempts from annual inspections ships not in excess 
of five tonnes gross tonnage carrying more than 12 passengers and 
are not pleasure boats. Bill C-15 would raise that limit to ships 
not in excess of 15 tonnes gross tonnage.  However, inspectors 
will be able to conduct spot checks on these vessels.  It is not 
clear to me if this is an area in which the government now plans 
to change in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 grants the governor in council the power to make 
regulations to prevent pollution resulting from the discharge of 
ballast water, thereby reducing the risk of oil spills in 
Canada's waters, including the Arctic.  We already have zebra 
mussels and lamprey eels in the Great Lakes.  Perhaps these 
regulations will be prevent future ecological disasters.  The 
current requirement for ships to have on board an oil pollution 
prevention plan will be extended to shore based loading and 
unloading facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Retired members of this fund, the  St. Lawrence pilot pension, 
are subject to an act over 100 years old and to the antiquated 
internal rules of the corporation of pilots.  Bill C-15 would 
redefine the pilot fund, recognize the plan as a registered 
pension plan, make the Pension Benefits Standards Act of 1995 
apply, define the status of the plan with regard to the Income 
Tax Act and allow the governor in council to make regulations to 
carry out this part of the legislation.  Of course, these pilots 
will continue to rip off Canadian shippers and grain producers 
but that relates to legislation other than to Bill C-15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On balance, this seems to be a good housekeeping bill but the 
Reform Party will have to hear from the stakeholders before 
passing judgment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will start by saying that I am pleased to speak on Bill 
C-15.  I would love to start my speech, particularly since I have 
40 minutes, by saying: C-15 at last! 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 was first read on October 30, 1997.  I am not going 
to cry over spilt milk.  I am pleased to see it back on the order 
paper.  But it took nearly nine months of gestation before the 
government could produce a bouncing baby bill for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it was presented for first reading, this bill contained 
certain irritants as far as we are concerned, and I shall return 
later to this point. 
My speech will not have a negative tone—on the contrary. This bill 
contains several worthwhile elements which the Canadian shipping 
industry has been demanding for years, if not decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want you to think that I am going to start off on a 
negative tack, but one does have to be realistic.  What I have to 
say is based on what we have before us in Bill C-15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will return in a few minutes to certain commitments made by 
the hon. member for Hamilton West, the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Transport, commitments which, if they ever 
materialize, could make agreement in committee and during debate at 
third reading much easier to reach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, which is called an Act to amend the Canada 
Shipping Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, 
the Government of Canada has undertaken a total revision of the 
Canada Shipping Act, which dates back to early in this century.  It 
ought, therefore, to be brought up to date and into line with the 
way things are done in world shipping circles in this day and age. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, in this respect, Transport Canada showed us that it 
considered this legislation out of date, too restrictive and 
confusing as it stood and it initiated the current reform.  As I 
mentioned earlier, this law is no longer relevant to the needs and 
modern development of shipping.  Bill C-15 before us could be 
described as serving essentially to modernize an old law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will work hard in committee, even though I said we would be 
very co-operative.  The Bloc Quebecois considers that the aim of 
this bill is to simplify legislation. 
Another aim is to make the law compatible with the federal 
government's regulatory policy.  A third aim we discovered involves 
contributing to the financial performance of the shipping industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipping is vital to a country like Canada and to a future 
country like Quebec, which have oceans as borders and navigable 
waterways.  We in Quebec have a road to the sea—the St. Lawrence 
Seaway—which crosses the entire province.  So it is important to 
have legislation that reflects economic imperatives.  In terms of 
economic development, shipping is vital.  I will come back to this 
later, in any case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Primary responsibility for this bill lies with Transport 
Canada, although the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has an 
important role to play. 
A few years ago, in 1995 or 1996, I believe, responsibility for the 
Canadian Coast Guard was transferred from Transport Canada to the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans.  The fleets of the coast guard 
and of the department were amalgamated.  However, given that 
shipping remains the responsibility of Transport Canada,  the roles 
of the two departments are very closely interrelated.  We can see, 
in the bill, that the role of the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now look at the main features of this reform.  Among 
other things, it sets out to assign responsibility for electronic 
registration of ships and related activities to Transport Canada, 
and responsibility for registration of pleasure craft to the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans.  I will return to registration 
of pleasure craft later in my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another feature of this reform is the possibility of renewing 
ships' certificates of registry.  An additional feature is the new 
optional registry for certain foreign ships subject to a financing 
agreement and those that are bare-boat chartered, in other words, 
that have no crew outside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final feature of this bill, and one of the most important, 
concerns a particular category of employees.  I am talking about 
the modernization of the administrative and financial frameworks of 
the pension plan administered by the Corporation of the Lower St. 
Lawrence Pilots serving the port of Quebec City and below.  It was 
partly for these St. Lawrence pilots that my “at last” was intended 
earlier.  As is well known, this professional corporation has been 
waiting a long time for this reform of its pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rapidly, the background to this bill, as the parliamentary 
secretary and the Reform member for Edmonton mentioned, is that it 
is an amended version of earlier Bill C-73, which made it only as 
far as first reading, on December 9, 1996, and which died on the 
<I>Order Paper</I> when the federal election was called in April 1997.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the parliamentary secretary indicated, this bill is part of a 
complete overhaul of the Canada Shipping Act, in partnership with the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans. More specifically, Bill C-15 is the 
first component of the first part. The second component, which will 
parallel the first one, will consist in a series of amendments which, 
based on our information, should be drafted and ready by the spring 
of 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now look at the Bloc Quebecois' position regarding certain 
parts of the legislation. As I said, the bill provides for a sharing of 
responsibilities between Transport Canada and the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the face of it, this idea does not present any problems. 
However, there are certain parts—and hopefully this issue will be 
resolved by the time the bill reaches third reading—which deserve 
very careful attention on our part, and on the part of taxpayers and 
certain groups. You will see in a moment to whom I am referring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we alerting public opinion about this legislation? Last 
year, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans held consultations. We know 
how this is done. The government floats trial balloons, but it has a 
very good idea of what it wants to do. 
Since its foundation in 1990, and including during the 1993 Parliament 
when it formed the official opposition and since the new contingent of 
44 members arrived in 1997, the Bloc Quebecois has demonstrated its will 
to respect democracy on a number of occasions, and not just during the 
recent flag incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the government, in its desire to respect democracy, 
undertakes vast consultations that cost tens and even hundreds of 
thousands of dollars. However, these consultations are sometimes 
a sham because—and this is what I started saying earlier, this 
is what is good about democracy—whether we like it or not, the 
government is elected to govern, which means it is there to make 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not keep it from making stupid or arbitrary decisions. 
Such is our role in opposition, to act as watchdogs, to be 
vigilant.  I call upon the public to be vigilant as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I referred to consultations, broad consultations, last 
year Fisheries and Oceans, via the Coast Guard, carried out 
consultations on instituting a fee system for pleasure craft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is serious.  There is no longer any reference in Bill 
C-15 to pleasure craft.  In the second reading version of C-15 we 
have before us here, there is a reference to “vessels”.  I met with 
Department of Transport officials who confirmed to me that the Bloc 
Quebecois definition of this term, an extremely broad one, was 
included in this bill. 
There was a plan to include that definition in Bill C-15, which we 
have before us, or in other words to institute a system of fees for 
pleasure craft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was clear that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans was 
using Transport Canada to deliver the bad news.  It was clear that 
the government wanted to assume the right, give itself the 
possibility of registering pleasure craft and charging registration 
fees.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, only those with motors of 10 HP or more 
have to obtain registration and this is issued free of charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked specific questions of senior Transport officials, 
the government never denied this.  The Bloc Quebecois is of the 
opinion that the intent behind this measure is to impose mandatory 
registration for all kinds of vessels.  One can easily conclude 
that such a measure will lead to a form of fee setting by 
government, once again making some degree of cost-recovery 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois does not object to the logic of requiring 
certain types of motor boat, big motor boats, what people call 
cruisers—my colleague from Berthier—Montcalm should give me a 
hand—boats with motors over ten horsepower— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Outboard motors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Outboard motors.  That's right. The Bloc 
Quebecois is not opposed to having big boats registered.  However, 
with this provision—and that is where it makes no sense, and 
they never convinced me otherwise—they wanted to force people to 
license and pay fees for pedal boats, rowboats and the flat bottom 
boats used in wildlife sanctuaries, in northern Quebec, northern 
Ontario, northern Manitoba and the riding of my NDP colleague from 
Churchill, who sits with me on the Standing Committee on Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They wanted to charge a fee to register pedal boats, flat 
bottom boats, rowboats and sailboards.  This is absolutely 
scandalous.  I said to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Transport and member for Hamilton West—he is here and cannot 
contradict me on this “You are making a huge mistake.  You will be 
charging people for services they are not getting”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In northern Quebec, around Mistassini, north of there, in 
Abitibi, north of Schefferville and in all the little spots where 
the coast guard has no jurisdiction, the government wanted to force 
people to pay a fee.  That is totally crazy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I direct my remarks to all hunters and fishers in Quebec and 
everywhere in Canada. 
I tell them to watch out.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Transport and member for Hamilton West said in his 
speech—I wrote down what he said—“We will be removing certain 
clauses in the bill, particularly those dealing with pleasure craft 
licensing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc does not criticize for the pleasure of it.  When the 
government uses its head and is reasonable, when it listens to our 
arguments and accepts them and when it uses common sense, we are 
obliged to recognize it and support its action.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I took note of the commitment made by the parliamentary secretary 
to the Minister of Transport. I hope he will act on this commitment in 
committee and withdraw these provisions of the bill, which are an 
absolute aberration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have come to know me since 1993, and I am the kind of person 
who believes greatly in fair play. I have a background in labour 
relations. I have worked with labour unions. We have been forced to sit 
down and talk things out on a number of occasions, but when we were 
done, we always concluded our meetings with a handshake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This to tell the hon. parliamentary secretary that, if he keeps his 
word and does what he publicly committed to do, we will agree to 
complete second reading, consideration in committee, and to pass this 
bill at third reading. I give him my party's word on this. However, I 
want to make sure that the parliamentary secretary will hold his end of 
the bargain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I urged all hunters and fishers in Quebec and Canada to 
watch out, as well as all recreational boaters and anyone who has a 
cottage 15 or 20 kilometres away from their ordinary place of residence, 
has a small craft or canoe and enjoys a leisurely ride on the lake after 
dinner with the wife and kids or the family mutt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is when the government realized I hope it made no sense to 
charge a fee to these people, to start asking them to register a paddle 
boat, a canoe or other small craft in areas not even patrolled by the 
coast guard. 
Investigators would have had to be hired to take an inventory of all 
these crafts, which would have cost more than the fees collected. The 
government acted sensibly and paid attention to our representations, I 
am grateful for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, people should watch out. The government may try again, 
differently, under the cover of a different bill. This government can 
hide things from any of us. As it stands, this fee has been lifted, or 
so they said, but we must remain vigilant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore I find it unfortunate that there is nothing in this 
bill on shipping, an important industry, to encourage shipbuilding. The 
Bloc Quebecois will have to think up a strategy in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, Quebec is the only province that streamlined its 
shipyards. Before the Conservatives came to power in 1984, we had three 
shipyards in Quebec. 
The Conservatives said we had to streamline our shipyards' operations in 
order to be competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec closed two of Canada's three largest shipyards. It agreed to 
shut down Canadian Vickers, in Montreal, and MIL, in Sorel, and to keep 
only the MIL Davie shipyard, in Lévis, across from Quebec City, and some 
other very successful shipyards that can compete on the international 
market. These include the Verreault shipyard, in Les Méchins, and Mr. 
Hamel's shipyard, on l'Île-aux-Coudres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, Quebec is the only province to have acted thus. Before the 
Conservatives came to office, Quebec accounted for 50% of Canada's 
shipbuilding activities. Following the streamlining exercise that took 
place under the Conservatives, Quebec now accounts for only 33% of 
shipbuilding activities in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is deplorable is that, while Quebec was streamlining its 
shipbuilding activities, the Conservatives gave subsidies to help open 
about 10 shipyards in the maritimes, including St. Mary's, in 
Newfoundland. That shipyard could not even complete the construction of 
drilling rigs, which it began some years ago, and it had to send them to 
St. John Shipbuilding or to Halifax. 
This is a double standard, with one treatment for Quebec and another one 
for the rest of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this took place under the Conservatives. I could give examples 
of things that happened under the Liberals, but 40 minutes is not long 
enough to do so. The bottom line is: Conservative or Liberal, it is six 
of one and half a dozen of the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We reserve the right to move amendments to encourage shipbuilding. 
There are people in Quebec who have clear ideas on the issue. We already 
had the opportunity to meet Mrs. Verreault, from the Verreault 
Navigation shipyard, in Les Méchins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have liked the federal government to follow the 
Government of Quebec's lead.  The Quebec government's budget, 
brought down by Bernard Landry on May 9, 1996, if memory serves, 
contained tax incentives for ship building in Quebec.  But there is 
nothing from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before wrapping up, I am going to go back to something I 
mentioned earlier, something I am happy to repeat.  This bill 
modernizes the administrative and financial frameworks of the 
pension plan administered by the Corporation of Lower St. Lawrence 
Pilots for and below the Harbour of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pilots' groups had long called for this.  Bloc Quebecois 
members can only indicate our approval of this provision.  I do not 
think the pilots were asking for charity.  Maritime pilots, 
particularly those on the Lower St. Lawrence whom I know a bit 
better, are proud folks. 
They are professionals, people who like their work, who are 
concerned about maritime safety and the environment.  What they 
were asking for was not charity.  All they wanted was for their pension 
plan to move into the next century.  This was an old provision that 
needed to be updated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I note the undertakings given by the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport and member for 
Hamilton West—now there is a long title—and I want to repeat that 
we will co-operate in committee, if he does as he says.  I have no 
reason to think he will do otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will even go a bit further.  I offer the government the 
opportunity to skip the recorded vote on this bill.  If there is 
agreement, we could, at the end of debate this morning, deem the 
bill agreed to on division at second reading, which would move 
things ahead more quickly and allow this bill to be referred to 
committee as soon as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak against Bill C-15, an act to amend the Canada 
Shipping Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts 
brought forward by the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party agree that it is time to bring 
some clarification to the Canada Shipping Act.  We have all heard 
that the shipping act is second only in size and complexity to 
the Income Tax Act and could use some updating.  However, the 
government is also taking this opportunity to bring forward some 
amendments that have raised concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the New Democrats believe it is time to reform the 
Canada Shipping Act.  Bill C-15 intends to do just that by adding 
a preamble to the Canada Shipping Act to clarify its objectives, 
definitions and interpretations, and to lay out the roles and 
responsibilities of the ministers of transport and fisheries and 
oceans.  Currently there is no introductory part to the Canada 
Shipping Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that ministerial accountabilities must be 
clarified.  Reoganization of the departments of the coast guard, 
fisheries and oceans and transport has resulted in a lack of 
clarity within the shipping act regarding ministerial 
responsibilities.  There is need to clarify those 
responsibilities, those of the Minister of Transport and the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, and to provide clear 
legislative authorities for the operation of their departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions have been raised with regard to that response.  I will 
note some of these questions and concerns.  Why are the powers 
divided between the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of 
Fisheries and Oceans? 
These powers have already been divided.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it now stands, the Department of Transport is responsible for 
ship safety, but the Canadian coast guard is in the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans. The result is that when ship safety 
officers from the Canadian coast guard have to board vessels, two 
departments, transport and fisheries and oceans, have to be 
involved, unless ship safety instead goes to the Department of 
Justice and travels to RCMP vessels or goes to the defence 
department and uses military vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was brought to my attention that Bill C-15 replicates the 
wording of a certain international marine centre.  In a paper, 
the executive director of that centre wrote about the primary 
elements to achieve competitiveness in international shipping: 
tax free status at the corporate level, a flexible manning regime 
and the application of ship safety standards that are genuinely 
international.  I cannot help but feel worried that Bill C-15 
could replicate the wording of this centre.  A tax free status at 
the corporate level sounds familiar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it calls for a flexible manning regime.  What exactly 
does that mean?  I am almost afraid to ask.  It is common 
knowledge that sailors' human rights are often violated on 
foreign vessels.  We cannot accept in Canada the lowering of 
working conditions for sailors.  We do not want a system, as in 
some countries of the third world, where sailors have no rights 
aboard a ship and where they are at the mercy of the company they 
work for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it calls for the application of ship safety standards 
that are genuinely international.  This would be acceptable only 
if those standards are higher than Canadian ones, and I doubt 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An article in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> noted that federal 
fisheries observers are afraid that some foreign ships they are 
assigned to are in such poor shape they could break apart and 
sink.  We can expect that it is not only fishing vessels which 
are in bad shape.  We should not be compromising the environment 
or sailors' lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The executive of the marine centre has suggested that Bill C-15 
will allow vessels which are owned abroad to be transferred to 
the Canadian registry.  Operating in international trade, these 
vessels would fly the Canadian flag but would not be taxed in 
Canada.  They would carry non-resident crews who would not be 
covered by the provisions of the Canada Labour Code.  A Canadian 
flag of convenience deep-sea fleet would be an inexorable threat 
to domestic employment in the coasting trade.  We need 
legislation from the government to ensure this does not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under language in section 18 of the new act, foreign built 
equipment could more easily be brought into Canada.  The only 
restriction on chartering a foreign vessel and working it in 
Canada would be that it not be registered in another country 
while it is being bare-boated in Canada.  Why would domestic 
operators use Canadian built vessels when they can charter or 
purchase those more cheaply abroad? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Advocates of unrestricted trade would argue that Canadians can 
compete with anyone, that technology and know-how are more 
important to market success than cheap labour, but this does not 
cut it in the shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This change would allow U.S. shipyards to build vessels for the 
Canadian coastal trade, but the Jones Act of the United States 
will deny Canadian shipyards the same opportunity in the U.S. 
market.  As it is, U.S. shipyards have the competitive advantages 
that come from contracts for military vessels which effectively 
subsidize the overhead costs of commercial boat building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the west coast, the domestic fleet relies on cross-border 
trade for a significant portion of its revenue.  Under the 
proposed changes, freighters or tugs and barges could be 
bare-boated from abroad, carry non-resident crews and compete for 
this international business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Great Lakes, the loss of cross-border business could have 
even more dramatically negative consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the government considered the implications for Canada-U.S. 
relations?  Do we believe that U.S. coastal operators and unions, 
who aggressively defend their country's cabotage rules, would 
happily accept price cutting competition from Canadian flag 
vessels carrying low paid Philippine, Indonesian or Burmese 
crews? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard concerns about the fact that ships under 15 tonnes 
will be exempted from mandatory registration under the act. Their 
registration will be optional under section 17.  The department's 
logic is that registration of the large number of small vessels 
is neither practical nor necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, towboats of under 15 tonnes tow equipment and fuel 
barges as well as log tows, competing with vessels which are 
registered and required to meet Transport Canada's vessel 
standards. 
The unregistered vessels not only undercut vessels which meet 
standards, they are doing work which is hazardous to the 
environment and to other marine traffic.  Often their equipment 
does not meet minimum standards.  Their operators are often not 
certified.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the major objectives in the Canada Shipping Act are to 
protect the health and well-being of individuals, including the 
crews of ships, promote safety in the marine transportation 
system and protect the marine environment from damage due to 
navigation and shipping activities.  If the act is designed to 
provide a level playing field then all vessels engaged in 
commercial activities should be registered and inspected, 
regardless of tonnage.  As well, the act should require risk 
assessment in standards of equipment and certification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Registration should be required for all vessels towing field 
barges or other hazardous goods.  It is important for the safety 
of our waterways.  It has also been brought to my attention that 
with the downturn in the fishery on the east and west coasts many 
fishermen have turned toward tourism as an alternative source of 
income.  This has led to an increasing number of tour boats. 
These boats might be under 15 tonnes.  Are we going to put our 
tourists at risk on boats that were not duly inspected because 
they were less than 15 tonnes?  Let there be no misunderstanding. 
I am not suggesting the small pleasure craft need to be 
inspected. I, along with my colleagues and the transport 
committee, will have to work against this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, the inspections.  I strongly oppose the government 
authorizing any person, classification society or other 
organization to conduct the inspections.  This section is 
contrary to the stated objections of the new act.  Privatization 
of inspection will not encourage viable, effective and economic 
marine transportation.  What it will do is increase bottom line 
pressures to cut corners to do things the cheap way rather than 
the safe way.  It is very worrying to think that the minister 
will hand over the inspection of ships from Transport Canada 
inspectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were this amendment to pass into law, the job of inspecting oil 
tankers and chemical tankers operating in Canadian waters could 
become a patronage appointment.  Even if the inspections were to 
be handed over to classification societies, there is still some 
cause for concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 Transport Canada marine safety branch inspected 1,184 
foreign flag ships.  Of these 10% were detained as being in such 
poor condition that they were not allowed to sail until they had 
done major repairs.  Yet every one of these ships had valid 
certificates issued by a classification society.  It is no wonder 
that each year statistically 10 bulk carriers sink without trace, 
usually taking their 25 person crew with them.  Yet, as the crews 
are mostly from third world countries, we rarely hear of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very obvious that when classification societies are 
allowed to operate without government supervision the market sets 
the standards for safety with the job always going to the 
cheapest, usually the least safe operator.  Are we ready to 
accept such a system in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We suffer from the cuts to airports.  We suffer from the 
privatization of port police.  Are we now going to have to suffer 
because ship safety will go down?  We cannot put our safety and 
our environment in jeopardy.  The classification societies 
include disclaimers of responsibility in all their documents and 
several court cases over the years have shown them immune from 
being sued, even where there is evidence of negligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further point of concern is in section 317-1, inspections by 
others.  The revenues generated by Transport Canada ship 
inspections will now be handed over to the private sector.  A 
figure of $12 million per annum has been stated.  Canada must 
compete with the United States and we are at a competitive 
disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States has the Jones Act.  The act is extremely 
protectionist.  We do not have an equivalent act in Canada to 
protect Canadian interests.  The U.S. with its Jones Act ensures 
the cargo that is carried between U.S. ports is carried aboard 
U.S. ships that are U.S. built, U.S. registered, U.S. owned, U.S. 
crewed and repaired and serviced by U.S. firms.  So much for free 
trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases the trade in Canada has become dominated by 
foreign flag vessels flying flags of convenience from low 
jurisdictions such as Panama. 
It is alleged by some in the industry that Canada Steamship 
Lines, the company owned by the finance minister, has made use of 
these tax evading measures.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to implement a Jones-like act in Canada that would 
require minimum levels of Canadian content in shipping activity. 
Furthermore, it is time we insisted that ships traversing 
Canada's inland waters be Canadian built and Canadian flagged. 
There are many needed changes in the bill, but we can do better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, my party will not support Bill C-15 as it is today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-15, an act to amend the 
Canada Shipping Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Shipping Act is one of the oldest pieces of 
legislation still in effect in Canada.  It was enacted in 1936 
and is the primary legislation governing Canadian ships in 
Canada's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the reorganization of both the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans and the Department of Transport, a reprioritization and a 
clearer outline of the ministerial responsibilities of both these 
department is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The merger of the Canadian coast guard with the department of 
fisheries was completed with responsibility for the coast guard 
functions being transferred to DFO with the exemption of 
harbours, ports, ship safety and pilotage and crown corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada has the prime responsibility for overseeing the 
reform of the Canada Shipping Act.  However, some of the sections 
of the act will fall within the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans, specifically those related to pleasure craft, search and 
rescue, receiving, receiver of wrecks and pollution preparedness 
and response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reform that is currently under way will help simplify the 
regulatory framework and make the shipping act more consistent 
with current regulatory policies.  In the end, reforms should 
contribute to better economic performance in the marine industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government chose to carry out the reforms in a two-step 
approach.  The first step takes place with Bill C-15.  Under Bill 
C-15 there will be a new general part that will be added to the 
beginning of the act, followed by a revision of the existing Part 
I that will deal with ship registration, ownership and mortgages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part II of the reforms to the act will review the remaining 
parts of the shipping act, specifically dealing with the areas of 
safety, certification and conditions of work, accident 
investigation, navigation, wrecks and salvage and economic and 
environmental issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that Part II of the reforms is estimated 
to be ready in early 1999.  We anxiously await these reforms and 
look forward to receiving and debating the issues that emerge at 
that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 will enable Transport Canada to assume complete 
responsibility for ship registration and related activities.  The 
Minister of Transport will be permitted through the act to 
appoint a chief registrar who will be responsible for a register 
of ships.  The register will deal with specific information such 
as the name and description of a Canadian ship, the official 
number and its registered tonnage, the name and address of its 
owner and details of all mortgages registered.  This gives 
Transport Canada responsibility for ship registration that is 
currently performed by Revenue Canada's Customs and Excise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will require that every ship that exceeds 15 
tonnes gross tonnage, that was owned only by qualified persons 
and was not registered in a foreign country, would have to be 
registered. Proposed in this bill for the first time, certain 
foreign ships will be allowed to register in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in favour of many of the reforms included in the bill. It 
is important to point out that Bill C-15 was introduced in 
October 1997.  However, it is essentially the same bill as C-73 
that was introduced in December 1996 but unfortunately died on 
the Order Paper when the election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reforming the outdated shipping act is important and provides 
significant benefits for Canada such as more employment and 
business opportunities for Canadians and, above all, a 
rejuvenated marine infrastructure and a better service for 
Canadian exporters.  This is particularly important as our 
country is an export-driven economy and we need to ensure that we 
have cost competitive mechanisms to get our product to market.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only wish these reforms were of greater priority for the 
government and were introduced earlier.  We are still pleased the 
bill is here now and that it will be dealt with in committee.  We 
look forward to looking more closely at certain issues and 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under clauses 35 and 36 of the bill the minister can appoint 
tonnage measurers to calculate a ship's tonnage.  A tonnage 
measurer may withhold a tonnage certificate until the person 
requesting it pays the tonnage measurer's fees and travel 
expenses.  The minister may set limits on the fees and expenses 
charged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although tonnage measuring is obviously important, we hope the 
fees and expenses remain reasonable so we limit possible 
additional costs being passed on to shippers and we can have cost 
competitive access to our own markets.  This is something to 
consider and watch for in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current part I of the Shipping Act will be replaced with a 
new part I that will modernize the registration of ships. 
Certificates of registry will have an expiry date.  The subject 
of expiration is understandable in the context of a transitional 
period, updating the registration of ships under the old act to 
registration under the new act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, section 48 outlines many sweeping changes the governor 
in council may make.  One area of concern under this section is 
the issuance and renewal of certificates of registry.  Although 
it is important to have updated registration information about 
all ships, we hope future changes that may be made will not mean 
more bureaucracy and excessive costs associated with too frequent 
registration requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also under the bill the Department of Fisheries and Oceans will 
be provided with greater authority to regulate pleasure craft. In 
this regard we are somewhat concerned that the government not go 
too far and have too much regulation of pleasure craft.  If there 
is a safety risk we are certainly in favour of it.  However let 
us not have regulation for regulation's sake.  We would encourage 
caution here.  The parliamentary secretary stated that they plan 
on making amendments to pleasure craft at the committee level. We 
are very pleased to hear this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased with certain aspects of the legislation.  Clauses 
pertaining to definitions are important.  Passenger safety will 
be enhanced by eliminating the specific reference to owner or 
charterer in the current definition of passenger, which in the 
past has possibly permitted some charterers to get around meeting 
specific safety regulations.  Therefore we think this is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area we believe is good is with respect to small 
vessels.  Presently the legislation deals mostly with large 
vessels and has not taken into account that small vessels are 
often built by manufacturers or individuals that may have fallen 
outside regulations that apply to larger vessels.  It is 
important for these manufacturers to comply with construction and 
manufacturing standards as manufacturers of larger vessels have 
to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the bill.  It is long overdue.  It is unfortunate the 
legislation was not passed when it was originally introduced in 
the previous parliament as Bill C-73.  However, it is here now 
and we support most of it.  Certain parts of the bill warrant 
further analysis at committee.  We should look more closely at 
the area of pleasure craft and how much further regulation is 
required.  The parliamentary secretary referred to the point that 
they would be making amendments concerning pleasure craft at the 
committee level.  We think this is very good and we are pleased 
to participate in a constructive fashion at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look forward to phase two of the reforms that will be 
implemented in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we go to

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN PARKS AGENCY ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK49">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed, from March 18, 1998, consideration of 
the motion that Bill C-29, an act to establish the Canadian Parks 
Agency and to amend other acts as a consequence, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak to Bill C-29, known in brief as the Canadian 
Parks Agency Act and introduced by the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of the bill is to turn Parks Canada, one of the three 
programs of the Department of Canadian Heritage, into an agency 
separate from the department, to be known as the Canadian Parks 
Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, Parks Canada has 5,000 employees, more than a 
third of whom work seasonally.  It administers 38 national parks 
and national park reserves, three marine conservation areas, 131 
national historic sites, seven historic canals, 165 heritage train 
stations and 31 heritage rivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Parks Canada works with 661 national historic 
sites it does not own.  It administers policy on some 1,000 
heritage federal buildings and shares responsibility for eight 
world heritage sites with UNESCO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government gives three reasons for the creation of a new 
agency to replace Parks Canada: to simplify structures, improve 
administrative efficiency and establish more flexible staffing and 
financial procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to achieve these objectives, the agency will have new 
or revised financial, administrative and human resource management 
powers.  To this end, the agency will become a separate entity, a 
public corporation as defined in schedule II to the Financial 
Administration Act and will become subject to part II of schedule 
I of the Public Service Staff Relations Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of responsibilities, the agency will report directly 
to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, who will be accountable for 
the agency's activities to Parliament. 
The Agency will report to Parliament by tabling the following five 
documents:  an annual report on the agency's operations; a summary 
of the five-year corporate plan; management plans for the national 
parks, national historic sites and other protected areas; a report 
every five years on the human resources management regime; and a 
biennial report on the state of protected heritage areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the agency's financial statements will be 
examined by the auditor general, who will report to the government 
and who will also assess the agency's performance against its 
mandate, its objectives and its corporate plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Parks Agency will remain subject to official 
languages, employment equity, human rights, access to information 
and privacy legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for financial provisions, the bill will give the agency 
several new financial powers, including; a two-year budget better 
suited to the investments made to develop parks and historic sites; 
the power to keep and reinvest all revenues, except fines; the 
creation of a standing dedicated account funded through 
parliamentary appropriation and the sale of excess property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This account will be used to finance new parks and national 
historic sites.  Finally, the agency will be able to make advances 
for unplanned land acquisitions when the context is favourable.  It 
will have to repay these advances subject to current interest 
rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for human resources management, the agency will be a 
separate employer under the Public Service Staff Relations Act. 
The CEO will have the authority to appoint employees and to define 
the conditions of employment of agency personnel, including 
collective bargaining, and the implementation of classification and 
staffing regimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes will give the agency the necessary flexibility 
to develop the human resources management regime best suited to its 
operating context.  The parks and historic sites network spans the 
country, operates around the clock in several different time zones, 
four seasons a year, and employs many seasonal, temporary and part 
time workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All employees performing duties that will be transferred to 
the Canadian Parks Agency will receive a job offer.  Their present 
job is guaranteed by Treasury Board for two years. 
The federal government claims that the establishment of a Canadian parks 
agency will allow it to fulfil more efficiently and at a lesser cost the 
mandate currently held by the Parks Canada program, under the Department 
of Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that, in the last four years, the government 
reduced Parks Canada's budget by $100 million. That budget is used, 
among other things, to develop the network of national parks and marine 
conservation areas, and to maintain and promote national historic sites 
and monuments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financial constraints imposed on Parks Canada led the 
government to consider a restructuring of the program's operations. The 
bill before us is the result of that exercise, and the proposed change 
is the creation of a Canadian parks agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has long been asking the federal government to 
streamline its operations wherever possible, and to fight waste, instead 
of cutting in social programs and education. This is why we support the 
principle of the bill, provided it will truly improve the effectiveness 
of the parks' management, without jeopardizing the mandate to preserve, 
protect and develop Canada's national parks and historic sites for 
future generations and for all Canadians and Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a briefing, government officials gave us the assurance that this 
bill is not the first step toward the privatization of our parks. 
In fact, when he appeared before the Canadian heritage committee, on 
November 20, the Secretary of State for Parks Canada said “There's 
something I have said over and over again, and I will take an 
opportunity to say it here when we are talking about finance. It is not 
the intention of this government to either privatize or commercialize 
Parks Canada. We believe the maintenance of our special places in Canada 
is an important trust given to us by Canadians. That stewardship 
Canadians want to see exercised publicly, and we will continue to do 
that through our agency and through the oversight of Parliament”.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An issue of major concern to the Bloc Quebecois about this bill is 
to guarantee that, once in operation, the agency will ensure continued 
accessibility of parks to all citizens. This bill reflects an 
unequivocal desire on the part of the government to raise fees on park 
users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that taxpayers already contribute to funding parks through 
their taxes, fees imposed on visitors should not be increased beyond a 
reasonable limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, extra revenue from user fees, royalties or the sale of 
assets should be used to provide more services, better fulfil the parks' 
mission or expand activities. This increase in revenue should not be 
used as an excuse by the government to further cut appropriations 
allocated to the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same vein, we want to ensure that the agency's fiscal 
targets and the federal government's stated wish to see the number of 
visitors increase in order to maximize economic benefits do not lead to 
an overuse of parks and historical sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like this bill to state that the agency must balance the 
need to preserve and maintain natural or historical sites against the 
increase in the number of visitors and the related expansion of tourist 
and commercial activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois' concerns are shared by many. In November 1996, 
the auditor general presented a meaty report to Parliament on the 
protection of national heritage in Canada. The auditor general had 
examined the systems established by Parks Canada to maintain and enhance 
the ecological integrity of national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, the auditor general pointed out that park management 
plans focus mainly on economic and social factors and little on 
ecological factors. He noted also that Parks Canada should upgrade its 
knowledge of the condition of natural resources in national parks in 
order to be able to select a sensible management approach, based on the 
ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following this report, Parks Canada took a number of corrective 
measures and, last fall, the secretary of state forwarded to us Park 
Canada's response to some criticisms made by the auditor general. 
The bill calls for measures relating to the creation and 
implementation of park management plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much still remains to be done, however, before all the auditor 
general's recommendations can be implemented.  The data on park 
conditions still needs to be updated, and the policies on 
ecological conditions need to be applied on an ongoing basis as 
well. The ecological objectives set out in the legislation must be 
translated into concrete actions if they are to become reality in 
spite of budget restrictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parks Canada has drawn up some ambitious development plans 
aimed at completing the national parks system, expanding the 
network of national historic sites and creating a system of 
maritime conservation areas. 
At present, 24 of the 39 natural regions defined by Parks Canada 
are represented in its system, and its objective is to develop the 
remaining 15 by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government claims these objectives will be 
attainable because of the enhanced efficiency resulting from 
reorganization, which will enable it to do more with less.  As 
well, the government is committed to not decreasing the 
parliamentary votes allocated to the agency. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, we question the new agency's ability to 
consolidate and fully develop the existing sites, while maintaining 
its objectives of expansion in today's context of budgetary 
restraint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do not want to see happen is for there to be a very 
vast but badly maintained system, with insufficient services and no 
ecological integrity.  We wish to ensure that the development of 
the system of national parks and historic sites is durable and 
sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our support at second reading of this bill must not be 
interpreted by the government as a blank cheque, however. 
We have let the government know that, when this bill is studied by 
the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, we want the committee 
to call as witnesses representatives of all groups of employees, 
including seasonal and part time workers, whose status might be 
changed as a result of the bill's planned changes.  We want to ask 
them to tell us about their concerns with respect to this bill, to 
check what guarantees they have been given with respect to job 
security and working conditions, and to see whether these 
guarantees are contained in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we want the committee to hear from 
representatives of environmental protection groups, in order to 
find out where they stand on the bill and the creation of the 
agency. 
Among other things, we would like to know whether environmental 
groups feel that the reorganization proposed in the bill will allow 
the new agency to fulfil its ecological mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want to ensure that the bill will provide a means of 
controlling contracting out, and ensuring impartiality and 
transparency in the tendering process for all contracts awarded by 
the Canadian Parks Agency.  The new structure and wide-ranging 
authority of the agency's CEO in the management of human resources 
must not pave the way for arbitrary decisions and patronage 
appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can count on our support in principle for Bill 
C-29 establishing the Canadian Parks Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will, however, be vigilant during clause-by-clause study of 
this bill in the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, in order 
to ensure that the bill makes it possible to deliver services more 
effectively, while respecting the existing mandate of Parks Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am rising to speak against Bill C-29, an act to establish the 
Canadian parks agency and to amend other acts as a consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals would have Canadians believe that the purpose of 
this legislation is to improve Parks Canada.  In fact, the 
Liberal background papers for Bill C-29 speak of organizational 
simplicity, administrative efficiency, human resources 
flexibility and improved financial procedures.  Quoting them, 
they use words such as business-like manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their language flows pretty in its terms, in its fancy window 
dressing which hides the real reason why Bill C-29 is coming into 
effect.  The real reasons are financial and fiscal and that is 
why the bill is in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will be outraged when they finally realize that the 
details of this proposal will be understood in the near future. 
Words like program review are hidden.  These are the reasons 
given for cutbacks resulting from our financial situation in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the Liberals are quick to state that Bill C-29 has nothing 
to do with privatization.  No, the Liberals know a lot better 
than that.  It will create a lot of trouble.  Whisper 
privatization in anybody's ear, especially dealing with national 
parks, and there will be a major outrage.  The repercussions will 
take several years to recover from.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians voiced their opposition loud and clear when the 
Liberals originally tried to take this approach.  Our parks are a 
sacred sanctuary.  Our parks are a part of our national identity. 
Our parks help us define what it means to be Canadian.  They are 
very special and distinct places in our country that reflect the 
ecological, cultural and geographical integrity for the 
generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our parks are a legacy, a legacy which began in Banff in the 
mid-1880s and which continues to this day.  Bill C-7, the 
Sagenuay-St. Lawrence marine park, was the latest legacy which 
was introduced and recently passed in this House.  The New 
Democrats supported it wholeheartedly. From Banff to the St. 
Lawrence these parks are alive into the next millennium; a 
century of noble effort and honourable intentions to be laid 
waste for short term plans and misguided Liberal fiscal policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason this bill is being introduced is for financial 
deficits and cutbacks.  It is to control the financial roller 
coaster that nobody seems to be in control of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister stated several weeks ago that we have 
reached a balanced approach.  But we never know where this roller 
coaster is going to go.  We are putting our parks in jeopardy by 
continuing to look at a cherished institution for the sake of 
expediency, financial accountability, transferability and 
transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the deficit battle, like many other programs, departments 
and services, Parks Canada was attacked.  It lost hundreds of 
millions of dollars, it lost jobs, services were reduced and user 
fees were increased.  If we continue to operate it in 
business-like manner pretty soon it will be like a hockey game. 
How many people can afford an NHL hockey ticket today?  Who will 
be able to afford to a part of this legacy for all Canadians, to 
go to a national park, to experience the beauty of Banff and 
Jasper, of the polar bears, the marine parks, the heritage sites? 
User fees will skyrocket.  There will be contracting out, pay per 
person, private companies, loss of dedicated staff and plenty of 
complaints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are angry that our national legacies are not being 
protected.  Canadians are angry that our heritage is disappearing 
bit by bit, service by service, program by program.  The New 
Democratic Party shares these concerns and is fighting for the 
very principles that this government and other parties are 
willing to squander for the sake of business-like practices. 
Principles are being squandered when it comes to the dollar. The 
legacy of national parks needs to protected.  It cannot be 
measured by dollar value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-29 does not seem to be the answer. If this nation has met 
the deficit challenge, why are we considering packaging Bill 
C-29, gift wrapping it for an organizational corporation like 
Walt Disney to purchase?  Why should we consider something like 
that?  The mentality for the last few years has been to axe 
policies and chop programs.  That has to stop.  Let us stop it at 
the national parks.  Close the gate, as the Reform leader did at 
Stornoway, create a gate and stop it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not continue the dismantling of federal 
responsibilities, especially not our parks and our historical 
sites.  I call on my colleagues to stop an enabling legislation 
that will impact 38 national parks and 786 historical sites. 
These are important symbols of our identity.  We must think long 
and hard before we embark on this path. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have a Canadian parks agency, a crown agency, reporting 
to the minister.  Why is this necessary?  Can we not fix the 
current problems identified by the recent round of consultations? 
Can we not fix it by having the employees labour, the service 
industries and the communities around the national parks 
addressing these issues with the existing structure? 
What is stopping us from implementing these changes and keeping 
Parks Canada intact?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have witnessed the spins and angles which the Liberals 
have used to damage our country.  The Liberals did not say 
anything about scrapping the GST, did they?  They did not mention 
anything about the BST in Atlantic Canada and how it would reduce 
cost and impact Atlantic Canadians.  No, they did not mention 
anything like that.  Again they are not mentioning that the 
agency is not for privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-29 will save the parks and the heritage sites. That is 
what they are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I received my brief from department officials, I 
immediately felt something was wrong.  It just could not be 
right.  The bottom line was to be financially accountable and to 
make things affordable.  However, if they make things affordable 
and business-like, it will be at the cost of employment services 
and program services.  Services will be eliminated and there will 
be user fee hikes.  That is the mentality of business-like 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Disney corporation is more than happy to raise their costs 
to give us a much shinier project or a much shinier concept with 
a futuristic approach.  If they get their hands on this, like 
they did on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the commercial 
rights will be owned by a foreign corporation. That is exactly 
what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian parks are not being privatized, but they are on the 
road to being commercialized.  A Reform member yesterday agreed 
wholeheartedly that it was the right way to go, to do it in a 
business-like manner.  He said that if he was the minister of 
Canadian heritage he would do it that way.  I think he was 
dreaming.  It is a right wing, capitalist approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us keep the national parks as a Canadian entity.  Let us 
keep them for all our children.  Let Canadians continue to 
operate them in the generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The outcry, which is a whisper right now, can be compared to 
what happened with our national railways.  They are now operating 
on American soil, on American rail lines. The Canadian dream of 
uniting our nation has been abandoned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the experience with NavCan.  It was packaged by the 
government to be sold to a private organization.  Is that where 
our parks are going? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, a fine patronage plum will be created.  Under Bill C-29 
a new CEO position will be created.  That person will oversee the 
agency responsible for our parks and heritage sites.  The CEO 
will have exclusive hiring and firing powers. The CEO will be 
able to dispose of and acquire crown lands and assets, following 
the rules of course, and we know the kind of track record the 
Liberals have on following rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CEO will also have the power to negotiate employee 
contracts.  The contracts which exist for Canada Parks employees 
will be negotiated over the next two years.  We do not know what 
kind of contract they will have.  We do not know—

has on the 5,000 employees that the parks employ as seasonal 
workers, summer student employment in the summer, their first 
work experience at the park creating a natural, historic and 
cultural legacy for other generations, is truly an honourable 
process of how our parks have been utilized in creating 
employment and creating education for our biology, ecology and 
our culture and geography students.  We also look at the fate of 
agencies and the government's role with regard to DND employees 
and privatization.  A British company is now operating employee 
status which will have a major impact throughout Canada.

interested to hear my NDP colleague's analysis.  I would like to 
know whether he has seen what I have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former section 4 of the National Parks Act reads 
essentially as follows “The National Parks of Canada are hereby 
dedicated to the people of Canada for their benefit, education and 
enjoyment, subject to this Act and the regulations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section does not appear in Bill C-29. 
It is also closely related to the former section 7.(f), which 
provides that the government may set fees for the use of the parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, fees will be set, it appears, by the administration of 
the new parks agency.  Its only obligation will be to publish them 
in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>, but that remains fairly haphazard.  Will the 
fees be the same across Canada—a mari usque ad mare—or will 
they be set according to the clientele or the amount of traffic? 
Will there be different fees, for example, at Forillon National 
Park and at Banff National Park? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member enlighten us on that? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  I thank the hon. member for raising 
that point.  I have no idea about the future of this parks 
agency. Nobody has any idea.  We are opening the door to an 
insecure future.  There is no vision of what our national parks 
will be.  It will be up to the chief executive officer of the 
agency that will be created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is said a percentage of 80% to 85% is government transfers 
and about 15% is user fees.  Who is to say that in the middle of 
this century it will be 50% user fees and 50% government?  By no 
means has Canada achieved the percentage of national parks that 
should be created. I believe it is a 12% commitment that has been 
made to Canadians that would be set aside as national parks.  We 
have not achieved the percentage of lands to be set aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the number of national parks increases in the future, the 
amount of transfer dollars available from the federal government 
will dwindle.  Will that be decided through the corporate or 
management plan which will be one person planning to decide to 
raise the fees?  It is uncharted waters and it is a scary 
thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once you put a big bow tie on an agency such as Walt Disney, it 
could take over the administration of the parks and make it a 
truly business-like plan operating at arm's length. The 
government says we can raise the issue with the minister every 
two years for a review.  It will be designed like an umbilical 
cord from the minister to the parks agency.  Some day it could be 
severed and that is the scary thought.  I would hate to see the 
national parks depart from that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Another legacy that Canadians should be aware of is potash 
heritage sites in my region, as well as Jasper, Banff, Terra Nova 
and the Cape Breton Highlands.  All of these parks will be 
impacted as well as future parks.  But at what cost?  Who is 
going to design and manage them?  It will be the chief executive 
officer.  He will be negotiating contracts with the staff.  We 
are giving him two years to come up with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if they do not come up with a contract in two years?  What 
happens to the employees?  They will be operating without a 
contract.  Who do they fall under?  Who is going to be 
responsible for parks like Jasper National Park or the Cheviot 
mine that will be right next door to a national park which is a 
world heritage site?  Who will decide how to procure these lands? 
One individual could decide to sell the parks or have an 
ecological impact on them.  That is a scary thought.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on Bill C-29, since I am very 
close to it as a result of my past experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first job was with Parks Canada in P.E.I. in 1981, and my 
last federal government job was at the Kouchibouguac National Park. 
So I have seen a lot of things first hand, particularly the 
developments between 1981 and 1997.  I saddens me to see the 
direction our parks are taking today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first reason to create the agency is, as my colleague has 
said, downsizing, or job cuts. 
It is privatization.  When the announcement came a couple of years 
ago that an agency would be created, I can still clearly remember 
our conference call with Mr. Tom Lee. It was clear that jobs were 
going to be lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were also headed toward alternate service delivery, which 
means people get shown the door and then hired again on contract at 
a considerable loss in salary, from $15 to $5.50 an hour.  When 
that first teleconference was held we were not fully in agreement, 
and those same concerns are still with us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am giving you the real facts, for I lived them.  If one 
looks at exactly what is going on in the parks today it is true 
that some have already got to another stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people wonder what my job was, I was a cashier.  I was the 
person who took money at the entrance. 
Often, families would turn up who did not have the $7 needed to get 
in and use the beaches, the bike paths, the walking trails.  They 
had to turn their cars around and leave.  We would have paid the 
fee out of our own pockets if we had been able to afford it, so 
that their kids could get to the beach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where things have got to today. That is what the bill 
will bring in, a continuity of the process of making national parks 
accessible only to those who can afford the high fees to rent a 
camp site, use the bike paths and our beautiful beaches, enjoy 
nature.  The national parks are very lovely, and they exist for a 
reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, they are in the process of being destroyed.  Today, 
there is a charge for a little bundle of wood for a camp fire. 
Before people had to pay for wood, we had no problems with our camp 
sites. 
Now people are cutting down the trees in our national parks because 
they do not want to pay the $3 or $5 extra for firewood. Our parks 
are now being destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agency cannot offer any guarantee that this is for the 
good of our parks, because that is not true.  It is absolutely 
false. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also look at the reasons why national parks were 
established. They were estaablished to protect nature and to make sure 
these places would still be there for future generations. Many national 
parks are located in high unemployment areas. Often, they are the main 
employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back home, I was one of the best paid employees in the region at 
$13 per hour, because the park was the main employer. Just think that 
people in these regions have to accept seasonal jobs that pay $5.50 an 
hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other reasons that explain what the government is doing. 
As my colleague pointed out, the government wants the parks to become 
self-sufficient and self-financing eventually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see it coming. I can also see how the human aspect is absent 
from our parks. When I started with the parks, in 1981, the focus was on 
client services. Clients came first. By the summer of 1996, the priority 
had become “give me your $7”, or “give me your $18”. Fees are 
unbelievably high and they are not consistent across the country. In 
some parks they are very high, compared to other places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who cannot afford such fees have no way of seeing, of 
discovering the natural resources of our national parks, and the 
situation will only get worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former regional vice-president of the public service alliance 
for the Atlantic region, I have a pretty good understanding of national 
parks in that region. 
I heard people's concerns. At one time, people were given this 
alternative: either we create an agency, or we make this cut and that 
cut. People have no choice. No one likes this system. People have to 
choose the lesser of two evils. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party clearly will not support this bill. It is 
unacceptable. It goes against what we believe. All Canadians should have 
access to our national parks. This access should not depend on their 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more the government increases the cost of services, the further 
it is pushing in the same direction. The philosophy is “if you do not 
have money in this country, too bad. We changed the rules and you will 
no longer have access to anything”. That pattern can be seen in health 
care, education and the national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very obvious that the government wants to follow the Reform 
Party's philosophy, which is “if you do not have money in this country, 
too bad”. I have a problem with that, because at one time I was among 
those who do not have money. I was also one of those who were 
expropriated from Kouchibouguac national park. I am very familiar with 
national parks, and I know why we pay for parks. Today, I can see that 
the government is changing direction, and this is not acceptable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I congratulate 
the member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac on a very caring speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing that there are 500,000 poor children in the Montreal area, 
I wonder whether they will ever be able to set foot in a national park, 
given the new parks policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised this issue earlier with the NDP member. I am concerned 
that under the bill—I had a quick look at it—the Canadian government 
is turning the responsibility over to an agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the agency created by the minister will develop 
policies, but the minister will not get involved in the areas listed 
under clause 13, which is at the heart of the way the agency will 
operate. Does this mean we might see the same situation as with Montreal 
airports where the transport minister can no longer get involved and has 
no say in the way airports are managed? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will it be the same with the new agency? Could it be that once a 
given area has been shown to be profitable, contrary to section 4 of the 
old act, which said that parks were for the use and benefit of all 
Canadians, the minister will bring in an agency specializing in 
entertainment, or a huge corporation such as Walt Disney? This 
organization will then become responsible for the administration of the 
Banff National Park, for example, in return for a small fee and will be 
free to charge whatever prices it wants and to go after its usual 
clientele, namely the rich, the upper crust, while the poor, for whom 
national parks were designed and created in the first place, will no 
longer have access to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are standing on a slippery slope. This seemingly innocuous bill 
has huge flaws and needs rethinking. I urge the minister to retain at 
least his power to get involved, especially under clause 13. It is at 
the heart of Canada's national parks management system. Without it, we 
might as well sell them to for-profit corporations. In fact, this is 
where we are heading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member, who gave such a good speech, to reassure me 
in this regard, if at all possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B> Madam Speaker, I must say that I cannot 
reassure my hon. colleague because he told it exactly as it is. The 
chief executive officer has exclusive authority. We have to ask 
ourselves why the power to make all decisions regarding hiring, 
operations, everything, has to be concentrated in the hands of one 
individual. We clearly have to figure out exactly what the Liberal 
government is up to here. It is trying to pull a fast one, as we say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, some members of this House can see exactly what is going 
on. It is not fair, and that is a fact. This person obviously has too 
much power, and that is the direction we are headed in, as I indicated 
earlier. We are moving in the wrong direction, that is, toward the 
commercialization of our national parks. That is quite obvious. 
No one can argue that we are not headed in that direction, which will 
mean more pollution, more of everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we must realize that unemployment is a big problem in this 
country. Affected employees will be guaranteed a job for two years only. 
They do not know where they will be working two years from now. Many 
employees across the country have no idea where they will be in two 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I completely agree with my colleague that the government is moving 
in a very dangerous direction, which will certainly be harmful to our 
parks and to our economy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
have this opportunity to make a few comments on Bill C-29, an act to 
establish the Canadian Parks Agency, which will be responsible for the 
administration of all legislation relating to national parks, national 
historic sites, national marine conservation areas and heritage areas. 
This bill will also make consequential amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to take part in this debate because I live in an area, 
the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean area, that has always been known as having 
great potential for tourism. It took several decades before we could 
even hope that, some day, we would be on the list of Canadian national 
parks. With regard to the management of federal and even provincial 
parks, we realize that we must try to add new elements that will make 
park management more dynamic, if I can use that term, and that will 
involve local communities to a greater extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will have the opportunity later on to make further comments on 
the contents of Bill C-29. In my own region, there is a 
provincial park, the Saguenay park, and there is also the marine 
national park. A co-operative effort is being made to try to meet 
common objectives for the development of our region and for the 
tourist industry of Quebec and of Canada as a whole. 
The efforts to establish the new national marine park directly 
affiliated with Parks Canada have been successful.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we realize that, in both provincial and national parks, we must 
try to provide funding so that our managers can initiate productive 
projects for the future and give guarantees in order to eventually 
promote the direct involvement of municipalities and the private sector, 
and so that we can bring more people into our parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the involvement of regional sectors, both private and 
public, perhaps we could make some interesting changes to the parameters 
and criteria underlying the management of national and provincial parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know very well that some efforts must be made to increase the 
number of visitors in our national and provincial parks. Some major 
corrective action must be taken to provide these parks with new 
facilities that would help attract more people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in my region, 200,000 visitors go to the mouth of the 
Saguenay River, to Tadoussac, in Charlevoix, but not even a quarter of 
them go to the Saguenay provincial park and marine park. We have to 
rethink a number of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the initiative to establish this agency will allow 
us to increase the participation of the people in the area. 
At the present time, it is very difficult to set up new infrastructures 
in these parks. I am referring, among other things, to the Saguenay—St. 
Lawrence marine park in our case. As has been done at Montmorency Falls, 
at Val-Jalbert and in national parks in western Canada, we could provide 
some means of access so that people could get to the extraordinary 
lookout site of Cap Trinité. It takes four and a half hours to walk to 
the statue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the people in the area, with the support of their 
federal member of Parliament, are thinking about setting up perhaps a 
cable-car or some other way to provide access to this site that is quite 
extraordinary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to redesign the existing infrastructure, and the 
establishment of the parks agency will certainly be an opportunity for 
increased financial autonomy, making this agency less vulnerable to 
government interventions that are not always timely. I am convinced 
stakeholders will feel this agency is more open to their needs and 
suggestions than Parks Canada has been in the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the best way to successfully manage the assets that remind 
us of our past is to bring in people into the regions in great need of 
economic development through tourist, cultural and heritage attractions. 
People will certainly be more than happy to suggest to the brand new 
agency ways to make these extraordinary sites that are an important part 
of Canada's and Quebec's heritage more profitable and attractive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure people in the outlying regions will become more actively 
involved in the way parks are managed. 
If such an agency is established, as we hope it will be, I am sure it 
will be quite open to the recommendations of people who have an 
economic, cultural and social interest in bringing in more people to 
enhance our whole heritage infrastructure and boost park development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still a great deal of work to be done, but the auditor 
general has told us he has serious doubts about the future of Canadian 
park development because of the budget cuts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last few decades, funding was haphazard. I am sure that, 
with the new agency being established under Bill C-29, we will be able 
to consider more seriously the future of our heritage and tourist 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also convinced that my beautiful riding of Chicoutimi and my 
region of Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean will make a significant contribution 
to the development of our national parks. In my area, in particular, 
with the agency speeding up the structural development of national 
parks, we will be able to step up cooperation with existing provincial 
parks, as was done during the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rest assured that our party will support this bill, because it is 
a step in the right direction. It is not perfect, but I am sure that the 
existence of this agency will make park managers more accountable. I 
remind the hon. members that Parks Canada was not even officially 
recognized. 
Under this bill, it will gain official recognition and receive 
guaranteed, statutory budgets. It will be assured of receiving the 
budget resources needed to promote development and also, I hope, to 
encourage cooperation among the stakeholders, who have different and 
very specific interests in regional development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party will cooperate and support this bill which is a step in 
the right direction.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened to my colleague's speech very closely and I have two 
questions for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There a number of very poor Canadian families in the country.  I 
think it was indicated this morning that about 1.4 million 
children are living in poverty.  We heard on the news today that 
there are 200,000 young people out of work, largely school 
dropouts who do not appear on any statistical record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my hon. friend agree that with the imposition of user fees 
certain Canadians, particularly children from low income 
families, will have a difficult time accessing the use of some of 
our national parks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is called commercialization of the national parks, 
would he not agree that this is another euphemism for the 
privatization of Parks Canada? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
important comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He alluded to poverty. I do not come from a very wealthy region. 
Since it is always better to talk about what we know best, I can tell 
you that, in the communities where these parks are located, 40% to 50% 
of the workforce has trouble finding work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fees will be charged, but there is a downside. I get messages from 
communities affected by the establishment of national parks, and even 
provincial parks, to the effect that they would like to be in charge of 
the development of these infrastructures. For example, there is a 
provincial park at home that was established 25 years ago, but very few 
jobs were created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Local people are telling us they want to improve their financial 
status, as mentioned by the hon. member, and take on more 
responsibilities. It would really be in everyone's interest to let these 
municipalities and villages take on some of the responsibilities, so 
that they could play a role in the creation of new infrastructures that 
will bring in more people.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, back home, 200,000 people travel to the mouth of the 
Saguenay River, in the Tadoussac—Baie-Sainte-Catherine area. Only 30% 
to 35% of them make it to the heart of the Saguenay park. This means the 
region loses out on a lot of revenue, because of a lack of 
infrastructures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, It is indicated that these are conservation areas. 
However, wildlife and plant life alone will not attract tourists. Some 
major infrastructures are necessary to make it easier for the tourists. 
Let us not forget that, economically speaking, seniors are currently the 
most appealing group of tourists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for these elderly to have safe access to certain sites, 
certain infrastructures must be built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really appreciate the hon. member's question. Indeed, if local 
people are more involved, I think it will greatly promote job creation 
and economic development. It will also indirectly allow these people to 
have access to the new sites that they have helped develop in an 
intelligent way that takes their views into account.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise 
in the House today on the occasion of the second reading of Bill 
C-29, an act to establish the Canadian parks agency and to amend 
other acts in consequence thereof. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will make it possible to modernize the agency 
responsible for managing Canada's national parks, national historic 
sites and other protected heritage areas. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate of this organization, presently known as the Parks 
Canada program of the Department of Canadian Heritage, is to play 
the leading role in federal government activities related to 
recognizing places representative of Canada's natural heritage 
and places of national historical importance, protecting these 
places and presenting them to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with national parks and national historic sites these 
special places include historic canals, a system of heritage 
railway stations, heritage rivers, federal heritage buildings and 
the vibrant federal archaeological program as well as Canada's 
UNESCO world heritage sites including most recently a favourite 
of mine, the old town of Lunenburg in Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of the Canadian parks agency will bring two 
main benefits to Canadians.  First, and I say this to reassure 
and to respond to the concerns of the member for Churchill River. 
It is to assist in the creation of new national parks, the 
designation of additional national historic sites and the 
management of other related protected heritage areas including 
the creation of national marine conservation areas.  In other 
words this is not an act of retrenchment.  It is an act which 
permits the ultimate expansion of these programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is the continued delivery of quality service to 
Canadians at existing parks and sites. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians attach great importance to their system of protected 
natural and cultural heritage areas.  Our national parks, our 
national historic sites and other protected heritage areas are 
characteristic of the geography, history, culture, economy and even 
the identity of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are joining forces to protect these exceptional 
sites and to further expand our system of national parks, national 
historic sites and other protected heritage areas.  In so doing, we 
are not just protecting our environment and our historical and 
cultural artifacts; we are preserving what makes us Canadians, what 
sets us apart from the rest of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have every reason to be proud of these sites, which 
represent Canada and which are evidence of the sound and 
sustainable management of the cultural and environmental resources 
of our heritage. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also reassure the member for Churchill that the new Canadian 
parks agency will not change the mandate of the Parks Canada 
program. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act creating the agency will support and wherever possible 
strengthen that mandate, enhancing its stewardship role in 
relation to Canada's natural and cultural heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian parks agency will remain fully accountable to the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage and to parliament.  The agency will 
report to parliament through the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
who will retain power of direction over agency activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the National Parks Act and other legislation setting 
out the mandate of the program will continue to be enforced.  In 
short, we will not be turning our national parks into Disney 
theme parks despite the concerns of the member opposite.  Indeed, 
if anybody attempted to try to sell off Canada's national parks 
or to reduce their territory, they would have to come back to 
parliament to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will change is that a new framework will be put in place to 
administer these existing pieces of legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Parks Agency will differ from the existing 
organization in two significant ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, control of the agency will be through direct hierarchic 
links between it and the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, administrative provisions will be made to measure so 
as to respond to the agency's specific objectives and unique 
operational requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In practical terms, this means that the Canadian Parks Agency 
will use the tools and instruments that best suit its highly 
decentralized and diversified operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Jonquière raised a number of justified concerns 
on the proposed agency's financial arrangements.  I want to 
reassure her that its financial management practices will still be 
governed by the Financial Administration Act.  It will continue to 
prepare its main estimates and to receive parliamentary 
appropriations.  The agency will still be audited by the office of 
the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main reasons for creating the Canadian Parks Agency 
was to ensure Canadians continued to enjoy a high level of service. 
Another objective was, to respond to the concerns of the member for 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac,  to create a stable administration that 
would provide parks' employees with some assurance their jobs would 
remain.  In fact, there is even the possibility of extending jobs, 
contrary to what she feared. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end new flexibilities are being created.  Canadians will 
benefit from them in very concrete ways such as the way in which 
the new agency will now be able to work toward the completion of 
the national parks system and the expansion of the system of 
national historic sites and other protected heritage areas as I 
described earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Canadian parks agency will receive the 
authority to keep and spend most of its revenue.  This will 
result in additional dollars for investment in new national 
parks, new national historic sites and other protected heritage 
areas.  A new non-lapsing account will be used to fund the 
creation of new parks and sites, as well as to complete those 
parks and sites which have not yet been fully developed.  This 
account would be able to carry moneys forward into the future and 
will help the agency achieve existing government commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A two year rolling budget will make it easier for the agency to 
plan and carry out its expenditures and will result in a greater 
stability of service for Canadians and a greater stability of 
regime for employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will also receive a higher level of delegated 
financial and administrative authorities from Treasury Board. 
This will reduce the time needed to make decisions and to get 
approvals. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will continue to come under Government of Canada 
contracts regulations, but will have increased powers to manage the 
purchase and sale of properties, award architectural and 
engineering services contracts and award construction contracts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will be able to negotiate the optional delivery of 
certain common services with the departments responsible.  Examples 
of these are surveying, property assessments, disposal of surplus 
assets, printing and publishing.  This will put managers in a 
better position to seek out the most economical and convenient 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In discussing the organization's mandate, it is important to 
note that, even if it does not have a direct mandate for tourism, 
it does play an important role, as the hon. member for Chicoutimi 
has pointed out, in visitors' image of Canada, helps maintain a 
prosperous and solid economy, and encourages sustainable 
development to the benefit of local communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's national parks, national historical monuments and 
other protected heritage sites generate more than $2 billion yearly 
in direct and indirect economic benefits, which are of crucial 
importance to local economies in rural, isolated or economically 
underdeveloped regions.  Once again, I am picking up on what the 
hon. member for Chicoutimi has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore very important to note that the Canadian Parks 
Agency will continue to operate Parks Canada's corporate units and 
urban townsites revolving funds, which are used to administer the 
hot springs in Banff, Jasper and Kootenay national parks, the golf 
course in Cape Breton Highlands National Park and the six townsites 
within a national park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future integrity of Canada's natural and cultural heritage 
sites will continue to represent a priority for the Canadian Parks 
Agency, as it does for the present government.  The challenges 
facing Canada's heritage areas will continue to increase, as will 
the demands upon them. 
It is essential not only to design policies that can protect these 
irreplaceable treasures forever, but also to ensure that the 
organization with key responsibility for our heritage is equipped 
with the necessary tools and structures to fulfil the mandate with 
which the people of Canada have entrusted it.> 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before us will enable the new Canadian parks 
agency to meet the challenges now facing our heritage areas in a 
most efficient way.  It will continue to provide for the use and 
enjoyment of Canadians a system of national parks, national 
historic sites and related protected heritage areas and to manage 
these places in ways that leave them unimpaired for future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Five members have 
indicated a desire to speak on questions and comments.  We will 
start with the member for Lethbridge, then member for 
Frontenac—Mégantic, and third, the member for 
Cariboo—Chilcotin.  If we have a chance, we will go to the 
member for Churchill River. With 10 minutes, it means we have 
approximately 60 seconds for the question and 60 seconds for the 
response.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
try to make it quick.  I have a national park in my riding, 
Waterton Lakes National Park, a hidden jewel of the west.  We are 
very proud of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary mentioned that there will be new 
parks and that there will be expanded parks.  Could he indicate 
to us whether in the discussions and in the proceedings they 
talked about jurisdictional overlap and the disputes that have 
arisen with other levels of government when it comes to 
developing a park?  Is there a new mechanism in place to handle 
that?  Has it been a consideration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the intent is to make the parks more efficient and to make 
the best use of the dollars available, can the member assure us 
that the user fees that are charged at the parks now are not 
going to get out of hand?  Is there some formula?  Is there 
something in place to assure that the people who are enjoying the 
parks now will be able to afford to enjoy them in the future?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the first question was 
about the expansion of the parks system.  The member asked if we 
are using new mechanisms to involve all the appropriate levels of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are developing such mechanisms when we create things like the 
new national marine conservation areas.  We are continually 
involving local populations and provincial governments in order 
to arrive at common objectives.  As the member indicated, these 
are complex matters with many layers. Existing mechanisms are 
being adapted for new challenges such as these marine 
conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two things can be said on the second point of user fees.  It is 
a mandate of the parks not to charge more than the service costs. 
In other words they are not designed to be profit centres.  More 
important, under section 25(1) of the act, the minister is 
responsible for the setting of park fees and must do so only 
after consulting with the group of relevant people in the area to 
see what would be the consequences of raising those fees.  If it 
were in any way a barrier, that would affect the final decision 
on the fees. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
his speech on Bill C-29, the hon. member for Don Valley-West said the 
new parks agency would have a higher level of administrative authority 
and more power to manage the environment in a national park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could we have a commitment from him that we will never again see 
what we are witnessing in Alberta, where there is a beautiful national 
park threatened by the opening of a mine nearby? It would appear that 
nothing can be done to prevent this from happening even though this mine 
is sure to cause serious damage to this park established many decades 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the higher level of authority given to the new parks agency, 
would it be possible to plan for this kind of situation and include 
provisions allowing the board of directors of a park and the new agency 
to take control of the park and, if need be, to expropriate and enlarge 
the park so that hundreds of millions of dollars in investments would 
not be lost because of so-called progress? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey:</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer is straightforward. > 
Since the present National Parks Act remains in effect, everything 
regarding economic decisions such as the ones mentioned by the member 
will remain in effect. Therefore, this new scheme will not allow the 
agency to go beyond the usual standards regarding the environment or 
consultations at the local level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill deals strictly with organizational matters, and with 
regard to the kind of decisions mentioned by the member opposite, 
current procedures will remain. So the answer is no.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to be able to ask these questions of the 
parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parks system is vast.  There are 38 parks, 131 national 
historic sites, 661 sites operated by third parties, seven 
historic canals, three marine conservation areas, 165 heritage 
railway stations and 31 heritage rivers. The proposal seems to 
make some move toward organizational simplicity and 
administrative efficiency.   There seems to be a delayering and 
more financial accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said that they are in the process of 
planning.  I hear this so often from the government. 
What is the government doing beyond planning to bring these good 
ideas into practice?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let us talk about planning 
in two ways.  In terms of creating a stable regime for the parks, 
like so many other government agencies Parks Canada has been 
subject to tremendous pressures through downsizing.  This has 
been a difficult period for Parks Canada.  That period is over. 
The thought now is to create a regime which will give the parks a 
better chance for stability by allowing them for example to keep 
moneys at the end of the year which they have made through their 
various ancillary activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actual efficiency aspects will be coming in to place as soon 
as the act is passed.  In terms of planning in the grander sense 
as to how we complete our national parks system, I think that as 
I suggested in my speech this law indirectly will allow that to 
happen by providing more money and a more stable regime.  In that 
way we can either complete existing parks or get on with the new 
ones a bit faster. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
with respect to the Canadian parks agency, the term Canadian 
parks is a change.  It is now known as Parks Canada.  How much 
money is going to be spent to advertise Canadian parks?  Will the 
the letterhead, logos and signs be changed?  Some people went 
into a flap about the beaver as our national parks logo.  Is that 
going to be changed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief executive officer has exclusive rights. In terms of 
user fees the minister only has to consult someone she thinks is 
interested in user fees.  It could be the chief executive 
officer.  He would be interested. That is all that is required in 
the act, whoever is interested, deemed by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am interested.  I live in Beauval, Saskatchewan.  My children 
are also interested about what happens in Banff and Waterton. 
These are wonderful Canadian parks for Canadians.  We are 
interested but we will not be consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should take a second look at this agency, the powers 
we are giving to it and the future of the legacy of our national 
parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the second point of 
consultation, the regime described in the bill is simply a 
carryover of the existing practice.  The minister is accountable 
in this House for those decisions.  The minister is a politician 
like the rest of us. It is normal to expect the minister in order 
to avoid a political firestorm to consult widely to protect the 
government in the fashion which has been the practice up to the 
current moment. It is a practice which is simply being 
reincarnated in the proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the point about the renaming aspect of the bill, I would 
venture a personal opinion here. When we have a brand name like 
Parks Canada we would be a little careful about frittering away 
the benefits of that brand name.  It may be that the agency 
aspect may simply be the title of record.  Those are decisions we 
will have to make in due course. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to voice my support for Bill C-29, the Canadian parks agency 
act.  While it is rare that we see eye to eye with the government 
on issues, I feel that partisanship must be cast aside when good 
ideas emerge.  This rarely happens on the other side though. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a country filled with natural wonders.  Our natural 
environment is as much a symbol of our country as are the maple 
leaf and the beaver.  From Riding Mountain National Park in 
Manitoba to Glacier National Park in British Columbia, our parks 
are national treasures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent the riding of Calgary East, a stone's throw away 
from the beauty and splendour of Banff, Jasper and Yoho national 
parks. I can say that Calgarians and indeed all Canadians are 
extremely proud of their national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People come from around the world to take in the beauty of our 
country.  In fact, our national parks and sites attract over 24 
million visitors yearly and contribute over $2 billion annually 
to the economy. While dollars do matter, we should not let this 
alone determine our commitment to preserving our parklands.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that this bill will allow our national parks to 
flourish while at the same time dramatically reducing the amount 
of government resources needed to administer them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-29 calls for the creation of a new agency, the Canadian 
parks agency.  Nine times out of ten I cringe when I hear of the 
birth of yet another bureaucratic monolith.  This usually means 
that the Canadian taxpayer is on the hook to pump in maximum 
dollars for minimum results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in this case I see some merit in the establishment of 
the Canadian parks agency.  Let me explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parks Canada is currently responsible for our country's 38 
national parks and, among other things, 131 national historic 
sites.  It manages over 225,000 square kilometres of Canada's 
natural and cultural heritage and employs roughly 5,000 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present responsibility for Parks Canada falls under the 
Department of Canadian Heritage through the Secretary of State 
for Parks who reports to the heritage minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new agency will remain accountable, through the minister, to 
Parliament.  Perhaps the most significant change will be that the 
new proposed agency will be able to raise and keep its own 
revenue.  This will no doubt contribute to more efficiency and 
will hopefully lead to a decrease in the fees Canadians pay to 
gain access to our national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard on numerous occasions from my constituents that the 
costs of visiting places like Banff and Jasper are too high.  The 
user fees keep going up and up, discouraging Canadians from 
visiting the national parks to see their own heritage.  We have 
an obligation to the people of Canada to make it as affordable as 
possible for families to take advantage of this beautiful 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nice to see that once in a very long while the government 
gets it right.  In this instance the Liberals have acknowledged 
that self-sufficiency in government is the right route to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian parks agency will be able to raise and keep its own 
revenue.  It will have access to $10 billion for parks and 
historic sites.  Normally this is where the taxpayer alarm would 
sound.  Another $10 billion of people's hard earned money will be 
spent?  However, in this instance any funds drawn from the $10 
billion account will be repayable to the crown with interest from 
revenue generated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, third party operators will be permitted to administer 
certain facilities.  Outsourcing to private business will improve 
service, increase revenue and deliver improved efficiency.  This 
new financial independence will allow the revenue generated to 
flow back into the parks and sites.  This in turn will allow for 
the establishment and expansion of new initiatives.  What this 
means is that new parks will be created and those already in 
existence will be better maintained.  This is how the government 
should work when it comes to areas such as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will be able to bargain directly with its employees. 
The CEO will have the authority to appoint employees and 
establish terms and conditions of employment for agency staff. 
Hopefully this will afford the agency the flexibility to develop 
a human resource regime which is more responsive to the agency's 
operational requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of accountability, the agency will fall under the 
minister of heritage.  She, in turn, will be accountable to 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the Canadian parks agency will fall under the Access 
to Information Act.  The auditor general will be able to audit 
the agency at his discretion.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-29 also commits the agency to hold consultations on a 
biannual basis.  This will allow Canadians to share their views 
on the agency's program and to participate in the management 
direction.  This is especially important because we have to be 
very careful that development is also balanced with the 
environmental requirements to maintain the parks.  The 
maintaining of our environment is also very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will consult directly with parties that may be 
affected by any new fees.  This hopefully will bring more 
reasonable fees for Canadians to enter into the national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that Parliament, the auditor general and, 
most important, the Canadian people will be able to hold this new 
agency accountable.  What we have is a bill asking for the 
creation of an agency that will be fully self-sufficient, more 
efficient, more flexible and fully accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also my hope that this new agency will contribute to the 
maintenance and enhancement of Canada's natural environment. This 
will ensure that future generations will be able to enjoy the 
many natural wonders that Canada has to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was proud to be in this House supporting the legislation 
introduced by the government which established the Saguenay 
marine park, the first marine park in the world.  It was my 
pleasure to support that bill.  I firmly believe that we have a 
moral duty to preserve Canada's natural environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the official opposition is committed to having our 
national parks and heritage sites administered in an accountable, 
efficient and cost effective manner.  For the reasons outlined 
above I see little reason why I should not support Bill C-29.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member spoke at the beginning of his debate about hope, 
and at the end he also spoke of hope.  How much hope do we have 
in the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listen to this party every day which talks about the 
obligations of the government and the patronage appointments. Now 
we are allowing another agency with a chief executive office to 
be created by this government for another plum patronage 
appointment. We are allowing the government to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other side will be going to question period raising an issue 
about appointments in the other place.  How can people trust your 
point of view over what the Liberal government is proposing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a capitalist form of commercialization of our national 
parks and eventually privatization when hon. members take their 
children, pay at the toll gate to lift the Stornoway gate up, 
enter Walt Disney national park and come out and negotiate the 
fee with the minister if she deems them to be of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency does not create any assurances of your hopes of the 
ecological integrity of the national parks of increasing the 
amount of national parks that we have in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I remind hon. members 
that it works best if members address each other through the

respond to the hon. member's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is right, I said hope.  I did not give a full commitment 
about that.  I do hope the government will not build this thing 
up with a patronage appointment.  Please do not do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is right regarding the question about whether this agency is 
going to consult people.   It has the ability to consult people 
and to talk to Canadians.  There is the question of who has the 
input over this. 
There is still a bureaucratic tangle over there. Some will say 
they do not trust those people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I find it interesting the evolution of this Liberal 
government's financing to its departments.  In the last 
Parliament I was not here.  I was out in the constituency and I 
was aware of what was going on.  It financed the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police to the tune of $100 million to set up 13 
integrated proceeds of crime sections.  The RCMP was forced to 
borrow that $100 million and is now in the process of paying it 
back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see there has been an evolution in this 36th Parliament to a 
full retention and reinvestment authority for all revenues. I 
wonder if this, in the hon. member's opinion, would be a good 
thing to extend to the RCMP to fight crime, to have the moneys 
retained and reinvested in fighting crime as opposed to paying it 
back to the Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what this has to do with 
this bill is that we are creating an agency which is responsible 
for keeping and administering the funds, not disappearing into 
the government coffers.  I think that is what the hon. member is 
alluding to for the RCMP. This is a good point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are supporting this one good idea of the 
government.  Maybe this idea will spread to other institutions as 
well, including the RCMP, if it is feasible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should start looking into this and doing these 
kinds of things more often. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage.  I believe him to be a sincere member of 
Parliament.  I believe that what he was stating was what he feels 
is accurate and true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate that he is speaking on behalf of the minister, but 
he said that he knew we had a lot of questions about this bill 
but trust him, they will act in the best interests of Canadians. 
We could count on them reflecting the views of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the same folks who were against NAFTA, for example. 
These are the same folks who were against the GST.  When they got 
into government they became GST enthusiasts, NAFTA enthusiasts 
and now they are MAI enthusiasts.  They even thought the GST was 
so good they would apply it in a blended sales tax throughout all 
of Atlantic Canada, knowing full well the people did not like 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a government says trust it, I become very suspicious.  It 
is not a reflection on my hon. friend. When any government says 
trust it, it will act in our best interests, there is sufficient 
evidence to say that we ought to then panic.  We then ought to 
say we know we are being conned, we know there is a snow job 
coming upon us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can probably tell I do not support Bill C-29 at this 
point.  I know today we are debating the principle of the bill 
and one ought to be generous when talking about the principle of 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill says we should change the name of Parks Canada to the 
Canadian parks agency.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is behind all of this?  Why would he want to change the 
name Parks Canada?  I suspect that if a global poll was done and 
citizens from Bangladesh, Dubai, Equador or wherever were asked: 
when you hear the name Canada what do you think about, what image 
comes to mind, it would probably be a toss up between a Mountie 
and some natural scenes, some park like settings, some pristine 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is Canada.  We are a geographic country, a country 
that is proud of our geographic heritage, the second largest 
country in the world.  Canada is probably the most untouched 
pristine environment to be found anywhere on the globe. Our 
national parks system epitomizes that.  Our national parks are 
sort of a Canadian icon that we leave for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that we have expanded a number of national 
parks over the last number of years in some very crucial areas. I 
am proud to say that I am from British Columbia, a province that 
has established more parks than any political jurisdiction in the 
world, and for good reason.  It is a tremendously and wonderfully 
beautiful province.  Vast parts of it will now be preserved for 
generations and generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theory of Parks Canada, or what is soon going to be called 
the Canadian Parks Agency, I think tells a great deal about 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this act intended to improve the situation?  From the 
government's point of view, I suspect it must think it is 
otherwise it probably would not introduce the act.  Remember, 
these are the same folks who think the GST is a good idea and 
that the MAI is a good idea at this point, but I suspect they are 
going to change their minds on that eventually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government thinks it is a good idea let us be 
clear.  Does it necessarily mean it is a good idea?  The fact 
that we gave the Bronfmans a $500 million tax break does not 
necessarily mean that was a good decision taken by the 
government.  Just the fact that it is a government sponsored bill 
does not necessarily say that this is in the best interest of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us also acknowledge that this bill involves a great deal of 
Canada, 31 national parks, 786 historical sites, a number of 
historical canal systems, 661 sites that are managed by third 
parties that are ecologically or environmentally significant, 165 
heritage railroad stations, 31 heritage river systems and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I suspect you and I would agree that the things 
that distinguish our country from virtually any other country is 
what we are talking about today, the natural geographic and 
historical significant parts of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We take this very seriously.  As New Democrats we have studied 
Bill C-29.  I want to say the hon. member for Churchill has spent 
hours and hours speaking with people who are involved in the 
parks system, speaking with people involved in Heritage Canada, 
knowledgeable people on the ground as well as in the park theory 
field.  On balance, he tells us as caucus colleagues that he is 
concerned about this bill, that the kind of impression that he 
gleans from these extensive consultations is one of concern and 
worry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, not many people think this is a good idea. 
I suspect that we would save a great deal of trouble by just 
cancelling Bill C-29 when we come to the vote but I am not so 
neophyte to think that is likely to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The background papers on Bill C-29 say that this is a 
contribution toward simplicity, toward administrative efficiency, 
toward human resource flexibility, toward improved financial 
procedures.  These are euphemisms.  These are words that George 
Orwell would have liked because when it says here human resource 
flexibility, what it means is that we want to lower wages and 
salaries of the people who work with Parks Canada, we want to pay 
people less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I have this idea?  Why do I have this perhaps 
questionable or cynical approach to this human resource 
flexibility?  It is because this is what is going on now with the 
Department of National Defence, that all the hundreds and 
thousands of civilian employees who work now on bases, who are 
paid a decent wage because of the collective agreements that have 
been negotiated year after year, are now being told they are all 
gone.  We are going to privatize and rather than pay $15 an hour, 
employees are now going to collect a minimum wage of probably 
$5.50 depending on their provincial jurisdiction.  That is the 
reality.  That is what is taking place today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is what the Department of National Defence is doing, why 
would we not think that is what this Canadian Parks Agency is 
going to do?  That is what the government is doing, so we assume 
that what they do in national defence they will do now with the 
national parks agency.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, when the government talks about human resource 
flexibility, let us be clear that is what it means.  We are going 
to have fewer people working in our parks, pay them less and have 
less dedicated personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As someone who has used our national park system from coast to 
coast, both national and provincial, spending a good deal of the 
summer hiking, camping, canoeing and riding in these pristine 
environmental areas, if there is a group of men and women who 
epitomize the best of Canada it is those people who work in our 
park system.  They are dedicated to the environment and to the 
work that they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when we pay someone the minimum wage as opposed to a 
decent salary now in Parks Canada, what is the signal we are 
sending?  The signal is that we do not think much of this job. 
We are saying it is a low end job, a minimum wage job and a job 
that anybody can do.  We are saying it is a job we attach little 
significance to.  That is what we are telling them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think this is the way it should be in our society but 
in our society, which is a money based, capital based society, we 
measure people's value by what they are paid.  Hockey players who 
are paid $3 million are the superstars or rock stars.  Others, I 
think it is fair to say, who are paid minimum wage are not 
normally those people who we hold in high esteem as a society.  I 
think it should be the reverse but that is the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about improved financial procedures.  That is scary 
language.  If there is any language that should get us totally 
upset in this House it is when the government starts talking 
about improved financial procedures because everyone knows what 
that means.  It means less money.  It means it is going to put 
less money into Parks Canada and it is going to make the people 
who use our parks pay for them in user fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone is a wealthy person or from a high income family and 
somebody tells them that in order to use the parks they will have 
to pay $10 to canoe down the river, $20 per night for firewood 
and $50 to park a tent for a day or two, it is no big deal. 
However, for increasing numbers of Canadians who see their 
disposable incomes going down and down, and for many people to 
zero and below, if we pass this legislation we are going to put 
access to Canada's national parks out of the reach of many, many 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An increasing number of Canadians who fall into the poor and low 
income category will not have the benefit of using our national 
parks because they will not be able to afford them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many of us as members of Parliament already hear regularly 
from our constituents complaining about the costs of accessing 
parks?  A family with four and five kids who want to go camping 
for two weeks in a national park will not be able to afford it. 
With this legislation, we are now going to make it even more 
difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 24 of the act deals with the fees.  It states that “the 
minister must consult with any member who he or she considers to 
be interested”.  That is the consultation.  Who is that?  Maybe 
she is going to consult with the hon. House leader for the 
government.  Maybe it is going to be the CEO of the Royal Bank. 
We do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the track record, we can only assume that this 
does not mean good news.  This does not mean that fees are going 
to go down.  It means I suppose how quickly they are going to 
increase.  Is that the kind of country we have become?  Is that 
the kind of place Canada has become?  Are people going to have to 
pay to go canoeing or to walk down the paths in our parks?  Yes 
it is and this legislation will simply make it worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is scary.  I suspect that the government wants 
to get this through the House really quickly before anybody 
figures out what it is all about.  I assume that my friends in 
the Reform Party, in the Bloc and in the Conservative Party will 
vote against it, and at least enough Liberals who are concerned 
about the environment and the future of Parks Canada will vote 
against.  However, we will have to wait and see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that Bill C-29 is not about privatization. 
That is simply not true.  It is not called privatization, it is 
called commercialization.  It is a new word.  Privatization is 
now considered by an increasing number of people to be bad news, 
not a good word, so it decided to change the word and call it 
something else. 
We will call it a commercialization.  Fair enough.  That is what 
it means.  That is what it is.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It simply means that increasingly we will be turning the parks 
into some kind of a quasi-business operation.  That is not what 
Canada is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to close my remarks by saying let me look at this 
government.  This year we are going to see cuts to Parks Canada's 
budget.  This is at a time when the government proudly tells us 
that we are in a balanced budget situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, we have some billions of dollars in 
surplus.  There is so much money rolling in these days that the 
government is not quite sure what the surplus is.  It is not 
positive.  Next year, it looks like it will be at some 
unimaginable level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the problem the government has, if it does not know 
how much money it is collecting, why would it continue to cut 
services in Canada's national parks?  Why would it continue to 
lay off park employees?  Why would it continue to make life 
difficult for people who are trying to run our heritage sites if 
that is the situation?  They tell us it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect at the Liberal convention in the next few hours, we 
will see most Liberals with their arms in slings come Monday 
because they will be slapping themselves on the back for days on 
end, twisting themselves out of shape to say what a great job 
they have done balancing the budget.  Still they want to impose 
this kind of damage on our park system.  There are some serious 
inconsistencies here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on but I think I have probably said enough at this 
introductory stage.  To repeat, I think the beginning of the 
massive change game, if there was another symbol other than the 
national parks, is the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no other police force in the world any better than the 
RCMP.  It represents the best of Canada, both past and present. 
I suspect it will also represent the best in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the government decide to do?  It decided to sell the 
rights of making money off the RCMP to Walt Disney.  Disney now 
has the right to market Mounties around the world. There are 
little Mountie dolls, Mountie hats, Mountie statues in China, in 
Taiwan and it is all done by the great corporation of Disney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is anything that is kind of embarrassing, I will bet 
the House leader for the government that there is not a single 
Canadian, other than himself, who thinks this is a good deal, who 
would actually stand up and say that one of the best things we 
have done as a Liberal government was to hand over the RCMP 
selling rights to Disney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government endorsed it.  It liked this idea.  I can imagine 
the members getting all excited and having a party that night 
when that happened.  That is where we are. “We sold out the 
image Mountie to Walt Disney.  Okay, we have done that”.  There 
goes a little Canadian heritage out the window. “Why not 
privatize the national parks?  We will call it commercialization 
or we will call it a special agency”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I will leave it at that and simply end by saying that as 
New Democrats—thanks to our critic, the hon. member for 
Churchill—we have looked at this bill.  We have talked about it 
in caucus at some length. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can honestly say that we cannot find a single good point in 
this legislation.  I will watch because, as I sit down, I suspect 
we will get to the vote.  I will watch my friends in the Reform 
Party.  They are sensitive people in certain areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not found any yet, but somewhere down there there is a 
sensibility or a sensitivity.  We will watch them because this is 
the chance.  How do we vote in terms of the future of Parks 
Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we turn it into the Canadian parks agency, a private 
corporation to make money now out of our national parks system, 
or do we continue in the great tradition of Parks Canada to 
preserve our natural environment for generations and generations 
to come? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the question.  We will decide it on this vote. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am quite interested in the financial aspects of this 
bill.  Therefore I will make my question to the speaker quite 
simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What effect does he see, if any, of the MAI agreement that could 
come down on our national parks system in Canada?  Is there a 
possibility of foreign interests getting involved in our parks 
system?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
that very thoughtful and insightful question.  I think he knows 
the answer but has given me the opportunity to say what I think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the answer is yes.  According to a provision in the 
MAI any law that is passed like the recent law on MMT and that 
eliminates the right of a private corporation to make profits 
will be considered to be a form of expropriation.  Consequently 
today the Government of Canada is in court, so to speak, with 
Ethyl Corporation of the United States because it is being sued 
for passing legislation against the MMT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine a significant ecological site next door to a 
potential mine.  A decision is being taken, after the MAI is 
signed and after a German mining company has shown interest in 
developing the mine, to turn that area into a park for future 
generations.  That decision would be challenged under the 
provisions of the MAI as a form of expropriation to that 
theoretical German mining company.  The government would have to 
compensate with hundreds of millions of dollars to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is only part of the problem.  The real problem is the chill 
effect of that threat.  The government knows that if it makes a 
park of that area the German mining company will sue it for 
hundreds of millions of dollars.  It probably will not make it 
into a park although it knows it should.  In consideration of 
future generations of Canadians the government knows that it must 
be made into a park, but because it knows it will be sued and it 
will lose, it is chilled and will not do it.  It will chicken 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess we can call it the chicken out factor in the MAI that I 
would be concerned about.  I appreciate the question from my hon. 
friend. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the speech of the NDP member from British Columbia. I 
am happy we are on the same side of an issue, which shows that 
people can get past politics to serve the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has some beautiful national parks in his province.  I 
would like to think we have one in the province of Saskatchewan. 
The lack of a long range plan for parks across Canada bothers me 
more than anything else in the legislation.  Could the member 
comment on how he sees this shortfall in the lack of a long range 
plan for parks across the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is unusual to have these 
thoughtful questions coming our way.  I appreciate the 
seriousness of my colleague's question.  When I think of the 
great province of Saskatchewan, one of the first images that 
comes to mind is the Waskesiu Park, one of the most beautiful in 
Canada.  The member should be proud to live in such a province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His question is well taken.  We lack a national park policy that 
makes any sense just as we lack a national waterways policy or a 
national highway policy.  Let us think of the value of our 
national park system and related parks, the value of waterways 
and the value of highways in Canada compared with any country in 
the world.  It is rather peculiar to think that we do not have a 
national policy in these areas.  The glaring shortcoming, as my 
friend point out, is well taken.  We need to have a national 
policy to build the kind of legislation that allegedly is 
attached to the bill.

<A NAME="LINK70">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (for the Minister of National Defence)</B> 
moved that Bill C-25, an act to amend the National Defence Act 
and to make consequential amendments to other acts, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to speak 
on Bill C-25, an act to amend the National Defence Act and to 
make consequential amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will strengthen the statutory framework 
governing the operations of the Department of National Defence 
and the Canadian forces, in particular the administration of 
military justice.  It ensures an effective and fair military 
justice system, one that is capable of operating in conflict or 
peace in Canada or abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four key components to Bill C-25 as it relates to 
military justice.  First, these changes will enhance transparency 
and provide greater structure to the exercise of individual 
discretion in the investigation and the charging process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the amendments will modernize the powers and procedures 
of service tribunals, including the elimination of the death 
penalty under military law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the amendments will strengthen oversight and review the 
administration of military justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the amendments will clarify, for the first time in the 
act, the roles and responsibility of the key figures in the 
military justice system and set clear standards of institutional 
separation for the investigative and prosecutorial defence and 
judicial functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am especially pleased to speak in support of the changes on 
behalf of the minister, clarifying the roles of these key figures 
in military justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we picture the manner in which the Canadian system of 
criminal justice functions in our cities and towns, there are 
four sets of key figures:  the investigators, the prosecutors, 
the defence counsel and the judges.  Each set of figures performs 
a discrete function in the criminal justice system.  It is the 
interaction of these independent figures, each with a determined 
role, that produces fair outcomes in individual cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of these figures can be found in the military justice 
system.  However, until recently their functions were largely 
carried out under the umbrella of the chain of command. 
Furthermore, the institutional separation between them was not as 
pronounced as in civilian criminal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further complicating feature of military justice in Canada is 
that the Minister of National Defence has been assigned a variety 
of quasi-judicial duties under the act.  This has meant that he 
played an active role in the administration of individual cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The roles, responsibilities and duties of the key figures are 
not precisely set out in the National Defence Act as it is 
presently laid out.  This lack of precision has led to confusion, 
uncertainty and misunderstanding about the respective functions 
and relationships in delivering justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that these roles are clearly separated and to provide 
objective guarantees that cases will be administered impartially, 
Bill C-25 establishes the duties and institutional relationships 
among the prosecution, defence and judicial functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end there are five important features of the bill.  It 
will remove the minister from the day to day administration of 
individual cases.  It will set out the qualifications and role of 
the judge advocate general as legal adviser in relation to 
military law.  It will fully separate the prosecution function at 
courts martial from the military chain of command by establishing 
the position of director of military prosecutions.  The director 
will be appointed by the minister and responsible under the 
general supervision of the judge advocate general for the 
conducting of all prosecutions at courts martial.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will provide for the appointment of a director of defence 
counsel services whose sole responsibility will be the provision 
of legal services to accused persons in proceedings under the 
code of service discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it will provide explicitly for independent military 
judges to be appointed by the governor in council for a fixed 
term.  Military judges are not responsible to the chain of 
command in the performance of their judicial duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the minister's role.  The National Defence Act 
assigns the minister with the management and direction of the 
Canadian forces and all matters relating to national defence. 
This includes responsibility for administration of military 
justice.  The act also gives the minister a variety of powers and 
responsibilities relating to the day to day administration of the 
code of service discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report of the special advisory group on military justice and 
military police investigation services, chaired by the Right Hon. 
Brian Dickson, former chief justice of the Supreme Court of 
Canada, recommended the elimination of the vast majority of the 
minister's duties and responsibilities for the administration of 
individual cases under the code of service discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 implements that recommendation.  This approach will 
avoid perceptions of interference or conflict of interest in the 
administration of individual cases and will enable the minister 
to devote more time to his or her normal political and policy 
role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to address the responsibility of the judge 
advocate general.  The JAG, as he is known in the armed forces, 
has advised the department and the Canadian forces on military 
history and law since 1911.  However, the National Defence Act 
does not set out his duties and this has contributed to 
uncertainty about his roles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the Dickson advisory group and the Somalia commission of 
inquiry recommended that the roles of the JAG be clarified 
through amendments to the act.  Bill C-25 clearly sets out the 
JAG's duties and functions as legal adviser to the governor 
general, the Minister of National Defence, the Department of 
National Defence, and the Canadian forces in matters of military 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the judge advocate general will superintend the 
administration of military justice in the Canadian forces.  In 
fulfilling this mandate the JAG will be required to conduct 
regular reviews and file an annual report to the minister, a 
report which the minister must table in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes, in addition to clarifying the JAG's duties, will 
improve the oversight and review of the administration of 
military justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Defence Act is currently silent on the important 
role of the prosecutor at courts martial.  In this regard both 
the Dickson advisory group and the Somalia commission recommended 
the establishment of a military prosecutor, independent of the 
chain of command, to deal with serious disciplinary and criminal 
charges and to be responsible for the conduct of all cases before 
courts martial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prosecutorial independence is a basic element in our criminal 
justice system.  A clear separation between the prosecution 
function at courts martial and the chain of command provides 
greater assurance that prosecution decisions will be free from 
external influences and conflicts of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 will achieve this objective through the establishment 
of the position of director of military prosecutions.  In order 
to reinforce the director's independence from the chain of 
command, the director will be appointed for a fixed term of four 
years and will report to and act under the general supervision of 
the judge advocate general.  In order to ensure ministerial 
accountability for military justice, the JAG's directions to the 
director will be required in writing and the minister will be 
informed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subject to certain limitations designed to protect the 
administration of justice in individual cases, the director will 
also have the duty to ensure that these directions are available 
to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Dickson advisory group also recommended that the judge 
advocate general's duties in respect of his or her separate 
defence and prosecution functions be set out in the National 
Defence Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 establishes a clear institutional structure for the 
defence function.  It establishes a director of defence counsel 
services whose sole function will be to provide and co-ordinate 
the provision of prescribed services to persons subject to the 
code of service discipline.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These services include legal assistance to persons detained or 
arrested acting as defence counsel at courts martial and certain 
appeals and providing legal advice to individuals making an 
election to be tried by courts martial or summary trial. The 
judge advocate general will supervise the overall provision of 
these services. To protect the solicitor-client privilege of 
accused persons, the judge advocate general will not be allowed 
to give specific directions in individual cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These institutional arrangements will enhance the separation 
between military defence counsel and other figures in the system. 
They will provide greater assurance of independent legal advice 
for those who need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the judicial function, whereas the minister 
currently appoints officers to perform judicial duties, Bill C-25 
will provide a statutory basis for the independence of these 
military judges.  It will do this by authorizing the governor in 
council to appoint military judges to a fixed five year term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments have a positive impact on how the military 
justice system is organized and conducted.  The amendments secure 
a statutory basis for the authority exercised by key figures in 
the military justice system.  The result is a modernized national 
defence act which for the first time explicitly defines the 
independent roles and functions discharged by each actor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When viewed in their totality, these amendments will strengthen 
the Canadian forces as a vital national institution by promoting 
discipline, efficiency, high morale and justice among the men and 
women of the forces. I urge all members to support Bill C-25. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak on Bill C-25, an act to amend the 
defence act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I will talk about the stated purpose of the bill. Then by 
focusing on three different areas I will talk about what I think 
in reality is in this piece of legislation. The first area I will 
focus on is the reform to the military police. Second will be the 
reform to the office of the judge advocate general. Third will be 
something that is completely missing from this legislation, which 
is an implementation of an independent inspector general.  I will 
focus on these three areas as I give the opposition reaction to 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by talking about a component that is completely 
missing from the legislation and in fact from government when it 
comes to our military.  The component which is completely missing 
is a true commitment to the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 amends the Department of National Defence Act.  The 
government says that this bill is presented to make substantial 
changes to the military justice system in the Canadian Armed 
Forces. It goes on to say that Bill C-25 does that by clarifying 
the role and responsibilities of various players. Also it 
separates on an institutional basis the system's investigative, 
prosecutorial, defence and judicial functions.  It is intended to 
complete summary trial reform.  It will reform sentencing 
regulations.  These are the things the government says this 
legislation will do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will establish two independent oversight bodies 
external to the Canadian forces.  The first is the Canadian 
forces grievance board and the second is the military police 
complaints commission.  It will require both of these boards and 
the judge advocate general to file annual reports to the minister 
which will be tabled before Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will require the Minister of National Defence to 
have the National Defence Act reviewed and reported back to 
Parliament in five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will also abolish the death penalty as a 
punishment and will substitute it with life imprisonment for 
crimes committed in the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be fair, there are some positive changes in this bill.  I 
will focus on three areas.  First I want to say that these 
changes while positive, absolutely do not go far enough.  For 
that reason, Reform cannot support the bill at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Substantial amendments to the bill are needed.  We will be 
presenting amendments at committee and at report stage.  If 
substantial amendments are accepted then possibly we could 
support this bill, but we feel that substantial amendments are 
needed. To demonstrate this I am going to focus on three areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A critical area is that of implementing the position of an 
independent inspector general.  This is something Reform has been 
proposing for some time and it was actually recommended recently 
in the report on the Somalia inquiry. Unfortunately it is not 
included anywhere in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There currently is an inspector general.  It is important to 
clarify this.  The inspector general in the forces right now is 
not independent in any way from the military rank system.  The 
powers are very narrow.  The way it has been described to me is 
that the inspector general is there now more to inspect that the 
uniforms are right, that people are wearing them properly, that 
type of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly that is not the role we see for the independent 
inspector general.  We see a very substantive role.  We feel it 
is a role which is critical to fixing the military so that it is 
an organization which functions well to protect Canadians.  That 
is the purpose of the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Somalia inquiry recommended the creation of an independent 
inspector general.  The government again has completely ignored 
that key recommendation of the Somalia inquiry in this 
legislation.  This is despite the fact that the minister in the 
press release announcing this legislation said that part of the 
reason for this legislation was to respond to the recommendations 
of the inquiry.  He has completely missed this critical aspect of 
the Somalia inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has shown very clearly that he does not want an 
independent inspector general in the Canadian military.  He said 
they did not need some outsider looking over their shoulders. 
That attitude is upsetting. We expect in Canada that we will have 
an outsider looking over the shoulders of those who run the 
military. Those outsiders are the Canadian public represented in 
the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also suggest that the independent inspector general 
could do a lot to head off some of the key problems before they 
become big news stories.  These have plagued the military and 
have done a lot of damage to morale over the past several years. 
The independent inspector general is not just to dig out dirt on 
what goes on inside the military, far from it.  The real key 
purpose is to find these concerns, to listen to men and women 
inside the forces and to act before there is another smudge on 
the military through some big story in the media. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly the only media stories we need regarding the 
military are positive stories which right now are completely 
missed.  There are many positive stories that should be told 
about the military.  We have excellent men and women serving in 
the military.  We have some excellent people in command positions 
in the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have an awful lot of very serious problems particularly 
in those command positions and other problems regarding the men 
and women which have driven morale to an unprecedented low.   We 
certainly saw this as we travelled with the defence committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do need someone looking over the military's shoulder and not 
just Parliament, although we certainly need more of that, but we 
also need an independent inspector general.  I do not think there 
is any doubt from events in the past and the recommendations of 
the Somalia inquiry and some of the things that came out that 
this position is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's response to this position was the minister 
announced the creation of the position of ombudsman in the fall 
of 1997. He agreed to create that post following the 
recommendations of the Somalia inquiry.  That was another 
separate position that was recommended in the Somalia inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister still has not followed through on that commitment. 
Bill C-25 would seem to be a logical piece of legislation to 
implement the minister's version of the ombudsman, which by the 
way is much different from the version of the ombudsman that was 
recommended by the Somalia inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes we are debating here today do not mention the 
position of ombudsman at all.  Not only has the independent 
inspector general been left out, but also the ombudsman has been 
completely left out in spite of the fact that the minister has 
called for this position to be created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the minister's own briefing notes on his idea of 
the ombudsman, which is much different from the idea of the 
ombudsman that was presented in the Somalia inquiry, he made it 
very clear that the position would have very little power and 
would not really affect the changes that are needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to quote the minister, he says that the ombudsman has no 
formal authority, does not conduct formal investigations, makes 
no formal recommendations and publishes no report of findings. 
The ombudsman is a member of the organization but not a part of 
its management structure.  Rectification of problems continues to 
remain within the chain of command.  As pointed out and 
recommended by the minister, that is the reality of what the 
ombudsman would do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do we not have the independent inspector general in 
this legislation, but there is no mention at all of the ombudsman 
in spite of the fact that the minister has actually said that he 
would institute an ombudsman.  Those are the two glaring holes we 
see in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second area I am going to focus on is the office of the 
judge advocate general.  I question whether there is a need for a 
change to the office of the judge advocate general.  If we are 
making changes, we had better know there is a need for them.  It 
has been demonstrated pretty well that there is a need for major 
reform to the office of the judge advocate general. The 
unfortunate thing about this is that the changes proposed in this 
legislation do not solve the basic problems which I will talk 
about in a minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First to answer the question of whether there is a need for 
change, clearly there is.  In the Somalia debacle, the lower 
ranks were blamed for the actions of the higher ranks. Documents 
were destroyed and officers lied on the stand.  This clearly 
points out the need for reform of the office of the judge 
advocate general.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Dean Marsaw case, which was a well publicized case, points 
that out.  There have been various individual courts martial that 
really show the need for reform in this office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bakovici hospital case in Bosnia and the way that was 
handled shows a clear need for reform in the office of the judge 
advocate general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most recently, in the Simone Olofson case that I brought before 
this House last week, a letter was written from the judge 
advocate general to this lady who made a presentation to the 
standing committee in Cold Lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She presented after the minister and the chief of defence staff 
said “We encourage members of the forces to present. They can be 
assured that there will only be positives that will come from 
this”. “We want to hear from people”, they said.  “Come, bare 
your souls.  Be witnesses before this committee and we will 
listen carefully.  We will take the information we get and try to 
make things better”.  That is what they said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did they do?  They sent a threatening letter to Simone 
Olofson.  They criticized her in the strongest terms for 
presenting before the committee.  There was a threat that really 
was not veiled that if she speaks out again she is going to be in 
trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This woman works on the base in Cold Lake on a contract basis. 
She is not a member of the forces.  Her father works on the base 
along with her father-in-law and her mother-in-law.  They can go 
through the list.  There are a lot of people in her family who 
depend on work at the base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judge advocate general, or perhaps it was the deputy judge 
advocate whose name was on the letter, actually pushed this thing 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This could have come from the minister.  We do not know.  It 
could have come from any rank higher than this person.  The way 
the military works, these people will write the letter they are 
told to write.  I do not want to lay the blame just on that 
individual, although clearly the letter was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said he apologized for it.  I did not really see 
much of an apology but at least he did acknowledge that it was 
wrong, that it never should have happened.  That letter shows 
clearly the need for some major reform in the office of the judge 
advocate general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Reform has said on this is that this office needs to be 
independent.  Currently the JAG is appointed by the privy council 
office on advice from the chief of defence staff and reports to 
the chief of defence staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can tell from that that really there is no freedom, that 
there is not the kind of independence that is needed in this 
office.  It was recommended again in the Somalia report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It needs to be recognized that conflict of interest between the 
judicial, the prosecutorial and the defence roles no longer 
exist.  We have been calling for that to be clearly separated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this legislation, if members were to read it and listen to 
the words that have been spoken about it, that happens.  In 
reality there really is not the independence and they all still 
answer to the chain of command. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That independence just is not there.  What is in this 
legislation is not as it is being presented by the government 
side.  That is pretty clear.  We have some great concerns about 
this office of the judge advocate general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister again says that the changes have been recommended 
in order to further strengthen the independence of the JAG. It is 
clearly not there.  His words just do not match up with what is 
in the legislation.  Prior to these amendments, the National 
Defence Act did not list the requirements for the JAG to be a 
military officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to do with this next minute or so is point out the 
changes that have been made in this legislation which actually 
make this appointment even less independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go through that step by step.  Prior to this legislation, 
the amendments to the National Defence Act did not require that 
the JAG be a military officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the National Defence Act states, the JAG will be an officer, 
a barrister or advocate with at least 10 years standing at the 
bar of a province.  That is what is stated partly in this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pool of individuals who would qualify for this position of 
judge advocate general, which was previously not limited by rank, 
has now been limited to a pool of very few people. 
Some say there are as few as four people in the military who 
would qualify under the guidelines which are laid out in the 
legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of making things better, it is pretty clear that this 
legislation makes things worse.  It narrows the pool even more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem with these changes, other than just the 
narrowing of the pool.  The JAG will still be within the chain of 
command.  He will have three levels of officers above him.  He 
will be outranked by approximately 25 individuals.  What we 
called for is more independence.  We suggested that the JAG be 
taken out of the normal chain of command. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that does not happen, he will be outranked by 25 people.  We 
know what that means in the military.  It means that when one of 
those 25 people give an order the JAG will listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rank system still allows for influence to be held over the 
JAG.  In fact, these changes will allow that to become law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present minister has already recognized the problem inherent 
in these amendments.  In making the most recent appointment last 
week, the minister went outside of the current list of serving 
candidates to recall a retired lieutenant-colonel to fill the 
position of JAG.  Lieutenant-Colonel Pitzul was promoted two 
rungs to become brigadier general, which is the required rank 
under this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This rank jumping negates the entire military hierarchical 
system which will make a mockery of the position.  That is a 
fundamental problem with what has been done with the office of 
the JAG by this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best person for the job may not be able to fill the 
position.  If he is a civilian he will not be able to do that 
unless he has the proper background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes, when we really look at them, will not increase 
the independence, as promised, but in fact will only make the 
system even more closed than before.  Clearly, the office of the 
judge advocate general has not been reformed in this legislation 
as it should have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third area is that of the military police.  I will not talk 
much about it, but I want to give a very brief outline of what 
has happened in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The military police should have been taken completely out of the 
chain of command and given more independence.  It is a very 
similar problem to that of the office of the judge advocate 
general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The military police should report to the attorney general in 
matters relating to the investigation of major disciplinary 
offences and criminal misconduct, particularly when the 
infractions occur in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judge Warren was commissioned to report on the military police. 
He recommended they not have the power in Canada to conduct 
criminal investigations, and yet this recommendation was 
completely ignored in Bill C-25.  It is another glaring gap in 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked about some of the specific problems with this 
legislation.  What I want to do now is talk about a missing 
component of this legislation and other legislation which may 
come forward.  That missing component is the commitment of 
government to the military.  That commitment must appear in three 
ways.  It must appear in words.  The government must reinforce, 
again and again, that the military is important to Canadians.  We 
need our military.  We need the kind of security which comes with 
a well trained and well equipped military.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing needed is commitment in terms of dollars, and I 
will talk a little about that.  The third is a commitment in 
terms of the change in the structure of the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the commitment in words, it might be thought words 
would be the easiest way a government could show commitment to 
the military.  I want to ask the following of any of the 
government members.  When is the last time a Liberal prime 
minister showed real commitment to the Canadian military? When is 
the last time a Liberal prime minister said we really need the 
military of this country?  When is the last time a Liberal prime 
minister said the men and women in the military were doing a good 
job or that the reason the military maybe is not functioning as 
well as it should is because of the basic structure of the 
military?  I challenge the members to find the last time the 
Prime Minister said things like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, one would have to look back a long way.  My guess would 
be about 30 years.  Clearly the commitment to the military 
has not been there in words in any way.  We have heard the 
defence minister on occasion show some support for the military. 
I think that is one of the jobs of the defence minister, but for 
the Prime Minister it has been an awful long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Give some credit to the Conservatives.  Certainly the 
Conservative government and former Prime Minister Mulroney did 
show a lot more respect for the military, did show more 
commitment to the military and did express our need for the 
military.  They did it not only in words, they did it in terms of 
dollars and in terms of change.  Those are the things I will talk 
about when I rise to complete my presentation after question 
period.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on Tuesday the Toronto Dominion Bank announced that the 
British Columbia economy is essentially in recession.  It is not 
hard to understand why.  For example, a Swedish company, Bolidon 
Limited, purchased Gibraltar Mines near Williams Lake less than 
three months ago.  Last week it announced that it is permanently 
closing this mine with a 12-year ore reserve still in the ground. 
What it really wanted were the Chilean mines in the deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two hundred and seventy-eight people will lose their jobs.  The 
economic spin-off of this closure will only add to the economic 
devastation felt by the community as a result.  The actions of 
both the provincial and federal governments have had an enormous 
detrimental impact on my riding of Cariboo—Chilcotin and on the 
entire province of British Columbia.  While the national 
unemployment rate is falling, it rose by almost .5% last month to 
9.7% which is higher than it was when this Liberal government 
began its economic reforms in 1994.

yesterday, when I asked the heritage minister about Option Canada, she

</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand from the minister's comments that she is

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing about Bloc members is that, when they do not

is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  On March 21, United Nations 
international day for the elimination of racism, a white 
supremacist meeting in Oliver, British Columbia, will try to 
solicit support for an Internet provider who has become an 
electronic news-stand for publications fostering hate against 
aboriginals, new Canadians, francophones, the Jewish community 
and other groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Racist groups are flaunting the law by using the Internet.  What 
is the government doing to ensure that Canada does not become an 
electronic safe haven for hate mongers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is a very important question.  It is an issue that 
concerns all of us who are both encouraged by the prospects and 
opportunities that new technology creates and mindful of the 
downside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the criminal laws that apply to hate or pornography in other 
forms of publication apply with equal force to the electronic 
media.  We will ensure they are enforced as stringently as 
possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as various 
white supremacist groups are now converging in the town of 
Oliver, British Columbia, the city hall has called for an 
expedited investigation of the problems regarding the regulating 
of Internet material, specifically racism and hate literature 
including such topics as neo-Nazi, white supremacist and 
anti-Semitic literature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internet providers should be responsible for hate material 
stored in their systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Justice take steps immediately to modernize 
the law to define the legal responsibility of Internet providers,

<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

Canada is hosting a number of international meetings that will 
touch on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a meeting of the OECD in October in Ottawa which 
will deal with electronic commerce and other aspects of the 
information highway.  As well, there will be an international 
conference held in Canada that will raise the very issues the 
hon. member has raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is complex from a legal point of view.  However, I believe it 
is key to understand that nothing distinguishes electronic 
communication from other forms of communication.  All aspects of 
the Canadian law with respect to pornography and hate mongering 
apply equally.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

has shown some upward movement recently.  The fact is that the 
only upward movement in the dollar is due to leadership, but not 
the leadership on that side of the House.

provinces for the health care system this government destroyed

</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent Informetrica report indicates that some 9,100 jobs will 
be lost in British Columbia by the year 2000 due to the increases

we have taken to put our fiscal house in order, to keep our

B.C. really got hosed when the Liberals decided to make political 
hay from essential infrastructure funding.  Communities 
throughout B.C. are still waiting.  Cities like Cranbrook have 
bills to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister blames B.C. but his excuses do not wash.  What 
about the culture and heritage grants where volunteer labour and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment,

What I said last week is that there is within my department 
resources available to deal with all enforcement issues 
necessary, including inspections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deputy minister was before the committee. He did respond 
that there is a review under way to find how we can reallocate 
some resources to make sure that we have effective enforcement 
within the department.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the 
minister is serious about inspections, she might want to listen 
to this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 26 one of the minister's officials stated when 
referencing what happens to a CEPA regulation in Ontario, “If we 
do not have the resources, then it basically sits in a file until 
an investigator is freed up, and if an investigator is not freed 
up over a period of a year or two years, then the file just gets 
closed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to know how many broken environmental regulations 
end up in a file that gets closed.

would then return to any leftover bills from Monday, followed by 
Bill S-4, the marine bill.

all hon. members, I would like to indicate the plans of the House 
for a little bit further.  I hope to be able to announce a

C-27, the coastal fisheries bill, Bill C-26, the grain bill, the 
Judges Act amendments introduced this morning, as well as Bill C-3 
and Bill S-5 if the Standing Committee on Justice and Human

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  All of the members are hollering for 
more, but I have to keep it to what I really have to say. I am 
pleased that the minister will be speaking and be open to 
questions.  I look forward to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I have said about this legislation is not as important as a 
key component that has been missing from this government and from 
Liberal governments over the past 30 years.  That component is a 
real show of support for and commitment to the Canadian military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before question period I was commenting on the three ways a 
government should show support for the military, the first being 
words, the second being money and the third being important and 
substantial change to the defence act and the way the defence 
department operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commented on the words.  To my knowledge, we have not seen a 
Liberal prime minister over the last 30 years stand up before the 
Canadian people and say very clearly that the Canadian military 
is absolutely essential to the security of Canadians in our 
country.  I have not heard that the men and women in the military 
are good people who do their jobs as well as they can in the 
system they are forced to work within.  I have not seen them show 
that kind of support for the people in the military.  We hear 
that from the minister of defence but clearly that is his job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely essential for the Prime Minister of this 
country, the top person within the government of this country, to 
come out and show strong support for the military.  Until that 
happens we are not going to have the proper level of morale, nor 
will we have a military that is functioning as well as it must 
function in order to offer the security that is so important for 
us.  That commitment has not been there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money is the second key commitment that must be made by 
government.  I go back to 1992 when Reform was putting together 
our zero in three plan, the plan to balance the budget in three 
years.  We campaigned on this in 1993 for the election.  In that 
plan we proposed reducing military funding from a level of about 
twelve and a half billion dollars a year down to about eleven 
billion dollars.  We thought that was absolutely necessary based 
on the financial condition of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has gone beyond $11 billion down to $9 billion a 
year that is being spent on the military.  Our military cannot 
operate properly at that level of funding.  The government has to 
show commitment by giving the men and women in the forces the 
proper equipment and the proper training.  The men and women in 
the military right now do not even have proper personal equipment 
including uniforms and combat equipment.  That is completely 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, they need the best in terms of more significant, 
larger equipment like helicopters.  There has been a promise to 
replace the search and rescue helicopters.  What about the 
shipborne helicopters?  We all know that the Sea Kings are unfit 
to fly.  They operate under much more severe conditions for the 
military than they do during civilian usage.  The military does 
not put as many hours on helicopters as the hours put on civilian 
choppers, but because of the vigorous and difficult conditions 
they operate under, they are not safe.  This government will 
offer a replacement at the very earliest by the year 2005.  That 
is the very earliest and that is not good enough. 
They just have not shown the commitment in terms of equipment and 
training.  That has to happen before we will have proper morale 
in the forces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, and this relates more directly to the piece of 
legislation that we are debating today, they have not shown a 
will, a desire or a direction when it comes to making the basis 
systemic changes that are needed to make this military operate 
properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation, quite frankly, does not cut it.  It is a 
series of half measures.  Some of them are good and move in the 
right direction.  However, when they are looked at and analysed, 
they really do not go anywhere near far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We oppose this legislation.  We will be making amendments and if 
the government will support our amendments, or put forth its own, 
offering the same kind of changes, then under those conditions we 
will support this legislation.  It really depends on the 
government and what it will allow in terms of its own amendments 
and amendments from us and other opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by saying once again that I am looking forward to 
the minister and his presentation at four o'clock.  I am looking 
forward to the questions that the opposition parties ask of the 
minister at that time. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I must say first that Bill C-25 is not only sizeable, but also 
ambitious. It is ambitious because it seeks to change our military 
justice system. For those who followed the work of the commission of 
inquiry into the deployment of Canadian forces to Somalia, we know very 
well that the present system has serious problems that deserve some 
special attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is among those who believe that the role of 
members of Parliament in defence issues must be reinforced. 
This does not mean that we must play a huge role overseeing the conduct 
and business of the military, but that we must oversee them in such a way as 
to break down the walls of national defence and the Canadian armed 
forces, in the best interests of people in Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be more effective in our role, we should have access to reports 
produced by non-political, independent organizations, such as those 
prepared by the auditor general. This is why, as the Létourneau 
commission recommended, we believe that an inspector general, working 
independently from the Canadian forces and accountable to Parliament, 
would ensure a fair, neutral and balanced analysis of the activities of 
the military, which the present bill will never be able to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Létourneau commission stated in its report “There is 
evidence that Canadians and members of the CF want a review process that 
is straightforward and independent. We also believe that a civilian 
inspector general, properly supported and directly responsible to 
Parliament, must form an essential part of the mechanism Canadians use 
to oversee and control the Canadian Forces”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if soldiers give up some of their rights when they join the 
army, they still expect to be treated fairly. During the Létourneau 
commission, some soldiers complained that their commanding officers were 
often insensitive to their concerns and that those who dared to complain 
faced informal retaliation or even put their careers in jeopardy. 
The members of the armed forces who feel the need to complain are faced 
with a dilemma: to suffer in silence or to fight the system and deal 
with the consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of an office of the inspector general would 
unquestionably meet the need for a fairer complaint processing 
mechanism. Instead of implementing the recommendation of the Létourneau 
commission and in order to really confuse the public and give the 
impression that he was agreeing to some kind of inspection, the Minister 
of National Defence chose to set up a review committee made up of eight 
distinguished Canadians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people will review the implementation of announced changes 
within the department and the armed forces. However, they will not have 
anything to say about the conduct of the armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the minister, these eight distinguished people will 
serve as a window for Canadians, a window that will be closed in two 
years since the mandate of the review committee does not extend beyond 
that period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will we be left with in the end? Simply a few annual reports 
here and there to meet accountability requirements. In short, we will 
not know anything more about the important things that will continue to 
go on in this galaxy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the Létourneau commission, we agree with the idea of 
appointing an inspector general of defence, who would be responsible for 
conducting investigations not only on the way the military justice 
system works, but also on any other aspect of national defence that he 
or she would deem appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any member of the Canadian Forces and any employee of the 
Department of National Defence could contact the inspector general 
directly for any reason without having to obtain prior authorization 
from anybody else within the Canadian Forces or the Department of 
National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that, right now, civil employees of the department are 
worried about the proposal to privatize services within the Canadian 
Forces and the possible consequences of such a decision in terms of job 
security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Longue-Pointe garrison, in Montreal's east end, it seems 
that the privatization process could result in the loss of 250 civilian 
and 150 military jobs. 
The same goes for the Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu garrison, where 300 jobs 
could disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inspector general would be the most appropriate authority to 
review any privatization of services by the Department of National 
Defence. An inspector general could address the individual or general 
problems of all DND and Canadian Forces personnel without these people 
having to fear some form of punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be able to express oneself freely without fear of retaliation is 
fundamental to anyone who wants to expose a delicate situation. 
Therefore, a member of the military should not be required to indicate 
to his or her superior that he or she is filing a complaint, especially 
if the complaint is against the superior. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inspections, checks, investigations or reports following a 
complaint by a member of the military should not give any indication 
whatsoever of the complainant's identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The threat of reprisal is not an imaginary concern. The hearings 
conducted by the Létourneau commission revealed that some members of the 
military had been threatened and badgered for their part in the 
commission's work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporal Purnelle and Major Armstrong were among them. The latter, 
in fact, required physical protection while in Somalia after he had made 
serious allegations of misconduct to his commanding officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By refusing to follow through with a proposal to create a position 
of inspector general, the defence minister is clearly showing that the 
armed forces do not intend to clean up their act and instead are 
determined to keep on operating in isolation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To justify his rejection of an independent review body, the 
minister said in the fall that the position of inspector general would 
cloud his authority before Parliament. It would make the 
responsibilities and accountability of the chief of the Defence staff 
and the deputy minister ambiguous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister even said that the high command did not want an 
inspector general constantly looking over their shoulder. However, the 
civil authorities have the duty to look over the shoulder of the 
military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the defence minister and the Canadian armed forces afraid 
of an institution which has a proven track record in the United States, 
and with which the American armed forces get along well? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT65"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT65"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1520

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the whole concept of accountability that is at stake. And by 
refusing to allow an independent control, the minister is reinforcing 
the idea that the government and the military are accountable to no one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the minister's promise to create an ombudsman 
position, something the military personnel are still waiting for, we 
must be clear. This position is not the same thing at all as an office 
of the inspector general. While the function of the ombudsman, or 
ombudswoman, if you will, is generally limited to receiving grievances 
and making recommendations in this regard, the inspector general would 
have wide ranging inspection, control, inquiry and assistance functions. 
The functions of the inspector would include those of the ombudsman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, as was recommended by the Létourneau commission, these two 
functions should be brought together and carried out by a single entity, 
that is the office of the inspector general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, if the national defence minister had really wanted to 
ensure greater openness in the military justice system, he would have 
supported the establishment of the position of inspector general. This 
would have indicated a clear willingness to make changes. So we can 
forget about openness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned a little earlier, the minister also stated, in his 
response to the recommendations of the Létourneau commission, that the 
implementation of the changes to the National Defence Act would increase 
the fairness and effectiveness of the military justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, in the Bloc Quebecois, believe that all military personnel must 
be treated fairly. 
They must, like any other Canadian citizen, be able to benefit from the 
constitutional guarantees provided by the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms. As the Létourneau commission said, the military justice system 
should follow the civil justice system, except when there are clear 
reasons to depart from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the question we must now ask ourselves is this: will the 
changes brought about by the bill ensure, as the defence minister is 
claiming, fairness in the military justice system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, this system is administered according to two main types 
of procedures, namely the summary trial and the court martial. Summary 
trials are aimed at dealing with minor military offences. 
This type of trial is at the heart of the military justice system, since 
more than 90% of all offences committed by members of the armed forces 
are only heard summarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually, summary trials are presided by commanding officers. The 
purpose of such trials is to deal quickly with disciplinary offences 
within the unit and to send the offender back to his or her unit as soon 
as possible. We understand that the goal to keep order and discipline 
within the armed forces somehow justifies the summary nature of this 
type of trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, during the hearings of the Special Advisory Group on 
Military Justice, chaired by former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court 
Brian Dickson, several members of the armed forces criticized the 
summary trial system of justice and even questioned its legitimacy, 
since it violates some of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to counsel and the right to be tried by an independent 
and impartial tribunal are both being violated. In that respect, this 
bill provides for minor changes to the summary trial process and appears 
to reinforce its constitutional validity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, the bill now prevents commanding officers from 
presiding at summary trials in which they are involved. Also, the 
accused person can have access to a lawyer before electing to be tried 
by court martial or by summary trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean that the accused has the right to counsel, only 
that he or she can consult with a lawyer. It is true that the commanding 
officer has the discretionary power to allow the accused to have access 
to a lawyer, but that is not a right granted to the accused, just a 
discretionary right enjoyed by the commanding officer.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of these few changes is quite simple. They are meant to 
change summary procedure just enough to let the commanding officers go 
on imposing their own discipline during summary trials. Even though this 
procedure still infringes on the constitutional rights of the accused to 
be heard by an impartial and independent court and to be represented by 
counsel, amendments in this bill will reduce the seriousness of these 
violations so that they can be reasonably justified under section 1 of 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section states that rights and freedoms are subject only to 
such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably 
justified in a free and democratic society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, the purpose of the bill is to make minimal changes to 
the summary procedure so that it can withstand any challenge under the 
charter, even if commanding officers are in no way impartial and 
independent in the legal sense defined by the supreme court in the 
Généreux case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the objective of maintaining order and discipline within the 
armed forces is important enough in itself to justify denying a 
constitutional right under certain circumstances, in wartime for 
example, we do believe that under normal circumstances, when the freedom 
of the accused is at stake, violating the right to be heard by an 
impartial and independent tribunal and the right to counsel, which are 
guaranteed by the Canadian Charter, is not justified under section 1 of 
the Charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constitutional guarantees provided by the Charter apply to all 
citizens, whether they are civilians or members of the military. In the 
absence of criminal sanctions, violating rights guaranteed under the 
Charter is not as serious an issue. It is, however, a different matter 
when the accused may lose his freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, section 7 of the Charter states that, “Everyone 
has the right to life, liberty and security of the person 
and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the 
principles of fundamental justice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision therefore guarantees the right to counsel of a 
person facing the risk of being deprived of his or her freedom. In 
addition, section 11(d) of the Charter entitles any person charged with 
an offence to a fair hearing. This right entails the right to counsel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that both the bill and the Queen's Regulations and 
Orders for the Canadian Forces provide that the accused may choose 
between summary and court martial proceedings when faced with a jail 
term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accused who chooses to be court martialled is entitled to 
counsel. Under the QR&Os, however, this right must be exercised within 
24 hours. 
If the accused chooses a summary trial, can we honestly say that he 
knowingly relinquished his constitutional right to counsel and to be 
heard by an impartial and independent tribunal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The choice between a summary trial and a court martial can have 
serious consequences. That is why we think the accused should be free to 
opt for a summary trial and have the right to counsel when faced with a 
jail term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the right of the accused to be heard by an impartial and 
independent tribunal, section 11(d) of the Charter provides that any 
person charged with an offence has the right to be presumed innocent 
until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an 
independent and impartial tribunal. 
So, in the case of disciplinary infractions punishable by detention, the 
accused should be heard by a totally impartial tribunal capable of 
making a decision on the sole basis of the evidence presented. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But can we seriously believe that, when a commanding officer 
presides over a summary trial, there is not a reasonable risk that 
the accused will be subject to prejudice?  The commanding officer 
will be required to judge a member of his unit and will probably 
have extensive knowledge of the accused's professional record. 
Furthermore, since the commanding officer is responsible to his 
superiors for the maintenance of discipline within his unit, he has 
a direct professional interest in the outcome of the summary trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The person making the decisions should not be influenced by 
the parties, or by outside forces, except in so far as he is 
convinced by the arguments and pleadings on the questions of law at 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we believe that breaches of discipline that may result 
in the suspension of liberty should be treated differently than 
other disciplinary offences.  In our view, only a more formal and 
independent tribunal offering the accused the right to call on 
the services of a lawyer, should have the power to hand down a 
30-day detention.  This having been done, the military justice 
system should provide the accused with procedural guarantees 
consistent with the charter.  The only way for a summary trial to 
ensure the accused these guarantees would be to restrict summary 
trials to offences not likely to result in criminal charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advent of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
obliged the Canadian forces to make adjustments to their military 
justice system in order to comply with charter rights and freedoms. 
When I say obliged, I am not exaggerating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On reading a study by Martin Friedland on the handling of 
military misconduct, I was astonished to learn that the armed 
forces tried, in the past, to obtain a general exemption from the 
application of the charter, but that the Department of Justice was 
opposed.  I admit that this says a great deal about how the 
military establishment viewed the charter.   The armed forces 
therefore had no choice, and had to comply with the charter in 
order to ensure the survival of their military justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Généreux case in 1992, the supreme court ruled that the 
court martial court in which this case was tried did not constitute 
an independent tribunal within the meaning of section 11(d) of the 
charter. 
Before the court could even bring down its decision, changes had 
already been made to the Queen's Regulations and Orders for the 
Canadian Forces, particularly to remedy the major shortcomings 
relating to the judiciary independence of the Judge Advocate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes called for military judges to be appointed for 
a set period of up to four years, but no less than two.  They also 
required the judges to hold no other duties for the duration of 
their mandate. These changes also called for the Chief Military 
Judge, and no longer the Judge Advocate General, to have the 
express power to appoint a judge advocate to the court martial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without running down the whole list of changes that have 
occurred since and the ones proposed by the bill, particularly 
those concerning the authority to call a court martial, we must 
admit that these amendments as a whole have considerably improved 
the military justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe, however, that the bill could have gone further in 
order to ensure greater independence for the military judges. 
These must be officers who have been barristers or advocates of at 
least 10 years' standing at the bar of a province. According to the 
bill, they are appointed during good behaviour for a term of five 
years, and this is an improvement over the current situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since military judges are appointed for only five years, 
unlike civilian judges who are appointed until they reach 
retirement age, there is no guarantee whatsoever that they would 
not be compromising their careers as military judges by bringing 
down judgments in favour of the accused rather than the 
prosecution.  I believe that military judges, like civilian judges, 
ought to benefit from security of tenure, sheltering them from any 
possible type of interference.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the irremovability of military judges is 
threatened because they may be removed before the end of their term 
under the discretionary power of the governor in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the matter of independence, the approach in the U.K. is 
different from ours.  There, a civilian and totally independent 
judge advocate general appoints the court martial judge advocates. 
The judge advocate general holds office up to the age of 70.  Like 
civilian judges, he may be relieved of his duties only for failure 
to carry them out or for improper conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The various judge advocates are civilian lawyers who cannot be 
removed. 
We believe Canada should draw on the British practice and use 
civilian judges who are totally independent and without military 
ambitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Létourneau commission made a recommendation in this regard 
that the chief military judge and all other judges appointed to 
decide on matters of military misconduct by civilians be appointed 
under the federal Judges Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a real effort to ensure institutional separation between 
the prosecution and defence functions of the military justice 
system, the bill creates the new positions of director of military 
prosecutions and director of the defence counsel service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the bill establishes more precisely the role of 
the judge advocate general.  The various roles played by the office 
of the judge advocate general have raised a lot of questions as to 
its impartiality. 
The fact of providing legal advice at the investigation and charge 
laying states and of being part of the prosecution, the defence and 
the judgment on military offences have drawn attention to the 
conflicting nature of the various functions performed by this 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, to its credit, removes the office of the judge 
advocate general from the prosecution function, which it gives 
exclusively to the new director of military prosecutions.  Under 
this bill, this person will decide the charges laid against 
individuals to be judged by court martials and conduct the 
prosecution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the institutional separation is only 
superficial, since the director of military prosecutions will be 
acting under the supervision of the judge advocate general, who may 
issue guidelines or provide instructions on prosecutions. 
So, there is a risk of interference from the judge advocate general 
that undermines the integrity and independence of the director of 
prosecutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oddly enough, the same thing goes for the new position of director 
of defence counsel services set up under this bill. By establishing 
defence counsel services, the bill separates the prosecutors from the 
defence counsel, since the defence counsel services no longer report to 
the office of the judge advocate general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, since the director of defence counsel services works under 
the general direction of the judge advocate general, once again, the 
bill fails to create the arm's length relationship that could reassure 
the members of the armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To achieve the proper arm's length relationship, should the defence 
counsel services not work under the direction of some other authority? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I know that I have just skimmed over the bill and that 
several other changes included in this piece of legislation deserve 
consideration, but unfortunately I will not have the time to address 
them today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, for all the reasons I mentioned earlier, I will vote 
against Bill C-25. How sad to realize that what Georges Clémenceau used 
to say at the beginning of the century still rings true today. He said 
“Military justice is to justice what military music is to 
music”.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL DEFENCE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK226">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-25, an 
act to amend the National Defence Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I must say 
it is a privilege to speak to Bill C-25, an act to amend the 
National Defence Act, involving primarily military justice.  The 
title of the bill does not state it all.  I want to mention some 
of the highlights of this bill before I get into the discussion 
of its content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 includes proposed amendments to the National Defence 
Act that attempt to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the 
military justice system's principal actors, including the 
Minister of National Defence and the judge advocate general.  It 
also attempts to establish clear standards of institutional 
separation between the investigative, prosecutorial, defence and 
judicial functions.  It establishes two independent oversight 
bodies external to the department and the Canadian forces, one a 
Canadian forces grievance board and the other a military police 
complaints commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also abolishes the death penalty as a punishment and 
substitutes it with life in prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill requires the Canadian forces grievance board, the 
military police complaints commission and the judge advocate 
general to file annual reports that the minister must table in 
this House.  These reports are in addition to the annual reports 
of the ombudsman, the chief of defence staff and the Canadian 
forces provost martial.  It also requires the minister of defence 
to have the National Defence Act reviewed and the results of that 
review reported to Parliament within five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know that you stay awake late at night worrying 
about all of these different tablings and so on.  I am sure that 
you will appreciate this process is appropriate within our 
parliamentary system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really is a joy for me to join the debate on Bill C-25, a 
bill which I have indicated changes and modernizes the National 
Defence Act and in particular the code of service discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As most members of this House know, the main focus of Bill C-25 
and a key focus of the National Defence Act is the military 
justice system, a distinct system of penal law applicable to 
members of the Canadian forces and other persons subject to 
Canadian military jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recognize that the military justice system in recent 
years has been under increasing scrutiny and pressure for change. 
A number of factors have contributed to the introduction of this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One factor is undoubtedly the extended and unprecedented period 
of time since Canada was last involved in a major war and the 
perception that chances of such involvement are now very remote. 
This situation tends to lead people both inside and outside the 
military to be less tolerant of any perceived systematic 
unfairness in the system and its retention of punishments 
perceived as excessive or rather out of date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to say that while we have 
been fortunate enough not to be involved in a major war for many, 
many years now and in fact for some decades, we do not forget the 
fact that many of those serving in our armed forces are serving 
in very troubled hot spots around the world.  As we debate this 
change to Bill C-25, they are carrying on their best efforts as 
peacekeepers and peacemakers on behalf of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another factor has been the adoption of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms.  This constitutional change has brought the 
military justice system as well as the Canadian legal system 
generally under increased scrutiny as regards procedural 
safeguards for accused persons and principles of fairness and 
equality of treatment generally.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Particular attention has been drawn to aspects of the military 
justice system that reflect the disparity of treatment between 
soldiers and civilians or among military personnel. These include 
the lack of certain traditional criminal law safeguards at 
summary trials, the fact that only junior ranks, privates and 
corporals, and non-commissioned officers, master corporals and 
sergeants, can be summarily sentenced to detention or reduction 
in rank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, commanding officers had considerable discretion in 
deciding to proceed or dismiss charges, including very serious 
criminal charges, the fact that persons exercising judicial fact 
functions, or what would be judicial functions in the civilian 
system, are often members of the chain of command who have no 
legal training and have other apparently conflicting 
responsibilities for administering the code of service 
discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be very clear.  All of us in this House today know what 
is behind Bill C-25.  In the last two years, such issues and 
concerns have been brought to the forefront by various high 
profile cases such as those relating to the misconduct by a 
handful of selected forces members in Somalia and Bosnia and the 
cases of Lieutenant Commander Marsaw and Corporal Purnelle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 report on both the Somalia Inquiry and the Dickson 
report recommended a series of changes to the military justice 
system.  There have also been a number of other internal and 
external studies dealing with possible reforms of the military 
system when it comes to justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats appreciate the efforts of the Minister of National 
Defence to bring the military justice system more in line with 
the civilian justice system.  We are very concerned about the 
issue of accountability when it comes to the military justice 
system.  Unfortunately, the efforts of the Minister of National 
Defence in this regard just do not go far enough.  We regret that 
greatly.  We were hoping for significant changes in the area of 
accountability, but unfortunately this has not happened with this 
particular piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that something went terribly wrong in Somalia.  We sent 
Canadian troops to Somalia to help keep the peace.  Some ended up 
killing the same people they were sent there to help.  It is a 
horrible thing that happened.  It would not be right to sweep 
this under the rug and pretend it never happened.  Nor would it 
be right to simply deny it.  It would not be right to deny why 
this happened.  It is certainly not right that certain 
individuals involved in this terrible incident are not now held 
accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this has happened.  This is a fact.  What is more 
shocking than the incident itself is the cover-up that happened 
and occurred after, a cover-up that included some of Canada's 
senior defence personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians first learned about the Somalia incident through some 
enterprising news reports.  Some talented inquiring reporters 
broke the story.  We learned more when Canadian soldiers with a 
conscience blew the whistle as well.  However, during this time 
soldiers in the upper levels of the military were busy little 
beavers tampering with some documents, destroying some, 
distorting others and stonewalling at every opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians, in spite of their efforts, could not get the full 
story no matter how hard they tried.  In 1994 the Liberal 
government set up the Somalia Commission of Inquiry.  In the 
beginning the Liberals appeared very keen to get to the truth. 
They were going to get to the bottom of things.  I remember time 
after time various ministers and others speaking in this House 
saying it was important to get to the bottom of the Somalia 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the commission started working, they too were stonewalled 
by military brass in their attempts to avoid having the truth 
come out.  To say the least, this frustrated the commissioners. 
We all remember night after night on the news various 
commissioners in their own adroit way explaining the frustration 
that they experienced in terms of getting to the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, the commission continued and the Liberal 
government got scared.  They were now well into their term of 
office and preparing for an election call.  I guess they did not 
want the defence department's dirty laundry being aired on the 
eve of an election.  We all know what happened next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Doug Young, the former minister of defence, shut the Somalia 
inquiry down.  One of the commissioners called the shutdown the 
most brazen cover-up in denials of responsibility in the history 
of this country. 
He also said that the Liberal government's actions were a brazen 
cover-up and a denial of responsibility.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the government snuffed out the inquiry, Canadians will 
never know the truth about what happened in Somalia and Canadians 
will never know who was really responsible for all the cover-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just grabbed a handful of newspaper clippings of that time 
from my file.  I thought it would be appropriate to read some of 
the headlines into the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the panelists said of the commission that the Department 
of National Defence got away with it.  Others went on to say some 
very questionable things.  I do not think our rules would allow 
me to use some of the language in these presentations.  I will 
set those aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One headline says “An inquiry insider slams the federal 
government's response”.  A second says “Prime Minister acting 
in a most irresponsible fashion”. Another headline says 
“Canada's military remains not accountable”.  Another says 
“The government kowtows to military brass”.  Others say “The 
Somalia inquiry proves a major embarrassment to the armed forces 
and to the government of the day” and “Outside supervision of 
military ruled out”. The sub-headline says “Military remains 
responsible for their own:  Inquiry exposes areas of 
incompetence”.  It is depressing to read these headlines.  One 
says “The defence stonewalled: Defence unable to obtain 
documents”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says—again this is the minister—“The minister has betrayed 
the Canadian armed forces, particularly their future”.  Another 
one is “Panic in the armed forces”.  Another one says “The 
Somalia inquiry a mess”.  Still another says “Cutting off the 
inquiry will backfire in terms of political fall-out”.  I am not 
sure if that happened but this was a prediction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another one says “Government calls the whole thing off before 
embarrassment” and another says “The deadline lets the brass 
off the hook:  A previous Prime Minister shielded from reality”. 
It says “Minister of defence not told the truth:  Grits shielded 
from military scrutiny”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on.  This is just a handful.  I am very reluctant to 
even mention these in my presentation because they are so 
distasteful.  I guess we have to nevertheless do these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that in spite of all the stonewalling and in spite of 
all the denials and cover-ups, despite being shut down mid-way 
through its work, the Somalia commission still issued 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wouldn't you know it?  The Liberal government has again 
responded with some arrogance, I am afraid to say.  The Minister 
of National Defence called the inquiry's work an insult.  The 
arrogance of this minister is unbelievable, how he would call the 
inquiry work an insult and not the fact that it was stonewalled 
and shut down prematurely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should tell the minister that this piece of 
legislation before the House today is an insult.  This bill 
completely ignores— 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
seems to me that with such a good speech as this being given that 
the minister should be on hand to take note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sure the minister would be 
taking note of the speech some place.  I know the hon. member 
knows it is improper to refer to the presence or absence of 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  Perhaps then, it would be in order to 
ask whether the Speaker sees a quorum in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not see a quorum.  Perhaps we 
could ring the bells.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the bells having rung:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I see a quorum.  The hon. 
member for Kamloops has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  I can hardly take that, Mr. Speaker.  I 
have never experienced this before in my life.  I do not want to 
overdo it and change their minds very quickly.  Thank you, that 
is more like it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to end my remarks in my presentation by simply saying 
that we believe the minister is not going far enough in 
subjecting our armed forces to an outside and independent review 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concerns New Democrats a great deal because we feel that 
the insular culture of the military was in fact in large part 
responsible for the cover-up that occurred in the Somalia affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures introduced by the minister in Bill C-25 may be a 
bit of a help, and I acknowledge that they may be a bit of help, 
but they really do not address the problem of a military beholden 
to itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Somalia commission's principle recommendation, the 
establishment of a formal inspector general system to watch over 
the military's performance, has been rejected by this minister 
and his Liberal government.  Instead, the minister will allow the 
military to continue to investigate itself in these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the minister is a very thoughtful individual but I 
find it hard to believe that he was attached to this because 
would anybody really believe that the military will continue to 
investigate itself in a clear fashion.  It is a bit like asking 
the coyote to keep an eye on the chickens in the henhouse and 
make sure everything is peaceful there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We point out what appears to be a glaring error in the draft of 
this legislation and perhaps we will have a chance to change it 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has also rejected a key recommendation of the 
Somalia inquiry aimed at protecting both those individuals who 
report wrongdoing in connection with the Somalia mission and 
those who may do so in the future.  This might be called whistle 
blowing.  Also rejected is the recommendation that military 
police be more independent of the defence department and report 
to the solicitor general instead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also has not accepted the commission's proposal 
that Parliament set the ground rules for future peacekeeping 
operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this minister has perpetuated the notion that the old 
boy network in the military is alive and well and that when 
problems arise, they will be settled clearly within the family. 
Given the terrible shape of our military these days, I am afraid 
that is not in any way assuring Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 reminds us of the government's failure to get to the 
bottom of the Somalia affair and the government's failure to 
bring forth the key recommendations of the Somalia commission in 
this bill indicates to us in the New Democratic Party that there 
is more secrecy to come and there will still continue to be a 
great lack of accountability in Canada's military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25, the department of defence response to the need for 
change in the military justice system, fails to deal with the 
contentious issue of accountability and responsibility within the 
senior echelons of the Canadian Armed Forces.  That is why we are 
not terribly enthusiastic about this legislation at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reiterate, I think it is fair to say that the two areas of 
serious concern are, first, the fact that there is no protection 
for whistle blowers, in other words those men and women in the 
Canadian Armed Forces who see a serious wrongdoing, see something 
that simply should not take place, who do not feel free to inform 
others, including the public, of this problem.  Until that 
happens there will always be this sort of cloudy pall hanging 
over the armed forces with people wondering if everything is 
going on above board.  There is also the matter of 
accountability.  The two are related but there is still the lack 
of accountability in terms of what is happening, particularly at 
the leadership level in our forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we do not like about the bill but, like everything 
else, there are good points and there are some bad points.  I 
have emphasized in my role as a critic today some of the more 
negative and downsides of Bill C-25.  But there are positive 
aspects. 
I could list a few, but it just is not part of my personality in 
the House to list positive things.  However, I will focus on one 
positive and that is the removal of the death penalty.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is here in his place and I want to applaud him for 
his efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many countries around the world have eliminated the death 
penalty for their armed forces.  The death penalty has been 
abolished in many western nations with which Canada has very 
strong ties.  Among our NATO allies are countries such as 
Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Greece, Iceland, The 
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Spain.  I could list a number 
of countries which have done away with the death penalty as a 
punishment for all civil and military offences.  Countries 
outside the NATO sphere have also abolished the death penalty for 
civil and service offences.  Our Commonwealth friends such as 
Australia, New Zealand and South Africa have also abolished the 
death penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The odd state in the U.S. retains the death penalty.  It is 
interesting that those states which have kept the death penalty 
are those states which have the highest amount of violent crime. 
There seems to be an inverse relationship to the death penalty 
when it comes to safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know that you as a learned individual know full 
well all of the reasons why we have abolished the death penalty 
in Canada.  Now that the Minister of National Defence, through 
this legislation, has eliminated the death penalty for Canada's 
armed forces, we join those nations which are the most 
progressive in the world.  I believe it is fair to say that the 
countries which are the most favourable in the world in which to 
live, almost inevitably, are those countries which have taken 
steps to abolish the death penalty.  It is a clear signal of the 
values they place on human life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am loath to say that we will not support the bill at this 
stage.  However, we hope that by sending out a clear message to 
our friend, the minister of defence, there will be a chance to 
amend it in committee.  We will be working hard in committee to 
improve the legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to speak to this bill today.  The government has decided to 
address the issue of justice in the Canadian forces and we 
believe it is about time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Addressing the issue of justice in the military is both 
important and urgent.  My party understands that if we are to do 
something, we might as well do it right.  Unfortunately, while 
there are some interesting points in the bill, it does not 
address the real problems faced by the Canadian forces today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several questions which we must ask ourselves. What 
events brought us to the point to have this bill read in Canada's 
House of Commons?  Did the government act in an appropriate way 
and does the bill address the need for change? If passed, will 
the bill work in a practical way when it is applied? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While all these questions are connected, it would serve us 
well to take the time to ensure that they are answered to the 
satisfaction of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question is perhaps the most important.  The key for 
this bill is what events brought us to this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe all members of the House are aware of the events which 
transpired as a result of other events in Somalia. However, they 
are worth repeating and repeating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Somalia inquiry was shut down for political and personal 
reasons last year.  That brings us here today.  Inquiry 
commissions are created because there is a public concern which 
needs to be addressed.  As elected officials of this House it is 
incumbent on all of us to take such matters very seriously.  It 
seems to me that if there is a good enough reason to begin an 
inquiry, then there is a good reason to complete it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quickly outline what was the cost, in real 
terms, of prematurely shutting down the Somalia commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Robert Fowler, then deputy minister of national defence, now 
Canada's ambassador to the United Nations, said that on March 19, 
1993 he told defence minister Kim Campbell's acting chief of 
staff, Richard Claire, that Somalia teenager Shidane Arone had 
died three days earlier as a result of foul play at the hands of 
Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Richard Claire, then acting chief of staff to minister of 
defence Kim Campbell, said he did discuss the death with Fowler 
and Vice-Admiral Larry Murray, then vice-chief of defence staff 
on March 19, but nobody mentioned foul play.  He said at that 
time the death was still a mystery to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Right Hon. Kim Campbell, then minister of defence, said that 
she was aware that there was an investigation going on from March 
17.  She knew this because she received a briefing note on that 
day.  In that briefing note the death of the Somali was listed as 
perplexing and that Canadian forces had acted appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Right Hon. Kim Campbell also knew from the same briefing 
book that Corporal Marchi had tried to kill himself because 
“he had roughed him up”, meaning Shidane Arone, “the truth was 
that he beat him to death”.  It was not until March 30, 11 days 
later, that Kim Campbell learned that there was an investigation 
into the death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the Somali inquiry was cut short, this has never been 
resolved.  The result is that Canada's fine military has been 
dragged through the mud and still there is no resolution.  The 
result is that Canadians have less faith in their public servants 
as Robert Fowler remains Canada's ambassador to the United 
Nations and Larry Murray has just been appointed assistant 
deputy minister in the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and 
still there is no resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is that Canadians do not know the true story and 
still there is no resolution.  That is why we are here today.  We 
are not here because the government all of a sudden cares about 
justice in the military but because the government made a mistake 
and it knows it made a mistake and now it wants to hide that 
mistake as best as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to the second point that I outlined earlier.  Did 
the government act in an appropriate way and does the bill 
address the need for change?  I would like to refer to the words 
of one of Canada's most respected sons, Chief Justice Brian 
Dickson.  In a speech given in November, 1997 Chief Justice 
Dickson said: “Something is drastically wrong when the public 
feels that its military is incompetent and led by an inept if not 
corrupt hierarchy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not bring up Chief Justice Dickson for no reason.  In fact, 
Chief Justice Dickson is an important player in the making of the 
bill because much of what is in the bill stems from the 
recommendations made to the minister of defence in March, 1997 by 
a special advisory group chaired by Chief Justice Dickson.  It is 
worth repeating the words of Chief Justice Dickson: “Something 
is drastically wrong when the public feels that its military is 
incompetent and led by an inept if not corrupt hierarchy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party agrees with Chief Justice Dickson.  There is something 
drastically wrong.  Does the bill address the need for change?  I 
just told the House I disagree with the way the bill arrived 
here.  However, there is much in the bill that my party agrees 
with.  The problem, however, is that when one tries to cover up 
something rather than address the real issues, as this government 
so often does, the result is very often inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, because the government is introducing the bill for 
the wrong reasons, it does not go far enough in addressing the 
real problems.  Indeed the government missed an excellent 
opportunity to instil new confidence in the military.  The 
government could have taken measures that would have truly made a 
difference, measures the Canadian public could point to and say 
“my government listened and I now have faith in the way the 
military operates”.  The government did not listen.  Instead it 
shut down an inquiry and stifled debate and now the Canadian 
public will feel cheated, and justifiably so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government feels proud when it says that it is fulfilling 
80% of the recommendations of the Somalia inquiry.  I want to 
make two points about this not so great accomplishment.  First, 
the Somalia inquiry was cut short and so we do not know what the 
full recommendations would have been.  Second, while the 
government thinks 80% is something to brag about, my party's 
answer to that is quality is far more important than mere 
quantity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Somalia inquiry commissioners recommended that the judge 
advocate general be a civilian.  The government ignored this 
recommendation.  The Somalia inquiry commissioners recommended 
that the office of the inspector general be created.  The 
government ignored that recommendation as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party proposed in our election platform last year and we 
maintain today that creating the office of an inspector general 
would be the best way to make the military both accountable and 
increase transparency to give the public more confidence in its 
armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed in our platform let the future begin: “Establishing 
an inspector general for the armed forces to act as an ombudsman 
to address concerns which cannot be dealt with in a routine chain 
of command”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the government's response to the Somalia inquiry, a document 
that for one reason or another my party has not yet figured out, 
called “A Commitment to Change” the government turns down the 
proposed inspector general.  In “A Commitment to Change” the 
government states that the commissioners themselves are confused 
and that introducing an inspector general of the kind that they 
envisioned would demand the very sort of counter-expert body the 
commissioners consider inappropriate in chapter 44 of the Somalia 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party has looked very closely at chapter 44 of the Somalia 
report and found one thing has nothing to do with the other. 
Chapter 44 is entitled “The Need for a Vigilant Parliament”. 
The chapter does not speak about the office of the inspector 
general but rather how to better inform Canadian 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In chapter 16 of “A Commitment to Change” the government 
misleads Canadians into believing the Somalia commissioners asked 
for an inspector general and then said in chapter 44 an inspector 
general was not needed.  That is not the case, and the minister 
and the government know this very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that was not clear enough, my colleague for 
Compton—Stanstead put forward a motion on November 29, 1997 at 
the defence and veterans affairs committee because he knew it was 
very important to clarify this precise issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read the motion that my colleague presented at 
that time: “That the committee invite the three Somalia 
commissioners to appear before this committee to speak on chapter 
44 of the Somalia report, `The Need for a Vigilant Parliament”'. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sad to say this motion for the need for a vigilant 
Parliament was turned down.  This is shameful behaviour on the 
part of this government.  It ends an inquiry and misleads 
Canadians in its response to the inquiry.  When the defence 
committee wants to have things clarified, as is its right, the 
motion is turned down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government does not want a vigilant Parliament because if 
Parliament were too vigilant this government might not get away 
with all its schemes.  Is this why 80% of the recommendations of 
the Somalia inquiry do not include the recommendation for a 
detailed annual report to Parliament? Instead of listening to the 
recommendations made by the Somalia commissioners this government 
chose to follow the advice given by the Dickson special advisory 
group.  What my party cannot accept is the way this government 
picks and chooses what recommendations to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government might want an example and this might surprise it. 
Recommendation 35 of the Dickson report, which has not made its 
way into this bill, calls for “an independent office of 
complaint review and system oversight such as a military 
ombudsman be established within the Canadian forces and that it 
report directly to the Minister of National Defence”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Somalia commissioners call it an inspector general.  The 
Dickson report calls it an ombudsman.  My party calls it an 
inspector general to act as an ombudsman.  And still this 
government does not act.  In the words of the Minister of 
Defence, the military does not need someone looking over its 
shoulder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this minister convinced that the Department of National 
Defence does not need an independent inspector general when 
experts who have studied for months and made recommendations to 
his department tell him he does need an inspector general? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I move on to my final points I want to tell this House 
about another recommendation made by the Somalia commissioners 
that did not make it into the government's 80%: “That the 
National Defence Act be amended to provide clearly that any 
individual in the Canadian forces or any civilian can lay a 
complaint with the military police without fear of reprisal and 
without having first to raise the complaint with the chain of 
command”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This recommendation does not appear in the bill before us today 
because in “A Commitment to Change” it is written plainly this 
recommendation is not accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If passed, will this bill work in a practical way?  My party will 
ensure during the committee stage of this bill that we invite 
witnesses who can enlighten the committee. 
I hope the government does not interfere with this process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that my colleague from Compton—Stanstead 
will put forward motions to invite the Somalia commissioners. 
They are experts and they have something to add to this bill.  He 
will also want to hear from those who worked closely on the 
Dickson special advisory group.  But that is not all.  It will be 
important to hear from the Americans, the British, the French and 
other like-minded nations on the operation and success of their 
military justice systems. It will also be important to hear from 
the stakeholders, namely members of the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill addresses the issue of military summary trials, that 
is, trials run by military officers with no legal training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When being briefed by the Department of National Defence on this 
bill, my party asked what sort of training company commanders 
were given.  The answer that there was no formal training 
astounded us.  Although Chief Justice Dickson recommends a 
certification process that allows officers to hold summary 
trials, the issue is not addressed in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through my colleague, my party will argue that this bill should 
go further to create real change.  We want the public to know the 
military serves them and not itself.  I hope the government takes 
my party's suggestions seriously.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate 
on Bill C-25, an act to amend the National Defence Act and to 
make consequential amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is a comprehensive package of amendments that 
will strengthen the statutory framework governing the operations 
of the Department of National Defence and the Canadian forces. It 
deals primarily with the military justice system. The amendments 
proposed in the bill are the most extensive amendments to the 
National Defence Act since it was first put in place in 1950. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The men and women of our armed forces have maintained our 
defence forces at a high state of readiness in the face of many 
challenges.  They have contributed with enthusiasm and 
professionalism to our wide range of international and domestic 
commitments.  In the Saguenay, in Red River in Manitoba, in 
central, eastern and Atlantic Canada they have played a crucial 
role in protecting the health and the safety of Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the recent ice storm, one of the worst natural disasters in 
our history, almost 16,000 members of the Forces provided relief to 
literally millions of Canadians who were without power. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They helped restore power, set up evacuation centres, assisted 
police and other emergency response teams and comforted people in 
need.  Their very presence helped Canadians cope with the 
disaster and face it with added confidence and resolve. The 
Canadian forces demonstrated once again that it is truly a vital 
national institution.  We and all Canadians have good reason to 
praise the dedication and the professionalism of these men and 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also remember that the Canadian forces are an armed 
force trained for combat and requiring a distinct system of 
military justice.  This requirement derives from the uniqueness 
of the Canadian forces' mandate, purposes and roles as well as 
special responsibilities and obligations to its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Military personnel may be required to risk injury or death in 
the performance of their duties. This puts a premium on the 
discipline and cohesion of military units. 
This operational reality has specific implications for military 
justice.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the Canadian forces require a justice system that can try 
offences against the ordinary law of Canada and offences that are 
unique to the military, such as mutiny or being absent without 
leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the military chain of command which is accountable not 
only for the maintenance of discipline but for carrying out the 
missions assigned by the government, must play a key role in the 
administration of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the system must be able to try and punish violations 
quickly so that individuals can be returned to service as soon as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the system needs to be portable so it can function 
wherever the forces are deployed in times of peace or conflict, 
either here in Canada or abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Discipline is the lifeblood of any military organization. 
Whether in peace or war it spells the difference between military 
success and failure.  It promotes effectiveness and efficiency. 
Its foundations are respect for leadership, appropriate training 
and a military justice system where equity and fairness are 
unquestionably clear to all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years however, the capacity of the military justice 
system to promote discipline, efficiency, high morale and justice 
has been called into question by a number of incidents.  The 
government looked closely at these events and has acted 
decisively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1995 the Somalia commission was established and the 
commission brought us a great number of recommendations.  Over 
80% of those recommendations, including many on military justice, 
are being implemented.  It has been asked what about the 
inspector general recommendation.  It is here in other forms. 
There are other people responsible for the military justice 
system who will carry out those same functions.  Indeed there 
will be independent monitoring, looking over the shoulders of the 
military to ensure that in fact they are implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1996 the government commissioned a special advisory 
group under the right hon. Brian Dickson, former chief justice of 
the Supreme Court of Canada.  We asked him and his colleagues to 
assess the military justice system and the police investigation 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The group reported on time and under budget. The minister of the 
day supported the recommendations in his report to the Prime 
Minister on the leadership and management of the forces of March 
25, 1997.  The Prime Minister endorsed early action on the 
recommendations and work began immediately to pursue their 
implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special advisory group was also asked to examine the 
quasi-judicial role of the minister in the military justice 
system. I am pleased to accept the recommendations it has made. 
They are also being implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government saw that the military justice system was one 
of the key areas where change was needed, we took action.  We 
sought advice from within the military, from the public at large 
and from distinguished Canadians with specialized knowledge.  The 
amendments under Bill C-25 are a product of that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 addresses a broad range of provisions in the National 
Defence Act.  It will modernize the provisions with respect to 
boards of inquiry.  It will clarify the legislative authority and 
performance of public service duties by Canadian forces members 
such as those during the recent ice storm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 is primarily about the modernization of the military 
justice system.  The four principal thrusts of this initiative 
will first, establish in the National Defence Act for the first 
time, the roles and responsibilities of the key figures in the 
military justice system and set clear standards of institutional 
separation, a very important element, for the investigative, 
prosecutorial, defence and judicial functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it will enhance transparency and provide greater 
structure to the exercise of individual discretion in the 
investigation and charging processes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it will modernize the powers and the procedures of 
service tribunals, including eliminating the death penalty under 
military law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, it will strengthen, not weaken but strengthen, oversight 
and review of the administration of military justice. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each component is a major building block in the revitalization of 
the Canadian military justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to present a brief overview of each, so that the totality 
of the improvements are apparent. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The roles, responsibilities and duties of the key figures in the 
military are not precisely set out in the National Defence Act as 
it is presently constituted.  This has led to a degree of 
uncertainty and misunderstanding about their respective functions 
and relationships in the overall process of delivering justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments contained in Bill C-25 will establish in clear 
terms the duties and relationship between the prosecution, 
defence and judicial functions.  The bill clearly defines the 
role of the judge advocate general as a legal adviser to the 
Governor General, the Minister of National Defence, the forces 
and the Department of National Defence in matters of military 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will establish the office of the director of military 
prosecutions who under the general supervision of the JAG will be 
responsible for deciding which charges are tried by courts 
martial and for the conduct of all prosecutions at a courts 
martial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will provide for the appointment of a director of defence 
counsel services who will provide legal services to accused 
persons in proceedings under the code of service discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will provide explicitly for independent military judges to be 
appointed by the governor in council for fixed terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the system as it now stands, the Minister of National 
Defence is also a key figure and plays an active role in the 
routine administration of individual cases under the code of 
service discipline.  Bill C-25 will remove the minister from such 
day to day administration. This will reduce potential conflict of 
interest between the minister's duties in individual cases and 
the minister's responsibility for the overall management of the 
department and the Canadian forces.  It will enable the minister 
to focus on other duties and responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments will also complement the recent initiative to 
establish the national investigative service of the military 
police.  This organization will be independent of the operational 
chain of command and will have jurisdiction to investigate 
serious and sensitive service offences. They are people who are 
being well trained to carry out that function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 will also improve the structure of the investigation 
and charging process and enhance transparency within that 
process.  The current system has been criticized for its lack of 
transparency and for the broad discretion it gives to a 
commanding officer to make final decisions concerning not only 
minor offences but also serious and sensitive offences that may 
implicate interests well beyond his or her individual unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the act will remove from commanding officers 
the power to dismiss charges.  They will provide a clear 
statutory basis for tailoring the jurisdiction of summary trials 
to those minor offences necessary for the maintenance of internal 
unit discipline.  They will also require that a charge that is 
beyond the jurisdiction of commanding officers is referred to the 
director of military prosecutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes to the act and to the regulatory administrative 
provisions dealing with investigations and charging of service 
offences will increase openness and refocus the exercise of 
individual discretion.  At the same time they will ensure the 
valuable and essential participation of the chain of command in 
the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments under Bill C-25 will also modernize powers and 
procedures associated with the two types of service tribunals 
that try military offences, summary trials and courts martial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform of the summary trial process is already well under way. 
Amendments to the Queen's regulations and orders enacted on 
November 30, 1997 restrict the jurisdiction of summary trials to 
more minor offences that affect internal unit discipline.  They 
also grant accused persons the right to elect trial by courts 
martial in all but the most minor cases.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, commanding officers are being provided with more 
comprehensive training in their military justice duties and 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 will complement those ongoing reforms of the summary 
trial process by reducing the powers of punishment at summary 
trial in keeping with its disciplinary focus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maximum period of detention that may be awarded at a summary 
trial will be reduced from 90 to 30 days.  The power to reduce in 
rank will be limited to one rank below the rank held before the 
summary trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In respect of courts martial, they will deal with more serious 
offences and will be conducted in accordance with rules similar 
to those at a civilian criminal court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently general and disciplinary courts martial are composed 
of a judge advocate who officiates at a panel of officers headed 
by a president.  Even though the president and the officers and 
the panel are not required by the act to possess any legal 
training, they nonetheless make judicial decisions and determine 
sentences.  Moreover, as it now stands, only commissioned 
officers can sit as members of general and disciplinary courts 
martial panels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 will recognize the judicial nature of the courts 
martial.  As such, it will eliminate the position of president of 
the courts martial panels.  It will authorize the presiding 
military judge to make all decisions of a legal nature, contrary 
to what I was hearing earlier from a colleague opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will enable a military judge presiding at courts martial 
rather than the members of the court martial to determine the 
sentence.  These people are well qualified to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, Bill C-25 will permit a non-commissioned member of the 
rank of warrant officer or above to serve as a member of a 
general and disciplinary court martial when the accused is a 
non-commissioned member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This participation, which is for the first time, will enable the 
Canadian forces to tap into the considerable wealth of experience 
and leadership offered by their senior non-commissioned members, 
men and women who also have a significant role to play in the 
disciplinary process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are moving to enhance accountability and transparency within 
the military justice system.  Oversight and review mechanisms 
must be in place to ensure that day to day decisions are 
monitored effectively and are capable of being assessed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 will establish two oversight bodies, both of which 
will be independent of the Department of National Defence and the 
Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is the military police complaints commission.  Its 
mandate will be to receive and investigate complaints by any 
member concerning the conduct of military police in the 
performance of their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also investigate complaints by military police about 
improper interference in their investigations by members of the 
Canadian forces and senior departmental officials.  That is 
something that is not done in other police complaints 
commissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Canadian forces grievance board will make findings 
and recommendations on certain categories of grievances prior to 
their being referred to the chief of defence staff for final 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If any finding or recommendation of the grievance board is not 
acted upon, the chief of defence staff will be required to 
provide reasons in writing for not doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to these oversight bodies, Bill C-25 will impose new 
review and reporting requirements.  The Minister of National 
Defence will be required to report to parliament on the operation

it is my duty to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask the minister a couple of questions stemming 
from the comments he made in his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that the position of an independent inspector general, 
which was recommended by the Somalia inquiry, was not needed as a 
result of changes made by the legislation.  I would like to ask 
him specifically how what was done in the legislation replaces 
the position of an independent inspector general laid out by the 
Somalia inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister proposed that there be an ombudsman. That was also 
recommended in the report of Somalia inquiry, as well as in other 
reports.  The position recommended in the Somalia and other 
reports called for an independent ombudsman.  The one being 
proposed by the minister is not independent.  However it is 
notable that the position of ombudsman is nowhere in the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the minister gone as far as he is going to go in this area, 
or will he implement a position of ombudsman?  Again, could he 
explain where the rather phantom independent inspector general is 
in the legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question.  It gives me an opportunity to say that 
the functions he proposes in terms of an inspector general are 
covered in other positions, not just in terms of the legislation 
but also in other provisions that are being made by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the legislation, as I have mentioned already, there is the 
grievance board and the police complaints commission.  There is 
an ombudsman who indeed will be independent.  It will not be 
someone who reports to the chain of command or who is part of the 
chain of command.  The person will be independent and will be 
from outside the Canadian forces.  When a report is issued, the 
report can be examined by parliament, can be examined by the 
committee which is a part of the parliamentary process and does 
such things.  It will be fully available and open to scrutiny and 
examination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That I call accountability and transparency.  It addresses the 
issue of the examination of what is going on in the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not afraid to have people looking over the shoulders of the 
military.  I said that we did not need an additional person to do 
that when we already have the functions covered.  They are 
covered by the ombudsman, by the grievance board and by the 
police complaints commission.  There is also a chief of review 
services who does a lot of work in examining what the chain of 
command has authorized, what it is carrying out and whether it is 
being carried out within the mandate and is being done in a 
proper fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very substantial overview will happen not only as a result of 
these amendments but of decisions of the government to implement 
oversight mechanisms to make the Canadian forces all the more 
accountable to parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on March 12 there was a press release from the 
minister's department announcing that Jerry Pitzul was the new 
judge advocate general. 
This appointment seems to exactly hit on what the minister is 
looking for.  It has the element of a civilian and the element of 
a former military person. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT81"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT81"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1640
<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand Mr. Pitzul has been out of the military since 1995 
when he took on a position with the Nova Scotia government as 
director of the public prosecution service.  It now appears he is 
being brought back into the military with a new rank, a raise in 
pay and new responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is praised in this release as being an extremely competent 
man.  Was an appraisal done of his performance in the province of 
Nova Scotia?  It speaks of his immense experience in Nova Scotia 
but the man never tried a case there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister if there is any beginning to the wisdom of 
this latest appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Mr. Speaker, given that the hon. 
member once worked for him— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  He fired me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  He fired him.  Yes, that is 
true. I guess if you get fired you do not particularly like the 
person who fired you.  Well, too bad.  Perhaps he had good reason 
to do that; I am sure he did.  I guess it does not hurt members 
who get fired because they get elected to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Pitzul has considerable experience in the military.  He 
spent most of his legal career in the military.  He has been a 
judge.  He has occupied other positions that have given him a 
great deal of information, knowledge and understanding of the 
military justice system.  On top of that, he now has experience 
from outside having gone to Nova Scotia and having performed 
duties in a civilian role in that province.  That adds to the 
depth and experience he brings to this position.  It also shows 
that we are willing to bring in new blood, to bring in people 
from the outside and to make reforms in the military justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the new judge advocate general, Mr. Pitzul, will do 
that and do it well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have one minute 
for a question and one minute for a response so that we can get 
them both in. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the minister mentioned that 80% of the Somalia inquiry 
recommendations were being implemented in Bill C-25.  The 
minister shut down the Somalia inquiry so 80% may not be an 
accurate figure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inquiry was not allowed to complete its work because the 
government shut it down.  That 80% figure is probably a bit 
erroneous.  Even so, the 20% the government chose not to 
implement includes some of the most important things that could 
be done for the Canadian Armed Forces including the 
implementation of an inspector general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask the minister directly one specific question about 
reducing the sentence for mutiny.  In this country mutiny can be 
very serious.  The minister has pointed out that we require a 
strong military system for good order and discipline.  Where is 
the wisdom in the government that would see a sentence for mutiny 
reduced to 14 years where we are dealing with heavy expensive 
equipment like CF-18 aircraft and we— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The minister of 
defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me comment 
about the Somalia commission of inquiry.  We are implementing 
over 80% of the recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about the other 20%.  We are by and large 
implementing all the recommendations.  We have different ways of 
implementing some.  We do not agree with every letter of every 
recommendation.  We have a different way, a preferable way of 
implementing but the spirit and intent of just about all 
recommendations are being implemented, not necessarily all by the 
legislation but certainly by government action in many different 
respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inspector general is a good example because it will come 
into the 20%.  I have said that all those functions are covered. 
We have covered them with other positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of mutiny, all these changes are to bring about 
a legal system that is in accordance with modern day legal 
practices, akin to what is happening in civilian courts and takes 
into account the charter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is very 
impressive that the minister is willing to overhaul the whole 
institution, in particular when it comes to justice.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he said, we expect every soldier to be willing to give his or 
her life so why on earth should we hold them to another code of 
conduct and a whole other code of justice than what we would hold 
ourselves accountable to?  I think this is important.  What is 
wrong with our own courts?  Why on earth can we not have our 
justice system deal with our military so that they can count on 
our justice system if they are going to give their lives for us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  I thank the hon. member for the 
question.  By tradition there is a separate military justice 
system because of the nature of dealing with matters swiftly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I emphasized in my remarks, discipline and cohesion are very 
important because not only can what some of our soldiers do 
threaten their own lives, it can threaten the lives of other 
people who are part of the team they are working with.  It is 
important to be able to deal with these matters for that reason 
very swiftly.  In some cases they may be abroad at the time. 
They may be involved in war or peacekeeping in other parts of the 
world and so it is necessary to have a portable system, have a 
system that can operate in a very swift fashion in terms of the 
military justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada has indicated there is justification 
and a need for a separate military justice system.  What we are 
attempting to do is to bring it as close as possible to the 
civilian system so that indeed the charter and the questions of 
fairness and equity within the judicial system will be there for 
the soldiers as much as they are for the civilians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the constituents of Okanagan—Coquihalla to 
speak on Bill C-25, an act to amend the National Defence Act. 
The act represents the government's attempt to respond to the 
failings of the military justice system which became so evident 
to all Canadians during the Somalia inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has an obligation to protect its interests both 
internationally and domestically.  This frequently involves 
committing military resources which is a task that is becoming 
increasingly difficult for the underfunded, undertrained and 
under-equipped Canadian Armed Forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to stress that this statement is in no way an 
attack on the good men and women who serve our country.  I would 
like to put it in complete context by telling the House, and 
telling Canadians, that I served in the Canadian Armed Forces.  I 
served five years in the regular armed forces with the navy on 
three Canadian destroyers, the HMCS <I>Gatineau</I>, the HMCS 
<I>Yukon</I> and the HMCS <I>Qu'Appelle</I>.  Later in life I also 
served in the Canadian Armed Forces Reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come to this debate with a little knowledge regarding the 
forces.  I see you also, Mr. Speaker, have served in the Canadian 
Armed Forces, and maybe other members have too.  I think there is 
a strong feeling that the military is very important to 
Canadians.  It certainly is to me and it is not lightly that I 
enter the debate on Bill C-25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people in eastern Canada had to do little more than to look 
out their windows recently to see the dedicated men and women of 
the armed forces in action.  Operation Recuperation had more than 
12,000 military personnel deployed in Ontario, Quebec and New 
Brunswick to assist in humanitarian relief operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Floods in the Red River Valley also highlighted the important 
role of our military forces and how they help with domestic 
problems in Canada.  Recently, internationally, we see unrest in 
the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo which has Canada and the 
United States considering the sending of more troops to that 
region.  Currently, Canada has some 1,300 troops located in 
Bosnia.  Recently we sent a small contingent to the Persian Gulf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my history as a member of Parliament and as a military 
person, most recently I have seen the good work of the Canadian 
Armed Forces internationally in Bosnia in 1994 where we had 
reserve members and regular force members.  They do Canadians 
proud each and every day of the week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last week, as a matter of fact, we saw Her Majesty's 
Canadian ship, the <I>Okanagan</I>, a submarine located in 
Halifax, rescue two men who had drifted out to sea in the Bahamas 
after the motor of their fishing boat gave out.  I congratulate 
the entire crew of the HMCS <I>Okanagan</I> for a job well done.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The men and women of our armed forces do a wonderful job and 
they deserve the support of this government for their hard work 
and dedication.  However, members of the Canadian Armed Forces do 
not have the commitment from this government that they need to do 
their jobs.  Spending cuts have decimated the Department of 
National Defence since the Liberals took power in 1993.  In the 
last five years, the department's budget has dropped from 
approximately $11 billion to just over $9 billion.  This has 
dramatically reduced the readiness and capability of the forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the men and women of the Canadian Armed 
Forces do their best with whatever they have and they have been 
able to complete their tasks, no thanks to this government and 
this Liberal administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cuts to the defence budget have lowered the standard of living 
of lower ranks to near poverty levels.  They have cut the number 
of personnel to below minimum levels and have reduced training to 
below minimum requirements.  In fact, I have introduced a private 
member's bill that will seek to address the substantial training 
deficits faced by our reserve forces in Canada.  This bill will 
entitle reservists employed by the federal government and crown 
corporations a period not to exceed two months annually for the 
purpose of training or serving in the Canadian reserve force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presently, reservists have been forced to use their own 
hard-earned vacation time to attend training courses.  This is 
just not right when they could be sent away to do the 
government's bidding and the government's will.  We need to make 
some concessions in our system for those reservists, those 
citizen soldiers who work so hard for us.  This is certainly a 
tremendous sacrifice for them and their families.  Therefore, I 
encourage every member of the House to show their support for the 
fine work of our armed forces reserve and support this bill when 
it comes to this House on Monday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Somalia inquiry exposed very serious deficiencies within the 
military justice system.  As I looked through one of the many 
volumes from the Somalia inquiry, volume 5, it just highlights 
some of the problems that the Somalia commissioners found when 
they were involved in that massive review of the military justice 
system:  too few military police and military police with 
inappropriate skills; commanding officers slow to call in the 
military police; guidelines for calling investigations not 
followed; guidelines not followed when it comes to summary 
investigations;  witnesses' statements not taken correctly; 
conflict of interest; problems in military investigations; lack 
of co-operation when people were interviewed by military police; 
difficulty investigating superior officers because of the chain 
of command in the military—military police had a lot of 
difficulty with that— and influence of commanding officers over 
investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The volumes and volumes of books that we have and still not 
complete point out the true problems that we have in the military 
justice system.  We have to try to get to the heart of those 
problems:  problems surrounding the murder of a Somalia civilian; 
the cover-up of the murder; the failure of the general staff and 
the government to hold anyone accountable for their actions or 
omissions; the cultural secrecy within the Department of National 
Defence; and the double standards in the military justice system 
all became very evident during the Somalia inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this Liberal government was really concerned about our troops 
and our men and women in the Canadian Armed Forces, it would have 
let the commissioners of inquiry complete their work and finish 
the recommendations instead of just coming up with 80% of the 
problem completely solved.  I do not think that is fair to our 
men and women in the forces.  They deserve much better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments in Bill C-25 give the appearance of an attempt to 
address problems with the military and the justice system, yet 
the amendments do not address all the concerns expressed by the 
commissioners in their incomplete report.  In fact, they actually 
add a whole new set of problems to the military justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first problem is that the bill creates more bureaucracy.  If 
there is one thing the Canadian Armed Forces does not need, it is 
more levels of bureaucracy.  We have more military personnel 
located in Ottawa in a bureaucratic function than we have on the 
pointed edge of the army in actual military roles. 
There are more bureaucrats here for the Canadian Armed Forces and 
this bill will add more bureaucracy to that already top heavy 
system.  That is not good enough.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The military police complaints commissioners is created.  That 
sounds fine.  The problem is it is going to create seven more 
order in council appointments.  I think Canadians are pretty fed 
up with order in council appointments.  We would like to see a 
system where they appoint more people who are fully qualified and 
have the background, not more patronage appointments that we saw 
this week in the Senate chamber.  We do not want to see more of 
that here and this department creates seven more order in council 
appointments.   It is unbelievable.  What we need in this system 
of military justice is openness, accountability and independence, 
not a more complex system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem is with the office of the judge advocate 
general.  Currently the judge advocate general wears three hats. 
He is responsible for investigative, prosecutorial and judicial 
functions of the system.  One office is responsible for the 
military police who investigate the potential violations for the 
prosecutors who prosecute the cases and for the legal officers 
who may preside over courts martial that may result.  It is not 
hard to understand that the JAG may find himself in a conflict of 
interest in these duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the days leading up to the murder of Shidane Arone, the judge 
advocate general was actively involved in providing the executive 
staff of the Department of National Defence with daily legal 
advice.  You have a person offering the chief of defence staff 
the military command, the military hierarchy, legal advice when 
he would only weeks later be expected to oversee the military 
justice system that was going to prosecute people.  So you can 
see there is a conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere was this conflict more evident than in the Somalia 
affair where the JAG was providing from the start legal advice to 
the minister, the deputy minister and the military police.  He 
did provide that judicial advice to his military trial judge 
division.  Clearly judicial responsibility should be removed from 
the JAG branch.  The judicial function must be seen as 
independent and clearly this cannot happen when the JAG is 
appointed directly by the chief of defence staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other problem with the judge advocate general being of 
military background is that he is always beholden to the person 
who appoints him.  There is only one person who can do that. That 
is the chief of defence staff.  He is offering him legal advice. 
He is also very thankful that he received this appointment.  It 
is a difficult position to put anyone in and they should change 
that system so there is more independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third problem with this bill is the failure to create the 
inspector general which was recommended by the Somalia inquiry. 
The inspector general would receive information from all sources, 
investigate complaints of corruption, abuse and mismanagement. We 
could give you many examples of why this is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day during question period my colleague for Lakeland 
brought a case forward where the inspector general had actually 
sent a letter to a person intimidating that person regarding a 
committee that was being heard.  That is why an inspector general 
is so important.  What are people who are intimidated by the 
office of the judge advocate general to do?  Where are they to 
go? The problem is that they have nowhere to go at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they have an inspector general who works as an ombudsman for 
men and women in the Canadian Armed Forces who find themselves in 
this particular situation where they are being attacked or being 
told to keep quiet about a certain situation that is happening on 
a base, we want to know about that in this House.  That is why an 
independent inspector general is so very important to a military 
justice system that is going to carry us through the 20th 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inspector general would also advise the minister concerning 
ethical interests including conflict of interest. 
This office must be filled by a civilian.  This would be the 
mechanism for ensuring civilian control of the military system. 
This is a fundamental principle of Canadian society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem with this bill is clause 28 and the reduction of 
the penalty for mutiny without violence.  The reduction is from a 
maximum of life imprisonment to 14 years. Clearly this change 
could dramatically affect the relationship between the ranks 
which is vital to good military order.  The minister acknowledged 
that himself.  We need a strong military justice system for the 
good order and discipline of our troops. One of the key reasons 
for that is that there is no other department in Canada where we 
ask our troops to put their lives on the line, that they may 
actually have to die for their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have frigates in the Canadian Armed Forces that are worth 
millions of dollars.  We have CF-18s that are also worth millions 
of dollars.  What would happen if internally within Canada there 
was a situation where a group of military personnel for one 
reason or another decided they were going to do away with a 
couple of those CF-18s and move them elsewhere? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A term of 14 years is not enough.  This is not nearly enough to 
ensure that we have good order and discipline in the Canadian 
Armed Forces.  It should be a life sentence and there is no 
question about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a nation that recognizes its obligations both 
internationally and domestically.  The ice storm, the Manitoba 
flood, Bosnia and the recent mission of the submarine 
<I>Okanagan</I> all demonstrate to Canadians what a wonderful job 
the men and women of our Canadian Armed Forces do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we find this Liberal government has shown it is no friend to 
the Canadian Armed Forces or people with military service.  The 
government has demonstrated this quite clearly through spending 
cuts.  In 1993 it dramatically reduced the readiness and 
capability of our forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a chief of defence staff, Boyle, who said to the 
international community in Brussels that our Canadian Armed 
Forces could not meet the readiness capability of going into 
battle. Exactly what we have a Canadian Armed Forces for is to 
make sure it can protect our interests and our sovereignty at 
home and abroad.  Yet we do not have a military that is at that 
level, according to a former chief of defence staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reductions this government has imposed have hurt the 
Canadian Armed Forces.  This does not stop the Liberal government 
from sending our troops into potentially dangerous areas like 
Bosnia, the Persian gulf or Kosovo.  As a matter of fact when the 
Prime Minister thinks it might help his political points by 
sending more troops to Rwanda or other places, even though we do 
not have the troops to fill that need, the Prime Minister makes a 
commitment anyway.  We all know the result of that was just a 
bunch of hot air. Those in the military circles knew very well we 
could not have met the commitment the Prime Minister made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has now introduced Bill C-25 to deal with the 
problems created by the Somalia inquiry.  However the changes in 
this bill fail to address the fundamental root of the problem, 
that the government, not the men and women in the forces and not 
the forces itself, but the government has failed to provide 
openness and accountability in our Canadian Armed Forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendations of the Somalia inquiry continue to be ignored by 
the government.  The government has done our armed forces no 
favours whatsoever. It has allowed a cloud to hang over the 
military by shutting down the Somalia inquiry when it was just 
getting to the root of the problem. True things were coming out. 
But the government felt it was in danger itself of being tainted 
with some of the things that were going on during the 
investigative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly support substantive changes to the military justice 
system.  I believe that Canadians also support changes to the 
military justice system. 
However, any changes must address the issues of accountability, 
openness and independence within the Canadian forces.  Changes 
must, for me to support them, include an inspector general.

that are required for our men and women in the Canadian Armed

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
earlier I heard the minister tell us that the role of the 
independent inspector general that was so very vigorously 
proposed in the Somalia inquiry and by others was found in his 
legislation or in something yet to come. It was not completely 
clear from his answer.  The member who has just spoken has 
indicated that the minister has created a new bureaucracy and 
several new patronage appointment opportunities for his Liberal 
friends.  The minister has not in fact put in place someone or a 
group who would perform the function of that independent 
inspector general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member which is it.  Is it what the minister says, 
that the position is covered in these changes or is it not?  Is 
what has been created a new bureaucracy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
member for his question.  Unfortunately, under the test of 
independence that I would certainly apply, there does not seem to 
be the independence we would like to see that an independent 
inspector general would provide for the Canadian Armed Forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons for the independence requirement as I 
mentioned during my remarks is that in one recent case a military 
person was actually intimidated by the judge advocate general's 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need the independence to make sure that the office will not 
interfere with the military structure whatsoever and that it will 
act as an ombudsman for people in the military structure, either 
family members in the military, the military personnel themselves 
or civilian members of the Canadian Armed Forces who are involved 
with the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we mean by independence. There would be no 
connection whatsoever and they would have investigative power to 
investigate complaints.  It would be similar to a provincial 
ombudsman role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is evidence around the world that an independent inspector 
general is very effective.  The United States armed services has 
an inspector general.  Millions of dollars in fraudulent 
expenditures, et cetera have been uncovered in the armed forces 
internally. People who have been intimidated by the chain of 
command or by other forces in the armed forces structure itself 
have been helped.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Independence is very important.  The government's reaction to 
this does not meet the test of independence.  Therefore I would 
suggest that we would be putting forward amendments that will see 
a true independent inspector general in the new military justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to nail this down a 
little more, I want to get back to the case the member referred 
to.  Last week I brought this to the attention of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Miss Olafson from Cold Lake appeared before the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs, 
having been encouraged by the minister, the chief of defence 
staff and others. She was somewhat critical of the department, 
like some people on the base at Cold Lake.  After, she received a 
letter from the deputy judge advocate, Colonel Barber, who 
strongly criticized her for what she had said at the committee 
meeting.  At the end of the letter he threatened her against 
continuing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current system, before this legislation which is being 
proposed passes, independence is an issue.  It is a critical 
issue.  Who indicated that the letter should be written?  Was it 
Colonel Barber completely, the deputy judge advocate who decided 
to write that letter, or was it the base commander, or was it the 
minister of defence who said to the deputy judge advocate to 
write the letter?  We do not know because the independence is not 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new proposals the minister has put forth, would there 
be the proper level of independence so that the judge advocate's 
office would not write the letter unless it felt it was proper, 
and not as a result of pressure from above? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think it would have 
the same independence as we are suggesting with an inspector 
general.  The system the minister has proposed is about patronage 
appointments, order in council appointments. Appointments would 
be given to friends of the Liberal government across the way. 
Those people I suppose with a stretch we could say are 
independent, just as much as the Liberal senator from B.C. who 
was appointed has independence from the Liberal government. There 
is no independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The structure in the bureaucracy would involve military people 
and civilian people who are connected either through the chain of 
command or through the bureaucracy on the civilian side of the 
Canadian Armed Forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the member's question, I fail to see how the 
government's solution offers the security of independence at all. 
I would strongly urge the government to reconsider this very 
fundamental point that there be independence in a justice system. 
I strongly urge the government when we put our amendment forward 
to wholeheartedly accept the amendment of installing an 
independent inspector general. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to speak to Bill C-25, an act to amend 
the National Defence Act and to make consequential amendments to 
other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 is the most extensive package of amendments to the 
National Defence Act since enactment in the year 1950.  The 
amendments deal with a wide variety of issues ranging from 
updating the boards of inquiry provisions to putting some of the 
Canadian forces domestic duties, such as duties during the recent 
ice storm, on a firm legislative footing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But Bill C-25 is primarily about military justice. 
In that regard it sets out a comprehensive strategy to modernize 
the code of service discipline in a way that is consistent with 
the values and expectations of Canadians and meets the Canadian 
forces requirement for a military justice system that is swift, 
fair and portable. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of this comprehensive strategy, Bill C-25 puts in place 
a number of mechanisms designed to improve oversight and review 
of the administration of military justice.  Both the report of 
the special advisory group chaired by the Right Hon. Brian 
Dickson and the Somalia commission of inquiry recognized the 
importance of strengthened oversight and review of military 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Dickson advisory group made two important points in this 
regard.  First, military justice by definition must include an 
effective, independent channel or mechanism through which service 
members can express their concerns about any aspect of the 
military establishment.  Second, in their opinion, such a 
mechanism would ultimately strengthen the military chain of 
command. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mechanisms in Bill C-25 are based on the principle put 
forward by the Somalia commission that oversight and review 
mechanisms should be strengthened.  Bill C-25 contains a variety 
of mechanisms to strengthen oversight and review and to 
complement other specialized mechanisms.  It is these mechanisms 
to strengthen oversight and review which I would like to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 will establish the Canadian forces grievance board and 
military police complaints commission, both of which will be 
external and independent oversight bodies.  It will establish a 
military police code of conduct.  It will create a new 
requirement for the judge advocate general to review and report 
on the administration of military justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it will require that the Minister of National Defence 
review the provisions and operation of the National Defence Act 
and report to Parliament within five years of the amendments 
coming into force.  All of these amendments will substantially 
enhance both accountability and transparency in the 
administration of military justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague is exactly right when he said transparency is our 
ultimate goal.  The amendments will also ensure that there is a 
means through which day to day decisions in the administration of 
military justice can be monitored and assessed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let me look at the current grievance system as authorized 
by section 29 of the act.  Today the language of section 29 does 
not clearly define the circumstances in which a member may submit 
a grievance.  In addition, while the grievance process has 
generally been seen to be achieving its objectives, it involves 
too many levels of review.  This leaves the perception that the 
process is slow and unresponsive.  Also, it is perceived as being 
too closely linked to the chain of command and lacking any 
external input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grievance process has been under active review within the 
Canadian forces.  It has also been the subject of observations in 
three recent reports.  The Somalia commission recommended that 
the Minister of National Defence have no adjudicative role in 
redress of grievance matters.  The Dickson advisory group 
recommended that the minister not be involved in grievances 
related to summary trials and noted that the report of the 
Minister of National Defence to the Prime Minister in March 1997 
indicated that it was inappropriate for the minister to act as 
the final arbiter in grievance processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 will act upon many of the recommendations of these 
reports.  For example, it will make three important changes to 
the grievance system.  First, it will clarify the circumstances 
in which a member may submit a grievance.  Second, it will 
establish the Canadian forces grievance board which will be 
external to and independent of the department and the forces. 
Third, it will authorize the chief of defence staff to be the 
final decision maker in the grievance process.

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grievance board will review prescribed categories of 
grievances before they are sent to the chief of defence staff. 
The CDS will have the option of referring any other grievance to 
the board.  The board will provide findings and recommendations 
and submit them to the CDS.  The CDS will not be bound by the 
board's findings or recommendations, but will be required to 
provide reasons when any findings or recommendations are not 
acted upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grievance board will establish its own internal process and, 
for the purpose of conducting its tasks, will have the authority 
to hold hearings and compel the attendance of witnesses and the 
production of documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 will require the board to file an annual report with 
the Minister of National Defence, who will be required to table 
this report in Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 will also create a military police complaints 
commission.  This commission will be independent and external to 
the department and the forces and will have the mandate to deal 
with complaints from the public about the conduct of military 
police in their policing duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also have the mandate to deal with complaints by 
military police concerning improper interference by members of 
the forces and senior officials of the department in the conduct 
of military police investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This commission will have the power and resources to investigate 
complaints and the power to conduct public hearings.  It will 
also have the power to subpoena witnesses and documents and take 
testimony under oath. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is the case with independent bodies which provide similar 
oversight to civilian police, the complaints commission will have 
the authority to make findings and recommendations to the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 will require the commission to file an annual report 
which will be tabled in Parliament by the Minister of National 
Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 will also make specific provision for a military 
police professional code of conduct to be established in 
regulations.  The code of conduct will establish a clear standard 
of professional conduct for military police.  The code of 
conduct, which is a feature of most Canadian civil police forces 
and which was recommended by the Dickson advisory group and the 
Somalia commission, will help to enhance both the professionalism 
and accountability of military police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to these important steps to improve oversight and 
review, Bill C-25 will also make the military justice system more 
open and transparent through two other new review and reporting 
requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, five years after Bill C-25 amendments come into effect 
the Minister of National Defence will be required to review the 
operation of the act.  This review will be tabled in Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the judge advocate general will be required to report 
annually to the minister on the administration of military 
justice in the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These reports, in addition to those I mentioned earlier by the 
Canadian forces grievance board and the military police 
complaints commission, will enhance openness and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments contained in Bill C-25 are the most 
extensive in the history of the National Defence Act.  They 
follow through on the recommendations of the Dickson advisory 
group and respond to those of the Somalia commission.  They 
provide a more effective statutory framework for the operations 
of the department and the forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of oversight, the amendments to the grievance process 
provide an open and responsive process through which members of 
the Canadian forces can seek review of decisions in the 
administration of the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments associated with the military police complaints 
commission establish a rigorous and transparent process to review 
military investigative activities.  The new reporting 
requirements mandated by Bill C-25 will enhance the effectiveness 
of parliamentary oversight in a number of important areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A famous military man once said “There is no security on earth, 
only opportunity”.  We have here an opportunity to propose and 
move these very specific amendments which will enhance our 
Canadian military. 
I urge all hon. members in this House to lend their unqualified 
support, which I am sure we will get, to these amendments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
a bushel of questions for this hon. member.  I will start with a 
few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the close of his presentation, the hon. member talked about 
the opportunity presented through this legislation.  I agree with 
the hon. member in a way that this is the time of opportunity in 
terms of reforming the military.  We have had calls from many 
different places for major and positive reform to the military. 
We have had the Dickson report.  We have also had the Somalia 
inquiry with a report that recommended substantive change, 
including the establishment of the office of an independent 
inspector general, which is not in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member listed one after another after another new 
bureaucratic bodies that are being created by this legislation. I 
know the hon. member has a background in the military or 
certainly a background knowledge of the military.  I will ask him 
a straight question.  Does he believe the Department of National 
Defence needs more bureaucracy?  Does the Department of National 
Defence need more bodies, more places to make patronage 
appointments, more complexity?  Does the hon. member really 
believe that is what the Department of National Defence needs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will gladly reply to 
the hon. member for Lakeland.  He asked what the military needs. 
The military certainly needs the tools to do the job.  With this 
government it will get the tools to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the Reform Party fresh start campaign was a no start 
for the military— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Jump start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  Jump start is also a good term. Reform 
wanted to reduce funding to the military.  Instead of trying to 
do the job with the tools we need, we would be doing the job with 
Tonka toys if it were up to Reformers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about the JAG, the judge advocate general.  I would 
like to use that acronym for the hon. member for Lakeland and say 
that he is just another grumbler.  We are doing everything we can 
possibly do to help the military.  All they want to do is make 
vituperative and splenetic remarks about it and indulge in 
nothing more than crass political opportunism. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds—Grenville, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a comment and a question.  My riding was one of the ridings 
affected by the ice storm.  I will take every opportunity I can 
to put on the record that the minister spoke about what the 
military did and the reservists too.  I am glad that point was 
made by the hon. member opposite.  He was characteristically 
humble as were most of the military people I encountered through 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The military saved lives in my riding.  I will say that time and 
time again.  I was very proud of the Canadian military which 
brings me to my question.  What problem are we trying to solve 
here?  I have listened quite intently to this debate.  The 
members on the defence committee are guilty of engaging in 
acronyms that I do not understand which leads me to my concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform is very good at these rather simplistic solutions.  Have 
an independent counsel.  It will take care of itself.  Let us 
think of what the Americans did during the Watergate crisis. 
Independent counsel.  Now we have Kenneth Star and the executive 
branch of the U.S. government embroiled in some kind of three 
ring circus.  If this is some way of cutting through red tape, if 
this is an elimination of bureaucracy, I do not know where that 
is headed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform Party wants to do something constructive, let us 
bring some balance to the debate.  This issue is not as 
simplistic as Reformers would have us believe.  There are 
different ways of accomplishing the same goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has a base in his riding.  Does the member think it 
brings anything to the picnic in terms of morale and recognizing 
the good works of the Canadian military to constantly dredge up 
and dwell on the small minority of negative comments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end by quoting a commander who left eastern Ontario after 
the ice storm to cheering crowds.  He said:  “This is the 99% of 
the military you haven't heard about in —”

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from December 11, 1997 consideration of the 
motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to be able to speak to the motion by the hon. member 
for Kamloops calling on the government to extend veterans 
benefits to Canadians who served in the Spanish civil war, the 
surviving members of the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion, also known 
as the Mac-Paps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a motion which on the surface has some merits.  It is 
one which many people have mixed feelings about.  However, my 
first difficulty is a tendency to revisit history and try to 
apply retroactive judgments about who fought on the right side 
and who fought on the wrong side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time Canada was not at war with Spain.  We had laws 
prohibiting our citizens from fighting in this foreign war.  This 
matter has been debated in the House before.  In 1980 a motion 
similar to the motion presented by the member for Kamloops was 
presented by Bob Rae, the then member of Parliament for 
Broadview—Greenwood.  The issue was also debated and discussed 
in great lengths in 1986 at the standing committee on veterans 
affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee concluded that the losses incurred by the 
battalion are indeed to be mourned and the qualities, endurance 
and courage shown by the battalion are to be admired.  These were 
brave individuals fighting for a cause they believed in and we 
should definitely not fault them for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee concluded, however, that these Canadians, 
the Mac-Paps, cannot be considered in the same light as Canadians 
who served in the wars in which Canada was involved as a nation. 
The committee also concluded that there can be no thought of 
treating them in the same manner by making them eligible for 
benefits under the veterans legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those men who went to Spain and waged war on the fascists are to 
be commended for their efforts.  One can applaud their bravery in 
the face of a better manned and better equipped enemy.  Spain has 
publicly thanked these men who joined the international brigade. 
However, the indisputable fact is that they were soldiers of 
conscience.  They went on their own to fight the fascist 
aggression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time of the Spanish civil war, Canada chose to be neutral 
and did not recognize the war.  Canada was not at war. The 
Canadians who participated in the Spanish civil war did so on an 
individual basis.  They let their conscience be their guide. 
These men went to Spain in defiance of the laws of Canada at the 
time.  They fought on behalf of their own conscience, not on 
behalf of the people of the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize the sincerity behind this motion.  This debate 
allows us the opportunity to once again say to these men that 
they are not criminals and what they did was what they honestly 
felt was right.  No one can fault them for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were courageous individuals.  However, this House cannot 
say that the laws are wrong.  We as a country did not support 
this war.  We salute their bravery but simply cannot agree that 
men who fought in a war not sanctioned by Canada are entitled to 
benefits which are reserved for people who answered their own 
nation's call to arms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should think for a few moments about what it would mean 
internationally if this House recognized officially the fight of 
these volunteers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise 
today to speak to Motion No. 75 put forward by the hon. member 
for Kamloops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Veterans status is a unique honour and it confers special 
privileges to those who have served Canada.  In recognition of 
the sacrifices they made a grateful nation has provided benefits 
to help provide for their war related needs.  I consider it an 
honour to play a role as parliamentary secretary in the 
government's approach on veterans issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion, as it is written now, would give veteran status and 
benefits only to those Canadians who fought for one side in the 
Spanish civil war.  Let me remind my hon. colleague that 
Canadians fought on both sides in the civil war. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians answered the call to serve their country during two world 
wars, the Korean War, and in several peacekeeping operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as the member mentioned, some Canadians served under 
different flags, during other conflicts, notably with the opposing 
factions during the Spanish civil war. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 1,300 Canadians volunteered for the international brigade 
to fight against Franco.  Incidentally, in the first hour of 
debate of this motion, the member for Chateauguay indicated that 
52 countries participated in the civil war.  I do not know where 
the member got that figure.  But of the 1,300 Canadians who 
participated, some fought in the Mackenzie-Papineau battalion, 
the Mac-Paps, others in the Abraham Lincoln battalion, the 
British battalion and other units.  They suffered heavy 
causalities.  Only 646 returned to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make it very clear about the government's view of their 
efforts.  No one will deny that these Canadians fought bravely. 
No one will deny that they believed deeply in the cause for which 
they fought.  They were not fighting for Canada.  They were 
fighting in direct contravention of Canadian policy and Canadian 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind this House that Canada had a policy of neutrality in 
the civil war that divided Spain.  It was a sound policy.  If the 
hon. member for Kamloops believes that Canada should have weighed 
in on one side or the other of the Spanish civil war, I ask him 
to look back to the political realities of those times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1937 J.S. Woodsworth, one of the founders of the CCF, which 
we all know is the precursor of the New Democratic Party, 
presented a motion to this House advocating strict neutrality in 
all European conflicts.  To enforce Canada's neutrality, this 
House passed the Foreign Enlistment Act in 1937.  It continues in 
force to this day.  It prohibits Canadians from joining the armed 
forces of, or otherwise supporting, a foreign state which is 
waging war against another foreign state which is on friendly 
terms with Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has authority to make regulations to apply this 
act to civil war.  That is what it did with respect to Spain in 
1937.   On July 31 of that year it became a crime to fight on 
either side of the Spanish civil war.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although in previous speeches some members mentioned that these 
Canadians were subject to job discrimination and surveillance by 
the RCMP, to the best of my knowledge no veteran of the Spanish 
civil war has ever been prosecuted under this law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to remember that these men disregarded the law 
and by adopting this motion we would in effect reward them for 
doing so.  I would ask hon. members to consider what kind of 
precedent this would set.  What kind of example does it make for 
young people today?  Are we saying that it is permissible to 
violate the law rather than work through democratic processes to 
change it? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we going to set a precedent granting the status of veteran not 
only to those who served Canada when their country called them, but also 
to those who served under a foreign flag in a conflict in which Canada 
had remained neutral? What message would we be sending to Canadian 
veterans? This would stain the honour granted those who answered their 
country's call and who fought for Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, I wonder if the member for Kamloops has contacted the 
Royal Canadian Legion to obtain its views.  I have a letter 
addressed to the Minister of Veterans Affairs from the president 
of the Royal Canadian Legion, Dominion Command: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Minister: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[The member for Kamloops] recently presented a private member's 
motion recommending the government consider the advisability of 
giving the members of the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion and other 
Canadians who fought with Spanish Republican forces in the 
Spanish civil war the status of veterans under federal 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Canadian Legion does not support the granting of 
veterans status to those who fought in the Spanish civil war.  It 
was an offence under Canadian law at the time to fight on any 
side during that war.  The Legion supports the rule of law and 
does not view it as appropriate to advocate a position at this 
late date which would in effect legitimize that which was illegal 
at the time.  This could set an untenable precedent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yours sincerely, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joseph Kobolak 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dominion President. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, adopting this motion would open the floodgates to other 
groups such as Canadian veterans of the Vietnam war who, contrary 
to what the member for Chateauguay said in his speech, do not 
qualify under our legislation for Canadian veteran status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an emotional issue.  It deals with elderly Canadians who 
in their youth were governed by their conscience to risk their 
lives in one of the most brutal conflicts of the century. They 
fought like heroes and left many of their comrades behind in the 
cemeteries of Spain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, no one is denying their courage and their 
commitment to their cause.  Although the motion does not 
specifically call for it, the member for Kamloops mentioned that 
we should look at the possibility of setting this issue before a 
committee.  As the member for the Progressive Conservative Party 
said, this issue has been raised in this House many times, the 
most recent being in 1986-87 when the standing committee on 
veterans affairs, chaired by a former member from Malpeque in my 
home province, studied the issue in great detail. After very 
careful research, deliberation and consideration that committee 
decided against recommending veteran status to Spanish civil war 
veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think this House in responding today to the motion from 
the hon. member for Kamloops should overturn the considered 
judgment of the committee that took several months to look into 
the issue in great detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleagues to vote against the motion.  In so doing I 
remind the House of the words of the report that the committee 
tabled on the issue.  I think those words speak eloquently of the 
Canadians who fought in the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion.  Many 
were killed, the report says. Many endured great hardship and 
displayed great courage. We mourn the loss and admire the 
qualities these men displayed.  They acted out of conscience and 
this merits respect whether one agrees with them or not.  May 
their twilight years be spent with the comfort of their own 
beliefs in the cause they served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Canadian veteran status and veterans benefits are 
reserved for those who fought for Canada.  That is how the law 
should remain.  That is why I am voting against this motion and I 
urge my honourable colleagues to do the same. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the purpose 
of this motion is to have this House investigate ways of granting 
some form of recognition to a noble group of Canadians, the 
MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion. 
They are a unit of 1,300 volunteer soldiers who banded together 
to go abroad and fight the suppression of democracy, the fascist 
powers of Europe.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These were Canadians who had the wisdom and the foresight to see 
the real dangers of fascism well before governments around the 
world.  In return for this wisdom and foresight and willingness 
to stand up to fascism, these volunteers were subsequently made 
criminals by our own government through the Foreign Enlistment 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at a time when our government is making apology after 
apology.  The Japanese were apologized to, as should have been 
done.  At that time the laws were not good.  People were just 
obeying the laws by putting Japanese Canadian citizens in 
internment camps and taking their property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of aboriginal affairs has just apologized to First 
Nations people.  I went to school with a man who at the age of 
four along with his brother were scooped up off the hillside by a 
truck that came to town and were taken to a residential school, 
not to return home for eight years.  They were just obeying the 
law.  No question, they did not do anything wrong but it was 
wrong.  It was wrong then and it is wrong now and the government 
had the foresight to recognize this and apologize for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have here people who fought for our country who were right 
then and they are right now.  We recognize that what they did was 
right and it was a just cause.  It made a difference in the 
history of this decade, the freedoms of peoples and we will not 
recognize their efforts.  As a country we will not even look at a 
way to recognize it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Spanish civil war was in many ways a dress rehearsal for the 
second world war and there was therefore an early test of the 
resolve of the free world to make a stand against the forces that 
were there to crush democracy.  That is putting it very mildly. 
As we all know, it was the death of millions of minority groups 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mac-Paps fighting alongside other international brigades 
distinguished themselves in a number of major battles against 
Franco's phalange, the Italian Black Shirt divisions and the 
German Condor Legion of the Luftwaffe.  Among those Canadians was 
Dr. Norman Bethune.  The casualty rate was staggering but even 
worse was the fact that those who survived were not allowed to 
enlist and fight for their country so were doubly denied any 
chance to be seen as veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are only 40 of these people alive.  I do not think it 
would be setting a dangerous precedent to recognize what they 
have done.  The government has already shown that it has the 
courage to recognize where we went wrong in the past.  We went 
wrong here and we should have the courage to apologize and 
recognize as a country what these people did for our country.  It 
is not about money, it is about recognition of Canadian citizens 
and their efforts to make sure this country remains free.

privilege today of participating in the debate on Motion M-75 tabled by 
my NDP colleague, the hon. member for Kamloops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today to speak in support of Canada recognizing the loyalty 
and sacrifice of members of the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion. I call 
today on the good will and generosity of my fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years before World War II, the Spanish civil war broke out 
pitting brothers against brothers, sisters against sisters. Franco and 
his army won the war and the fascist dictatorship lasted 40 years, in 
fact until the dictator died in 1976. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This conflict was not merely a civil war for the repercussions 
went far beyond.  Claude Bowers, the American ambassador to Spain 
between 1936 and 1939, said at the time: “History will declare 
that the six months intervening between the fascist victory in 
Spain and the invasion of Poland were a mere armistice in one 
war, the second world war”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view the Spanish civil became the powder keg that ignited 
the second world war just as an infamous assassination in 
Sarajevo laid the groundwork for World War I. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Spanish republican government, democratically elected and 
therefore legitimate, appealed to the international community for help.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the stated neutrality of their governments, volunteers 
came from Argentina, Cuba, Poland, Sweden, the U.S.S.R., Great Britain, 
the United States, France and other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brave antifascist citizens of Italy and Germany risked their lives 
and that of their families to help the cause of a democratic country 
that Franco would transform into a dictatorship for 40 years. In Canada, 
close to 1,250 men and women with names like Maurice Constant, Peter 
Johnston, Hugo Koski and William Dent, to name but four, left their 
homeland for the battlefields of Spain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These Canadians, most of whom were of European descent, had 
suffered from the consequences of the first world war. 
However, the vast majority of them were not soldiers and had never even 
handled a firearm. Most were blue collar workers, journeymen, students, 
citizens of Canada at a time when our country was still suffering from 
the severe economic depression of the 1920s and 1930s. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Norman Bethune was one of these brave Canadians.  As head of an 
innovative battlefield blood transfusion service, Bethune 
witnessed the horrors and became rapidly conscious of the stakes 
of war. He is often quoted as having said “The time to stop 
fascism is now and the place to stop it is Spain”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another brave Canadian was Maurice Constant, then staff 
lieutenant for the 15th International Brigade and now emeritus 
professor at the University of Waterloo.  Constant recalls living 
through the Great Depression.  He said “People of my generation 
had the same feelings as young people now; the feeling of 
helplessness.  There were no jobs to go to.  We students thought 
the political-economic system was a failure”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Great Depression had a profound impact on Canadians. 
Therefore, it is logical to say that, for the brave soldiers of 
the Mackenzie-Papineau battalion, participating in the war was a 
way to escape marginalization, a way to relate to some absolute, 
to make it through the ideological undertow toward the certainty 
that the fight against European fascism was honourable and 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget—and this is fundamental—that General Franco 
overthrew an established democracy. In 1986, when he testified before 
the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs, Walter 
Dent, secretary for the Mac-Paps battalion, said “General Franco decided 
to overthrow the government. Therefore, what is at issue is not kind of 
people that were fighting fascism. We were fighting to protect the 
country's democratic institutions. 
This must be pointed out very clearly, so that there can be no doubt 
whatsoever”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1980 during a debate very similar to this one Bob Rae, then a 
federal member of Parliament, stated when speaking of the 
Mac-Paps that they were anti-fascist before it was fashionably 
popular to be so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The presence and popularity of pro-fascist sentiments in the 
Canadian population and institutions led to the birth in 1936 of 
Canadian legislation which partially reflected the state of mind 
of a certain fascist electorate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Foreign Enlistment Act of 1936 made it illegal for volunteers 
to fight against fascism in Spain because, at the time, Canada was 
playing it safe and professed neutrality on the international scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not in the Canadian nature to want to preserve democracy? Is 
altruism not a Canadian trait? Is it not typically Canadian to fight for 
peace, order and good government? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we still talking about the Spanish civil war in Canada 
today?  For the simple reason that some of our fellow Canadian 
citizens have not reached closure on this matter. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Religious, political and philosophical beliefs aside, these brave 
Canadians had the vision and courage to recognize that Franco's army not 
only posed a threat to Spain but also jeopardized the foundation of 
democratic nations in Europe and the balance in their relations with 
Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are the veterans of the MacKenzie-Papineau battalion today? 
Following their heart-wrenching defeat, about 650 veterans 
returned to Canada.  They were greeted as heroes in Toronto, 
where a crowd of over 10,000 had gathered to meet them. 
Groups such as the friends of the MacKenzie-Papineau battalion 
organized fundraising events to help survivors and the families 
of those fallen comrades.  But soon the plight of the Mac-Paps was 
engulfed by the overriding priorities of World War II.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the Hon. Minister of Veterans Affairs does not support 
the request made by the Mac-Paps. Neither does the Royal Canadian

members. I had the honour to meet these men and women on several 
occasions at the Legion's branch in my riding of Laval West. They all

</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the motion merely asks that a committee consider the 
advisability of recognizing the contribution made by Canadian soldiers 
in the Spanish Civil War to protect democracy. The committee will be 
free to make whatever recommendations it deems advisable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a letter dated November 20, 1997 and addressed to the hon. 
member for Kamloops, the Minister of Veterans Affairs wrote the 
following, concerning the 1987 review made by the veterans affairs 
committee on the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion “I agree with the 
committee's conclusions that we should deplore the losses suffered by 
the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, and that we should admire the 
endurance and the courage displayed by the battalion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister was sincere when he wrote these lines, he should 
support the motion. 
The Canadians who participated in the Spanish Civil War left their 
homeland for a far away country, where they were going to risk their 
lives, along with other volunteers from all over the world. These people 
were united by the same cause, namely the defence of democracy and the 
right of people to freely choose their government through an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These men and women were not adventurers. They left their families, 
their work and their country to join an under equipped army that was 
fighting seasoned troops fully supported by the fascist governments of 
Germany and Italy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 40,000 volunteers from 52 countries answered the call of a 
democratic Spain. These volunteers were not equipped, fed or housed 
adequately, and almost half of them were killed, while many others were 
injured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These volunteers were fighting to protect Spain's democratic 
institutions. The word “antifascist” was written on their pay slips. 
It is important to remember that the Spanish government which fascist 
generals were trying to overthrow was an elected, democratic and liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international brigades fought under the command of the 
legitimate Spanish government's army. The Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion 
was part of the 15th brigade, which also included a British, an American 
and a Spanish battalion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian battalion, named in honour of the two leaders of the 
1837 rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada, was formed on July 1, 
1937 at Albacete, Spain.  It was made up of some 1,200 volunteers 
and distinguished itself particularly in four campaigns: the attack 
on Fuentes on the River Ebre in the fall of 1937; the defence of 
the city of Teruel during the winter of 1937-38; the spring retreat 
of 1938; and finally, the push beyond the River Ebre in the summer 
of 1938, which was to be the last great offensive of the republican 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1938, the soldiers of the international brigades 
were withdrawn from the front lines and repatriated. Only half the 
Canadian volunteers came back. 
The other half had been either killed, reported missing or 
captured, with the exception of a few who remained in Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they returned home, some of the Spanish War veterans were 
given a heroes' welcome.  Money was raised to help them out and to 
provide the casualties with medical care.  Within a few months, 
however, their sacrifice and heroism was forgotten.  Canada soon 
declared war on the Axis and called for the nation to mobilize 
against the fascists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the fifty or so countries whose men and women took part in 
the Spanish Civil War within the international brigades, only two, 
Canada and the United States, did not confer war veteran status on 
these volunteers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, about forty of the Canadian international brigade 
volunteers are still alive, although very advanced in years. 
Passage of the motion by the member for Kamloops would not cost the 
federal government much, but it would have great symbolic 
importance.  It would recognize the some 1,200 Canadians who 
volunteered to defend democracy and to prevent the birth of a 
fascist regime in Spain on the eve of the second world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The democratic and patriotic ideals that inspired their 
struggle and their heroic sacrifice also inspired the Canadians 
who, later, fought fascism during the second world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Walter Dent explained that a number of the former volunteers 
on the international brigades contributed directly during the 
second world war through their experience.  One of them became the 
chief instructor of the armoured tank corps in Alberta.  Another 
taught officers how to read and draw maps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principal organizer of the British Home Guard was the 
former commander of the English battalion in Spain. 
The chief instructor of the secret war, who wrote a manual that was 
used by the American and British armies, was Bert Levy, a former 
brigade member, who was an American of Canadian origin.  A number 
of parachuters dropped behind enemy lines were Spanish war 
veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proof that these volunteers were first and foremost believers 
in democracy lies in the fact that many of them returned to the 
countries of eastern Europe after the war and continue to defend 
democracy.  They were punished and persecuted by the totalitarian 
regimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1980, the councils of seven Canadian cities passed 
resolutions asking the federal government to recognize the 
volunteers in the Mackenzie-Papineau battalion.  They are Calgary, 
North York, Ottawa, Thunder Bay, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, all parties in the Spanish Parliament voted in favour 
of making all survivors of international brigades honourary Spanish 
citizens.  Citizenship award ceremonies were held in November 1996, 
and 12 of the 40 Canadian veterans of international brigades took 
part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spain provided a small commemorative plaque in memory of the 
Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, which was installed on the grounds of 
the Ontario legislature by the National Historic Sites and 
Monuments Board in 1995.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inscription on the plaque is to the effect that Spain will 
not forget those Canadians who fought and gave their lives on 
behalf of democracy.  It is finally time for Canada as well to pay 
tribute to these heroic individuals who volunteered their services 
to defend democracy.  That is why the Bloc Quebecois will be voting 
in favour of this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to discuss private member's 
Motion No. 75. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the hon. member for Kamloops on his efforts in 
bringing this important matter before the House.  He like many 
hon. members understands that Canadian veterans of the Spanish 
civil war have not received the recognition they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of those brave men fought and died in defence of a 
democratically elected government.  A great many of the 1,300 
Canadians who went to fight for republican Spain between 1936 and 
1939 did not live to see their Canadian homeland again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion were the first 
Canadians to take up arms against the fascist forces of Hitler 
and Mussolini.  It appears in hindsight that they knew what 
others only suspected, that 1930s Europe was being pushed closer 
and closer to a full scale war by the spread of fascism in 
general and Nazism in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, having said all this, I feel obligated to oppose Motion 
No. 75.  My reasons for this are simple and straightforward.  The 
Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion was not a recognized unit of the 
Canadian Armed Forces.  Its soldiers were not authorized members 
of a Canadian fighting force.  The Mac-Paps, as they came to be 
known, fought in Spain against the express wishes of the Canadian 
government which took a neutral position early in the Spanish 
civil war along with Britain, France and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore find unacceptable the hon. member's assertion that 
we should retroactively make the Mackenzie-Papineau veterans 
members of the Canadian Armed Forces.  I am not alone in holding 
this position.  Previous committees and subcommittees of the 
House of Commons have expressed similar views.  So too has the 
Royal Canadian Legion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not that I do not value the sentiments of the hon. member 
for Kamloops.  On the contrary, I welcome any and all dialogue 
concerning ways this country can recognize Canadian veterans of 
the Spanish civil war.  However, in Motion No. 75 there seems to 
be a leap in logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member will know that in addition to the many Canadians 
who fought on the republican side in Spain, a handful of 
Canadians also took up arms in the name of Dictator Franco. Would 
the hon. member for Kamloops suggest that these men as well who 
fought to re-establish fascism in Spain should be recognized as 
veterans?  Would the hon. member say that these men and their 
widows should receive veterans benefits?  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member realizes that what he is asking for is 
both illogical and untenable.  Canadians have at times chosen to 
go off on their own and fight in various wars, conflicts and 
uprisings. 
This is true today and it will, no doubt, continue to be true in 
the future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some Canadians volunteer their military services for money, 
others do so out of ideological conviction, but never have 
Canadian mercenaries and freedom fighters asked to be designated 
veterans, nor will they unless the hon. member's motion is 
granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to pass judgment on the role of the Mac-Paps in the 
Spanish civil war.  It is simply to say that we cannot and should 
not rewrite history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the hon. member for Pontiac—Gatineau—Labelle, 
brought to the attention of the House last hour the similar 
findings of the standing committee on veterans affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That committee stated a decade ago that its decision not to 
grant veteran status to the Mac-Paps was “without regard to the 
rights or wrongs of the actions of those Canadians who are 
veterans of the Spanish civil war”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This cuts right to the heart of the matter.  The member for 
Kamloops is proposing that the political correctness of the 
Mac-Paps cause should qualify them for veteran status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, the member for Chateauguay questioned why Canadians 
who served in a politically incorrect war like Vietnam should be 
considered veterans when the Mac-Paps are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What both members seem to forget is that Canada recognizes as 
its veterans only those who serve Canada or its allies in a war 
in which Canada was a combatant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mac-Paps did not meet this criterion in 1936 and they do not 
meet it now.  However valiant they may have been in their defence 
of Spanish democracy, the members of the MacKenzie-Papineau 
Battalion fought as civilians in the eyes of the Canadian 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It matters not that they are now only few in number or that it 
would not involve significant sums of money should this motion 
succeed.  In my mind there is nothing that would justify changing 
this situation 60 years after the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are, however, compelling reasons to honour the Mac-Paps in 
other ways.  The member for Kamloops mentioned in his speech that 
a memorial was erected recently at Queen's Park and that similar 
plans are under way in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my belief that many members of this House would be more 
than happy to support some kind of federal initiative that would 
not only preserve but promote the proud history of the Mac-Paps. 
I will not endorse the politically motivated revision of history 
that is called for in Motion No. 75. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I oppose the motion before the House but would like 
to commend the hon. member for Kamloops for his efforts to 
increase public awareness of Canadian involvement in the Spanish 
civil war. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I too am pleased to rise to speak on Motion No. 75.  I wish to 
commend my hon. colleague from Kamloops for having brought this 
motion before the House even though I disagree with it in 
principle and will vote against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think history is important.  It is important for us to not 
dismiss issues such as this and the question of the legitimate 
status as veterans for those who fought in the MacKenzie-Papineau 
Battalion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a slightly different perspective from that which 
prevailed in this debate.  It has been suggested that those 1,300 
Canadians who entered into the Spanish civil war of their own 
volition did so out of a commitment to democracy and out of a 
desire to fight and defeat fascism.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt that they felt so motivated, that they felt 
called and they felt the courage of their convictions in engaging 
in this war.  Nor do I deny that many of these veterans acted 
heroically in the action they faced.  The fact that so many of 
them died is one of the tragedies of war which we all mourn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several people who have spoken to this motion have rendered a 
simplistic and incomplete picture of the history of 1937 and the 
Spanish civil war.  They have painted the contribution of the 
MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion and the Republican forces in the 
Spanish civil war as being, without question, beyond repute and 
on the side of the angels.  They have suggested that the forces 
they were fighting were merely an extension of the unquestionably 
evil forces of fascism which were then gaining force in Nazi 
Germany. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important for us to recognize that when this House 
and this Parliament gave passage to the Foreign Enlistment Act in 
in 1937 it understood the greater complexity of the situation as 
it then unfolded in Spain, as did the Canadians who left to fight 
in Spain on behalf of the Phalangist cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No argument can be made that there was a unanimous view in this 
country about which side in this very complex and messy war had 
the moral upper hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it was the hon. member for Laval West who said that 
the Foreign Enlistment Act, which prohibited Canadians from 
enlisting in a foreign war which was not recognized by this 
country, was passed in part under pressure from a fascist 
constituency in the Canadian electorate.  I really think that 
does a disservice to Canadians, now and at the time.  It does a 
disservice to our history.  It is based on a gross 
misunderstanding of the reasons for this enactment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is the Spanish civil war was not a battle between 
good and evil.  The Spanish civil war was a complex war between, 
on the one hand Republican forces which included communists, 
Stalinists, Trotskyites, anarchists and, admittedly, democrats. 
It was a strange and tempestuous coalition which itself came to 
blows internally.  In fact, some of the most brutal actions in 
the Spanish civil war, as any historian will say, were within the 
republican movement itself, as the communists and Stalinists, fed 
by the tyrannical designs of the Russian Stalinists, attempted to 
seize control of the Republican movement and were largely 
successful in so doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side, it was not simply a uni-dimensional coalition 
of fascists supported and motivated by Adolf Hitler. Indeed the 
German and Italian fascists supported elements of the Phalangist 
cause, but there were democrats, monarchists, catholics and 
others who opposed the Republican cause because they saw it as an 
encroachment of a foreign tyrannical political movement, 
communism, and its threatened imposition on Spain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reasons different people were motivated to take different 
sides in this war are complex.  We do a great disservice to 
history and to those Canadians who fought on both sides of this 
war to suggest that it was as simple as has been presented here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, we have heard from many speakers about the atrocities 
committed by the Franco forces in the Spanish civil war, and 
understandably so.  One can make no moral apology for the evil 
that was done in that respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is important to enter into the record some 
historical consideration of the kinds of terrible evils 
perpetrated by the Republican cause which was supported by the 
Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion.  I do not suggest for one moment 
that the Canadian combatants in that war were engaged in these 
kinds of atrocities, but the fact is they fought alongside 
Stalinists and Trotskyites and anarchists and others who were 
motivated as much by a kind of anti-Christian and anti-catholic 
hatred as by a desire to establish democracy in Spain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eminent historian Hugh Thomas in his book the <I>Spanish 
Civil War</I> published in 1961, somebody regarded as generally a 
pro-Republican historian, detailed in his book the kinds of 
atrocities committed by the Republicans during the war.  Among 
other things, he says that of the 86,000 people killed under the 
Republic, 7,900 were clergy or religious, 12 were Bishops, 283 
were nuns, 5,200 were priests, 2,500 were monks and 250 were 
novices. These were not people killed as innocents in the war. 
These were religious people, not direct combatants in the war, 
who were sough out and killed by Republican forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He reports that nuns were raped and murdered in Pozuelo de 
Alarcon near Madrid.  He reports of parish priests being seized 
by leftist militia men, scourged, tied to wooden beams, given 
vinegar to drink, crowned with thorns and then shot.  He reports 
a crucifix was forced down the throat of a mother of two Jesuits. 
He reports that 800 faithful Christians were thrown down a mine 
shaft.  He reports that in Cernera rosary beads were forced into 
monks' ears until their ears ruptured.  The historical record 
shows priests having been castrated and their castrated organs 
being forced into their mouths. He reports priests who were 
burned alive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all documented incidents.  Faithful Christians were 
burned alive after digging their own graves. Others were burned 
or had their eyes gouged out.  Churches and convents were 
indiscriminately sacked and burned.  There were 150 churches 
totally destroyed and nearly 2,000 more than half destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is just one small historical review of the record of the 
wonderful Republicans in the Spanish civil war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that in considering this bill and in considering the 
history of the passage of the Foreign Enlistment Act, which this 
motion essentially seeks to undo retroactively, we must be 
mindful of the historical complexities of the time and must not 
allow ourselves to be the victims of the kind of historical 
revisionism which suggests that one side in this combat was all 
sweetness and light.  That is not what the record shows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because Parliament still recognizes the Foreign Enlistment Act 
some have argued that we cannot and should not extend veterans 
benefits to the remaining surviving Mac-Pap veterans. I would 
argue that if people engage in civil disobedience, as these 
people knowingly did, they agree to accept the consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>John Stuart Mill, the great political philosopher, says in his 
magnum opus <I>On Liberty</I> that those who engage in civil 
disobedience do so while accepting the sanctions the state 
imposes for such civil disobedience.  Those who engaged in the 
Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion knew full well at the time and with 
conscious deliberation decided to act with civil disobedience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that 60 years later we cannot undo a decision they 
made at that time.  I call on my colleagues to oppose this 
motion.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>COURTS IN CAMPBELLTON 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
February 6, I brought to the attention of the House the fact that courts 
in the Restigouche region were overloaded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give a brief historical overview of this issue. In 1992, the 
number of judges sitting in Campbellton dropped from two to one. A few 
months later, the only judge serving the region was transferred to the 
judicial district of Fredericton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While waiting for a replacement, the region of Campbellton was 
without a permanent judge for about three months. The ensuing backlog 
would probably not have been insurmountable, except that the court 
registered an increase in the volume of cases, including family law 
cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judge who is currently sitting is making superhuman efforts to 
hear as many cases as possible, but it is now obvious that his valiant 
efforts are not enough to ensure quick processing of the cases. Not a 
single small claims case has been heard for a year now, and some civil 
cases will not be heard before 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members may think this is a provincial matter. Normally, I 
would agree. However, there have been a number of developments in which 
politics clearly impeded the judicial process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new chief justice in New Brunswick did everything within his 
power to find a solution to the court's backlog. Now, the bar 
association in Restigouche, the crown attorney's office, the chief 
justice of New Brunswick and the New Brunswick bar association all agree 
on the solution: Campbellton needs an additional judge. The two levels 
of government are the only ones dragging their feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I raised the issue in the House, the solicitor general—the 
Minister of Justice was not present—said that the federal government 
was aware of the situation. If so, what is it waiting for to act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told by the federal Department of Justice that nothing can 
be done until a written request is received from the provincial 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, the New Brunswick justice department tells us that the 
request was made and that they are waiting for a reply from the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that the provincial and federal governments will 
quit passing the buck on this and will finally accept their 
responsibilities, so that access to justice will no longer be 
jeopardized in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's inaction impacts very heavily on the human 
level.  Mothers can wait up to eight or nine months for a support 
order to allow them to feed their children properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since small claims court cases have not been heard for a year, 
business owners really have no recourse when they have been 
wronged.  I have also heard of accident victims who have had to go 
on welfare while waiting for their cases to come up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation cannot continue.  The people feel there is no 
longer any justice for them, and it would seem, unfortunately, that 
they are right. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker,  I 
would first reassure the member that the Minister of Justice shares 
his concerns on the delays in the legal proceedings.  However, as 
the hon. member mentioned, the matter is a provincial 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, the Province of New Brunswick will determine the 
number of judges appointed to superior and provincial courts.  The 
Minister of Justice simply appoints judges in the event of 
vacancies in the province.  Currently, all positions on the court 
of Queen's bench in New Brunswick are filled. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here is one of ensuring the effective allocation of 
existing judicial resources. 
The level of judicial service in any part of the province is the 
shared responsibility of the provincial attorney general and of 
the chief justice of the court of Queen's bench.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a political problem as the member would like us to 
believe.  The minister has heard from the attorney general of New 
Brunswick and is in discussions with the New Brunswick minister 
on this issue. There are ongoing discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to clarify that the minister supports all 
initiatives that will take place to the access to justice and to 
reduce delays in legal proceedings. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in fact, the minister also announced a federal 
initiative to promote the unification of family courts.  At the 
request of a number of provinces, new judges may be appointed to 
simplify access to the justice system on family matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initiatives testify to the importance the government 
places on the right of all Canadians to have access to the justice 
system.  The minister shares the hon. member's concerns on the 
situation faced by the residents of Campbellton, and I can assure 
him that the matter will be raised with her New Brunswick 
counterpart.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>HEALTH CARE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, tonight I 
have the opportunity to say a few words about the state of health 
care in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice with interest that at the Liberal convention coming up 
in a few hours there are a number of resolutions pointing out the 
concern of delegates from across the country attending the 
Liberal convention regarding the state of health care in Canada. 
They are pointing out that in their judgment some cases are 
actually at a crisis level.  I think the Minister of Health 
actually used that word in a couple of comments in the last 
little while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall it is fair to say that the Liberal government does not 
take health care seriously.  Canada is now 17th among the 28 
industrialized nations of the Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development in public spending on health care. 
Between 1986 and 1997 the public portion of Canada's health tab 
declined from 77% to 70%. By 1999 it is expected to drop to only 
60%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today private spending in Canada's universal public system 
exceeds the total of federal health care dollars.  I might add 
that only 20% of Canada's health care funding now comes from the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1986 Ottawa has slashed a total of $36 billion from health 
care according to Dr. Fuller of the Health Sciences Association 
of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to mention that medicare's complete privatization 
appears to be the goal of at least two provincial governments 
these days, the governments of Alberta and Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read with interest just a few days ago how impressed the B.C. 
Reform member for North Vancouver was at the service he received 
in a Florida hospital while he was on vacation.  He said “It 
really put to shame what happens in Canada.  I do not think there 
is any harm in having some competition.  I know it is widely 
supported in my riding and there should be some competition to 
get efficiency into the system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of these fiscal and ideological pressures on our 
system, privatization is well under way across the country.  In 
Manitoba people with means to do so are hiring their own nurses 
to care for them in hospital.  The fact they have to do this is a 
reflection of the crisis in our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week apparently with the blessing of the Alberta 
government, the Royal Bank of Canada and the Alberta Medical 
Association reached an agreement that will see patients able to 
charge uninsured medical services on their credit cards or debit 
cards right at the doctor's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on at some length.  I think it is fair to say that if 
there was a poll conducted across the country, Canadians 
everywhere would consider that we are in a crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I simply want to say that health care in Canada 
has become a $75 billion marketplace.  United States based 
international corporations armed with free trade agreements 
threaten to dominate the provision of services shortly with the 
support of some provincial governments, most large employers and 
a large section of organized medicine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For profit companies are benefiting from government 
participation in joint ventures, lucrative contracts with 
ministries of health, outsourcing arrangements with hospitals, 
generous tax breaks for venture capital investors, access to 
medicare payments and direct grant allocations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could go on and on.  I can summarize by simply saying our 
health care system is in serious trouble.  Medicare is being 
challenged from coast to coast. It is time that the federal 
government took this issue more seriously than it is at the 
moment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the question 
has arisen as to when Canadians can expect the federal government 
to come forward with a financial commitment for home care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Home care is already an integral part of our health care system. 
It is not an add-on or a new idea.  It is an essential component 
of the care that many Canadians receive on a regular basis.  What 
is new is how home and community care can be used within the 
system in this era of modern technology and the potential of home 
care to meet needs created in the system by the extensive 
restructuring and reform seen in most jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come to examine home care programs in all 
jurisdictions and, as members might expect, that task will not be 
a simple one.  While we are committed to taking steps toward the 
future, delegates at the recent national conference on home care 
have made it clear that the task is large and complex.  Delegates 
urge all levels of government to work together on the development 
of a national home care approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize the need to develop a national approach to home and 
community care for Canadians, an approach that will ensure 
Canadians that wherever they go across the country, they can 
receive the care they need.  Recognizing that there is a need and 
knowing in detail how to meet that need are two different 
matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To develop a national approach of this calibre, we must work 
together in partnership with provincial and territorial 
governments, with care providers across all parts of the health 
system and with Canadians in all walks of life.  We need the 
results of pilot and evaluation studies that are being sponsored 
by the health transition fund and other research studies that 
have been undertaken to inform our discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point an immediate new financial commitment in respect 
of home and community care is not appropriate, but I can say that 
the government will be there to fulfil its responsibility with a 
contribution in an appropriate amount when we see the size and 
the shape of the solution—

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ATOMIC ENERGY CONTROL BOARD 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as the former chairman of the Kitchener-Wilmot Hydro Commission, 
I have a strong and keen interest in the generation of 
electricity in the province of Ontario.  I have a particular 
interest in the use of nuclear power and the generation of that 
electricity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ongoing concerns have been expressed in relation to the use of 
nuclear power in Ontario.  The safety of the system has been 
repeatedly questioned.  I am not here to debate whether or not to 
use nuclear power.  Rather, I think it is important to ensure 
that residents of Ontario have faith and confidence in Ontario 
Hydro. This includes the use of nuclear power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, I was dismayed recently when the Atomic Energy 
Control Board was reported to have said that Ontario Hydro's 
failure to show detailed plans on how it will improve slipping 
nuclear safety was “entirely unacceptable”.  It would appear 
that there are ongoing concerns on the part of the Atomic Energy 
Control Board regarding missed promises and commitments by 
Ontario Hydro in this regard.  This is unacceptable to residents 
of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, people in Ontario need to know and be reassured 
that everything is being done to ensure a safe and secure system 
in the generation of electrical power in Ontario.  I would ask 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources 
to give that assurance today to both this House and to the people 
of Ontario. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Atomic 
Energy Control Board is responsible for regulating all nuclear 
facilities and activities in Canada.  Its role is focused 
strictly on health, safety and environmental protection.  It is 
not mandated to interfere in the business practices of its 
licensees unless those practices have safety implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with Ontario Hydro is one of management and 
operational performance, not public safety.  Public safety and 
environmental protection are the Government of Canada's highest 
priorities.  Safety has never been compromised.  We have very 
high nuclear safety standards and strong enforcement of those 
standards through the AECB which played a key role in getting 
Ontario Hydro to take aggressive corrective action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technology is not the problem.  The Candu technology is one of 
the best, if not the best in the world, as demonstrated by the 
excellent safety and operating performance record of Candus 
around the world.  Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, AECL, has 
taken a proactive role in assuring its customers that this is an 
internal management problem at Ontario Hydro and that its Candu 
technology is sound and robust.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you are well aware, the Atomic Energy Control Board has 
concluded that Ontario Hydro nuclear generating stations continue 
to be operated safely under the conditions of its licences and 
for the duration of the licences.  This conclusion is consistent 
with the findings of Ontario Hydro's own investigation and with 
the report of the Ontario Select Committee on Ontario Hydro 
Nuclear Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public may be assured that the AECB will continue to monitor 
the situation very closely.  The AECB has inspectors on site to 
monitor operations and to ensure that anything of safety 
significance is dealt with immediately.  If there is any evidence 
to cause any source of concern, the control board will not 
hesitate to impose restrictions as it always has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Nuclear Safety and Control Act and its supporting 
regulations which are expected to come into force in late 1998 
will provide the board with modern regulatory tools to enhance 
its regulatory capabilities.  The government's intention is to 
ensure that Canada continues to have a strong independent nuclear 
regulator which focuses on the safety of people and environmental 
protection.
