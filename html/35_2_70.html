<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The motion put before the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams</b>: Mr. Speaker, a point of order. The motion that 
was placed before the House and was agreed to calls for debate on 
the motion. When will the debate commence?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Just as soon as the 
government tables the motion we will move to debate. The motion 
presented by the chief government whip was the agreement to 
debate the motion once it is tabled, within certain parameters I 
believe, until 1.50 p.m. this afternoon.
<P>
	I will look to the government side and see if we can move back to 
motions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
move that the 25th report of the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs, presented to the House this day, be concurred 
in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to debate the 
concurrence motion so ably put to the House by the parliamentary 
secretary to the government House leader.
<P>
	As we commence the debate we are setting in place the 
committees for this fall and for next spring, committees which 
could in fact be in place from now until the next election. Of 
course, next fall if we are still in session and still in this Parliament, 
then the whips, through the mechanism of a striking committee, 
will table another report which would be subject to something 
similar to what we are experiencing today and new committees 
would be struck then.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Meanwhile, we are all here this morning to debate this report, 
which, as I pointed out earlier, will put in place these committees.
<P>
	To start with today, I would like to talk about the amendments 
made to the whole committee system in the past few years and the 
new openness that now exists in this Parliament. In previous 
Parliaments, parliamentary committees did not have the same level 
of authority as today.
<P>
	For example, committees now have the authority to draft 
legislation. These committees have done so. The bill on lobbyists, 
for example, was drafted by a parliamentary committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> This is not a good example.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I for one think it is a good example because we did 
a good job. I commend opposition members for their excellent 
work, notwithstanding the criticism aimed at them by my friend 
across the way. I think the members from both sides of the House 
who sat on this committee did a good job.
<P>
	Having given you that example, I could add several others.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This morning one minister tabled two bills which will be sent to 
committee for study prior to second reading. The general principle 
of the bill, as opposed to merely the clauses, are up for review at a 
very different level, a far more intense level of criticism than those 
bills which are sent after second reading. That is an innovation of 
this Parliament and that is the kind of good work that can be done 
by parliamentary committees when bills are sent there prior to 
second reading under the new mechanism and, of course, pursuant 
to the promises that were made in the red book and which have 
been delivered, as were so many promises in the red book.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	The parliamentary committees have done tremendous work. Just 
yesterday we saw the finance committee table a report in the House 
on the whole issue of family trust.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A while ago, we saw a whole series of reports prepared by 
parliamentary committees and the good job they did.
<P>
	I must tell you that, when I first arrived here as a member of 
Parliament back in 1984, committees were not doing much other 
than dealing with legislation and budgetary estimates. Today, under 
Standing Order 108(2), committees can practically turn into 
working groups and review all kinds of matters coming under the 
responsibility of the departments associated with the various 
committees.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4417"> 4417 </A></B>
<P>
	Under Standing Order 108(2), the transport committee can 
review transportation issues either within or outside the estimates.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> The auditor general.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The hon. member opposite talks about the auditor 
general. In fact, this power existed before the amendment I just 
mentioned. This is not a good example, because this power has 
existed for a long time. It existed before Standing Order 108(2). In 
fact, the power of the public accounts committee to review the 
auditor general's report is similar to the power now held by other 
committees; it did not exist before.
<P>
	In that sense, I am glad the hon. member raised the issue. 
Committees have a much freer hand today than they did, say, 10 or 
12 years ago when I first came to this hon. House.
<P>
	Of course, much more headway has been made since this 
government took office and opened up all sorts of new ways to 
improve the efficiency of parliamentary committees.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have, for instance, seen some of the work done by the foreign 
affairs and environment committees in dealing with issues ranging 
from pollution, circumpolar issues and so on. The foreign affairs 
committee is, as I understand it, studying the possibility right now 
of doing work in that regard. All of this would have been 
impossible under the rules as they existed only a few years ago.
<P>
	We saw a joint committee early in this Parliament do a review of 
both the foreign affairs department and the defence policy put 
together. This was a joint effort of the foreign affairs committee 
and the defence committee. This was early in Parliament. They did 
an excellent report, widely quoted, and this work was done under 
the able chairmanship of the then member for Ottawa-Vanier, 
now a member of the other place, Senator Jean-Robert Gauthier. 
That kind of excellent work was done in this Parliament by the 
parliamentary committees.
<P>
	The point I am making here is that the parliamentary committees 
have a role to play today which is far different than the one I knew 
when I came here. I only wished that as a new member I would 
have had the power to do all these things that new members today 
as they come here in Parliament are experiencing. The level of 
frustration that some of us had many years ago when we tried to do 
anything in committees was unbelievable.
<P>
	I see my distinguished colleague from Edmonton who was a 
member in this House several years ago at the time when I believe 
estimates were probably done right on the floor of the House of 
Commons. There was little or no work done by committees. You 
could not even call witnesses before a parliamentary committee. 
You could barely hear testimony of any kind with regard to 
legislation.
<P>
	Today we have committees sitting in Ottawa, bringing experts to 
give advice so that we can improve on the legislation of the 
government and study issues far and wide. All of these 
opportunities would have been virtually impossible before.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	We have starting next week the standing committee on justice 
travelling to look at the Young Offenders Act. I am sure it will 
produce an excellent report.
<P>
	I hear a member of the Reform Party being critical already but I 
am not that negative about the Reform member who will be sitting 
on that committee. I think he will probably do a good job. I am 
willing to give the benefit of the doubt to the hon. member, 
notwithstanding the criticism which is already starting by some of 
his colleagues. That is okay.
<P>
	We have faith in some of the Reform members. We say that the 
ones on that committee will hopefully do a good job. I hope they 
do. I am still hopeful. I hope those Reformers do not take 
personally the criticism of their own colleagues we have just heard. 
We are on their side. We will defend those Reformers sitting on the 
justice committee.
<P>
	The parliamentary committees have done a very good job over 
recent years. In this Parliament we have seen them do excellent 
work. We have seen them produce legislation. We have seen them 
produce reports. We have seen them study various issues, make 
recommendations to Parliament and we have seen many of those 
recommendations turned into law.
<P>
	During the 1993 election campaign our party had the red book. I 
know you are a non-partisan person, Mr. Speaker, but nevertheless 
I am sure you will recall those of us who are more partisan-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The members across who want to abolish the CBC 
did not get their way. I guess they are agitated this morning.
<P>
	Notwithstanding that, here is what we said. We said we would 
give MPs a greater role in drafting legislation through House of 
Commons committees. That was done. Legislation was produced, 
everything from the redistribution bill that was produced by 
parliamentary committee to the committee that dealt with the 
lobbyist registration and so on.
<P>
	We said we would permit parliamentary committees to review 
order in council appointments. Most people across the way have 
never even used that process. That process was used a lot more 
when we on this side of the House were in opposition. We were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4418"> 4418 </A></B>
<P>
scrutinizing those  things a lot more diligently than some members 
of the opposition now.
<P>
	We said at that time there would be more free votes allowed in 
the House of Commons. Free votes occur almost exclusively in the 
Liberal caucus. When was the last time we saw the Reform Party 
vote against one another? I know someone will bring to my 
attention the gun control issue where one member voted against the 
rest of them. Shall we say he had a different job not too many days 
later, a job with less whipping. Nevertheless we had some free 
votes. The consequences were a little different in the Reform Party.
<P>
	We also said the parliamentary committee would do prebudget 
consultation. That has been probably the greatest success of all 
parliamentary committee initiatives. I congratulate all members of 
the finance committee on both sides of the House in all three 
political parties officially represented in Parliament. That 
consultation has occurred every fall. It has given Canadians a more 
precise picture of the country's finances and we have been able to 
track gradually how this country has been doing financially. That is 
something which is unprecedented.
<P>
	We have the finance committee televised nationwide, being 
questioned by members on all sides of the House and being able to 
indicate to all Canadians the progress of Canada's economy. 
Whereas that process formally occurred once a year at budget time, 
we have developed an almost twice a year system. We now have the 
fall consultation process with the appearance of the minister and 
the others who also appear before the Finance Committee, and then 
the spring budget free period.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	Why did this happen? I believe it happened in large measure 
thanks to the diligence of members on all sides of the House. In 
order for that to happen the proper climate had to be there to start 
with. That process was permitted because this government wanted 
to change the rules and allow Parliament to do that. We did. It was 
in the red book. We made the commitment. We delivered on the 
promise. We made that kind of thing happen, or at least we created 
the climate to make it happen.
<P>
	The reason I make the distinction is that notwithstanding the 
wishes of the government had members on all sides of the House 
done a shoddy job of the whole thing it would not have been very 
significant. The government made the commitment. The House put 
the structure in place. Members on all sides of the House acted 
properly and made it work. I congratulate all members. You did a 
good job and that process now has an incredible level of credibility.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	You can certainly see the good work parliamentary committees 
are doing. The Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development has also done a fine job with its comprehensive study 
of social programs in Canada.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that the Standing Committee on Finance took 
on prebudget studies. There is also the Standing Committee on 
Industry, with its ongoing review of the banking industry in 
Canada, its summer hearings and all it has done. Why is the 
industry anxious to know what the Standing Committee on Industry 
is going to do? Because this committee has gained credibility in 
this matter through its good work and because the rules we have 
now allow committees to do that kind of work. These rules did not 
exist when I was first elected to Parliament in 1984.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Paul, Lib.):</B> It has been many 
years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> It has been many years indeed. In fact, to be more 
precise next Wednesday I will be celebrating 20 years in political 
life. The rules have changed over the years and they have changed 
for the best.
<P>
	I will conclude on this to give as much time as possible to 
parliamentarians from other parties to speak. I am confident that, 
like me, they will express satisfaction with the way parliamentary 
committees operate and will want to commend the hon. members 
for their excellent work on these committees.
<P>
	This was made possible by the excellent co-operation of the 
committees and by this government's agreeing to put the system in 
place and improve it as required and then listening to the advice 
given by parliamentarians. Through committee reports, we have 
collectively ensured better government for Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I wonder if we could 
seek the unanimous consent of the House to take a few minutes so 
we could introduce petitions and then come back to the motion 
rather than waiting until the debate collapses. This way we would 
be able to get petitions finished and get back to the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, if we immediately move to the 
presentation of petitions, it will leave us less time to debate the 
committees' motion. Is this indeed the case? I would first like to 
know how many petitions there are. They could always be 
presented at three o'clock.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I appreciate the involvement 
of the chief opposition whip, but the House did not give its 
unanimous consent. We therefore resume with the questions and 
comments for the last speaker.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
comment and a question for the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
	In the member's commentary he spoke for a long time and 
virtually said nothing of substance except to praise the status quo, 
which is not what we are here to do. We are here to bring about 
positive change. The member also made an implication as to my 
role when I was whip and about free votes. Let me explain to him 
very briefly what free votes are all about in the Reform Party.
<P>
	A free vote means that we vote the party line, the platform and 
policies that we represent to the people, unless we have clear 
evidence from our constituents, even those who did not vote for us, 
to vote otherwise. The way we find that out is to do polling, talk 
shows, town halls, surveys through householders and scientific 
surveys. I did that on gun control. I live in an urban riding and there 
is a greater mix there. Therefore, I voted the wishes of my 
constituents which were with the government on that issue. My 
colleagues are proud of that. That is a free vote.
<P>
	That is the way we would do a free vote if we were government, 
not the way the member claims a free vote should work, which is 
that on private members' bills we have free votes. That is a sham 
and that is not what free votes are about.
<P>
	On sexual orientation, I did the same thing. I voted with the 
government because there was a clear indication from my 
constituents to vote with the government on that bill instead of with 
my party. My party did not kick me out of any position. I resigned 
the position of party whip voluntarily and freely.
<P>
	For the member to use an argument of convenience is once again 
misleading the public which not only he is doing today but the 
finance minister and every minister across the way has done, 
except for the current human resources development minister. He is 
doing the best job of all.
<P>
	I will now put my question to the hon. member. As the whip for 
the government, as a man who bragged about his 20 years of 
experience in the system, as a man who has honesty and integrity, 
as a man who I know will tell me the truth to this question, as a man 
who I know will not shirk from his responsibility to answer this 
question, does he, when these committees are set and struck, tell 
the members of his committees who are assigned to those 
committees how to vote and whom to vote for in terms of 
vice-chairs? Will he answer that question with conviction, honesty 
and courage on chairs and vice-chairs? On public accounts we 
cannot have a member of the opposition party as a chair. On that 
issue, would he give me the benefit of his 20 years of experience 
and be honest with me?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, let us start with the issue of the 
wishes of constituents before I get to the second part. The hon. 
member just told us how he did the right thing by voting on gun 
control because it was the way his constituents wanted him to vote.
<P>
	However, there is something wrong with the proposition here 
because his leader said that even though his constituents wanted 
him to vote for the bill that he was going to vote against it. What 
the hon. member just told us is that he did the right thing by not 
adhering to the party line. He has to at the same time recognize that 
he has told his leader that he has done the wrong thing because he 
did the opposite to what his constituents wanted. That is the 
proposition that has just been-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> And I will be held accountable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> He just told us now that his constituents will 
probably kick him out. That may be so but that is not the point. The 
point is that the hon. member has just said that a rule applies to him 
and he followed it and that the rule was the rule of the Reform 
Party. However, the leader did not follow the rule which he has just 
himself invoked as being the rule for the Reform Party. We have to 
admit that there is something inconsistent in that.
<P>
	Let us get to the second part. The member has asked me how I do 
my job of whip in the Liberal Party. I hope I do it with honesty. I 
hope I serve my country, my party, the Prime Minister of this 
country and all of us in the House of Commons properly. I believe 
that is how all of us should behave in our jobs.
<P>
<B>(1035 )</B>
<P>
	The hon. member was the whip of his party; the hon. gentleman 
performed this function for his party for some time and he did it 
very well. He will note that whether the issue was the timing of a 
vote or any other issue, he consulted with his colleagues and with 
his leader and then took a decision. After making that decision he 
would take action on whatever issue.
<P>
	I do not know whether in his party it was he when he was whip or 
his leader, who selected the critic, which is roughly the equivalent 
on the opposition side of what the chair or the vice-chair is on the 
government side. I have no idea how this selection process occurs. 
Maybe they draw straws. Maybe the leader selects them. I do not 
know because it is an internal caucus matter on their side.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Committees are supposed to be independent, Don.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> And the hon. member says that committees are 
supposed to be independent.
<P>
	We just appointed the members to the committee. The member 
across is not going to tell me that he did not appoint them. His 
signature is on the report we tabled in this House a few minutes 
ago. Obviously determining the composition of committees is not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4420"> 4420 </A></B>
<P>
an independent  process. Under the standing orders it is done by the 
whips of all political parties.
<P>
	The member cannot say that he has no knowledge of the rules. 
He was, after all, the whip for some time, and I know the whip 
knew the rules.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I call for resumption 
of debate, just so we all understand the rules of debate on this 
motion, I will look to the Bloc Quebecois then the Reform Party for 
their participation.
<P>
	The time allocations are all the same with 20 minutes and 10 
minutes. Then we will revert to the normal rules of debate, going 
from one side of the House to the other.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
always I enjoyed the speech of the government whip. He is always 
very entertaining. He always gives us a nice little political story to 
go with his speech, but he often does not answer the question. The 
question that was put to him today was point blank: Does he or 
somebody else in the leadership of the Liberal Party instruct the 
members on those committees how to vote on the committees as to 
who will be chair and vice-chair?
<P>
	A committee is supposed to be independent of the House. In 
other words, it supposedly has an agenda of its own. It calls the 
witnesses and comes to conclusions independently of the House. It 
runs its own affairs, organizes itself and if it has to spend money, it 
will ask the House for permission.
<P>
	What we are trying to get from the government whip is the 
answer to the question: Do committees really have that much 
independence or is the government whip or someone in their 
hierarchy actually holding them down under their thumb and 
telling them what to do?
<P>
	As we head into the election of the chairs and vice-chairs it will 
be interesting to see what happens. The government whip would 
not answer that question because the truth is that members are told 
how to vote in committee. They are told who the chair will be and 
they are told to vote for the Bloc Quebecois members, the 
separatists, for the vice-chairmanship in every committee. They are 
told that, they are instructed to do that. If they break the rules, they 
pay the price.
<P>
	That is the kind of discipline we are trying to break in this House 
of Commons. It is the kind of thing we say should be the 
prerogative of individual members. They have worked with one 
another for several years now.
<P>
	I cannot say how much it boggles my mind to say that the 
vice-chairmanship of the Canadian heritage committee should be a 
separatist who wants to break up the country. On foreign affairs we 
want to have somebody who represents Canada and Canadian 
views, who portrays the Canadian perspective on international 
issues. So what do we do? We put a separatist, a person who wants 
to break the country in half, in the vice-chairmanship, the steering 
committee as it were of that committee.
<P>
	That is a shame. It is a shame because it is instructed from the 
government side by the whip, the person who would not answer the 
question of our former whip. He knows the answer yet he tries to 
get around it. That is one of the things that is wrong with the 
committee system.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	Why are we debating this today? I can tell you why. We are 
debating what is wrong with the committee system.
<P>
	I should have mentioned before I started that I was dividing my 
time.
<P>
	There are two broad headings we are going to be discussing 
today from our perspective as to what is wrong with the committee 
structure. First, there is too little independence from the governing 
party. I already mentioned an example and I will talk a little more 
about that and what is wrong with the partisan process in the 
committee structure. The second part ironically is that committees 
are too independent from Parliament. They are too dependent on 
the party hierarchy and too independent from Parliament. I would 
like to expand on that a little bit in my time remaining.
<P>
	To use an example, I was on the committee debating Bill C-64, 
the employment equity bill. When it came time for amendments, of 
course, I had many amendments to the bill from my perspective of 
what should be done to improve it. But the amendments given on 
the government side were not amendments from the committee 
people at all. The amendments were brought in by the cabinet 
minister, laid on the desks of committee members and people 
started making amendments. Unilingual English speaking 
members were making French amendments to the bill. In other 
words, they did not have the faintest or foggiest idea what they 
were amending. If we brought that to their attention, well of course 
they had no say in the legislation at all.
<P>
	The bill went to committee, sure. We investigated it, sure. But 
the word came down from on high: ``These are the amendments 
that the cabinet minister wants. Do it, or else''. That is not 
independence and it is not what we had hoped for, which was some 
true independence from the governing party.
<P>
	That partisan process, the fear that the members in these 
committees have of what might happen to them if they break party 
lines, is hindering the political process. It hinders the independence 
of the committee process. It hinders the ability of individual 
members to have an impact on the governing of our country.
<P>
	At times it gets to the farcical stage, it gets really bad. For 
example last year the chairman of the defence committee would not 
allow our members to question the  defence minister when he was 
before the committee. The reason? Well, he was our guest and we 
do not ask nasty questions of our guest. It is partisan, highly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4421"> 4421 </A></B>
<P>
partisan. The chairman was chosen beforehand and did not have the 
confidence of the committee and has not proven herself on that 
committee. Instead, she was using her absolute authority to tell 
people what they could or could not do.
<P>
	If only the government would realize that if it cut the apron 
strings, the partisan strings to the committees, the committees 
would suddenly blossom on their own into useful, powerful and 
dynamic committees. They would have the independence required 
to get individual members of Parliament some influence into actual 
government business. Instead of being a voting machine, they 
would be a policy making machine. That is all that has to happen.
<P>
	It is the same thing that was wrong with the parliamentary 
system 20, 30 or 40 years ago and in essence it has not changed. 
Whether a bill is referred on first reading, second reading or third 
reading, we all know the truth: The committees do as they are told. 
And that, regardless of how we try to change it is what the 
government insists on.
<P>
	The second thing is about too much independence from 
Parliament. Committees are dependent on the party partisanship in 
order to make them function because of the way that party over 
there runs things. That is too bad and it should be broken in order to 
free up all backbench members who sit on these committees to 
have some real influence.
<P>
	Parliamentary committees are too independent from the rules of 
Parliament. The rules are made in the House of Commons, our 
standing orders. They give order and civility to debate. That is why 
I address you in the Chair, Mr. Speaker, instead of calling 
somebody by name across the way.
<P>
	The Latin phrase that guides this parliamentary system is lex rex. 
It means the law is king. In other words, the rule of law, the way we 
handle ourselves, the way we conduct debates, the questions you 
can ask and so on are decided by law or parliamentary procedure by 
order as to what can happen and in what order.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	The committee system is a law unto itself. When the government 
majority decides to do something it is king. In other words, the 
party is king. I do not know what the Latin for that is but the party 
is king. Instead of the rule of law being king, instead of having 
predictable standing orders for the committees, it does as it wishes 
when the going gets rough.
<P>
	On May 17, 1995 the human rights committee was studying this 
same employment equity legislation. During this supposed 
investigation I made a point of privilege. Let me read my point of 
privilege, a little of what happened during this debate. I brought 
into the House of Commons the following observations.
<P>
	First, I brought amendments to that committee in English and I 
was not allowed to table them because they were in English only. 
The chairman would not accept my amendments. They were all in 
proper order but they were in English and he would not accept 
them. This is totally out of order in a country that accepts both 
languages, and yet who cares? The chairman hammers the gavel 
and he is king. The orders came from on top. The chairman's ruling 
was challenged but it was supported entirely by the government 
whip and others who were there to make sure the chairman was the 
king. He had all the authority.
<P>
	When we had some of the amendments come forward 
amendments were passed in that committee without a vote. The 
chairman said: ``I do not want to hear anymore about this''. Smack, 
amendments carried. We said: ``But we have not even tabled the 
amendment''. He said: ``It does not matter, it is carried''. That is 
the new openness, the new co-operation.
<P>
	The committee moved then to time allocation. It said it would 
debate it all right, five minutes total time allocation per section. 
You could not even read the sections out in five minutes, but that is 
the freedom that we have in committees.
<P>
	The problem remains and it is two-fold. The partisan system 
drives it from the top, it drives it from the party hierarchy in the 
Liberal Party and demands strict obedience to its rules. On the 
other hand it does not have a law except the law of the jungle. The 
people it appoints in those positions do the bidding of the 
hierarchy. It is wrong, it is an effective committee system and all 
backbenchers from all parties should be outraged at the way that 
works.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, several of the examples provided by the hon. member are 
true. We have to review the way committees operate, including the 
election process within committees, but the issue today is really 
that of the party line.
<P>
	I believe the party line is indeed a foundation of the British 
parliamentary system, as can be seen when a general election is 
held. Candidates try to get elected on the basis of a platform, a 
party line. Why, once elected, should they no longer adhere to the 
party line? These people can run as independents if they wish. If 
they get elected, they will have their own line. It is up to them. 
Reformers claim to have ideas, a program, something to offer to 
Canadians. They would get elected based on that platform, but then 
they would do away with it? It does not make sense.
<P>
	The real problem is that this new party has a great deal of 
difficulty adjusting to the way the House operates. Let  me give you 
an example. Once, we spent an evening here voting on a series of 
amendments tabled by a Reform Party member, who voted against 
his own amendments. The House was unanimous; everyone voted 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4422"> 4422 </A></B>
<P>
against the amendments that the member had proposed. This is 
quite something, but we should tell it like it is.
<P>
	I took part in the negotiations on the establishment of the 
committees when this Parliament first opened, in January 1994. We 
discussed the issue of offices. It took me two hours, on behalf of the 
Bloc, to select the offices of Bloc members. It took about ten days 
for members of the Reform Party to do the same. They even chose a 
closet for one of their members. I think there is a problem at some 
level.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	I suggested to the Reform members that they could co-chair five 
committees, a first in the history of the Canadian Parliament, here 
in Ottawa. They said: ``We insist on having finance, commerce, 
agriculture, justice and industry.'' And a cherry on top, I suppose. I 
do not see what else they could ask for.
<P>
	It does not make any sense. These people do not know how to 
negotiate and then they complain that things do not work well. I, 
for one, think that they should adapt to how things are done here. 
We are a sovereignist party. We, of course, have major 
disagreements with the party in office, but we agree on how to 
disagree. We can agree on the rules and say: ``Here is how things 
will be done.'' Then, of course, the going gets tough, but we have 
agreed on the rules.
<P>
	There is always some way we can work with these rules. We 
have done it before and we are a sovereignist party. We are able to 
work with the rules of Parliament. I do not see why a federalist 
party like theirs has trouble functioning here. The problem is not 
with the rules. The problem is with that party.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am interested to hear the strong 
defence of the rule of law. I hope the members opposite will, during 
any referendum debates, ensuing negotiations and that kind of 
thing, stand by and say that nothing will happen to Canada except 
by the rule of law and observance of the Constitution. I hope they 
would do that, although I will not hold my breath. The rule of law 
seems to be a convenient thing for them.
<P>
	One of the things I am talking about is that in committee, 
certainly we can obey the rules. Certainly we will observe the rules. 
The trouble is that there are no rule in the committee. Some 
committees only act as a law unto themselves.
<P>
	Sometimes there is a good, experienced parliamentarian at the 
head of the committee. The member across the way is a fine 
example. We disagree with him in many ways. We disagree with 
many of his  policies. We disagree with a lot of what he says and 
stands for.
<P>
	Even on the gun control debate, a very heated and protracted 
debate, we had absolutely no problems with how he handled 
himself and how he handled the chair. That is not the case by and 
large.
<P>
	There are inexperienced people, people being paid off or people 
who are being rewarded somehow who get to chair these 
committees and ramrod things through following the wishes only 
of the party leadership. That is not right.
<P>
	The member opposite, a former justice minister with many years 
of experience, whether I disagree with him politically or not, is at 
least fair in committee and I do not have a problem. It is interesting 
that when he votes against the government, when he stands up for 
what he knows is right as he did a year ago, he lost his 
chairmanship. We do not have the benefit of his experience any 
longer. That is a shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
great pleasure to debate this issue today on committees.
<P>
	Although it is a debate about committees, it could almost be a 
debate about democracy itself. It is really a debate about the 
definition of democracy in a way that it fits our committee 
structure.
<P>
	I could talk about committees in general. My colleague has 
already brought up specific examples of committees. I could speak 
about them in general but I will start with some comments about a 
committee that is probably the worst committee on the Hill. It is 
perhaps the best example of what I would call manipulated 
democracy.
<P>
	That committee is the committee that decides whether private 
members' bills will be votable. Just before the summer break in 
June 1996, a member from the government side of the House, the 
member for Mississauga East, had her comments about the 
committee that had just decided that her private member's bill 
would not be votable quoted in the <I>Hill Times</I>: ``I am not 
suggesting that it is a kangaroo court. It is more like a cockroach 
court. You cannot see them at work and then they run away''.
<P>
	It is a really good description of what that committee stands for. 
The member from the government said had a private member's bill 
that would have ended concurrent sentences and forced rapists and 
murderers to serve consecutive sentences for multiple crimes. That 
bill was made non-votable because the government side had 
decided it did not want that issue to go to a free vote in this place.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Can a member of this House get an explanation of why it was 
non-votable? Can she or he find out what happens in that commit-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4423"> 4423 </A></B>
<P>
tee? No. There are no records kept. There are no notes. It is all done 
in secret behind closed doors with no records kept. No wonder the 
member for Mississauga East called it a cockroach court. As she 
said, we cannot see them at work and then they run away.
<P>
	That member's experience is not unusual. It has happened to me. 
Every single one of the private member's bills and motions that I 
have put forward has been made non-votable. Maybe there were 
good and logical reasons for that to happen but there is no way that 
I could get an explanation for that. That for me certainly and 
perhaps anybody in this place who has put forward a private 
member's bill is the worst committee on the Hill.
<P>
	As the member for Mississauga East said, if she had a bill that 
offered better treatment for criminals it would race through the 
place in a week, but if you have a bill that wants to side with the 
victims or correct obscene injustice in our system you can expect 
resistance and many years of effort and debate. To that member, 
welcome to the club, because that is what this side of the House is 
fighting the entire time.
<P>
	Last year there were a total of 16 private members' bills which 
would have toughened up the justice system and not one of them 
could get past the system that is put in place through these 
committees to prevent it from ever becoming law. Even the ones 
that are made votable by that cockroach court committee that end 
up being passed in this House by the members get referred to 
committees which then stonewall them, delay them and keep them 
there under the orders of the ministers until they disappear 
completely off the map.
<P>
	We see those examples over and over again. The bill that would 
have rid section 745 from the Criminal Code passed in this House 
and yet the committee and the minister are defying the will of the 
members here. It is contempt of Parliament in our estimation.
<P>
	The members on both sides of this House are demanding more 
and more that all of our private members' business should be made 
votable and that the committees should stop interfering with the 
process. We should be permitted to bring the will of the people to 
this place and to put it through and turn it into law. I certainly hope 
we will soon see the disbanding of this cockroach court committee 
which has been a major problem for us.
<P>
	The problems of the committees are really symptomatic of a 
load of problems that go right through the system which operates 
here, that makes this place almost just frosting. The real issue, the 
real cake, all happens behind closed doors. Everything is 
predecided and this is just the charade that happens on the top.
<P>
	An example is I write letters to ministers about important issues 
about these committees. Months go by. A letter written to the 
justice minister remains unanswered after two months. A question 
on the Order Paper in this place, put here on October 5, 1995 with a  
45 day answer period asking what sort of money the Squamish 
Indian Band gets in my riding has been sitting on the Order Paper 
since October 1995 and never answered. That is just another 
symptom of our constant problems.
<P>
	My colleague from Fraser Valley mentioned the employment 
equity committee. I was sitting with him on that committee when 
the employment equity bill was considered last year. We were told 
that bill would be referred to committee before second reading so 
that members could have meaningful input to shape the bill prior to 
coming back for second reading in the House. What an absolute 
sham that was. It was unbelievable. When we describe it to people 
in the outside world away from this place they can hardly believe 
that it is true, what we tell them.
<P>
	There was a time limit-arbitrary rules created by the 
committee-to discuss any clause. It did not matter how long it 
was, how short it was. Five minutes included the time it took for 
the government member to read it out and describe what it was all 
about. My colleague from Fraser Valley and I were denied the 
opportunity and ability to even ask questions of expert witnesses 
who were at that committee, experts from the government side. We 
were not even allowed to question them. We had questions from 
our constituents and we were denied the right to put them. That bill 
was rammed through the committee after hours, at short notice, 
when it was impossible for us to get witnesses to come to the 
committee. This is an abuse and a manipulation of democracy. It is 
unacceptable.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	One example my colleague from Fraser Valley gave was how the 
chairman decided he had had enough discussion and just passed 
something by himself. We had another example where we managed 
to catch a few of the government members napping and got a 
particular clause through and the chairman reversed it by himself. 
He changed the vote. The vote was yes and the clause passed. He 
said it was no and it had failed. We were unable to get that reversed. 
Days later when we came back into this House and appealed to the 
Speaker for justice to be served and these decisions at the human 
resources committee to be reversed, we were told that the 
committees were their own masters.
<P>
	I have another example. I sat on a small committee which was 
looking at the boundary changes in North Vancouver. There were 
only three members on that committee, two from the government 
side and myself from the Reform Party. There were about five 
clerks there, one to watch translation, one to watch what's going on 
and others whose jobs I do not know, five people and the three of 
us. We had to elect a chairman. One of the government members 
asked me if I minded if he nominated the other government 
member to be the chairman. I told him I knew how it worked 
around here  and he should do what he had to do. So he nominated 
the other Liberal member to be the chairman. Then they both look 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4424"> 4424 </A></B>
<P>
at me to second the nomination. Can you believe it? ``Not a 
chance'' I said, ``you can't expect me to do that, it is not 
democratic''. They looked at one another for a moment, looked at 
the clerk, and the clerk said that we could always change the rules, 
so they did. They changed the rule so they did not even need a 
seconder to elect the chairman.
<P>
	The whole committee system is a disgrace. I could go on for an 
hour giving examples. I see my time is up and I welcome questions 
and comments. I will just say that this needs changing badly.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, like my 
colleague from Laurier-Sainte-Marie who asked a question a few 
moments ago, I also agree that we can support some of the 
arguments put forward by the Reform Party. It is indeed difficult to 
work in committees where the majority of members are on the 
government side. Since the government exhibits a certain amount 
of ministerial solidarity within committees, it is difficult for us to 
win every time. It is part of the game of democracy.
<P>
	In this context, it can be very frustrating for the Reform Party, as 
well as for the official opposition, to have requests or proposals 
rejected sometimes.
<P>
	I would like the member to tell us what changes he thinks should 
be made to improve the committee system. Before knowing if we 
can support their position and if we can denounce the government's 
attitude on this issue, I would like to know what alternative the 
Reform Party is proposing for these committees. What democratic 
system would it like to see put in place in order to be able to 
achieve its aims, because I suspect that under all this lies a feeling 
of frustration with regard to proposals that were not supported by 
the majority in committee? What mechanism would Reform 
members suggest be put in place to ensure that other members who 
do not belong to their party would get the respect they deserve in 
committees?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
thank the member for his question about the operation of 
committees. There has been some discussion about the British 
parliamentary system. There is a lot of tradition involved in the 
operation of this place. That is absolutely true.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	However, all it takes is the political will to change these things 
which have been in place for a very long time. Most of these things 
were put in place to fit a time that has long gone, a time when the 
people were not well-educated and when communications were not 
very good.
<P>
	When Edmund Burke said: ``You don't do your constituents any 
favour by representing their will'', that was 200 years ago. Today 
we live in the information age. Our constituents are exceptionally 
well-informed. They know what is going on in the world. They can 
find out the minutest detail about what is going on in this place.
<P>
	I am sure all members have experienced from time to time 
constituents who know more about a particular bill and its possible 
problems or benefits than they do. There is a member over there 
from the islands who said that he never reads the bills. There are 
constituents out there who take a direct interest.
<P>
	The suggestion from Reform is that we can run on a general 
mandate of what we stand for but within that we must have 
flexibility to suit the information age and the flexibility to adapt 
that agenda to comply with the will of the people, the people who, 
after all, are paying our salaries. This means that when a committee 
goes travelling across the country taking submissions, it should 
truly take democratic submissions so that it is not a predetermined 
outcome and that it truly wants to know what Canadians want and 
is prepared to have the political will to adjust its agenda and get 
away from partisanship.
<P>
	It does not happen very often. If we look at the past three years in 
this place, I have had to vote three times contrary to my party 
mandate in order to represent my constituents' wishes on 
government bills. Therefore, it is not something that happens every 
day. It is on very carefully considered issues. I do not suffer any 
consequences from being able to do that.
<P>
	It is a new democracy. All it takes is the political will. I would 
urge members to get behind these changes so that we can get real 
democracy in this place.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I regret to have 
to say in this House that it seems to me that the Reform Party has 
chosen a topic for debate this morning that would have been more 
appropriate for a supply day.
<P>
	The hon. member from the Reform Party did not reply to the last 
question I asked him. I threw the ball into his court by asking him, 
through you, if he could tell us how he would like us to operate in 
committees. He did not answer the question.
<P>
	What is at the bottom of all this is the Reform Party's frustration 
at not occupying the position of official opposition in this 
Parliament, and at not being able to obtain the number of 
vice-chairs that it would like in committees. That is the real issue.
<P>
	Under the guise of a free vote, the Reform Party would have us 
believe that it allows its members to vote as they wish, that they do 
not have to toe the party line. I would like to hear from them what 
happened to Jan Brown, what happened to her? I am sorry, Mr. 
Speaker, I ought to have used the name of her riding.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4425"> 4425 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am sorry, but nobody can 
hear you right now because my microphone is on, not yours. Only 
one person may rise at a time. The member corrected himself, but 
I would like to remind the House that when speaking about our 
colleagues we must use the name of their riding or their 
department.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> As I could not be heard, I will correct myself now 
that my microphone is back on and say that I should have said the 
member for Calgary Southeast. I would like the members of the 
Reform Party to tell me what they did with the member for Calgary 
Southeast when she decided to vote freely, when she decided not to 
toe the party line, because she found it too radical, too extreme?
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	That MP was not allowed to remain in the party, she was 
expelled. Today, they are telling us, with a ``holier than thou'' air, 
that they advocate the free vote within their party. Granted, but on 
certain minor bills only. If, for instance, the Reform Party were to 
introduce a bill on the use of cow hair in mortar, I do think it could 
let its members vote freely on something like that, but on 
fundamental and vital questions which were part of a party's 
election platform, it is important for solidarity to be maintained, 
and that must extend to the committees as well.
<P>
	I also have doubts about how sincere the Reform Party members 
are, because we have seen them in action in committee. In the three 
years since we were elected, every time committee chairmen and 
vice-chairmen are selected, the Reformers opposed having a Bloc 
Quebecois member as head of the public accounts committee, for 
example, or as vice-chair of other committees-because, 
traditionally, a member of the party in power heads committees 
except that the public accounts committee is chaired a member of 
the official opposition.
<P>
	The Reform Party would have liked to be the official opposition, 
but unfortunately the voters decided to give them two seats less 
than the Bloc Quebecois. Terribly frustrated by this, the Reform 
Party decided to try to change the rules, to change tradition. True, 
this is not a Standing Order, but it has always been parliamentary 
tradition to have a member of the official opposition as the 
vice-chairman of a committee.
<P>
	The Reform Party ought to have put more effort into its election 
campaign so that more of its candidates could have been elected. 
Then it would have been recognized as the official opposition and 
would have had that privilege. With all their talk of democracy and 
British tradition, Reformers ought to know that democracy and 
British tradition recognize that the majority rules.
<P>
	As it happened, the Bloc Quebecois won more seats than they 
did, but they refuse to accept this, and that too is just another 
excuse, because the real reason they are making such a fuss about 
how vice-chairs, how Bloc representatives are chosen in 
committees, is not that Bloc members are involved but especially 
because Bloc members are sovereignists.
<P>
	We are sovereignists because that is what our platform is about. 
We presented our platform to the people of Quebec, who 
democratically elected to send us to Ottawa with a majority to 
represent them. The people of Quebec chose so wisely that, as a 
result, we became the official opposition. Quebecers owe 
themselves a vote of thanks now because they are well represented.
<P>
	Reform Party members would like to see this sovereignist 
position, this political option prevent us from having the 
democratic right to sit on committees. Because we are 
sovereignists, they would like to see Bloc members denied the right 
to be vice-chair of a committee.
<P>
	If we did not have that right, why would we have the right to 
have a member on the committee? If we have no members on the 
committee, where does that leave our democratic rights? Is this not 
about the most elementary respect for democracy?
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	The most elementary respect for democracy means accepting the 
decision made by voters in a riding, in a province, to send 
representatives to the House of Commons. That is the most 
elementary respect for democracy. Denying someone a 
vice-chairmanship because it is not convenient this time around is 
not a good reason. A person holds opinions we do not share, and as 
a result, we deny him the right to be vice-chair of a committee. If it 
were like that, we would not get very far in a democracy.
<P>
	We saw the attitude of the Reform Party in the committee that 
dealt with the Jacob case, for instance. Oddly enough, they showed 
a great deal of solidarity at the time. The Reform Party members on 
that committee did not seem to be allowed much latitude to express 
their views. They all had to think the same way, otherwise they 
were not allowed to sit on the committee. If one member did not 
work out, they would substitute another.
<P>
	And today the Reform Party tells us, with a ``holier than thou'' 
air, that it wants more democracy in committees. I agree that we are 
sometimes pushed around by the party in power which has a 
majority in all committees. I agree that the party in power, which 
has a majority and decides to exercise its solidarity, can beat us 
every time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> That is what the people want.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> That too was the result of a democratic decision. I 
wonder what the Reform Party would do if it were in office. I 
would be curious to see if its position would be: ``From now on, 
you are free to elect whomever you want to chair the committee, in 
spite of the fact that we have a majority''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4426"> 4426 </A></B>
<P>
	Angels act like that, not the Reform Party, in spite of its ``holier 
than thou'' air. If it came to power, the Reform Party would be 
the first to insist that rules of democracy that are to its advantage 
apply; it would want to use them and would fight anyone opposed 
to their use.
<P>
	I am sorry but the real subject matter of the debate today is the 
Reform Party's frustration at not being the official opposition, and 
that is how their remarks must be taken.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to offer a comment based on what I have heard here this 
morning on the rule of law. My colleague, the member for Fraser 
Valley East, was very specific about it. He said this Chamber 
operates under the concept that law is king. He said the Latin for 
that is lex Rex.
<P>
	He went on to describe what committees do, that this is not the 
rule of law. He said instead, committees seem to operate under the 
rule of politics, that the political system is Rex, is king. He did not 
know the Latin for politics is king.
<P>
	I have done a little research and I have this to offer to the House. 
I believe the Latin translation for that as it applies to the committee 
system is tyrannosaurus Rex, which comes from the dinosaur era.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I do not know if the hon. 
member for Joliette wishes to comment on his colleagues' remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> I do, Mr. Speaker. Such remarks are surprising, 
coming from the hon. member who just spoke, after his recent 
comments last spring and during the summer.
<P>
	The rule of law does not mean much to people like that. What 
matters is their owns views, extremist views. When the law gets in 
their way, they get around it. When the people in front of them do 
not share their views, they try to get rid of them. If their skin is not 
the right colour, out they go. If they do not have the right political 
ideology, the right views about where this country should be 
headed, out they go.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	We have been here for three years and both the official 
opposition and the governing party have been saying all along that 
the Reform Party is a party of extremists whose attitude is reflected 
not only in official statements to the press and in the excessive 
behaviour displayed by individual members but also in each and 
every committee of this House. They would have people excluded 
on the basis of their political opinions. That is discriminatory. That 
is extremist. It is like racial prejudice, like being against religion.
<P>
	Today, these people want to teach us a lesson in democracy. But 
they cannot even tell us how the committees should operate in 
order to be more responsive to public opinion.
<P>
	I suggest that they think this over and I am confident that this is 
the last time they make such a request because not enough of them 
will get elected in the next election to be in a position to demand 
anything, whether in committee or in the House of Commons.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time allocation of five 
minutes for questions or comments is brief. I want to accommodate 
as many participants as I can. I simply ask for the co-operation of 
the member for Calgary Centre. If he could he either make his 
comment or pose his question within the one minute period then I 
could give the same amount of time to the member for Joliette to 
respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member talked about tradition and what we suggested should be 
used in the standing committees.
<P>
	He referred to tradition. I would like to refer to the rules, and the 
rules are clear. We wish the standing committees would operate 
according to Standing Order 106(2):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Each standing or special committee shall elect a Chairman and two 
Vice-Chairmen, of whom two shall be Members of the government party and the 
third a Member in opposition to the government-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The wording does not preclude members of the third party in the 
House from filling these positions.
<P>
	Since 1958 the chairman of the Standing Committee on Public 
Accounts has been a member of the opposition, following British 
parliamentary tradition. Even Beauchesne's parliamentary rules 
and forms citation 781 states it is customary for the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts to be chaired by a member sitting 
in opposition to the government. That does not preclude any 
opposition party. It does not refer to the official opposition, the 
tradition he refers to.
<P>
	Procedurally no party member is precluded from assuming the 
position of the chair in any committee. A precedent was set during 
the third session of the 35th Parliament when members of the NDP, 
the third party-the third party in the House like us-served as 
vice-chairs to standing committees and subcommittees and chaired 
legislative committees.
<P>
	This party is recommending a push for real openness and real 
free votes for chairs and vice-chairs, not the set up that the 
government perpetrates on each of the standing committees. That is 
what we are recommending. Allow the members to be masters of 
their own destinies and vote for their own chairs and vice-chairs.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Calgary Centre is 
absolutely right. True, this is what the law says but it is also true 
that we are often guided by the traditions and practices in our 
parliamentary system.
<P>
	But if we look only at the legislation, the Bloc Quebecois 
proposed candidates for the position of vice-chair in the various 
committees and managed to convince the government 
representative to vote for them. All this proves is that we had the 
same right as Reform members. We exercised this right and, since 
we are better than they are, we managed to convince the 
government to vote for our candidates. That is why some of our 
members are now committee vice-chairs, and this was done 
democratically.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the most extraordinary thing about parliamentary life is 
how one always has to expect the unexpected. Last night, when I 
went to bed, I certainly did not think that, this morning, I would be 
debating a report tabled by the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs.
<P>
	In 1993, during the election campaign, four major parties were 
trying to win the support of Canadians. There was the Liberal Party, 
which claimed to be in the best position to manage the affairs of the 
country. There was the Conservative Party, which, of course, made 
the same claim. There was the Reform Party, which wanted to 
change Canada and knew how to do it. And then there was another 
group, made up of separatists, sovereignists, who said: ``We want 
to go to Ottawa to protect the interests of Quebecers''.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	On October 25 of that year, the Liberal Party formed the new 
government, with a strong majority and, of course, the 
responsibility that goes with it. When you have a strong majority, 
you ultimately have the power to do what you want. This comes 
with a price though, and I think that, when the time comes, voters 
will make the government pay that price.
<P>
	The Reform Party got 52 candidates elected, not bad for a new 
party. Unfortunately, the Bloc got 54 candidates elected in Quebec. 
In other words, we became the official opposition by a narrow 
margin. It was a narrow margin indeed-only two members-but 
we got it nonetheless.
<P>
	The value of parliamentary government and the respect in which 
society holds it derive entirely from its rules and tradition. 
Accordingly, we became the official opposition. This did not thrill 
the members of the Reform Party, and I can understand that.
<P>
	What I have more trouble understanding is that after three years, 
they have been unable to sort out common sense, logic and, finally, 
their responsibility as a party in this House to ensure that the 
House's time is used intelligently. They wanted to reform Canada. 
When their members are capable of taking up the time of this 
House for matters which are very interesting but somewhat 
dubious, we have to wonder what is going on.
<P>
	What does the time of the House mean? It means 295 members 
who are here to defend their constituents' interests, it means staff 
who work with these members, it means the House's support staff. 
When the House's time is wasted, tens of thousands of dollars are 
being thrown out the window.
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. member for Joliette, mentioned the Jacob 
affair. Everyone remembers the Jacob affair, I should think. In any 
future discussion of the 35th Parliament, it is one issue that will 
stand out. We listened to the Reform Party, we appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, much work 
was done and the final conclusion was that there was not really any 
basis for the charge.
<P>
	As for what we are hearing this morning, and with any luck the 
debate will be over at 1.55 p.m., there is not really any basis for it. I 
can understand that it is frustrating for the Reform Party to see 
members of the official opposition holding the position of 
vice-chair on each of the committees for three years, but that is one 
of the responsibilities of the official opposition. The governing 
party has understood that, and finds it perfectly reasonable to vote 
for the candidates the Bloc Quebecois submits to committees.
<P>
	There are certain actions that go along with the recognition of 
responsibility. I feel that the governing party can live with us as the 
opposition, and I am totally in agreement with that. I have no 
problem with that.
<P>
	It is quite another thing, however, to say that it is easy to work in 
committee. It is not. Sometimes one has good ideas, is convinced 
they are excellent ideas and can make a valuable contribution to the 
government's bills, but sometimes, unfortunately, our valuable 
contributions end up in the waste basket. That is the government's 
choice and the choice of the majority in committee.
<P>
	What we have to demonstrate is that our arguments, our 
contributions, are important and have real potential for improving 
the lives of our fellow citizens. When we work in committee and 
try to convince our counterparts on the government side that this or 
that amendment is important and should be passed by the 
committee, and subsequently by the House, we are doing our jobs.
<P>
	We may regret that we are not always successful in doing so, but 
I do not think it is productive to take up three hours of debate to say 
that one is not in agreement with the report tabled by the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs and that really, 
everything ought to be done according to a free vote.
<P>
	When we ask ordinary people, the people who constantly switch 
channels on their tv and end up getting bits and pieces here and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4428"> 4428 </A></B>
<P>
there, who sit around discussing this and that, what they think 
about politicians, their answers are not always very reassuring.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	It hurts to hear this, when we have the impression we work hard 
and are doing our best. However, if they are watching us today, and 
I imagine some of them are, they will inevitably start wondering 
and say: ``What on earth is going on? Let them go to work in 
committee, instead of wasting their time''. They may have a point 
there.
<P>
	However, I wish the voters watching us this morning would 
remember one thing, and that is that the parliamentary system 
works according to certain rules, which means there is a price to 
pay when we have a majority government and there is also a price 
to pay when a party is the official opposition thanks to a single 
member.
<P>
	I would therefore urge them to elect a sizable official opposition 
in the next election, which will probably be held within a year. I am 
convinced the official opposition will come from Quebec, because 
to me it is clear that as far as the rest of Canada is concerned, the 
Reform Party is not up to forming an official opposition with a 
sense of responsibility and capable of acting accordingly.
<P>
	Amazing, Mr. Speaker. You are signalling that I have one minute 
left, so I will do you a favour: I would rather not take it. I am sure 
my Reform Party friends have plenty of questions to ask and 
perhaps members opposite as well, you never know, so thank you, 
and I will wait for their questions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it very interesting that the member for 
Laval Centre is the only one I know who has brought up the Jacob 
decision or transaction in the committee. She is the one who 
brought it forth, not the members of the Reform Party.
<P>
	We were not questioning the decision of that committee here in 
this discussion. I find it absurd that members of the Bloc party can 
question our concern about committees. If members of the Bloc 
party really think that being the official opposition is the be all and 
end all, then maybe they should have the courage to put candidates 
in all of the ridings across this country and see whether they have 
the support of the Canadian people for the kind of issues and 
positions that they take. They know that they represent one 
province in this country. If anybody is extreme, it is the Bloc 
Quebecois members who are talking about leaving this country and 
breaking this country apart. If they do not call that extreme, I do not 
know what is.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member if the Bloc Quebecois has the 
courage to put candidates in the other provinces other than Quebec 
in the next election.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I was negligent in not raising 
the issue earlier when it occurred the first time. I believe in the 
affair we are referring to we are referring to one of our colleagues. I 
would simply ask the co-operation of the House in reference to that 
particular issue that we would refer to the member for 
Charlesbourg.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, your point is well taken.
<P>
	I want to inform the hon. member that whether something is 
extreme depends how you look at it. Yes, I referred to the case of 
the hon. member for Charlesbourg. I made that reference to use an 
example everyone would be familiar with. You know, when you 
teach a class, the best example is one that is crystal clear. For 
everyone in Quebec and the rest of Canada, the case of the hon. 
member for Charlesbourg is an example that is self-explanatory, 
and a case that took quite some time. The hon. member may think it 
extreme of me to bring this matter up, but I do not think that just 
because this case was closed by the House, we were bound never to 
discuss it again.
<P>
	Fielding candidates in all Canadian ridings is an interesting 
point, but the hon. member should remember that we are here to 
defend the interests of Quebecers and to stand up and say what is 
wrong with this system, because there is something wrong with it. I 
see the hon. member is smiling. I am sure this means he agrees with 
me. There is something wrong with the system, and we believe it is 
not only our right but our responsibility to say what is wrong on 
behalf of the rest of Canada, when we wear our official opposition 
uniform, which we do quite elegantly.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the dialogue. With regard to the investigation of the 
member for Charlesbourg, the member has basically stated that it 
was a waste of time. What she is saying in fact is that the House 
made a decision of its members to do something and that this entire 
House therefore was the cause of wasting its own time.
<P>
	The member may want to reconsider whether or not the integrity 
of the House is being brought into question, because it was our 
decision and not a committee decision to undertake that 
investigation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral: </B>Mr. Speaker, I will give one response 
to that comment: in its highly democratic spirit, of course, the 
House agreed to have a committee examine the case of the hon. 
member for Charlesbourg.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4429"> 4429 </A></B>
<P>
	What I mean is, if the Reform Party had not introduced a 
motion, as far as I know, I do not think the House would have 
had to use such precious time to come to the conclusion, following 
the tabling of the procedure committee report and our minority 
report, that, ultimately, there was nothing to make a fuss about.
<P>
	It must be recognized that we sometimes waste our time. It is not 
because a decision was made that, a posteriori, we cannot say that, 
in fact, there was nothing to fret about. So, our time was wasted 
somewhere.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have been listening to the debate this morning. I have also been, 
with some interest, involved in the matter that led up to this debate 
coming before us today.
<P>
	As a new member of this House, I too have found it to be a 
learning curve challenge to deal with some of the issues of the 
standing orders, the rules, the decorum and the general principles 
of governing ourselves as members of this House and as members 
of the other house.
<P>
	Frankly, I think that on balance, one of my frustrations when I 
listen to some of my colleagues from the Reform Party is based on 
the fact that they-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I hesitate to interrupt 
the proceedings and particularly the parliamentary secretary, but I 
have been apprised by our table officers that there is a technicality 
here that I think we should clear up.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary in tabling the motion earlier is 
deemed to have spoken. Therefore, just to assure myself that we are 
following the correct parliamentary procedures here, I will have to 
ask the House for consent to permit the parliamentary secretary to 
continue his intervention. Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a good example where a rule has 
come up and we learn by our inexperience.
<P>
	The point is that we need to look at what the government said 
when it was the Liberal Party of Canada in the 1993 federal 
campaign.
<P>
	In that campaign there were a number of commitments which 
dealt with parliamentary reform. They included the commitment 
that would give members of Parliament a greater role in drafting 
legislation through House of Commons committees. That was a 
commitment we made. We made a commitment that would permit 
a parliamentary review of order in council appointments.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	It was a commitment we made as a Liberal Party. We stood 
before the people of Canada and said that was a principle. We all 
felt in the run up to the 1993 election  that the respect the people of 
Canada had for members of Parliament was low. Now that we are at 
our places in the House we all have a responsibility to try to 
enhance and improve the respect and the integrity of the system.
<P>
	We also talked about more free votes in the House of Commons 
in the lead up to the campaign. We talked about the fact that 
members of Parliament should be involved in the prebudget 
consultation process.
<P>
	Frankly, whether or not the Reform Party members have 
accepted this, we won the election. Therefore, our platform is the 
one which will be adopted and imposed. Despite their opposition, I 
am somewhat sympathetic to certain remarks that were made by 
the whip for the Bloc Quebecois this morning. All parties have to 
work together at committees to produce and enhance the work of 
the government as it is presented.
<P>
	As I was thinking about what I wanted to say this morning, I was 
really struck by the very first line in Beauchesne. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The principles of Canadian parliamentary law are: to protect a minority and 
restrain the improvidence or tyranny of a majority; to secure the transaction of public 
business in an orderly manner; to enable every Member to express opinions within 
limits necessary to preserve decorum-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We must have certain limits and certain rules. Just because the 
Reform Party members do not like the rules, they want to change 
the rules.
<P>
	The rules have become part of the Canadian tradition which 
adopts the principles of the British House of Commons, the 
principles that all members have respected. Notwithstanding those 
principles or precedents, the Liberal Party of Canada came forward 
with a series of changes and said that there were certain flexibilities 
it would like to build into a new approach to Parliament. We ran on 
them and we got elected on those and we implemented them.
<P>
	On February 7, 1994 our government House leader brought 
forward a substantial motion that detailed changes to basic House 
rules. He stood in his place and said that there should be a motion 
to change the rules. He talked about the fact that he wanted to 
implement a number of commitments that our party made in the 
election campaign and in the speech from the throne. That is how it 
works. He talked about a revitalization of Parliament.
<P>
	Not everything the Reform Party has said is wrong. Not 
everything the Liberal Party, the Bloc or other Canadians have said 
is wrong, but we have a set of principles of British parliamentary 
tradition that we have had for hundreds of years. When we look at 
how Canadians have reflected on this Parliament and the previous 
Parliament during the mandate of this government since 1993, it 
speaks volumes about how Canadians have reflected on us as 
members of Parliament. I do not say that in a partisan way. I talk  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4430"> 4430 </A></B>
<P>
about it as the hard, good work that has occurred on committees 
such as the industry committee, government operations committee 
and the lobbyist committee.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	As a new member of Parliament I have been given the 
opportunity and the honour to have served shoulder to shoulder 
with members from the Reform Party and the Bloc where we work 
together in procedure and House affairs to resolve difficult and 
complex issues when legislation comes after first reading to our 
committee as it did with the lobbyist bill.
<P>
	We were given a rare new Canadian opportunity, an opportunity 
that lived up to the commitment that we made as a government and 
as a party. We said that members of Parliament should be given 
more flexibility and so we effectively drafted new legislation.
<P>
	We had a minister come before our committee who said: ``Here 
is my bill, my opportunity to present my best chance to give you 
how I believe a policy should be implemented on lobbying''. The 
committee took this very seriously and worked very hard with 
members of the Reform Party, the Bloc and with our own members. 
We had members of the Liberal Party agreeing with the Bloc. We 
had members of the Liberal Party agreeing the Reform. At the end 
of the day we had a very good quality result. The result was a better 
piece of legislation.
<P>
	We brought the minister back and he said: ``I think you have 
gone a little further than I might have gone but if that was the 
consensus I am prepared to accept it''. I use that as an example of 
the credibility of members of Parliament. Frankly, our credibility is 
at stake every day because all members of Parliament at the end of 
the day have to work together. They do not have to agree on 
everything from hair style, suits or opinions but we respect each 
other's opinions.
<P>
	One of the frustrations that I find with what Reform members 
have suggested in certain comments today is how committees have 
manipulated democracy. Frankly, what I worry about is in whose 
view of democracy have they manipulated? Is it their view? Is it the 
people's view? Which people of Canada's democracy have we 
talked about?
<P>
	The issue is not that the government has failed to live up to its 
commitments. The real issue is the Reform Party has failed to 
understand that it did not win the last election. Many of my 
colleagues know I have tried throughout my career in Parliament to 
be a non-partisan chairman at industry, at government operations, 
at lobbyists and procedure and House affairs. At the peril of my 
own party I have tried to be a non-partisan chair of a committee.
<P>
	I find it most irritating when I see members opposite, 
particularly in the Reform Party, trying to portray the government 
as manipulating democracy because their characterization of that is 
a perversion of democracy. Their characterization is manipulating 
the true realities of how this place works. Many Canadians do not 
get an opportunity to get the flavour of what goes on in this place.
<P>
	Frankly, perhaps rather than televising this place we could have 
more television at our committee rooms when a lot of the real work 
of what goes on at committees is what is going at this place for the 
work of the men and women who work shoulder to shoulder 
regardless of political persuasion.
<P>
	Because there is a particular agenda in one particular party 
which represents only a very small part of that overall agenda, I 
find it irritating disruptive-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Rubbish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member calls it rubbish. It is 
important to look at what our party has done, at what we have 
accomplished, at what we have done and what we said we were 
going to do and at what Canadians feel about members of 
Parliament today.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	I feel better about being able to say to people when I get into a 
taxi, when I am in a restaurant or when I am on the street in a 
market that I am a member of Parliament than I might have 
characterized being a member of Parliament 10 years ago.
<P>
	Elections are something that we have for 45 days every four or 
five years. I would urge those members of the Reform Party who 
have not bothered to read the newspaper to realize that they lost the 
last election to look at some of the polls about how Canadians feel 
about Parliament, that we are doing a better job. It is not as 
Liberals, although the Liberal Party is doing quite well. I am very 
proud of that record but those members should reflect on how 
Canadians view Parliament, how Canadians have viewed the 
committees that are working, the role of the member of Parliament.
<P>
	I am very proud of the committees that I have worked on. I am 
proud of the work of the members of the Reform Party and the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois. They have contributed. We have 
become friends, colleagues and compatriots. We have become part 
of a process of changing this place and making it better. We have 
become part of making the British parliamentary tradition that we 
have so carefully preserved at this place more flexible, more 
current.
<P>
	As the member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley said, it 
needs to be something not spoken by Sir Edmund Burke 200 years 
ago. It has to be more modern. We have a more modern democracy 
and a more modern federation.
<P>
	While I disagree with certain views of the Reform Party or 
certain views of the Bloc, we have become a better federation. I do 
not think it is fair to characterize the new government initiatives 
that were brought about  as commitments in the red book to give 
members of Parliament more flexibility, more involvement with 
drafting legislation, and have them whitewashed as a manipulation 
of democracy. That is wrong. It is disruptive. That is intellectually 
dishonest.
<P>

<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is rubbish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> There is a good example where a member walks into 
the Chamber, barks out ``rubbish'' and then wants to participate in 
the debate.
<P>
	If Canadians want to look at what is really going on, perhaps 
they want to re-examine what is going on with certain members of 
the Reform Party. Frankly, it makes me very worried about 
democracy when I look at some of the extremist views that come 
out of certain elements in the Reform Party.
<P>
	I respect the member's right. I would ask you respect our right 
to-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I have been here since the 
beginning of the debate. There are strongly held views about this 
issue. Please allow the Chamber to do its work in the usual 
parliamentary fashion. We will get through this debate and all the 
others.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will conclude with what Reform Party 
members said when our government leader spoke about the 
reforms and brought forward the reforms, the enlightened changes 
in my view, to the House.
<P>
	The House leader for the Reform Party, whom I would consider a 
colleague and a friend, said the following. I respect what he says. 
The members of the Reform Party should listen carefully to these 
words and take heed of them: ``Mr. Speaker, today is a very great 
day and one we should mark high on the marquee as being very 
important for the House, for Parliament and for the people of 
Canada. First I want to thank the government''. He spoke those 
words in reply to the government House leader. He spoke those 
words in response to the changes, the initiatives we brought 
forward, to the initiatives we campaigned on, to the initiatives we 
have implemented.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Be specific.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> If you had been listening to the debate you would 
know what the specifics were.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I know that shortly we will 
get to questions and comments. I urge you to please make your 
interventions through the chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe MPs have been given a greater 
role. I believe MPs have been permitted to have Parliament review 
legislation. I believe we have been given more free votes. I believe 
we have been more effective in becoming involved in the 
consultation process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
sort of enjoyed that presentation. It was a lot of good political 
rhetoric, not as good as the government whip who I still think 
trumps this particular member because he gets the political rhetoric 
up to a different level. I did not believe most of it, but still it was 
relatively good rhetoric.
<P>
	The question I have is two-fold. This was asked of the 
government whip, and I will ask the deputy House leader. The 
committees are supposed to be independent and above board, 
masters of their own destiny. I asked the government whip if he 
instructs the members of the committee as to who should be the 
chairman and vice-chairman. The government whip would not 
answer. So I ask him the same. Who in the hierarchy in the Liberal 
party instructs who should be chairs of these committees?
<P>
	Second, on the greater issue of fulfilling red book promises, one 
of the promises for parliamentary reform is that the position of 
deputy chair should go to one of the opposition parties. That was 
the position in the red book, written by the hon. member for 
Kingston and the Islands. That has not come to pass, even by the 
furthest stretch of the Liberal imagination. I wonder why that did 
not happen if it was a red book promise? What about these 
committees? Who chooses the chairman?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is certainly not a new complaint 
coming from the whip of the Reform party or from the previous 
whip of the Reform party, or the previous whip of the Reform party, 
or the previous acting whip of the Reform party. I get a little 
amused-the old expression that people in glass houses should not 
throw stones.
<P>
	What I find curious is why members of the Reform party would 
want to have information about how the Liberal caucus operates? 
The committee operation is open. The Liberal party continues to be 
the most open party on Parliament Hill. We have democratic 
elections. We have democratic open contests. There is no fettering 
of that. There is no interference with that. We have a caucus 
system.
<P>
	I make no illusions about the fact that I got elected as a member 
of a political party. We campaigned on it. We produced our 
information in black and white and we were elected on it. What I 
find a little curious is that we made commitments, got elected and 
delivered on those commitments. What part would the hon. 
member say we did not deliver on? Have we given a greater role to 
drafting legislation? How many pieces of legislation have gone to 
committee after first reading? How many parliamentary reviews 
have there been of order in council appointments by this 
Parliament? How many more free votes have there been in this 
Parliament than the previous Parliament?

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I recognize the hon. 
member for Chambly I should explain to the House that when we 
began the debate on the motion, the first time around each of the 
parties, the government, the Reform and the Bloc spoke. We are 
now reverting to the customary order for speakers and I will now 
go to the official opposition to see if someone wants to speak and 
then I will revert back to the government to see if there is a 
spokesperson and of course subsequently to the Reform Party.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy 
to stand up before you in this House to make a few comments on 
the attitude of the Reform Party today.
<P>
	I am a member of this Parliament. With a senator I co-chair the 
Standing Joint Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations. As the hon. 
member who just spoke pointed out, it is in the committees that the 
real political work gets done. It is there that members can have an 
impact on the legislative process, often without regard to how 
parties are represented on the committee.
<P>
	This morning, for example, I attended a meeting of the industry 
committee at which another member like myself asked pertinent 
questions and tried to influence the position of the Liberal majority 
on the committee. Judging from the reaction of the other members 
and of the Liberal majority, I now believe that his proposals may be 
approved. That is the ultimate reason why members sit on any 
committee.
<P>
	It is the same for the regulations committee, where a Reform 
member often asks relevant questions and contributes ideas the 
committee needs, because they often-not always, but 
often-reflect common sense and a real search for solutions.
<P>
	For example, I must point out to the Reform Party, the third 
party, that since the real political work is done in committee, it is 
normal for those who appoint the committee executive to choose 
people who tend to share their views.
<P>
	That is probably why, in many respects, the Liberal Party is in 
perfect harmony with Bloc members, and that is probably why 
Liberal members on a committee will often vote for a Bloc member 
as vice-chair. In fact, other than on sovereignty issue, if you look at 
the record of the debates and votes held in this place, you can see 
that the Bloc Quebecois has often adopted or already shared the 
Liberal position. That is politics.
<P>
	By contrast, and I must remind Reform members of this. They 
often come here to defend the oppressor rather than the oppressed, 
and I can elaborate on this.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	They often remind me of this joke a member told me a while 
ago. Two young men are trying to steal a purse from an old lady on 
the street, but she puts up quite a fight. He said-that is how the 
joke goes: ``I stepped in and the three of us had no problem 
snatching the purse from her.'' What the Reform Party is doing in 
this place is similar.
<P>
	Take for example the banking legislation, the Interest Act 
introduced in this place. That year, banks had made between $3.2 
and $3.4 billion in net profit after taking advantage of every 
allowance for bad debts permitted under the law. The Reform 
Party-I had not travelled as extensively in Canada at the time as I 
have since-objected to telling the banks that their profits were 
excessive and that they should loosen their stranglehold on 
consumers.
<P>
	The Reform Party voted unanimously against it. I figured that 
everyone in western Canada were either bankers or very wealthy, 
with close ties to banks. They could not be consumers or debtors; 
they had to be creditors.
<P>
	I have travelled through there a few times since. Along the road, 
I have seen houses no more sumptuous or larger that those in rural 
Quebec. I noticed big equipment, probably mortgaged or financed, 
in some people's back yards. They could have used the kind of 
assistance provided for in this famous piece of legislation.
<P>
	No Reform member rose on party lines to say that the banks 
were doing a little too well. Reform members all voted against the 
bill presented by the hon. member for Portneuf calling for the 
employees working in a company just before it went bankrupt to be 
given priority when assets were distributed, even ahead of the 
banks. Unanimously, Reform members voted against. They are not 
right of centre, but extreme right wing, which is unfortunate.
<P>
	They would like the majority to submit, to shut up, and to let 
them have the whole playing field. They think they could go ahead 
with hare-brained ideas like reinstating the death penalty. 
Apparently, they even sent someone to the eastern bloc countries to 
learn how to give a good beating, how to flog people. They are 
pretty good at whipping themselves. They discovered something 
good, something equitable and fair: how to whip others.
<P>
	Will we put up with such attitudes in committee? When the 
message does not suit Reform members, they go after the 
messenger. They kill the messenger. It is simpler to eliminate him, 
and thus silence any opposition.
<P>
	I heard Reform members, puritans no doubt, saying that God did 
not make all men equal. He created the rich and the poor. It is not 
up to a man, a legislator, or society to restore a just balance. God 
created such a world, and we must respect His will. The poor have 
no choice but to die, or to starve. This is Reform's basic 
philosophy. The rich can become richer. God wanted them rich. 
This is the other side of Reform's basic philosophy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4433"> 4433 </A></B>
<P>
	Fortunately, in committee, and I acknowledge it, their views are 
somewhat less rigid. They know they are in a minority position 
and cannot impose such a philosophy, and this is what frustrates 
them.
<P>
	Now, put yourself on the side of the majority. Will the majority 
let reformers run the show in committees and try to sell all sorts of 
preposterous ideas, all this is in the context of a political agenda so 
convoluted that is hard to follow?
<P>
	In this particular case, I can understand that Liberal members 
would vote in favour of Bloc Quebecois members who, since the 
beginning, and in spite of having had just about every possible 
insult hurled at them, have been able to stay on course and follow 
their ideal and their philosophy, which is to show compassion for 
the poor and to have an understanding of the political situation in 
Canada, and in Quebec in particular.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	All these factors come into play and influence the outcome of an 
election to a committee.
<P>
	I want to reassure reformers right now by telling them that the 
redistribution of the electoral map for the next election will greatly 
favour them. There will be several new seats in western Canada, 
including British Columbia and from Ontario on. This will be a 
golden opportunity for them to become the official opposition, as 
they so strongly wish. Are we to interpret their attitude this 
morning as a sign that they have come to the conclusion, as the 
party whip said, that they might be wiped off Canada's political 
map in the next election? They may have come to this conclusion 
but, of course, they will not all tell us.
<P>
	All this to say that we cannot, in the committees, grant executive 
representation to a minority party. It cannot be done.
<P>
	Since I only have a minute left, I will to reply to the member for 
Vancouver, who quoted a latin maxim of his own. Let me tell him 
one which I hope he will understand. It is not from me. It says: Vox 
populi, vox Dei. When the majority speaks it is the very basis of 
democracy and we must respect that. We must not start interpreting 
democracy. When democracy has spoken, we must respect it.
<P>
	In response to what the member proposes, I will simply say that 
the nicest bird song is not always and necessarily the longest one. I 
say no to what he is proposing this morning.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
been sitting here right from the beginning of this debate, and I have 
to admit I have not been able to understand what Reform members 
are driving at. What do they want?
<P>
	None of them has been able to describe the kind of democracy 
they would like to see here.
<P>
	But I did understand one thing. Reform members are unable to 
adjust to the system. Whether we work here, in the Canadian 
Parliament, in a workers' union, in a school, or a hospital, there is 
always a system that cannot be ignored. It is needed if we are to 
avoid constant strife and futile discussions, to avoid having to do 
without an established order. Under such conditions, it is extremely 
difficult to reach a consensus.
<P>
	It is a well known fact that Reform members have a hard time 
agreeing among themselves. Just imagine the problem they have 
living within the system as it now stands.
<P>
	To make things change, one must work from within the system. 
That is the way to improve it.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	I have to admit that I sometimes have a hard time accepting what 
goes on in committee. I sat on the public accounts committee, 
which is chaired by the official opposition. The chairman did an 
outstanding job, I have to say. He did not try to give preference to 
the official opposition during the proceedings. Instead, he tried to 
stick to existing criteria.
<P>
	Since the chairman of the public accounts committee was a 
member of our party, I would obviously have liked to have 
preferential treatment and to get a little more time during the 
proceedings. But we followed the rules on allocation of time in 
committee.
<P>
	There is room for improvement in the committees, and some 
procedures could also be improved. However, did Reform 
members make any constructive suggestions in that regard? In any 
case, in the committees I sit on, and especially in the government 
operations committee, I never saw nor heard any Reform member 
try to improve our operations. This is not to say that everything is 
perfect, far from it, but within the committee everyone is allowed 
to express one's view.
<P>
	Problems can arise when the time comes to table in the House a 
report on a committee; there too there might be room for greater 
information and above all improvement.
<P>
	All committee members should be able to talk to each other, to 
have certain discussions, instead of constantly complaining that 
nothing works. This is how to improve things.
<P>
	As we know, the Reform Party wanted to change Canada. Let us 
look at what it has been doing for the last three years. In my 
opinion, it has not succeeded in changing much, except, as I heard 
the hon. member for Vancouver North say this morning, for turning 
the House into a spectacle, into a farce.
<P>
	I do not have to go back very far. Since the House resumed its 
work this week, what has happened here? We got to hear the same 
old stories, stories that took up a lot of the time of the House, that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4434"> 4434 </A></B>
<P>
kept members away from dealing with the real problems Canadians 
have. They used anything and everything to make a spectacle of 
this House.
<P>
	We avoided true debate on job creation. We avoided talking 
about family trusts. Those are the issues people want to hear about. 
I find this morning's debate pointless. Why is this issue being 
raised again? Why challenge the Bloc Québécois' legitimacy as the 
official opposition and refuse to go by the rules of the Canadian 
parliamentary system? The voice of democracy has been heard.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	It is as a result of a democratic process, namely the last election, 
that the Bloc Quebecois, which has been mandated to protect the 
interests of all Quebecers in this House and has, until now, fulfilled 
its mandate in an honourable and dignified manner, became the 
official opposition. Why is its legitimacy always put in question by 
the same people, the same political party?
<P>
	I can understand that there is some frustration, but at one point 
they have to get over that kind of frustration. They have to roll up 
their sleeves and get to work. I think that is still beyond the Reform 
Party. Why lose time on a pointless debate on procedure, that 
means nothing to Canadians, that will not change the way things 
are done and that will bring no improvements whatsoever, when we 
have so much to do?
<P>
	Of course, they will blame it all on the separatists. But that is not 
the case. In committee, we have constantly made suggestions to the 
government, ever since it was elected in 1993, and we will continue 
to do so. We want to represent with dignity the people who elected 
us, my constituents and each and every Quebecer. That is how 
things should be done. If something needs to be corrected, we 
should go through the existing channels, make suggestions, hold 
discussions and things will improve.
<P>
	Let me conclude by asking the following question: What have 
the members of the Reform Party done to improve the system? In 
my view, not a thing. I agree with my party's whip. So, ``until the 
next time''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to make a comment and also ask a question of the hon. 
member.
<P>
	The hon. member talks about democracy, structures, a waste of 
time and these kinds of things. In debate previous to this, reference 
was made to the same thing. I suggest to the member that 
Parliament has roles. I agree that we are elected and we come. The 
bulk of the members form the government and subsequently down 
the opposition.
<P>
	I suggest very strongly that the role of the opposition is to 
critique. The third party is doing that. We do not see that coming 
from the official opposition. Someone has to  do that regardless of 
what his or her mandate is. We also have to address the mandate of 
the House. That is in the traditional structure of this place.
<P>
	He also mentioned that we have structures by which we function. 
I suggest that structures are human made and they can be changed. 
It is not necessary to continue to use something forevermore amen 
because it happens to be a structure that is in place. It is the role of 
the opposition to critique that structure and make it function as well 
as possible in today's environment.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member if he feels that it is not a democratic 
principle to critique these things and bring to them a modern day 
concept of what is happening. The rest of Canada's citizens are 
asking us to do that and not just say it is a waste of time.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague 
for her question. I will answer this: When we want to change 
things, when we want to improve things, we have to work within 
the system, to discuss, to negotiate.
<P>
	During this Parliament, committees operate in a way they never 
did before. So there is room for improvement and there is still time 
to act.
<P>
	Now, as far as the Bloc Quebecois' role as official opposition is 
concerned, I must say that it plays that role fully, on top of its 
mandate, which is to defend the interests of Quebecers. Whenever 
the interests of Quebecers are at stake, we have solutions to 
suggest, we question the government, whatever the subject, 
whether it concerns what happened in Somalia, what is happening 
on the job creation front, what is going on with respect to family 
trusts or what is going on in the different committees.
<P>
	In the committees, there are certain stands with which the Bloc 
Quebecois disagrees. On such occasions, we criticize and play our 
role as official opposition fully.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate. Some 
members who have arrived recently may be wondering exactly 
what is going on in the House.
<P>
	We are debating a motion which has to do with a report tabled by 
one of the House committees. Pursuant to the rules of this place, 
after the adjournment for the summer all committees have to be 
reconstituted. We need to have chairs, vice-chairs and the 
membership of all committees reassessed and reaffirmed by each 
of the parties. That report has come before this place for adoption.
<P>
	Normally what would happen is that the report would be tabled 
during Routine Proceedings and a motion to accept that report 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4435"> 4435 </A></B>
<P>
would be put. Then, by unanimous consent of the House, the report 
would be adopted and committees could proceed with their work.
<P>
	That is not what is happening now. The motion to concur in the 
report of this committee and to accept the structure of the 
membership of the various committees of the House of Commons 
is being debated. It is being debated not because the government 
wanted to debate the work of that committee but because the 
Reform Party decided it wanted to take up some time of this place 
to talk about its wish list and to do a little whining.
<P>
	Reformers want to talk about how awful it is that they did not 
form a government after the last election. They want to talk about 
how awful it is that they are not in charge of this place. One of the 
previous speakers made the point that they just do not understand 
democracy. So we are here and will be having this debate for four 
hours.
<P>
	The point of the Reform motion is that there is a lot of wasted 
time here. Right now 295 members of Parliament are hung up, 
unable to do any work whatsoever in this place for four hours. 
Committees cannot even hold meetings because they are not 
officially constituted. They are waiting for this motion to be 
passed.
<P>
	The hypocritical arguments of the Reform Party to this point are 
blatantly evident. The Reform Party does not even think it is 
important enough to participate in debate or to follow the debate.
<P>
	Although this is a waste of time we have to go through it. Yet the 
issue here should not be a partisan debate on whether the Reform 
Party's views or the government's views or the views of any other 
party in this place are okay.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, if you had been here last night you would have 
heard the very interesting speech of the member for 
Gander-Grand Falls which reflected what should be happening in 
this place.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	We were here until after 11 p.m. last night dealing with House 
business. A number of members were doing other work, making 
calls and getting ready for a vote that was to be taken, but when the 
member for Gander-Grand Falls rose in his place to give a brief 
intervention, people stopped and listened. Not only did they stop 
and listen out in the lobbies, they came into the Chamber and they 
took their places because they wanted to hear what was being said 
and they wanted to participate in the event.
<P>
	The event was a barn burner of a speech. People were listening. 
People watching television I know were listening because here was 
a long time member of Parliament who is not a member of the 
cabinet, who is not a parliamentary secretary, who is not I do 
believe a chairman of any committee, but he is one of the most 
eloquent debaters in this entire House. People listen to what he has 
to say.
<P>
	The point is, he is a member who is a model for all members. He 
is a member who is working as hard as he can to do one thing: to 
improve the image of people in political life, to improve the image 
of members of Parliament not only in this place but at home in their 
communities and as they travel across this country. Probably the 
most important work of any member of Parliament is to make their 
contribution in whatever way they are capable of, to improve the 
productivity, the image and credibility of this place like the 
member for Gander-Grand Falls does.
<P>
	One of the important issues that has to be accepted in this place 
is that a majority government was elected in the last election. In 
some respects that is a curse to a government. A government that 
has a majority has complete control of the House. Democracy 
makes it so with the majority of the members in the House, 
provided they maintain solidarity among that team. They all ran for 
a party, they all ran for a platform and they are here to deliver on 
their promises. As long as that government is true to itself and true 
to its platform to the best of its ability and within its control, then it 
has the control of this place. It has the control to the extent that 
when issues come up and votes are taken, the government with a 
majority will win the vote. It is a quirk of democracy in that a 
majority government is fully in control of the aspects of this House.
<P>
	That is a very frustrating position to be in, not only from the 
opposition party standpoint, but also for backbench members of 
Parliament who are one of a very large number of members of a 
caucus. It is very difficult for all members in this place to fully 
participate to the extent that opposition members do.
<P>
	If you look at the news on any one night, the clips of the action in 
this House that were taken for the news will be of opposition 
members. An opposition member will get up and say: ``The 
minister over there was just protecting his own sorry butt'' and that 
gets on television. Another member will point their finger and 
make some rhetorical comment and that is on the news.
<P>
	All members of Parliament regardless of whether they are on the 
government side or the opposition side, if they are doing their job 
effectively, if they are taking advantage of the opportunities 
available to them, have ample opportunity to demonstrate to 
Canadians what their salt is in this place, what their value is and 
whether or not they respect this place. This place must be 
respected.
<P>
	I want to point out that we have four hours to debate a motion 
which is just going to review old arguments. This debate could not 
have taken place without the unanimous consent of the House. The 
Reform Party, the Bloc and members on this side of the House gave 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4436"> 4436 </A></B>
<P>
unanimous consent. If Reform Party members were really so 
agitated about what was going on, they would look at all of the 
aspects of the operations of this House in which unanimous consent 
is asked for and required.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	There was one this morning when the parliamentary secretary 
rose to give a speech. Somebody realized that he was the mover of 
the motion and in fact was deemed to have spoken and technically 
should not have been speaking. The House was asked for 
unanimous consent to waive the rule and allow him to speak. The 
Reform Party accepted. It could have said no and he would have 
had to sit down and we would have moved on to the next speaker.
<P>
	If members of Parliament who have a problem with the process 
would look very carefully, they would find that there are ample 
opportunities for them to direct the activities within this House, if 
they would only exercise them. However they do not.
<P>
	I will tell the House why members of Parliament do not take 
advantage of the opportunities they have to direct the activities 
within this House. It is because it is clear to all members of 
Parliament here that regardless of political stripe and regardless of 
views on the issues, it is in our best interests, in the best interests of 
our constituents and in the best interests of all Canadians that we 
co-operate and make sure that this place is operating efficiently and 
that we are dealing with issues which are important to Canadians.
<P>
	It means from to time to time members from all sides of the 
House have to co-operate. Therefore, we make deals. We 
co-operate with each other. We say: ``We will allow you to have 
this debate this morning but listen, we have to get our committees 
working. Therefore, why do we not agree to let this debate go 
forward and instead of for the full day let us cut off the debate?'' 
The Reform agreed, the Bloc agreed and the House agreed. We are 
going to at least limit this so that the vote on the motion can be 
taken before the House and the committees can go back to work 
this afternoon. That is co-operation and work.
<P>
	Committees are an interesting beast. Someone said earlier that 
committees are where the real work takes place. That is absolutely 
true. As a backbench member of Parliament, I want to personally 
attest to the fact that it is in committees where the real work, the 
strong work, the intelligent work, the work which applies the 
experience and expertise of members of Parliament really comes 
into play.
<P>
	When I have an opportunity to address the House, it is a very 
honourable and awe inspiring occasion. It is always a great honour 
to be able to speak in this Chamber. However, whenever I speak in 
this Chamber, the Chamber is generally empty. There are usually 
about 10 people in the House. I look up in the galleries and try to 
sense what the people are thinking: ``Gee, there are not too many 
people down there. Where is everybody?  We pay for 295 members 
of Parliament. Where are they?''
<P>
	We all know that right now many members of Parliament are 
making calls to constituents, writing letters, meeting people in their 
offices or at committee meetings. Things are going on on 
Parliament Hill all the time. We do not all have to be here. As a 
matter of fact we do not all have to participate in the debate on 
every issue. That would be tremendously unproductive for the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	Therefore, we have a committee system. We have a committee 
system where hopefully each of the parties has assigned to their 
committees representatives from their parties who they feel have 
appropriate experience, expertise or certain things to contribute to 
the activity of that committee. It is in their best interests that the 
views of their party and the views of their constituents who are 
represented by those members are brought to bear at committee 
which is where it really happens.
<P>
	I had the honour to chair a parliamentary committee on a drug 
bill. It went on for a year. I enjoyed the opportunity to lead a group 
of my colleagues through a very complex bill, as it ultimately 
turned out to be. I think we came back with some 70 amendments 
to a drug bill which dealt with all kinds of very interesting 
problems.
<P>
	Being a member of the health committee, having served as an 
associate on the finance committee, having participated to some 
extent on the industry committee, I have had an opportunity to 
move around through various committees. I had an opportunity to 
make a contribution and to participate in the debate, to participate 
in the questioning of witnesses and to help focus on the relevant 
issues to the matter before that committee.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	It is easy to say that committees are free to do what they want to 
do. Technically, that is true. The parliamentary secretary quoted 
earlier from the first line of Beauchesne's which basically says that 
the rules, the limits and the principles articulated in the rules of this 
place are there to protect the rights of minorities. It means that 
things like unanimous consent are required. Even if there is a 
majority government, if we co-operate, that means we can be 
productive.
<P>
	One of the most important changes that has happened in this 
House to make it a productive place was the change which was 
made and introduced by the government House leader with regard 
to voting procedures. We have had literally hundreds of votes in 
this place. In a vote it takes about 10 minutes to call the roll of the 
members. If we wanted to grind this place to a halt, consent should 
not be given to have any votes in this place without calling the roll 
each and every time.
<P>
	Whoever says no to unanimous consent will do so at their peril 
because Canadians will quickly understand  that the House is going 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4437"> 4437 </A></B>
<P>
through a process that is not productive. We agree on a number of 
things and that means we can apply votes. It means that we can 
express the will of our constituents, of our parties or of our 
individual views.
<P>
	We have had cases where ordinary members have voted in a way 
contrary to their own party. They voted their own views. We have 
had free votes. I am very grateful that the government has extended 
free votes on certain issues to its caucus. The other parties have 
done the same or similar things. They respect the values, the 
interests and opinions of their own members because there are 
certain issues that are not partisan issues. They are personal issues. 
They reflect social and personal values that someone holds very 
dear.
<P>
	We will not force people to simply be lemmings that run and 
jump off the cliff if somebody says to jump off the cliff. Members 
have more integrity. We are here trying to improve the optics of the 
House of Commons, the integrity and the view of the integrity and 
image of people in political life.
<P>
	This is a very honourable profession. It is a great honour to be 
here serving people. We all know that we give up a great deal to be 
here because we feel we have something to contribute. Most if not 
all members are giving up valuable family time to be here. Many 
members who live far away from Ottawa and who travel 
extensively to get home give up a lot of their own personal time to 
be here representing people because they feel strongly about it.
<P>
	We know that nobody takes this job to get rich. Members do not 
get rich. Most members I know made a better living in terms of 
income in their former lives. I know many of the members. Look at 
their history. Look at what they have done in their communities. 
They have been involved at the grassroots level, at the local level of 
politics, at the provincial level and territorial level. They have been 
involved in raising money for causes they feel strongly about. They 
have track records and they are here because of those track records. 
They are here because they have experience and expertise that their 
constituents felt was important to bring to this place.
<P>
	People have made that contribution as members of Parliament 
and we respect that. I hope each an every one of us is making 
progress, ensuring that our constituents and Canadians we 
encounter know we are doing the best that we can to improve the 
image of people in political life.
<P>
	Having said that, is it good? We have seen the polls on what it is 
to be a member of Parliament and where we rank. It is very low. 
There is very little respect for people who are in political life. It is 
unfortunate. It has taken about 25 years to get there and it will 
probably take as long, if not longer, to earn back a measure of the 
respect we need in this place.
<P>
	To get back to the issue of committees, some have suggested that 
we really should have certain parties as vice-chairs or whatever. I 
can tell of my experience in committees. I would not want to be a 
vice-chair. If a person cannot be the chair and at least have some 
control over the timing of the meeting and have an opportunity to 
apply one's wisdom, then I would rather be an ordinary member of 
the committee and be able to participate. f I had a choice and could 
pick what would be the best position for me I would rather be a 
member of the official opposition on a committee. The normal 
procedures and the rules of the House are that members of the 
official opposition get to ask the first questions of witnesses and 
make the first interventions. They get to ask all the good questions. 
They get to set the tempo and some of the focus of the committee 
meeting. Then it goes to the third party. By the time it gets around 
to government members in committee, there are few substantive 
matters to be dealt with. Very often, as we all know, time runs short 
because we only have a half an hour for a witness. Time runs out 
and government members do not even get a chance to participate. 
There are some awkward things.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	However, we have made progress in making this a more open 
place. As long as the opposition parties are going to be given 
unanimous consent, I will be comforted to see that unanimous 
consent coming forward. It continues to remind me that we all have 
to co-operate in this place. We do from time to time get into 
situations like this because we have to keep our feet on the ground 
and say: ``Let us get a little bit of that partisan stuff in there''.
<P>
	I have tried not to make this a partisan speech. I respect my 
colleagues in this House. I do not agree with them on many issues 
but I respect their right to have a different opinion and I respect the 
opportunity to be able to continue to express my opinion in this 
place.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to ask the member for 
Mississauga South a question. He spoke about respect for 
parliamentarians and that the public needs to re-establish respect 
for the people who have chosen to serve their country in this 
manner.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member how the public can respect 
members of Parliament and members of committee when often 
times we see that the chairpersons or other members of the 
committee do not respect the member of Parliament's right to 
represent his or her own opinion rather than that of the party in 
committee? Is that not something we should be dealing with? That 
person is there representing Parliament, not necessarily a political 
party, and he or she should be given the freedom to say what he or 
she thinks openly, rather than being controlled by the party whip. Is 
that not required as respect for that member in committee?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4438"> 4438 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Madam Speaker, the member raises a very good 
question. However, the member would agree that it does not get 
back to the issue of what are the implications to the House of 
Commons and to Parliament if a majority government is elected.
<P>
	If I were in the Reform's position, I probably would share their 
frustration to some extent in certain aspects, for instance 
committees. If there is legislation or issues that the committee has 
decided to deal with and the government policy or platform is 
articulated and specific, the government members of the committee 
will support the platform on which they ran. They will support the 
legislation they are dealing with or they will support the opinion 
articulated by the party for which they ran.
<P>
	Notwithstanding what the Reform or the Bloc or even other 
Liberal members have to say in committee, with a majority 
government situation there is no question that by and large the 
decisions made by that committee reflect the government position.
<P>
	There are cases where very important changes have been made 
and very important points have been raised in committee. 
Committee is where the work happens. I know that the member has 
been very active in the justice committee. I know that this member 
and many other members working in committee do make very 
positive contributions and consultations in committee.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	As was suggested earlier, I wish that more committees could 
have their proceedings televised so that Canadians could see all 
members at work. What happens in this place happens in about 45 
minutes during question period. That is where the theatre is. 
Canadians think that what they see during question period is what 
happens all day long in this place. It is not.
<P>
	In fact this place is a forum for the opposition parties. I recall 
when a colleague from a long time ago asked the rhetorical 
question: ``What is the role of the opposition?'' Somebody blurted 
out: ``The role of the opposition is to deliver blows that would 
tenderize a turtle''.
<P>
	It was a rhetorical question and a flip answer. But in this place 
when there is a majority government, that majority government is 
in a position to either deal with matters straight up or to have a little 
fun with them. Government members will be held accountable 
when they go back to the electorate. A majority government which 
is in control day after day is fully responsible for its decisions and 
for the results of those decisions. It means that even at committee 
the government still must call the shots. It is the one that is 
responsible, not the opposition parties.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to comment on what the hon. member said 
and perhaps question him at the same time.
<P>
	He speaks of progress in the committees. This is my first 
Parliament, so I would not be aware exactly what progress he is 
talking about. I am concerned that when the election of vice-chairs 
for instance is not an open and democratic process, where is the 
progress in that? We have ample proof that it is not. I am not going 
to waste the time of the members giving them examples for which I 
have facts. I would like the hon. member's comment on that.
<P>
	I would also like his comment on this. I know that in the last 
Parliament that third parties had vice-chairs. Why is that not the 
case now? I know who it was too and that party only had 44 
members in the House. Why could the third party in the House not 
have vice-chairs on the committees? That would be fair and 
progressive. If we are talking about progress that would certainly 
be progressive.
<P>
	I am also concerned about the democratic process when a bill has 
been voted unanimously in the House of Commons and it is 
non-partisan. I hear this member talking considerably about 
partisanship. This particular bill was non-partisan. It was presented 
that way. When it went to committee it was voted down completely 
and buried. It was voted down in such a way that it could not come 
back to the House. The committee would not return it to the House. 
Yet technically and procedurally that bill was considered alive. It 
stymied anything that the member, who is working hard for 
non-partisan interests, could do.
<P>
	When the bill came back to the House because of the prorogation 
last February the same thing happened. It went to committee and it 
was voted down, and would not be returned to the House. That is 
not a democratic process. We must do something to change it. I 
would like this member to give me his comments on this. How can 
we change it?
<P>
	I happen to have a motion in. I put it in last June so it is far ahead 
of what we have been doing this last two weeks. We must address 
these concerns.
<P>
	Third, I have suggested to those who are in charge of committees 
that when any information comes in from witnesses it is given to 
the member whose bill is on the committee agenda at that time. In 
fact, it must be given to the member whose bill is being discussed 
at that time or that member is at a disadvantage. I have also 
addressed that to those who are in charge of committees.
<P>
	Could this member please comment on those three items?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
with regard to the vice-chairs issue, I understand that Reform 
would like to have people in the position of vice-chairs. They well 
know that committees have two vice-chairs, one is the government 
vice-chair and then there is the official opposition vice-chair. That 
is the pattern we have had.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4439"> 4439 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	If the chair is not there, the government vice-chair takes over. If 
the government vice-chair is not there, then it would go to the 
official opposition vice-chair. That happens so rarely that in my 
view having a vice-chair position is actually a disadvantage. The 
opposition members who would not be in the chair would get an 
opportunity to question witnesses. I do not see it as a significant 
issue.
<P>
	I understand parliamentary tradition. It is frustrating but I do not 
see it as a problem.
<P>
	With regard to private members' bills I agree. The member will 
know that I have a similar situation with a bill, Bill C-222, on 
health warning labels on the containers of alcoholic beverages. It 
was dealt with at subcommittee. But the subcommittee did not take 
a vote on the bill. Rather, it referred it back to the main committee 
and said let us continue to study it. It is at committee now. It may 
never come out which is very frustrating.
<P>
	The issue here is private members' business. I would support the 
reform of the selection of bill for private members' business. I do 
not believe we should be debating bills that do not qualify as 
votable. If a bill is frivolous there is no point in taking up the time 
of the House by talking for an hour about it. A bill which does not 
merit being votable should not go through the process.
<P>
	For any bill that is passed at second reading and referred to 
committee, I do not support the committee failing to report the bill 
to the House. At least it should report that it has decided the bill has 
no merit. Then the House would have an opportunity to determine 
whether it shared that view. That would be an important 
clarification which I would support.
<P>
	With regard to witnesses, it sounds like a technical matter. 
Anyone who has business before this House or a subcommittee 
should be privy to all documents. That is something the member 
could work out herself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the member for Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley.
<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity to join this debate. When I 
first ran for Parliament in 1993, I had a couple of real concerns 
about the preceding years. It seemed like the will of the people had 
not been heeded on many occasions. The Trudeau government 
began an era with all kinds of legislation being forced on the people 
of Canada although they objected to it.
<P>
	When the will of the people guides the politicians we have a 
democracy. We do not have that, which is the problem with this 
place and this country and which is also the reason I am here. 
Instead, we have the will of the politicians who make decisions that 
affect the people,  even if those decisions are against the wishes of 
Canadians. In my view that is tyranny, and that is what we have to 
break.
<P>
	I find it amusing to hear the Bloc members debating the issue of 
democracy when they will not even honour a referendum of their 
own people that said no to separation. I wonder what part of no they 
do not understand. This was the result not once but twice. And they 
are talking about democracy. I find that kind of amusing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Sadly amusing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Sadly amusing.
<P>
	We are talking about the committees today. As I look about the 
room, I see the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce who was the 
chairman of the justice committee when I served on that 
committee. He did a very admirable job. He is a very fair 
individual.
<P>
	However, I found it really discouraging. One day he chose to do 
what he felt he had to do as a politician, as a representative of some 
people, and voted a certain way. He is therefore no longer the chair 
of that committee.
<P>
	One might say that those committees are supposed to be there for 
the benefit of parliamentarians. They will examine issues and do 
things right. We are going to put people in charge, in the chair 
positions, who are the most capable and the most able. I have found 
that is not so.
<P>
	It is being used as a place of patronage if an MP is a good old boy 
or girl. If a member does not behave, they will be booted out and 
their position will be taken away.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	I see another member in here from Scarborough whom I admired 
on that committee because of his ability to go through legislation in 
a legal manner that I am not capable of doing as an ex-educator. I 
relied on his statements and opinions that he put forward on that 
committee. He was a valuable instrument as far as I was concerned. 
One day he chose to go against somebody over there on a little 
decision. So out he goes. We do not need him there any more and 
instead we will shove in somebody else. Guess who we shove in? 
Maybe not anybody nearly as competent but somebody who will do 
as they are told.
<P>
	When you have a government constantly telling the people 
running this country to sit down, be quiet and do as they are told or 
face punishment, that is wrong. I am going to do everything I can to 
inform the people of this county about what is going on. It is a 
dictatorship, not a democracy. The sooner the voters realize it the 
sooner these guys will be gone. That is what I am waiting for. I 
hope for the sake of my grandchildren that is exactly what does 
happen.
<P>

<P>
	In 1993 the Liberal party put together a red book of promises to 
act on if it became a governing body. On page 92 it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the House of Commons a Liberal government will give MPs a greater role in 
drafting legislation through House of Commons committees.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So much for that. How many of these pieces of legislation have 
received second reading approval in this House of Commons and 
go to the committee and there they lay? They were never brought 
back to the House to discuss. I find it absolutely deplorable that we 
are voting on Bill C-45 this week when about two years ago we had 
78 members from that government vote to abolish section 745. 
Those same 78 will probably have to support Bill C-45 because a 
certain minister has said that is the way it will be.
<P>
	That is a shame. Once upon a time they were in full support of a 
private member's bill that would abolish section 745 of the 
Criminal Code. Now we have a flip-flop. Why? The word must be 
out. You had better shape up. Is that what it is, you little puppets? 
When are you going to wake up and start being the men and women 
you were sent here to be and represent the people of Canada?
<P>
	That statement of page 92 has turned out to be nothing more than 
a red ink book lie, another broken promise. They ought to be 
ashamed. It is a farce going through the motions. I felt like all we 
were doing on that justice committee was going through the 
motions day after day. One member from the government asked a 
while ago who reads it. There were some very conscientious 
workers from the Liberal government on that justice committee 
who tried their best to make some important changes. 
Consequently they will probably not be on that committee again 
under these social engineers we have on the front row of today's 
government.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> There is nobody here today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> We will use our imagination. That is what they 
use all the time.
<P>
	There is a rule that we could follow. I talked to the chairman of 
our committee, the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, and I said 
the member from Calgary Northeast and John Edwards, the past 
commissioner of Correctional Service Canada, and I visited the 
University of Alberta. We met with some researchers in their 
department who gave us some very strong messages: ``We must get 
our message to the Parliament of Canada, it is essential for the 
safety of Canadians''. I talked to the chairman of the committee 
and he suggested I put it on a letter and send it to the committee 
requesting that particular researching group to appear before a 
committee to tell it what they had found out because they were 
unable to get the ear of the government. Even Mr. Edwards 
indicated from his visit to the committee that this information 
should be brought to our attention and that it could be extremely 
important.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	On April 27, 1995 I wrote a letter to the chairman of the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. I did not even get an 
acknowledgement, and I am on the committee. I did not get this 
before the steering committee for even a suggestion that we 
consider it. Nothing whatsoever happened to this.
<P>
	I asked the next chairman to review this, look at it and he said: 
``What letter? What request? I have no idea what you are talking 
about''. In 1995 the researchers told us that if something is not 
done about what we are finding out, in the very near future, within 
the next year or two, we will see a major increase in HIV in the 
prisons across this land. We could do something about it but we 
have to have the ear of the government. You try to do that through a 
committee where you are supposed to. Not a chance.
<P>
	They are going to get the ear of the government because I am 
going to the press. We will get it out. I am going to the researchers 
and they are going to join me. The message will get out. They have 
been ignored.
<P>
	Suddenly last week we see a huge increase in HIV and hepatitis 
C in the prisons because a non-democratic body of people are not 
interested in what the opposition has to say. I say opposition is right 
here, not there. They are in with the Liberals on so many pieces of 
legislation they ought to have a copy of the red book to go along 
with the other propaganda they read.
<P>
	I hope the Canadian people will wake up one day and realize 
what kind of people are operating this country. It is not a 
democratic group. We need a change.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I served on the human resources development committee 
for two years after being elected to Parliament. I would like to 
recount a bit of my experience on that committee and ask the hon. 
member for Wild Rose to comment.
<P>
	One of the first things the government mandated that committee 
to do was consult Canadians. We were instructed to make a 
cross-Canada tour to find out how social programs should be 
changed, reformed and modernized.
<P>
	As a young rookie parliamentarian I felt that was very important 
thing we needed to do. One of the reasons I was elected was to 
change and modernize Canada's social programs. Canadians 
wanted to preserve some of their most valuable social programs 
and so I participated in that complete tour. We went across Canada 
and consulted for over six weeks. We amassed volumes and 
volumes of material on what Canadians wanted to do. I was excited 
about the possibilities of what could be done.
<P>
	The tour cost millions of dollars. We went from Yukon to 
Newfoundland to consult Canadians about what the wanted to do 
with unemployment insurance, pensions, welfare, health and all
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4441"> 4441 </A></B>
<P>
the areas under this entire umbrella. It was virtually half of 
government spending.
<P>
	Canadians told us very clearly what they wanted to do with 
unemployment insurance. That was one of the special interests I 
had on this. Canadians wanted unemployment insurance to again 
be a true insurance program. They wanted a lot of the things the 
government had put into that program taken out and made a true 
insurance program with employers and employees having a much 
greater say in how the funds would be managed.
<P>
	I was most disappointed when at the end of this tour the minister 
completely disregarded what the committee had done. The minister 
completed disregarded the input Canadians had through that 
committee.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	I was shocked at the amount of money that was wasted. All of 
this material was simply shoved away. I do not know what room it 
was put in but it would have taken a fairly large room to house all 
of the submissions that people, in good faith, thought were going to 
be heard by this government. It was completely disregarded. This 
was a farce, as my colleague said.
<P>
	The government claims it will listen to the committees, that the 
committees will be effective and have an influence on the agenda. 
There is concrete proof that absolutely nothing was done. This 
committee process was an absolute joke. The government 
completely disregarded the report and the recommendations that 
were made.
<P>
	A government that claims that the committees will be effective 
and which made that promise in its red book has completely 
reneged on that. I am very concerned that it continues to give the 
impression that through the committees effective changes will be 
made to legislation. That is not happening. I have been an eye 
witness to the waste of money and time these committees are 
because Canadians do not have a say even when the government 
tries to give the impression that it is consulting.
<P>
	Would the hon. member have any comments with regard to that? 
I think it is a serious matter which I have not heard addressed. 
However, it continues to go on behind the scenes all the time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for the 
question. I do agree. I know what he is talking about. He is talking 
about a group of people who have been put together to go through 
the motions.
<P>
	The decisions on all of these issues are already made. They are 
made behind the closed door of the minister's office. That has been 
evident over and over again in the last three years. The decision is 
made but they go through the motions and pretend that the 
committee is really having some input and the Canadian people are 
really having some input. It is all a joke.
<P>
	On January 16, 1994-I will never forget the day-the social 
engineer from the justice department, our justice minister, said: 
``Get your submissions in for the Young Offenders Act''. I can tell 
this House that they came from all across the land, thousands and 
thousands of them, including my own. They arrived in that 
minister's office and then the committee was struck. We then got 
Bill C-37 which was approved by this House.
<P>
	Guess what? After all that work, the committee is going to tour 
around and see what the people want to do with the Young 
Offenders Act. It is a joke, a waste of time and a waste of taxpayer 
dollars.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have sat on several committees and would 
like to support my colleague by saying there have been some good 
chairpersons from the government side who have taken on their 
role very judiciously. However, I have also sat on a committee that 
broke the rules and changed the membership to accomplish what it 
wanted accomplished, which was to kill a report from the 
subcommittee on national security.
<P>
	This committee met, and I will only use the 1995 year, for seven 
months. It spent over 35 hours hearing witnesses and preparing a 
report. During this time the member for Scarborough West was a 
member of the government and led the government's attack or 
representation on dealing with a report from SIRC, the security 
intelligence review committee, that we were reviewing.
<P>
	This individual put hours of research and represented the 
government in what I thought was a very competent manner. He 
has a very astute legal mind and offered a lot in the discussions and 
debates on this report. As I said, the committee members sat for 
over 35 hours listening and cross-examining the witnesses to get as 
much information out as we could.
<P>
	The members of the committee, which included the Bloc 
member and the Reform member, got to the fourth draft of a report 
on September 8. This report was being prepared to be introduced 
and tabled in the House of Commons by the end of that month.
<P>
	However, lo and behold, one of the other members of this 
committee, obviously on instruction from the party and the 
government, which the member for Windsor-St. Clair who maybe 
had not understood the issues but who participated in the 
discussion, had been involved in bringing this report to a fourth 
draft.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	On September 19 the government made sure that this report 
would not go on, would not be tabled in the House of Commons. 
The government took the member for Scarborough West off the 
committee. He was the only government member who probably 
had actually read the report under discussion and knew anything 
about it and he was taken off the committee. The government  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4442"> 4442 </A></B>
<P>
replaced him with an individual who had not sat for over 35 hours 
listening to witnesses with a chance to cross examine them.
<P>
	The second meeting of this committee with the new members 
from the government side lasted for 10 minutes before they 
adjourned it. They waited until they had eaten the sandwiches. We 
met at suppertime because that was the only time we had available 
as busy MPs. They waited until they had filled their faces on the 
sandwiches and fruit before they adjourned the meeting because 
they did not want to address the report.
<P>
	There was one government member who decided they would 
rewrite the report after the committee got to a fourth draft. The 
member for Windsor-St. Clair went away and rewrote the whole 
report without any input from the opposition members on the 
committee. What a farce.
<P>
	The government, in order to keep this report from being tabled in 
the House of Commons, did not even respect their own member. It 
did not even respect the chair of that committee. The adjournment 
by his own party members was done without his knowledge. They 
adjourned our meeting early on three occasions in order not to deal 
with the issue. They did not even have the courtesy to tell the 
chairman who was representing the same party, the government 
party, that they were doing this.
<P>
	It shows to me the absolute disregard and disrespect the 
government has for the independent operation of a committee to 
get down to the real work and to determine whether something is in 
the best interests of the people of this country.
<P>
	It is about time the government realized that each one of us is 
here to give the best that we can, including the government's own 
members. If they happen to find something that is wrong and that 
should be brought to the attention of the government, they should 
be allowed to do that.
<P>
	I have watched time over time this kind of interference by the 
government whip. I watched it in the justice committee when we 
were debating Bill C-41. Two Liberal members had gone through 
the process, had gotten replacements signed in to show up and sit 
down and the party whip came in and said: ``No, you are not 
representing the government. Here are the replacements that we 
have approved''.
<P>
	There is total disregard for the process and the rules that are in 
place so that we as members of Parliament can do the job for the 
Canadian people in reviewing legislation in committee to make 
sure the end result is the best possible for the people of Canada.
<P>
	I would suggest that the government has a long way to go before 
it is fulfilling its red book promise of giving more independence to 
committees, of giving more members of Parliament the ability to 
affect legislation and to help in the creation of legislation.
<P>
	I am another private member who has a bill that made it through 
second reading in the House of Commons. Mine passed 
unanimously two years ago. It is sitting in the justice committee 
and has been for two years. The Minister of Justice introduced a 
bill on the same subject two years later. Why did the committee not 
deal with a private members' bill that was dealing with dangerous 
offenders and how to keep them off the streets of Canada? Two 
years ago that was passed unanimously by this House, placed into 
the committee and totally disregarded.
<P>
	I would suggest that the tyranny of the majority which one of the 
Liberal members referred to earlier is precisely what this country 
has with the present government. Because this government has 
such a massive majority, it feels it has the right to totally disregard 
the rights of its own individual members of Parliament to represent 
the Canadian people in what they feel is right and just.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	Anytime there is a critical review of something which may point 
out an issue or an area that the government should back away from 
or reconsider, it is disregarded. Maybe I have misread the position 
of the member but I thought we were all here to do the best job we 
can for the Canadian people and to make sure that those who follow 
us have the best legislation, the best rules to govern the country to 
make sure that it is a strong, vibrant and unified country in the 
years to come.
<P>
	I do not see that our work in committees is allowing us to do that. 
I have seen interference by the government, not only on opposition 
members but on government members which is in contravention of 
the parliamentary system.
<P>
	If the government wants to return to this House with any 
majority let alone a mass majority it had better pull up its socks and 
start listening to the Canadian people because it may not be given 
another chance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the member made a very good intervention. I am glad she was able 
to get all of her frustrations out. It is good to be able to express 
one's frustration at democracy. However, it is a contradiction 
because one cannot be frustrated with democracy.
<P>
	The issue here is that a majority government is fully in control of 
the work and the decisions of the House of Commons by virtue of 
that majority. The electorate as a whole is going to hold the 
government fully accountable for the decisions and actions in this 
place, understanding fully that the opposition parties were not in a 
position to defeat anything.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4443"> 4443 </A></B>
<P>
	The member raised issues about something that happened in the 
justice committee and talked about our work. I believe her quote 
was ``our work'' as a collective of the committee, as if the 
committee does not reflect a microcosm of this place. It is a 
partisan committee made up of partisan members and team 
members who represent their party's position. That means 
notwithstanding that the member has made good points, the 
ultimate decision is of the committee. The committee is controlled 
by the governing party with the majority and thereby transposing 
the responsibility, the government is responsible for each and 
every decision the committee makes and must be accountable to 
the people.
<P>
	If the member feels that the committee's work and the end result 
of the decisions made and the amendments proposed and the bills 
supported or not supported were wrong and not in the best interests 
of Canadians, there will be an opportunity for those members in the 
next election.
<P>
	The member should remember that the curse of a majority 
government is that it is deemed to be in control by all Canadians. It 
will be held fully accountable and what it does is at its own peril.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Madam Speaker, I find it very interesting to hear 
a member of the Liberal Party say that the government is fully 
responsible for the decisions of the committee. In this case the 
member the government replaced on the committee was 
recognizing that there was a discrepancy in the information or the 
testimony of witnesses and questioned and challenged it. Because I 
had no support from the committee for recognizing there were 
discrepancies in testimony and that it should be challenged and 
questioned, I brought it to the House as a point of privilege.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	I will quote from the Speaker in his ruling earlier this week: 
``However in my opinion this is a matter for debate and not a 
question of privilege. The member clearly has a dispute as to the 
facts presented to the committee. Should the member wish to return 
to the committee with the matter, and the committee ought to report 
to the House on this aspect of the question, the House at that time 
may choose to deal with it''.
<P>
	The committee refused to even deal with it in the report stage. 
That is why the member for Scarborough West was kicked off the 
committee. He recognized that the other members of the committee 
would not deal with that issue. I would suggest that the government 
is responsible for the decisions to help cover up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to ask my colleague what she really thinks about the selection 
of vice-chairs, especially only from the ranks of the separatist, 
break up the country party.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Madam Speaker, the issue really is the openness, 
the ability for the members of the committee to choose the person 
they feel is best able to represent the opposition. I would suggest 
that there have been times when many of the government members 
would have liked to have supported a Reform Party member who 
was presented to them but were told not to.
<P>
	The day that the Liberal members of these committees are given 
the freedom, and I mean full freedom, to select who they feel is 
best able to represent them, we will see some Reform Party 
members placed in the vice-chair positions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have just a few points concerning this debate.
<P>
	What started it was the tabling of this excellent report by our 
whip, the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, who is 
doing a fantastic job. He has been one of the best whips I would say 
in the history of this place. On the list of names of people serving 
on these committees, months of consultation have gone into 
preparing this list to make sure that members are on the committees 
they want to be on if possible.
<P>
	All of a sudden, the Reform Party stands up in the House, 
frustrated by its own unpopularity, frustrated because the 
government is so far ahead in the polls, but mainly frustrated 
because of the Bloc. Under our system it is the Bloc, the official 
opposition, which has many of the privileges the Reform Party 
would like to have.
<P>
	Here Reformers are today criticizing of all groups to criticize the 
Government of Canada for this lack of democracy, for this lack of 
accountability to the House of Commons, to the Canadian people, 
to this lack of power over the legislative process. There are only 
two functions of committees in the House of Commons under our 
system and they are accountability and the legislative function.
<P>
	Is it not strange that they should be criticizing the very 
government in the entire history of this place which has allowed 
free votes not just on private members' bills, but also on 
government initiatives. If we investigated the mother of 
Parliaments, the British Parliament, I do not think we would find 
there such progressive actions as those by the Government of 
Canada, by the Prime Minister, under the present administration. It 
is historic. It has never been done before.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	On top of that, with this new found power which has been given 
to members of Parliament on government bills and private 
members' bills, we have in this place the best accountability of any 
legislature under the British parliamentary system. I am referring 
to question period.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4444"> 4444 </A></B>
<P>
	There is no other legislature in the world that has a question 
period that the ministers, the executive, have to attend to answer 
whatever questions are posed by the opposition parties- no other 
legislature in the world.
<P>
	I will tell the House what we do have in the world. Perhaps the 
Reform Party would like to have this. Perhaps it would like us to 
become up to date like the British, the Australians or any other 
Parliament where one has to give notice of a question to a cabinet 
minister. The cabinet minister does not even have to be in the 
House every day. They are only called once every two weeks to 
come for a day to answer questions in the House, questions for 
which notice has been given.
<P>
	Why have we retained this? We have retained this because the 
Government of Canada, particularly now, is in a situation with a 
separatist party as the official opposition. The Government of 
Canada has rejected the many suggestions from the academic 
community that we go the way the British and the Australians have 
gone where they have to give notice of every question and the 
cabinet ministers would not be confined to their places here in this 
House every day and be answerable to a complete free for all by the 
opposition parties.
<P>
	The system we have works only if the accountability of the 
government is actually accomplished by the two main political 
parties in opposition, first the power given to the separatist party.
<P>
	We can imagine why the Reform Party is rather frustrated. We 
have a system whereby one of the two main players in question 
period is a separatist party that is only interested in breaking up the 
country. That is its agenda. It is not interested in anything else. I do 
not think Bloc members are interested in anything else. When they 
sleep they dream about it. They plan it day after day: ``What are we 
going to say in question period to break up the country?'' 
Obviously that is not working in the best interest of Canada. Then 
there is the second party.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Extremists.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> As the hon. member pointed out, this is party of 
extreme political positions. And so we wonder who the losers are. 
The losers are the people of Canada.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Give us an example of what is extreme.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> The hon. member has asked for an example. We can 
give examples. Imagine a political party with that much power for 
accountability being opposed to our health care system. Imagine a 
political party that includes in its position that it wants the public to 
have roads built by private enterprise and then we would need toll 
gates. How else? Imagine the Alaska highway. Imagine if there 
were tolls on the TransCanada highway. This is the party with these 
very extreme positions on certain things.
<P>
	An hon. member from the Reform just mentioned 
unemployment insurance. They had this great plan. Let us talk 
about the extreme position of being opposed to reducing the 
premiums for employees and employers, to use the unemployment 
insurance fund to pay off the deficit, to make sure that everything 
becomes zero, and then they will reduce the premiums. That is in 
their policy booklet, page 24 of the budget they presented.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	What we have is the Government of Canada being held 
accountable to the people of Canada by two political parties that 
are not representative of the wishes of the Canadian people and 
therefore cannot really hold the government accountable for their 
actions. The government holds true to the principles of democracy 
in the House by giving members of Parliament on the government 
side a free vote even on matters that are introduced by the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	It is clear the reason the system is not working is the fault of the 
opposition parties and they only have themselves to blame. They 
should go back to the drawing board as far as question period is 
concerned and perhaps come up with some better suggestions 
rather than hold up all of these excellent committees with these 
excellent MPs just waiting to do their job as presented by our whip 
earlier on today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
always interested to hear the member from Newfoundland speak.
<P>
	He spoke of extremism. We have seen extremism in this country 
for the last 25 years. We have seen the extremism in the fiscal 
monetary policy that has created a $600 billion debt in this country. 
We have the extremism result in a $50 billion interest payment 
each year on that debt. We have seen the extremism of the MP 
pension plan which is not a pension plan at all but a winning lottery 
ticket.
<P>
	We have seen the extremism of section 745 that allows first 
degree murderers like Clifford Olson to apply for early parole after 
serving just 15 years and take everyone of those 11 families whose 
children have been murdered through the horror, pain and the 
anguish again and again.
<P>
	We see the extremism of politicians who support those kind of 
rights and protection for the murderers in this country while 
ignoring completely the duty and responsibility to protect the 
innocent victims of the children of those families.
<P>
	Yes, this country has had to be subjected to extremism, 
extremism that I have talked about, which we could speak about for 
hours in this House; extremism of the Young Offenders Act that is 
considered to be a joke by many of the young offenders them-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4445"> 4445 </A></B>
<P>
selves; a justice system that cannot protect the lives and the 
property of our citizens. Yes, we have extremism in this country 
and it is  the result of people like my colleague who just addressed 
us.
<P>
	We can talk of something the hon. member did not address with a 
democracy as expressed within our committees. I sat on the justice 
committee and I saw one of the finest chairman who knew the 
rules, who was an experienced capable man and who was fair to 
both the government side as well as the opposition. I saw that hon. 
member fired from his position simply because he chose to 
represent what he thought was in the best interests of his people on 
a government bill.
<P>
	The hon. member has not addressed that. Perhaps he could 
address that in the time he has left. What does he think about the 
hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce being treated in that 
horrible manner by a so-called democratic process and a 
government that is supposedly sworn to uphold the democratic 
principles of this country? Let us hear the hon. member respond to 
what happened to this hon. member over here.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member has claimed we 
are a government of extremes. He started his point by talking about 
the debt and the deficit, of economic extremes, as he called it.
<P>
	I have to admit this country today is in an extreme position 
because we are at an extreme, are we not? Which one of the G-7 
countries leads the world in economic development? Which 
country is at the economic extreme? Is it Italy? Is it France? Is it 
Germany? Is it the U.K.? Is it Japan? Is it the U.S.? What country is 
at the economic extreme? We agree with the hon. member. The 
country at the economic extreme is the country of Canada, which 
leads everybody else.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to ask the hon. member, speaking of extremes, which political 
party's extreme ideas did the government adopt? Which party ran a 
campaign on cuts and deficit elimination and that cuts lead to jobs, 
better opportunities and make this country better? Which party ran 
on jobs, jobs, jobs? Which party has stolen the other party's ideas? 
We want nothing to do with its ideas and we are glad it is stealing 
ours, our extreme views, our extreme positions and our extremely 
valuable contribution we have made to this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Madam Speaker, the Liberal Party of Canada would 
never be that extreme. The Liberal Party of Canada, since the fall 
of 1993, has been the most progressive economically of all of the 
industrialized nations of the world, and is projected to be that way 
next year, without adopting the Reform principles of cutting health 
care, making people pay for their roads and doing away with social 
programs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I can see as you do that the government majority is 
pleased to hear what I have to say, and I will not be afraid to speak 
my mind.
<P>
	The fundamental reality we are faced with here is that we have a 
democratically elected opposition composed of 53 members who 
agreed to comply with democratic rules with regard to party 
fundraising, rules that were rejected by both the Reform Party and 
the government majority in this House.
<P>
	We are being told today that our work as parliamentarians, 
particularly our work in committee, is useless. That is what the 
Reform members are saying. They are saying that our work as 
parliamentarians is useless because they are not the official 
opposition.
<P>
	That is sheer hypocrisy. You will recall that less than two weeks 
after we came to this House, the leader of the Reform Party invited 
us to a luncheon where he told us that his party would have a new 
image, that we would see a new way of doing politics, that his party 
would be democratic, that it would enrich debate.
<P>
	Despite the fact that we have a system where the people have 
their say, where they can choose their representatives 
democratically, some members have the gall to tell us today that 
this system is worthless with regard to committees, because they 
are not the official opposition. It certainly takes some nerve to rise 
in this House today and make that kind of comment.
<P>
	How should we evaluate the work of the opposition? We have a 
democratic opposition.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	And we are here because we received a mandate. What is that 
mandate? It was given to us during a democratic electoral 
campaign held according to public rules. The people of Quebec 
chose 53, 54 members from the Bloc Quebecois. That is a fact.
<P>
	What is so painful for the Reform Party members? I hope that 
one of them will have the courage to stand up and say it instead of 
their usual hypocritical speech. What counts in democracy is not 
what you have on your head, but what you have in it and how much 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4446"> 4446 </A></B>
<P>
brain power you have that determines whether you should aspire to 
form the official opposition.
<P>
	What does the Reform opposition have to say? What do the 
Reformists say about public finances? And on the foreign affairs 
policy? And what about human rights? What do they have to say 
about the big debates of the moment? And about the recognition of 
the rights of Quebec? They have nothing to say and this is why not 
only will they not form the official opposition after the next 
elections, but we will see to it that they are completely wiped out.
<P>
	I challenge you, Madam Speaker, and any of the 
Reformers-who are a throwback to bygone days-to give us an 
example of any occasion where we have been remiss, either with 
respect to content, policy or ethics, or in connection with 
attendance in the House, or our use of any of the prerogatives of the 
official opposition. I challenge them to give us one example.
<P>
	We know very well that we have done our work properly. We 
have done it like those who know that, when the official opposition 
rises in the House, it speaks on behalf of the Quebec people, who 
made a democratic choice, and who will do so again in order to 
reach an ideal that we have never concealed, which is to see that, 
when it so decides, Quebec will be able to attain sovereignty.
<P>
	But did that mean that, when we had the opportunity, we were 
not able to honestly and respectfully represent a broad range of 
Canadians? Yes, we were able to do so. We were able to do so when 
we spoke about Bosnia. We were able to do so when we spoke 
about renewing institutions internationally, particulary with respect 
to the United Nations. We agree that, in specific cases, the Quebec 
nation may have interests in common with the rest of Canada, but 
we have never compromised our principles.
<P>
	Did the Reform Party fight against family trusts? Did you hear 
them on this issue? Did the Liberals get up and fight when 
apparently two billion dollars had more or less legally left the 
country, left Canada? Did they stand up and fight? No.
<P>
	What bothers both these parties is that we take a unique position. 
We have something different to say, something specific.
<P>
	I know both the Reform Party and the government majority wish 
we could blend in with the rest of Canada. But that will not happen, 
because we know what Quebecers will do, because they are capable 
of democratically choosing what is in their own interests. And 
being guided by their own interests means electing spokespersons 
exclusively dedicated to promoting the interests of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	In the same breath, I hasten to say that each and everyone of us 
has friends in English Canada, and we believe that the best way to 
conduct our political business in the next century is in the form of a 
partnership.
<P>
	That is what we believe, and we are not naive about the 
eventuality, the plausibility and the eminently desirable policy of 
maintaining a Canadian common market. We are not naive in this 
respect.
<P>
	I am concerned to say the least that the Reform Party has nothing 
to say about these issues. To rise in the House with all the naivety 
and indignation of a convent school girl of 17 and say they are 
unhappy because in committee they are not the official opposition 
is an affront to democracy.
<P>
	Democracy is about being able to elect the people who represent 
us. Do Reform Party members seriously believe that with this kind 
of holier than thou attitude, devoid of any common sense, they will 
win the popular vote? Is that what they believe? I hope not.

Speaker, I have three petitions from several hundred Canadians 
from different provinces which state that abolishing the 
opportunity for prisoners serving life sentences of 15 years or more 
who apply for a judicial review of their parole eligibility will likely 
only serve to increase both the human and economic costs of the 
criminal justice system and increase public fear and 
misconceptions about crime among the Canadian public.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore call on Parliament to oppose the repeal 
of section 745 of the Criminal Code or the restriction of prisoners 
access to just and fair procedures as well as to launch a concerted 
public education campaign to promote the need for more 
responsible and humane criminal justice approaches to enhance the

<P>
	The petitioners pray and request that Parliament proceed

public concern that sexual predators are at large in our streets

substantial revisions of the YOA and they call on the House to 
enact legislation to reform the justice system and the Corrections

primarily that new laws would ensure that sexual predators are kept

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians know that strong families make a strong country and 
that we must pursue appropriate initiatives to build that strength. 
These initiatives also include mitigating problems which 
undermine and weaken the family such as alcohol abuse.
<P>
	Tragically, 50 per cent of family violence, 65 per cent of child 
abuse and one in six family breakdowns in Canada are all directly 
or indirectly due to alcohol misuse.
<P>
	The consequences of family violence and child abuse are 
devastating and long lasting. However, this is a societal problem 
which requires the resolve of both men and women working 
together to identify and eliminate the root causes of family 
violence.
<P>
	Reducing family violence means healthier families, improved 
outcomes of our children, lower health care costs, lower social 
program costs, safer communities and stronger families.
<P>
	Finally, strong families make Canada strong. Therefore I call on 
members of Parliament to pursue initiatives to restore the strength 
of the traditional Canadian family.

today to salute the management and employees of Les industries 
Cascades. Environmental protection is an important value for 
them, and an integral part of their management philosophy. 
Evidence of this is their recent official opening of a secondary 
water treatment plant at the Kingsey Falls pulp and paper complex, 
representing an investment of over six million dollars in order to 
reduce biological oxygen demand and hence the toxicity of effluent 
from the four Kingsey Falls plants.
<P>
	Cascades employees were responsible for much of the design, 
construction and installation of the equipment, and its operation. 
This company now has one of the most efficient secondary 
treatment systems in the pulp and paper industry. My 
congratulations to the management and employees of Cascades, 
which has now moved into the vanguard of environmental

NDP views the preoccupation of Parliament with the fate of the 
defence minister and General Boyle as politically unfortunate. It 
has let the Liberals off the hook on other issues.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the Prime Minister and the minister of defence 
have been disappointing in their stalwart defence of General Boyle.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is right to say that the inquiry should be 
allowed to do its work but the Prime Minister should do his work.
<P>
	To question General Boyle is not to attack or criticize the 
enlisted men and women of the Canadian forces who are 
distinguishing themselves at home and abroad.
<P>
	To imply that questioning General Boyle is an attack on all who 
serve in the forces is false and a cheap rhetorical tactic. To imply 
that all General Boyle's internal critics are only motivated by 
resistance to change in the department is also false. There is a 
legitimate question of leadership here and it is hard to argue that 
General Boyle is the one to provide it.
<P>
	The Prime Minister should be wary that his twisting, evasive and 
often shallow defence of General Boyle is enough to make some 
Canadians wonder about his leadership abilities. It is time he 
stopped bragging about his standing in the polls. Pride goeth before 
a fall.

when seeking the finest expertise and equipment available. It is 
clear that the Minister of National Defence takes his job quite 
seriously. The minister has displayed tremendous strength and 
tenacity as he works to make Canada's defence department the best 
it can be.

	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to once again to your attention an innovative 
tool for promoting literacy.
<P>
	I had the recent pleasure of participating in launching a new 
Canada Post Corporation stamp in Fredericton. The new stamp is a 
partnership effort between CPC and ABC Canada, a non-profit 
organization that helps raise awareness of literacy and promotes 
private sector involvement in supporting the cause.
<P>
	The new stamp costs 50 cents, with five cents from every stamp 
going to ABC Canada.
<P>
	I wish to commend Canada Post for this novel and creative way 
to support literacy in this country. It is once again helping us raise 
funds on a community basis. New Brunswick has been a leader in 
the promotion of literacy and I hope it continues to lead by 
supporting the use of this new stamp. If all 10 million stamps are 
sold literacy groups across the nation will benefit to the tune of 
$500,000. If one in three Canadians buys just one booklet of stamps 
they will sell out.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AUDITORGENERAL">AUDITOR GENERAL</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in an absolutely unprecedented gesture, Liberal members 
have attacked the auditor general for blowing the whistle on the 
family trust scandal.
<P>
	For three years the Bloc Quebecois has been criticizing these tax 
havens, yet now, because the auditor general has confirmed what 
we have been saying, that billions of dollars are going out of the 
country tax free, the Liberals are questioning his competency and 
the way he is fulfilling his mandate. And this is someone appointed 
by the House of Commons.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister tell us whether he dissociates himself 
from the opinion of certain members of his party or whether he 
rejects this report?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, I would like to thank the finance committee for its 
report. I would like to thank the representatives of the government 
for the majority report, and the opposition members from the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Reform Party for their minority report. I intend 
to examine it with care.
<P>
	As for the comments about the auditor general, someone who, as 
the hon. members are well aware, has always had our strong 
support, I must admit that there was a difference of opinion in the 
committee on certain steps taken or recommended by the auditor 
general.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Differences of opinion are, I feel, part of democracy. What I do 
not understand about the tone of the comments on the auditor 
general in the Bloc Quebecois minority report-for it is not merely 
a disagreement with the government-is that the Bloc seems to 
hold the position that the committee, that Parliament, does not have 
the right to make comments about an employee of Parliament, 
which is what the auditor general is.
<P>
	It is the role of Parliament, and the role of the members of 
Parliament, to make comments, whether about the Prime Minister, 
the Minister of Finance, other ministers, or the auditor general. 
That is part of what democracy is all about, and that is what they 
have done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, it is obvious that the Minister of Finance has given up his 
fancy footwork for the summer. He was much more nimble when it 
came to skating around the GST issue.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that, by remaining mum, he is 
sanctioning the report by his MPs and making a direct attack on the 
very institution of the auditor general, the protector of the general 
public and the one whose job it is to call attention to the faults in 
the public administration? Does the Prime Minister realize that he 
is backing up his MPs by his silence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
what the Leader of the Opposition is really doing is confirming the 
point I wanted to make in my response, namely that the standing 
committee does not have the right to make comments about an 
employee of Parliament. This is totally ridiculous. I would ask the 
Leader of the Opposition to speak about the substance of the 
majority report, a report which I applaud. This is a very meaty 
report, with a great deal of merit, and we on this side plan to 
examine it carefully.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the minister wants to talk substance, we will talk 
substance. We will talk of the very philosophy of this government. 
It has to be understood. When the Somalia inquiry tries to cast 
some light on administrative and leadership failings in the Army, 
the Prime Minister discredits the Commission. When the auditor 
general tries to cast some light on the matter of family trusts, 
government members discredit the auditor general.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister explain to us the new philosophy of 
his government, which to all appearances consists in discrediting 
those who are not in agreement with it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
unfortunately it is obvious that the Leader of the Opposition has not 
had time to read the majority report. First, their criticisms were 
made very respectfully, and second, they accepted most of the 
auditor general's recommendations very favourably. They thanked 
him for  them, point by point. That is in the report, the thanks to the 
auditor general. Moreover, we in government thank the auditor 
general for the points he had raised, and because of the fact that he 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4453"> 4453 </A></B>
<P>
did raise those points-and the majority report says this-the 
Ggvernment will be in a position to act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for the past three years, we have been asking the 
government to get to the bottom of the family trust scandal. It was 
not until the auditor general recently condemned the scandalous 
transfer of $2 billion in trust funds to the U.S. tax-free that the 
Prime Minister finally decided to ask the finance committee to 
review, to shed light on this matter. The Liberal majority tabled its 
report yesterday and all they did was attack the auditor general.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Who is the Prime 
Minister trying to protect?
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, this matter was first raised in 1991 under the previous, 
Tory government. Second, right after we came to office, we dealt 
directly with the matter of family trusts and, in our second and third 
budgets, we eliminated all the fiscal abuses associated with family 
trusts. Third, the hon. member must know that this matter has 
nothing to do with family trusts. It was indeed a family trust, but 
the real issue is how to collect taxes from immigrants when they 
leave the country. That is the real issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if this is only a Tory matter, why should they be afraid to 
get to the bottom of this scandal? Why? While the Minister of 
Finance and the Prime Minister are stalling, more billions of 
dollars are leaving the country tax-free, because the government 
refuses to plug the loophole created in 1991.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is aiding and abetting the flight of capital, 
and I ask him again the same question: Whose interests is he trying 
to protect?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is really unfortunate on a matter of some seriousness that the 
opposition is unable to treat a serious matter with the serious 
degree of concern that it requires.
<P>
	Instead of yelling here in the House or trying to seek a diversion, 
why does the opposition not deal with the fundamental matter 
which is what the majority report did? This occurred in 1991 under 
the previous government. Immediately upon taking office we 
eliminated all fiscal abuses having to do with family trusts. We 
then asked the finance committee to take this issue on. It has in fact 
made a serious number of recommendations that we as a 
government intend to look at.
<P>
	I only wish the opposition parties had been able to sit down and 
understand the issue. Under those circumstances they might have 
been able to deal with the debate in an intelligent way.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOMALIAINQUIRY">SOMALIA INQUIRY</A></H3>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government cannot have it both ways on the Somalia inquiry. The 
Prime Minister has complained that it is too slow, too expensive 
and too hard on witnesses. The reason the inquiry has been delayed 
again and again is that the department was not producing the 
relevant documentation. If this government wants someone to 
blame in this whole affair, it should simply look in the mirror.
<P>
	Why will the Prime Minister not simply admit that if the 
Minister of National Defence and Jean Boyle were really capable 
of doing their jobs, the commission would have had all the 
documents and the Somalia inquiry would be on track today?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member says the government cannot have it both ways. I would 
submit that her party cannot have it both ways. Her party advocated 
the establishment of the commission. That commission, as I have 
reminded hon. members, will allow for an impartial setting to hear 
all of the evidence and have everyone dealt with fairly.
<P>
	However, for the last three days in the House, if we look at 
<I>Hansard</I>, what have we seen? We have seen accusations coming 
from the other side, imputation of motive and reflection upon 
evidence. One cannot one day advocate having an inquiry with an 
impartial setting and then the next day come in the House of 
Commons and do the opposite. It is the opposition that wants it 
both ways.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
very minister, by appearing on TV and pronouncing Jean Boyle 
innocent even before the thing was finished, has castrated that 
commission and that is all there is to it. It is as simple as that.
<P>
	The Somalia inquiry is having such a hard time doing its job 
because the department does not have any real leadership. We then 
see a minister step in and think that he can make announcements 
about it before it is even over.
<P>
	The minister and Jean Boyle himself do not know up from 
sideways. There is precious little respect in the military across the 
country for this minister and for Jean Boyle. That is why the 
department is in such a mess and why the Somalia inquiry has 
taken so long.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4454"> 4454 </A></B>
<P>
	I will ask one more time. If the Prime Minister is really serious 
about mopping up the mess in the military, why will he not start 
at the top with the minister and Jean Boyle?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member has uttered an absolute untruth. I am sure she has done this 
inadvertently. I defy her to show any time where I reflected upon 
evidence before that inquiry.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, not on 
evidence but by inference he was saying that Jean Boyle is a great 
guy. On national television the minister stood up and said: ``He is a 
fine man, we support him and he is doing a great job''. I do not 
know how much more clear I could get that he is trying to influence 
and interfere with the commission and its findings.
<P>
	The only reason the Prime Minister will not fire these guys is 
because he is worried about potential political damage. Let me tell 
him from Canada: There is far more damage in keeping them than 
in letting them go.
<P>
	I ask the minister, the Prime Minister or whoever is going to 
juggle and get themselves up on this one, why does the Prime 
Minister not just admit he was wrong, cut his losses and let these 
guys go?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have an inquiry that is doing the job it was asked to do. 
We would like to have the results as quickly as possible so we can 
deal with the matter efficiently.
<P>
	In the meantime, I urge everybody to let the commission do its 
job, let General Boyle run the armed forces and let the Minister of 
National Defence do what is needed in national defence to give it 
some stability and the political leadership that is needed. In the 
previous nine years, in the previous administration, the department 
had seven ministers. There was no connection between the political 
needs and the administration. The stability that is needed is being 
established at this moment by the good work the Minister of 
National Defence is doing.

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, family trusts are a strange issue to say the least. 
Two billion dollars were transferred out of Canada tax free, with 
the kind help of Revenue Canada officials. The auditor general 
exposed the scandal, the official opposition demanded that an 
inquiry be held, the government refused, turned around and 
attacked the auditor general.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Why does the Prime 
Minister not want to look into this scandal in which billionaires are 
able to transfer huge assets to the United States to avoid paying 
taxes like everyone else?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
regarding the substance of the question, the majority report 
contains a series of recommendations vital to ensuring that any 
loophole that may have existed is plugged.
<P>
	That said, the hon. member used the word ``scandal'', implying a 
lack of credibility on the part of certain people. We were not in 
office when this took place, the Conservatives were, and I must 
point out that the auditor general himself, whom the hon. member 
quoted, confirmed the integrity and credibility of all concerned.
<P>
	Is the hon. member telling us that the auditor general was 
mistaken?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can the Prime Minister justify refusing to 
review such an unfair tax system, which always benefits the same 
people, unless he is trying to protect those around him who 
contribute to his election fund?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, the question itself seems to be 
imputing motive and that should not be a part of the questions we 
address to one another. I would caution all members to please be 
very judicious in their choice of words.

so wishes, I will permit it. If not, we will pass on it.

<P>
	We set out to tackle the family trust problem immediately upon 
taking office. We started by repealing the 21-year rule.
<P>
	Then, we eliminated the choices that applied to the privileged. 
As a result of the steps taken by this government, the fiscal abuses 
associated with family trusts have been eliminated. Unfortunately, 
the hon. member is two years out of date.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, double standards prevail at the Department of 
National Defence. There is one policy for General Boyle yet a 
different policy for the rest of the Canadian Armed Forces. Due 
process for subordinates and none for General Boyle.
<P>
	In the tragic death of Corporal MacKinnon, his commanding 
officer Major Hirter said he is responsible and he has been charged. 
Boyle said he is responsible yet nothing has happened.
<P>
	Is this glaring double standard the kind of management the 
Prime Minister is proud of?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, here is yet 
another example of the hon. member reflecting upon something on 
which he knows I cannot comment because of my obligations 
under the National Defence Act.
<P>
	He has made reference to potential proceedings against one 
member of the armed forces and he wishes to have this debated in 
the House of Commons. We have a justice system within the 
military and the people in the military are subject to it. It is 
constitutionally sanctioned by the supreme court. It could, perhaps, 
be in need of some updating and I hope Parliament will help us in 
that.
<P>
	I think it is grossly unfair for the hon. member to raise the cases 
of individuals knowing that I cannot reply because of the 
obligations I have under the National Defence Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, again the Minister of National Defence tries to spin 
the argument in his own favour. He knows full well that Major 
Hirter will get due process. The problem is that a political 
appointee of the government does not seem to be able to be lowered 
to the due process the law system should provide. There is a clear 
double standard.
<P>
	Canadian Armed Forces personnel were ordered not to use work 
or business hours or resources to prepare their testimony for the 
Somalia inquiry. Yet despite this order, access to information 
documents show that General Boyle spent more than 50 business 
hours preparing to testify.
<P>
	Is this glaring double standard and violation of orders the kind of 
management the Prime Minister is proud of?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon.

Even if I could, it would  be very difficult to cut through the

impression that only the Liberals are right regarding this issue. All 
the editorial writers are wrong. The Liberals are the only ones in 
step, as in the case of the army.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's silence today speaks volumes. So do the 
comments made by the Minister of Finance, who tries to cover up 
his colleagues' blunder.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Finance: What does he have to say to the 
statements made by the auditor general, Mr. Desautels, who said he 
would do the same work again, and by the former auditor general, 
Mr. Dye, who said the Liberal government does not understand 
anything about the auditor general's role?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the majority report said that the advance ruling process must be 
protected. The auditor general said the same thing. Is the Bloc 
Quebecois for or against that?
<P>
	The majority report says the credibility or the integrity of the 
public servants involved is not in any way at issue. Similarly, the 
auditor said he had no intention of attacking the credibility and the 
integrity of these public servants.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>

	The Bloc Quebecois cries foul, but the auditor general does not 
agree. There is no scandal, as stated in the majority report.

comments made by the auditor general, and the majority report 
agrees with that.
<P>

time dealing with the substance.

	I ask the Minister of Finance why he is taking cover behind 
something which is said to have occurred in 1991, on December 23, 
around 11 p.m., just before Christmas, when everyone is partying. 
Some hard-working public servants can come and find a little hole 
to slip $2 billion through. This still goes on every day, and the hole 
is not being plugged from the other side.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Auditor 
General of Canada is an independent officer of Parliament whose 
mandate it is to investigate government mismanagement, waste 
and abuse.
<P>
	Not only is the Prime Minister critical of the independent inquiry 
into Somalia but the Liberal dominated finance committee has also 
found fit to interfere with the day to day affairs of the auditor 
general.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. What is the purpose of 
this attack on the auditor general, who is an independent officer of 
the House and whose job it is to investigate the government and 
report back to this House?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have committees of the House of Commons that look 
at reports from a lot of officials from many important sectors of 
public administration.
<P>
	When the committees meet, the duty of the members of 
Parliament is to look into the report and express their point of view 
about it. We have different parties in this House and sometimes the 
parties do not agree.
<P>
	We are not about to ask the committee to meet and not to look 
and not to report. They are there to do just that. Now the report will 
be studied by the Minister of Finance. There are in this report 
suggestions by the people from the government side, people from 
the Bloc and from Reform. We will look at all the suggestions, take 
the good ones and reject the bad ones.
<P>
	The committee members have to do their work, to study the 
report and have the honesty to report to the House what they 
believe should be reported to the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this report 
is extremely critical of an officer of this House. It was not the 
officer, it was not the auditor general, who waived the $500 million 
in tax revenue. It was the Department of National Revenue. It was 
not the auditor general who approved a tax waiver of that 
magnitude with no documentation in the files whatsoever. It was 
his duty to report these facts to the House.
<P>
	Clearly this government favours the rich and taxes the poor.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Will the government 
act today to close this loophole that has been wide open for several 
months and stop it right now?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member earlier said that the committee had interfered in 
the work of the auditor general. That is obviously nonsense.
<P>
	The committee, immediately on receipt of the report of the 
auditor general, convened, heard the auditor general, heard a 
number of experts on the issue and came out with a report that 
largely agreed with the auditor general on the steps that had to be 
taken. In fact we have now received the report and we are going to 
act on it as quickly as we possibly can.
<P>
	It is really nonsensical for the member to say what he has said. 
What is even more nonsensical is for a member of the Reform 
Party to talk about somebody preferring the rich over the poor. This 
is the party which has consistently for three years stood up and said 
eviscerate the poor, get rid of them so that we can protect our 
friends. This is the party which has said let us get rid of old age 
pensions. This is the party which has said let us eliminate health 
care. This party which has tried to destroy the social fabric of this 
country, and he has the nerve to stand up here and say that. Mr. 
Speaker, I cannot believe my ears.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the heritage minister.
<P>
	This morning, the CBC took action in response to the Liberal 
government's order to reduce spending. When it has completed the 
operation, it will have reduced its budget by one quarter, or $414 
million, and its staff by one third, or 4,000 positions.
<P>
	How can the minister explain that, with one hand, she is cutting 
the CBC's budget by $414 million, while, with the other, she is 
creating a $200 million patronage fund, in the guise of promoting 
the production of Canadian content?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that the 
cuts made today to the CBC, in response to our budget, are not 
easy. I must remind the hon. member that the cuts were made to 
several levels of government.
<P>
	Over the next three years, the federal government will let 40,000 
people go. I must remind the member that, last  year, even 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4457"> 4457 </A></B>
<P>
Radio-Québec had to reduce its staff by half. It is true that we are 
losing positions, but during the budget cuts last year 
Radio-Québec, now Télé-Québec, had to let half its staff go.
<P>
	I am satisfied that the CBC's president and board of directors 
have done their best to at least respect the CBC's right to be heard 
throughout the country in both official languages. They were not 
forced to cut as deeply as Radio-Québec did.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister would do well to get her facts straight. 
Télé-Québec may have made cuts, but it reopened all the regional 
stations, it did not close them, like the CBC.
<P>
	Are we to understand that by transferring money from the CBC 
to the television production fund, the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, who until today had no influence over the CBC's editorial 
content, has finally given herself the power she has always wanted 
and that she will control the CBC?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as I said, it is not easy to 
make cuts. Radio-Québec dropped from 629 employees to 329, a 
reduction of 50 per cent. One thing is certain, and that is that the 
programming fund, half of which has been set aside for the CBC, 
was supported by all of Quebec's artists, by Quebec's cultural 
community.
<P>
	What is interesting is that this will give the CBC, working in 
partnership with the private sector, access to funds that will give 
priority to Canadian production, up to a total of $650 million. We 
are creating 10,000 jobs.
<P>
	There is no doubt that these are difficult times and this is why we 
must work in partnership with film makers, the true creators of 
Canadian and Quebec culture.

	<B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber-St. Barbe-Baie Verte, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this weekend will mark the return of a very special 
tradition for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador, and for the 
people of the lower north shore of Quebec.
<P>
	Both the food fishery and the commercial fishery for cod has 
been closed for several years now to allow for rebuilding after a 
catastrophic decline. Conservation has been our first priority. 
Would the hon. minister explain to his colleagues why he has 
allowed the resumption of the food fishery?
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, this year I implemented 
the continuation of the sentinel fishery.  This is a survey designed 
for fishermen and scientists to determine the rate of return of the 
cod stocks that were decimated. The results are optimistic. In some 
cases the results this year as compared to last year are from double 
to 25 times greater.
<P>
	This is not sufficient for a commercial fishery but after 
consultation with every aspect of the industry, all the stakeholders, 
including the senior scientists, I have decided that it is prudent to 
allow a very limited, very closely controlled food fishery for two 
weekends. Essentially this will allow the people of Newfoundland 
and Labrador and those of the Quebec lower north shore to return to 
a traditional association with cod as a food in a very limited manner 
that they have been associated with for hundreds of years. I was 
very pleased to do it.

question is, did the Deputy Prime Minister scrap the GST like she 
said she would? No. Did the Deputy Prime Minister provide stable 
funding to the CBC? Rather obviously not. Did the Prime Minister 
fulfil his promise to scrap the GST on reading? Rather obviously 
not. In fact, he doubled it.
<P>
	Given a record that would make Pinocchio blush, why should 
Canadians believe anything at all this government has to say?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when you are looking to 
find out who is telling the truth, I have a hard time taking the 
question of the hon. member seriously when he and his party have a 
stated policy of abolishing the CBC.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
advise the Deputy Prime Minister to stay away from those bank 
machines.
<P>
	I would like to quote from the Liberal Party policy convention: 
``A Liberal government would reaffirm the historic principles 
embodied in tax free status for the printed word and remove the 
goods and services tax on reading materials''. The Liberals have 
put it in writing for us and we are very appreciative of that.
<P>
	Since the finance minister likes to talk about his government's 
commitment to education and literacy, I wonder if he can explain 
his broken promise, for instance, to medical students at Memorial 
University who are going to have to pay $400 more for their books 
because of a promise that the Liberals did not keep. In fact, not 
only did the government not keep its promise it doubled the GST 
on books.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
I said yesterday, there has been no change in the GST on books and 
there has been no doubling.
<P>

<HR>

<P>
	At the same time I indicated very clearly in this House on 
numerous occasions that we are very open to the concept of 
examining the way in which books are taxed. However, we raised 
certain questions which the hon. member has not yet answered. 
In fact, is this the best use of $140 million or are there other ways 
in which one can support literacy?
<P>
	We will continue in that vein. Our basic goal is certainly an 
improved workforce and more educated Canadians. I ask the hon. 
member, why is it that in the last budget we increased educational 
credits for students? We made it easier for students to go back to 
school and to afford it. We made education easier in the last budget 
and Reform voted against it.

	Yesterday, the Prime Minister said the army was at a standstill. 
Obviously, its chief of staff is busy defending himself, preparing 
his testimony and trying to get out of the mess he is now in.
<P>
	Are we to conclude from what the Prime Minister said that he 
admits the army is paralysed because he refused to suspend his

questioned? In other words, will the Prime Minister acknowledge 
that if he had suspended the general, the army would not be at a 
standstill?

present context, could the Prime Minister tell us how much time 
General Boyle can spend on leading the army, carrying out his

helped to create?

that the chief of the defence staff and his colleagues have been at 
the  forefront of bringing some very important changes to the 
armed forces.
<P>
	Yesterday in a speech in Ottawa the general talked about some of 
the real accomplishments of giving commanders more control, of 
devolving more authority to base commanders across the country, 
of looking at terms of service for military personnel so that they 
can be assured of service depending on performance.
<P>
	Lots of reforms are going on. It is a pity that people have become 
so obsessed with some events that they are overlooking the 
fundamental changes, the good changes, that are putting the 
Canadian military in the forefront of reforms of all military in the

	Last week, the Liberal member for St. John's West gave an 
ultimatum to the town of Placentia. The ultimatum was this. Sell 
two surplus fire trucks for a token fee against your will or face 
losing a $350,000 federal grant for an arena.

	I would like the Prime Minister to explain to us why Liberal MPs 
can use the money from taxpayers' pockets across Canada to force 
provincial or municipal governments to toe the Liberal line and to 
agree to individual MP's projects.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> The way the question is worded, I am trying to see

when the Liberals on the finance committee got the message from

Revenue Canada was mollycoddling the Bronfman family trust

ask the finance minister, who claims that the Liberals have already 
dealt with this problem, why the finance committee would make 
such recommendations to deal with the problem if, as the finance 
minister says is the case, the government has already dealt with the 
problem.
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to further ask the finance minister when he is going 
to wake up to the fact that Canadians who pay their fair share of 
taxes are sick and tired of people getting away with this stuff and 
they want something done about it. They want the government to 
revisit this tax decision because it is legally possible to do so. Get 
that money back so we can-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. Minister of Finance.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
immediately upon taking office the government dealt with the 
question of family trusts. It took away all of the abusive tax 
advantages that accrued to family trusts. We did that immediately 
upon taking office.
<P>
	That is not the issue in this case. What happened in 1991 brought 
up the issue of how we should treat property owned by somebody 
who is a resident of Canada who is leaving Canada, of how we 
should treat the property of an immigrant. It was not a family trust 
question. It was really a question that dealt with very wealthy 
Canadians but every bit as much could have dealt with a widow of 
an immigrant who was returning to her homeland and how she 
should deal with that property. That is the basic issue at stake here.

Mr. Speaker, I have to report on a meeting that took place in St. 
Petersburg two weeks ago. It was a very important meeting to us 
because of reasons everyone in this House will be familiar with, 
related to the importance of the fishery to Canada.
<P>
	There were three points that were achieved through careful 
negotiation and a lot of homework. The first is that Canada will 
control the total allowable catch when the fish recovers in NAFO 
area 2J 3KL, which is adjacent to Canada's coast. The second is 
that the amount of total allowable catch for a NAFO non-Canadian 
will be restricted to 5 per cent. The third is that a dispute settling 
mechanism will be allowed to look at the difficulties we have 
experienced in the past.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is with great sadness that I rise today to pay tribute to Arnold 
Peters, the CCF-NDP MP for riding of Temiskaming in Ontario 
from 1957 to 1980. Arnold died at the age of 74 on September 17.
<P>
	I had the honour of being a colleague of Arnold's all too briefly 
from May 22, 1979 until he was not re-elected in the general 
election of February 18, 1980. During that time I came to 
appreciate him greatly as a happy warrior  who knew Parliament 
well, who knew his constituents well and who knew where he 
stood.
<P>
	Arnold stood on the side of working people and he made no 
bones about it. He was a rough but gentle person with strong roots 
in the mining and logging communities of northern Ontario. He 
loved the people of these communities and worked hard for their 
welfare. He had worked in various capacities as a union organizer 
and was very clear on who he represented when he came to 
Parliament.
<P>
	Arnold and his CCF colleague Frank Howard were responsible 
for reforming Canada's archaic divorce laws in the late 1950s. As I 
understand it, divorces in some provinces used to have to come 
before Parliament, something that seems ridiculous to us now. By 
discussing or reading into the record each divorce claim that came 
before Parliament, Arnold and Frank made the ridiculousness of 
such a process obvious and it was soon changed.
<P>
	Arnold knew the rules and he knew how to use them. He was not 
one to be pushed around politically or personally. He did not mince 
words, and stories abound about how direct Arnold could be with 
bureaucrats who were frustrating the legitimate needs and rights of 
his constituents. As a rookie MP, I always knew that we were in 
good hands when Arnold was around.
<P>
	Arnold Peters also had a reputation as one who worked to reform 
the prison system in his day. He was also, I might add, an advocate 
for those who worked for the House of Commons without benefit 
of collective agreements.
<P>
	I spoke with a long time colleague of Arnold's this morning, 
Mark Rose, who told me that Arnold at one time could fairly have 
been called an ombudsman for House of Commons security and 
other staff who needed someone to go to bat for them on many 
occasions.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	During the second world war Arnold Peters served in the Royal 
Canadian Air Force, and we honour his service to his country in 
time of war, as we have honoured it in time of peace.
<P>
	I last saw Arnold at the unveiling of the plaque in the Centre 
Block where the names of those who served in former Parliaments 
are inscribed. The name of Arnold Peters is inscribed there nine 
times. But more important, Arnold Peters' name and memory is 
inscribed in the hearts and minds and stories of all those who love 
justice and who fight for the common people. Arnold Peters was 
such a person and we loved him for it.
<P>
	To his wife Alma, his sons and all his family, I express sincere 
condolences on behalf of the NDP caucus in Parliament. We

<P>
	I remember him well, for Arnold Peters was my member of 
Parliament during the years I was growing up in Kirkland Lake. 
Arnold Peters died on Tuesday.
<P>
	Before his election in 1957 Arnold Peters had been a gold miner, 
a union activist and had served during World War II.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	When Arnold Peters was first elected, in 1957, I was still quite 
young, but, as my family lived in Kirkland Lake, I remember very 
well when he became the member for our riding of 
Temiscamingue.
<P>

	He very quickly made a name for himself in Parliament when he

reform Canada's divorce laws. As a result he became known 
around here as one of the divorce twins.
<P>
	As an opposition member first with the CCF and later with the 
NDP, he was certainly outspoken. I am sure some of my colleagues 
on this side of the House can still remember this northern 
Ontarion's spirited questions from his seat across the way.
<P>
	He was rewarded for his dedication to his constituents in 
Temiscaming and for his service to all Canadians in the House of 
Commons by going on to win eight more elections. With 22 years 
in this Chamber he was the longest serving member in the riding's 
history.
<P>
	On behalf of my colleagues on this side of the House, I would 
like to extend our sincere condolences to his family.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Again, we extend our most sincere condolences to the family of 
the late Arnold Peters.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the 
Reform member from Ontario, I rise in the House today to join my 
hon. colleagues in paying tribute to Mr. Arnold Peters, who passed 
away this week.
<P>
	Mr. Peters served in the RCAF during World War II and in 1957 
was elected as the member of Parliament for the Ontario riding of 
Temiscaming, an office he held for 23 years, winning nine 
successive elections.
<P>
	Mr. Peters served both his country and his constituents with 
distinction and honour.
<P>
	On behalf of the Reform Party I want to give thanks for his years 
of service and to extend our sympathies and condolences to his 
family and friends.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Before we had Statements by Members today, we 
had a few more petitions that I said I would take in and also 
answers to Questions on the Order Paper.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (for the Minister of Justice, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-45, an act to amend the Criminal Code (judicial review 
of parole ineligibility) and another act, be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to speak in support of the third reading of Bill 
C-45, an act to amend the Criminal Code and another act.
<P>
	This bill would amend section 745 of the Criminal Code which 
provides for judicial review of the parole ineligibility period for 
life sentences for murder and high treason.
<P>
	I note for the information of the hon. members that section 745 is 
now called section 745.6 as a result of the coming into force of Bill 
C-41, the sentencing bill, on September 3, 1996. Under section 
745.6, as it currently reads, an offender is not eligible to apply for 
review of his or her parole ineligibility period until he or she has 
served at least 15 years of the sentence.
<P>
	During such a review the decision on whether or not to reduce 
the ineligibility period is made by a jury of 12 ordinary citizens 
drawn from the jurisdiction where the crime was committed. At 
present this decision can be made by a majority of eight out of 
twelve members or two-thirds of the jury. This is one of the aspects 
of the provision that would be affected by Bill C-45. The decision 
is made by a jury after it hears evidence presented by the applicants 
and by the crown.
<P>
	It must be noted that under section 745.6 the jury has no 
authority to release the offender from prison. All it may do is allow 
the applicant, in appropriate cases, to apply to the National Parole 
Board for a parole hearing prior to the expiration of the 25 years of 
ineligibility. A decision on whether or not to grant parole is made 
by the parole board after considering whether the offender's release 
would present an undue risk to society.
<P>
	Where the parole board decides to release an offender who has 
had his or her parole ineligibility period reduced, the board 
imposes conditions on that release. These conditions and indeed 
the life sentence itself continue to apply for the remainder of the 
life of the individual or the life of the sentence and the offender  
may at any time be sent back to prison should he or she breach the 
conditions of that release.
<P>
	This means that the offender continues to be subject, literally for 
the rest of the offender's life, to the risk of being reincarcerated at 
any time for a breach of the conditions of release.
<P>
	I would also note that for the consideration of all hon. members 
that a system of review of the parole ineligibility period after 15 
years is consistent with systems in place in many of the western 
democracies we like to compare ourselves with, in that, in many of 
these countries parole eligibility for murder is set at 15 years and in 
some cases less than 15 years. In the United States the average time 
served by murderers who are not executed is 18 years at the federal 
level, and 15 years at the state level.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	As hon. members know, section 745.6 was enacted in 1976 in a 
public fashion when the death penalty was abolished in Canada. It 
was felt at the time that section 745.6 was necessary as a source of 
hope for the rehabilitation of convicted murders and as a source of 
protection for prison guards as well. We can all imagine situations 
where convicted murderers have a faint hope of being released on 
condition that their behaviour will be better. If they knew in 
advance they would be imprisoned for the rest of their lives, what 
incentive would there be not to put the safety and life of prison 
guards in jeopardy?
<P>
	The enactment of section 745.6 also recognized, in some cases, 
keeping offenders in prison beyond 15 years does not serve the 
public interest. We all know there is a great deal of public concern 
about section 745.6. Many have asked for the repeal of this section 
out of concern for public safety. Others have cited the 
revictimization of the victim's family by the review hearing 15 
years down the road at a time when the terrible wounds inflicted by 
the crime may have started to heal. Others focus on the appropriate 
minimum period of incarceration for the worst offence in the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	I share the concerns of Canadians about the need to ensure public 
safety. I am moved by the pain and experience of the families of the 
victims of these often brutal, senseless crimes. The prospect of 
victims' families being revictimized through a public review 
conducted before a jury in cases where the offender has no 
reasonable prospect of success is one of the considerations that has 
prompted the government to act by bringing this bill to the House. 
However, I do not support the repeal of section 745.6. I believe the 
reasons that justified its addition to the Criminal Code in 1976 are 
still valid today. Bill C-45 amends section 745.6 in order to ensure 
the provision is available only in appropriate cases.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4463"> 4463 </A></B>
<P>
	Before moving on to the three main elements of the bill where 
changes are being sought I want to speak briefly about a number 
of principles on which our criminal law is based. These principles 
which have evolved over hundreds of years of jurisprudence 
through the British courts, the Commonwealth and the courts of 
Canada. We must keep these principles in mind when we are 
considering some of the arguments made, particularly those 
arguments that this section should be abolished.
<P>
	If we cast our minds to what we have heard about the criminal 
justice system a number of these sacrosanct principles come to 
mind. Probably the most obvious is during a criminal trial that in 
order to have a finding of guilt we must prove that guilt beyond a 
reasonable doubt. I suppose in some instances the person that 
committed the offence is found not guilty because of that very high 
standard. We could have a standard where perhaps the person is 
guilty, so let us convict him. Or, they are likely guilty, or on the 
balance of probability they are guilty and maybe we should convict 
them. The law has evolved in this civilized society, such that we 
want to keep the number of innocent people in prison to a 
minimum. That is why we have a very high standard of proving 
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If we question that principle, let 
us remember why it was enacted in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Another principle that has evolved over the years is the rule 
against the retrospective application of the criminal law. What does 
that rule say? It says that someone cannot change the criminal law 
in a substantive way to affect the life of an individual after the fact. 
We cannot make a new law to apply to past actions.
<P>
	This law probably evolved many hundreds of years ago through 
the jurisprudence. It was a way for the judiciary to protect citizens 
many centuries ago from the capricious actions of a state less 
concerned about the rights of an accused. For example, a person 
does an act that is not illegal. Subsequently, whatever government 
it is changes the law and makes that act illegal. Surely there is 
something wrong with charging the person after the fact. When the 
person did the act, it was not illegal. However some government 
enacted a law making that act illegal and are going to charge the 
person. That does not make any sense.
<P>
	What if a person commits a criminal act and the sentence is a 
maximum of any number of years in prison. Subsequent to the 
person committing that offence, the government changes the law 
and puts in place a penalty that is much harsher. What about the 
death penalty? Surely it would be unfair to impose a more 
significant penalty after the fact. This principle is no doubt 
protected in the charter. Do not blame the charter as often 
Reformers are prone to do. This rule has evolved over hundreds of 
years to protect citizens from the capricious actions of government.
<P>
	Governments many years ago may not have held the individual 
in such regard. Let us never forget to look back in history to see 
how these rules evolved, to see what abuses they were designed to 
alleviate, before we disregard them.
<P>
	We believe that individuals must be notionally aware of what is 
legal and what the consequences are before the act is committed. 
By promulgation of these prohibitions, and the statutes of the land 
are in the code, action is to be taken against them. Society must be 
aware of these restrictions and activities before they can 
contravene these prohibitions. This makes common sense.
<P>
	What is the implication of this rule against retrospectivity in 
relation to the repeal of section 745 when it means that even if this 
section were repealed, the people already in the system, that is, 
those already convicted of murder and serving time in prison for up 
to 25 years? In the future if they were recently convicted and 
sentenced, they could still apply. The repeal will not bring to an end 
the ability of people who are already sentenced to make application 
under section 745.
<P>
	Reformers tell people to go out and campaign for the repeal of 
section 745 and the person who committed this horrible crime 
against their loved one will not get a section 745 application. That 
happens. That is a fact. That is what the Reform Party is telling 
these victims of crime to do. I want to read the words. We have the 
words of the hon. member for Macleod who indicated quite clearly 
in a speech on Monday. that he advocated that an individual go out 
and campaign for the repeal of section 745, reliving past horrors, 
spending their own money, spending their own time in order that 
the individual who committed this terrible crime would be 
prevented from making a section 745 application.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	Surely the Reformers cannot have missed one of the 
fundamental principles upon which our criminal law is based. 
Surely even if the members happened to miss it perhaps their 
researchers might have caught this very fundamental principle. 
They could have told the victims of these horrible crimes exactly 
what the fact of the matter was instead of urging them to campaign 
against this legislation, suggesting to them that the individual that 
committed this horrible crime against their family would be 
prevented from applying. That is an absolute exploitation of the 
pain of the victims and their families. It is an exploitation for 
political purposes of people who have been hurt in the most 
fundamental way.
<P>
	Reformers are always interested in talking about the effects on 
the victims. I ask the question: What about the effects on the 
victims of this kind of nonsense? The Reform Party would do well 
to advise people who come to them to counsel as to exactly what is 
entailed by repeal of section 745 of the act before sending them out 
to conduct their campaign for them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4464"> 4464 </A></B>
<P>
	It is very disturbing that these people who have committed these 
horrible crimes and have been convicted, and those who seek 
nothing more than to gain publicity because they know they will 
never ever ever get out of prison, utilize people from the Reform 
Party to get their publicity for them.
<P>
	I remember a day at the justice committee when the hon. 
member for Calgary Northeast sat there with eyes aglow reading a 
letter from a notorious criminal. The hon. member was hoping 
beyond hope that maybe he would get some attention by bringing 
forward this letter. The Reform Party needs to think about the 
witting assistance of individuals who have no hope of getting out; 
all they are seeking is publicity. They need to think about whether 
they should in fact be giving them publicity. Serious thought 
should be given to this tactic and changes in behaviour should 
result.
<P>
	Our legislation deals realistically with section 745 and the 
changes that are required. We acknowledge that even a repeal 
would not change the system. The changes we are proposing, while 
one of the changes cannot be implemented after the fact because it 
is a substantive change, the other changes to the act are procedural 
and thereby we can make them.
<P>
	I will now go over the changes that have been brought in by this 
government. The three elements of the bill that are changing 
accomplish the goal of ensuring that only in appropriate cases will 
individuals have the benefit of success of this application.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	The first change eliminates judicial review for all multiple 
murders committed in the future, whether or not the murders are 
committed at the same time. This would include serial murderers. 
The proposed amendment is consistent with a notion found in the 
Criminal Code that repetition of the offence should be treated more 
harshly by the law than a single offence. Therefore anybody who 
commits multiple murders will not be allowed the benefit of 
section 745.
<P>
	The second proposed amendment is procedural in nature. It 
creates a screening mechanism whereby a judge of a superior court 
would conduct a paper review of the application to determine if 
there is a reasonable chance of success before the application is 
allowed to proceed to a full hearing. This would help to ensure that 
only deserving cases get before a section 745 jury, that only in 
appropriate cases would there be a full blown hearing. This would 
ensure for frivolous cases with no likelihood of success that the 
victims would not have to relive the horrors of the situation.
<P>
	The third amendment would provide that a parole ineligibility 
period may only be reduced by a unanimous vote of the jury. As a 
result of this provision, an application for a reduction in a parole 
ineligibility period would be denied when a jury decides it should 
be denied  or when a jury simply cannot reach a unanimous 
conclusion to reduce the period. Also in denying an application, a 
jury can decide if and when the offender may make another 
application, but in any event, not before two years.
<P>
	In June, before the summer recess, the standing committee heard 
from a number of witnesses with strong views on section 745.6. 
Some of them asked for a complete repeal of the section. I cannot 
support this because I believe that doing away with section 745.6 is 
not good policy and not the right thing to do in addition to the other 
problems I have mentioned.
<P>
	Other witnesses have argued forcefully for maintaining the 
section in its present form. In light of the committee hearings 
which accurately reflected the deep division in opinion evident 
during the consultations that preceded the introduction of this bill, I 
believe Bill C-45 strikes the right balance between those who want 
to maintain the section and those who want it repealed.
<P>
	When the Minister of Justice introduced Bill C-45 on June 11, it 
was my hope this House would be able to move quickly to pass 
these amendments before the House rose for the summer. 
Regrettably this was not possible. I ask hon. members of this House 
to support the bill at this time and give it quick passage so we can 
bring these amendments into force as soon as possible.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
the third time I speak to Bill C-45, not counting what I said to the 
Standing Committee on Justice.
<P>
	Right from the beginning, we have been hearing double speak 
from the hon. member for Prince-Albert-Churchill. On the one 
hand, he says: ``We are not striking down section 745 of the 
Criminal Code. It should not be struck down, there must be some 
hope left'', and on the other, for all intents and purposes, the 
provisions of Bill C-45 will make release under section 745 
impossible in several areas in Canada.
<P>
	Let us start at the beginning. When did article 745 appear in our 
criminal law? Twenty years ago this year, in July 1976, as a result 
of a compromise negotiated by the then Solicitor General, the 
present member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, amendments to the bill 
abolishing the death penalty in Canada were tabled. These 
amendments were referred to as the Prud'homme-Fleming 
amendments, after the names of their movers.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Why? What happened? Nobody had to toe the party line, it was 
to be a free vote in the House of Commons, and those in favour of 
abolishing the death penalty simply could not count on enough 
votes; the numbers were not there. If the vote had been on the 
initial bill introduced by the Trudeau government, it would have  
been defeated by 4, 5 or 6 votes. Negotiations conducted by the 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and the Prud'homme-Fleming 
amendments made it possible to secure another 6 votes, and I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4465"> 4465 </A></B>
<P>
believe that the death penalty was abolished on the strength of 
these 6 votes. But when you negotiate, you make compromises.
<P>
	Some kind of compromise had to be reached at that point with 
the people who were inclined to favour the death penalty but still 
had some doubts, and the members who took part in the 
negotiations at the time were able to tell them: ``Look, the basic 
decision to make here is not to choose between 25, 10 or 15 years, 
but to determine if we want to abolish the death penalty''. This is 
how they were able to convince some individuals who were against 
a firm sentence of 25 years in prison to support the 25-year 
sentence; otherwise, the death penalty would have been 
maintained. The government back then made it very clear. I 
remember hearing Mr. Trudeau say in this House: ``If the bill is not 
passed, do not rely on cabinet to systematically use the royal 
prerogative to commute sentences. People will be executed in 
Canada, and scaffolds will be built''. The message was quite clear. 
Members who wanted to take it into account did just that.
<P>
	The hon. member for Prince Albert-Churchill River would 
have us believe that section 745, as amended today, is a measure of 
clemency, but that is not so. In 1976, the law was made tougher. 
Until July of 1976, anyone under sentence of death, whose sentence 
was commuted to life in prison or anyone found guilty of first 
degree murder and sentenced to life in prison was eligible for 
parole after 10 years. They did not have to appear before a jury; 
they only had to go to the National Parole Board and, based on the 
circumstances, apply for parole. In fact, convicted murderers 
sentenced to life imprisonment spent an average of 13.2 years in 
prison. That is far from the minimum of 25 years stipulated in 
section 745.
<P>
	All these negotiations made the law tougher; it was not improved 
for the inmates. Section 745 provides that anyone convicted of first 
or second degree murder and sentenced to more than 15 years in 
prison may, after 15 years, apply to the chief justice of the 
province's superior court or supreme court, who would then 
empanel a jury. The chief justice has no discretion in this; he must 
empanel a jury and it is up to the jury to make the determination.
<P>
	After the evidence is introduced, after the sociologists, 
psychologists, social workers and correctional officers have 
presented their arguments and reports, sometimes after the victims' 
families have provided relevant information, the jury will 
determine whether or not it should recommend that the inmate be 
paroled, since the inmate will always have his life sentence 
hanging over him. The procedure outlined in section 745 is not a 
lottery.
<P>
	Under the current provisions in section 745, the jury must make 
a decision based on a two-third majority, or 8 out of 12 members, 
which, I think, is quite reasonable since, according to criteria that 
were set centuries ago, their cedision does not have to be based on 
something beyond a reasonable doubt. All they have to do is make 
a determination based on a preponderance of evidence.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	In the circumstances, does the inmate deserve to be paroled 
earlier? Do you need unanimity for this? I think not.
<P>
	I think that, back in 1976, the legislator had the good sense to 
determine that a two-third majority was sufficient. Maintaining the 
two-third rule will result in the standard application of the law 
throughout Canada. Regardless of the province where we live, we 
will all be subject to the same laws and regulations not only in 
theory but also in practice.
<P>
	The comments made by the Reform Party reflect a Canadian 
reality that cannot be ignored. These members represent a 
significant number of Canadians, who want tougher sentences and 
are asking that section 745 be repealed or Bill C-45, with its 
tougher sentences, be passed. In certain regions of Canada, western 
Canada in particular, juries will certainly be less lenient.
<P>
	If the hon. members representing western Canadian ridings have 
been calling for the repeal of section 745 of the Criminal Code with 
such vigour, I assume that judges and juries in western Canada will 
reflect the same social reality.
<P>
	These members must not be out of touch with the reality in their 
region. This means there will be one reality for western Canada, 
one for Ontario, another one for Quebec and yet another one for 
Atlantic Canada. I submit that, since criminal law comes under 
federal jurisdiction, there must be a single standard applicable from 
coast to coast to coast. This standard should allow for a bit of 
leeway-a margin of error, so to speak, i.e. four members in the 
jury. That sounds like an excellent idea to me.
<P>
	As I said earlier, under the current legislation, after 15 years, 
inmates are fully entitled to ask the chief justice to empanel a jury. 
The point was made during the debate that only a minority of 
individuals actually make an application. They realize, in many 
cases, that it may be rejected.
<P>
	The chief justice then empanels the jury and the jury makes a 
recommendation. If it is recommended that the individual be 
allowed to apply for parole, the individual can go before the 
National Parole Board. This means that, at the end of the 15 years, 
several more months may elapse before a decision is made.
<P>
	We have heard of individuals who applied for parole but were 
not released until much later. If the jury is not  convinced by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4466"> 4466 </A></B>
<P>
arguments presented, it sets a date when the person may reapply for 
parole or release before serving the full 25 years of their sentence.
<P>
	The hon. member for Crowfoot asked an excellent question of 
most of the witnesses at the hearings, both on Bill C-226 and on 
Bill C-45. The question he asked was the following, and he may 
correct me if I do not get it right. He asked the witnesses what was 
the appropriate sentence for a person found guilty of murder. It is a 
fundamental question, the crux of the whole debate.
<P>
	Once the answer is that a person found guilty of murder should 
not be sentenced to death, once the possibility of the death penalty 
has been eliminated, what is the appropriate sentence? Nothing can 
replace a life, we have been taught this from an early age. This is a 
value-I was going to say an almost universal one-that would 
benefit from more universal exposure. In the world in which we 
live, it is one of the supreme values we have.
<P>
	There is no way to replace the life of a person lost in such 
circumstances. And then the Canadian Parliament decided that 
taking someone's life because he had killed another person was not 
a good way of showing that it was wrong to kill.
<P>
	We are in a difficult position. We cannot just let people go free. 
There has to be a penalty.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Twenty years? Twenty-five years? Life? Something along those 
lines, without being more specific. Twenty-five years seems like a 
sensible proposal. Life imprisonment with the possibility of review 
later on, yes. People must have something to hope for. We must not 
remove hope. That is what helps a person to survive. To sentence a 
person without holding out the hope that some day he may be 
released is at least as bad as a death sentence.
<P>
	On the other hand, the sentence must be exemplary, since murder 
is, in my opinion, the most serious crime that exists in the Criminal 
Code. We cannot give a suspended sentence for first degree or 
second degree murder. So we need something that is severe enough 
to set an example, to protect society, so that the person who is 
found guilty is punished and the family, the community feels safe. 
People have the right to be protected.
<P>
	We said at the second reading stage that we wanted a review of 
the legislation, which is now 20 years old. We had a day and a half, 
two days at the most to do this review, practically sitting around the 
clock. We expected a review process from coast to coast. Like the 
unemployment insurance scenario, it seems everything was agreed 
upon beforehand. We heard witnesses, with very little time to 
spare. It was impossible to do parliamentary committee work 
worthy of the name, but the vast majority of witnesses who 
appeared, the John  Howard Society, the Elizabeth Fry Society and 
even people representing victims told us: ``Do not tamper with 
section 745.''
<P>
	What was the rush? Where were the public demonstrations 
demanding amendments that affect about 75 or 76 people who have 
filed requests in the past 20 years? There are other problems that 
are far more acute and require immediate attention. We would have 
had time for a thorough review.
<P>
	Now that 20 years have passed, would it not be better to go back 
to the situation that existed before 1976 and judge each case on its 
merits before the Parole Board? That was an option.
<P>
	Is there a case for keeping the section as it is now or should we 
consider all other avenues? That is what we wanted to do and what 
we were not allowed to do, and now we are faced with legislation 
that is fundamentally reactionary, since it will now require the jury 
to be unanimous, with the consequences I mentioned earlier. It will 
also force prisoners who want to apply for parole to first go through 
a judge to whom they will give evidence, not in person in an 
adversarial hearing where each party can argue its case, but in 
writing. In common law, while the judge could decide to hear the 
parties, the prisoners have no statutory right to be heard, they 
cannot demand a hearing. Depending on what school of sentencing 
he belongs to, the judge may decide: ``There is no probability of a 
jury granting you parole; your application is denied.''
<P>
	Individuals will not be judged twice, but the facts will be heard 
twice. In criminal cases in general and, by way of comparison, in 
trials by jury, the jury is master of the facts, while the judge is 
master of the law. But in this case, the judge will be master of the 
facts. He will first examine the facts of the matter. If he does not 
find the evidence probative enough, he will not allow the prisoner 
to go before a jury. Should the prisoner be allowed to proceed, he 
will then have to make his case again.
<P>
	The burden of proof is on the prisoner. Do not mislead us into 
thinking that this measure is designed to protect the system and to 
extend the traditional jury process to the system under section 745. 
The prisoner who goes before 12 jurors to be allowed to apply for 
parole after 15 years has to convince those 12 jurors. The Crown is 
not there to say: ``In objecting, I must convince the 12 of them to 
vote unanimously against his release.''
<P>
	The burden of proof is on the prisoner. It seems to us that it is too 
heavy a burden, with the consequences we enumerated earlier.
<P>
	Reference was made to Bill C-226, which I opposed, in which 
the issue was set in much clearer terms by simply calling for the 
repeal of section 745.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	There was at least a clear question and no double talk. Now 
people in the West can be told: ``See, criminals will no longer be 
paroled under section 745 because the law was tightened up'', 
while people in Ontario and Quebec will hear: ``See, social 
workers, psychologists, we believe in rehabilitation because we 
have amended the provisions in section 745 to make them even 
more attractive''. That is what they will say. As one of my 
professors used to say in law school: ``The best thing to do when 
one wants to win a case but does not have one is to confuse the 
judge''.
<P>
	During elections, it is the people who are the judge. When one 
wants to win a case but does not have one, the thing to do is to 
confuse the people so there is a chance that, on election day, they 
will be confused and put their Xs in the wrong spot. The chance to 
vote in an election comes only every four or five years so one must 
be careful not to make a mistake. That is what the government is 
doing.
<P>
	At least, those who argue in favour of simply abolishing section 
745 are being honest. I do not share their views, but their arguments 
were clear. By contrast, the government's convoluted reasoning is 
anything but. I wish to commend the courage shown by the hon. 
member for Kingston and the Islands, who held his ground 
throughout the debate and who, at report stage yesterday, put 
forward an amendment and voted against the bill, as did the former 
Solicitor General, the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, 
along with a few other colleagues on the Liberal side.
<P>
	One can live with double talk for a while. According to the old 
saying, you can fool some of the people all of the time, you can fool 
all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the 
people all of the time. This is what the Liberal government has 
tried to do since the beginning of its term, believing that it would 
improve the plight of the unemployed, the Canadian prison system, 
the transportation system by privatizing it, in spite of all the 
comments and interventions of the hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans. As you know, his comments 
were right on throughout this whole issue.
<P>
	Some day, the dust will settle and voters, who are not stupid, will 
render their judgment. The hon. member for Prince 
Albert-Churchill River also said that section 745 would be 
improved, since a serial killer, a person who has committed more 
than one crime, at the same time or consecutively, will no longer be 
allowed to invoke this section. This is a step backward. One can 
easily think of cases where a person may commit more than one 
crime in a given situation but still deserve to be released.
<P>
	Take the case of someone who decides to rob a bank with a gun. 
Criminal intent may not be present at the beginning, but the person 
ends up killing two people during the hold-up, according to the 
rules of interpretation of murder. This is a regrettable and  
reprehensible act, and the person will be sentenced. However, if 
this person has not committed any other offence, should he be 
prohibited from invoking section 745, in the same manner as a 
murderer such as the one to whom the hon. member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead referred, who savagely killed and 
raped Isabelle Bolduc in such a sordid manner that it cannot be 
described in this House? There are people who seem beyond 
redemption for society. Committing one sordid murder is often 
worse than killing more than one person.
<P>
	The bill also attempts to establish levels of murders. Is it less 
serious to kill two people, than one? Is it less serious to kill one 
person, than three or four? The particular circumstances of each 
case must be taken into account. We cannot rely on a general rule, 
as the government wants to do.
<P>
	The government wants to pave everything over. This used to be a 
popular thing to do. The City of Quebec did it about 20 years ago. It 
put concrete everywhere in the city. Today, all that concrete has to 
come down in order to restore the beautiful architecture of this city. 
Today, the government is putting another layer of asphalt on 
parking lot 745, hoping that the spring thaw will not do too much 
damage. But we will begin to see the perverse effects of this 
legislation in a year or two. We will see these results in the prisons, 
because, as I said earlier, if we remove any hope for these people, 
we will force them to do desperate things.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Will prison guards and law enforcement officers be safer? Will 
an inmate who knows that he will never get out of prison have no 
qualms about killing a guard or two, because he has no hope left? I 
think that the way we are going about addressing this issue is all 
wrong and that the status quo would have been much better.
<P>
	Not one of the opposition amendments has been accepted. Even 
the amendments put forward by the hon. member for Kingston and 
the Islands were not approved by the government. Was the bill so 
good? It was introduced on June 11, then there was a time 
allocation motion at second reading when the bill was rammed 
through and sent to committee for a day and a half or two days, 
forcing its members to sit night and day almost. Do we have all the 
information we need to say: Yes, we are sure that, beyond a 
reasonable doubt, this bill will improve the situation in Canada? I 
do not think so. This is a bad piece of legislation that will only 
undermine the judicial process in Canada.
<P>
	In conclusion, after indicating that the official opposition will be 
voting against this bill, I want to move an amendment, which reads 
as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``that'' and 
substituting the following therefor: Bill C-45, an act to amend the Criminal Code </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4468"> 4468 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(judicial review of  parole ineligibility) and another Act, be not now read a third time 
but that it be read a third time this day six months hence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, the motion seems in order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I support the 
hoist. In fact I would like to see this bill hoisted forever without a 
glimmer of hope of ever being returned.
<P>
	As I rise to address Bill C-45, I will first comment on two points 
in the intervention by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Justice.
<P>
	He suggested today in his speech that the removal of a parole 
application is barred by the principle of retroactivity. That is really 
what section 745 is. It is a section that allows for a parole 
application for the reduction of the parole ineligibility of a life 
sentence. The legal advice we have received is that the removal of 
section 745 would affect all people who are imprisoned at the 
present time and who would wish to apply. This would deny them 
the right to apply and it would be sound and constitutional.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	I listened carefully to the parliamentary secretary's statements 
and he suggested that members of Parliament, including Reform 
members of Parliament, would use the pain and agony and 
suffering of families who have had their children murdered for the 
purpose of partisan political gain. If I understood him correctly, in 
my humble opinion that statement is beneath contempt.
<P>
	I oppose this piece of legislation which in my mind and that of 
many Canadians demeans the value of a human life. Bill C-45 
clearly demonstrates that the Liberal justice minister and a 
majority of his Liberal colleagues place very little worth on the 
lives of Canadians.
<P>
	I would like each of the members of this House who voted in 
favour of Bill C-45, who voted to allow first degree murderers the 
opportunity for early release, to ask themselves: What value do 
they place on the lives of their brothers and sisters or the lives of 
their children? Do they feel their lives are only worth 15 years? 
Would the joy and excitement which rings in the voices of their 
young children and grandchildren be forgotten after 15 years?
<P>
	I would like the justice minister to ask the Rosenfeldts when they 
attend the justice committee hearings today if they have forgotten 
how their son once smiled and laughed, or if they have forgotten 
how it felt to cradle and comfort their young child.
<P>
	I would like the justice minister to ask the Rosenfeldts how they 
felt the day they learned Daryn was tortured, sexually assaulted and 
killed by the deranged Clifford Olson.
<P>
	I would like the justice minister to ask Mrs. Rosenfeldt how she 
feels every time she is forced to think about Daryn's last hours of 
life, or how she felt on August 12 when Olson exercised his right 
for early release courtesy of the Liberal government.
<P>
	I would like the justice minister to look into the eyes of Mrs. 
Rosenfeldt and explain why he supports the bid for early release of 
her son's killer. I would like the justice minister and all members to 
pause and think about our own children and grandchildren and then 
justify to Mrs. Rosenfeldt why her son's life is worth a meagre 15 
years.
<P>
	The minister is directly responsible for Clifford Olson's August 
12 bid for early release. He is directly accountable to the 
Rosenfeldts and the other 10 families whose children were ripped 
from their lives at the hand of this man.
<P>
	The justice minister is responsible for Clifford Olson's news 
making attempts for early release. The justice minister claimed Bill 
C-45 was not about Clifford Olson; he claimed the bill was not a 
result of Olson's August 12, 1996 date to make application for 
early release. Why then was the minister and his government so 
insistent that the bill be passed before the summer recess? Why did 
the Liberal government ask us and the Bloc not to unduly delay the 
bill?
<P>
	We provided our co-operation despite the fact we do not support 
Bill C-45. We gave our word that we would not block the passage 
of the bill because we did not want to be responsible in any way for 
Olson's bid at early release. We did not want the Rosenfeldts and 
the other families to have to relive the nightmare they have endured 
for the past 15 years.
<P>
	And although Bill C-45 would still give the likes of Olson an 
appeal to a judge, which I find beneath contempt, there is the 
possibility he could be denied a full judge and jury hearing he now 
has under section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The justice minister has had almost three years to introduce Bill 
C-45 but he chose to drag his feet. He chose to introduce Bill C-45 
at the eleventh hour. The justice minister chose to gamble with the 
emotions of the Rosenfeldts and the other 10 families whose 
children were killed by Olson and he lost that gamble. Bill C-45 did 
not pass and Olson once again grabbed the spotlight he so 
predictably seeks.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	For the benefit of the members of this House that do not sit on 
the justice committee, I would like to read the testimony given by 
Sharon Rosenfeldt on June 18:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4469"> 4469 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Emotional upheaval, that was what I felt on February 8, 1996 when I found out 
that Clifford Olson, the killer of my son, had applied for his 15-year judicial review. I 
do realize that the full application cannot be made until August 12, but I know that 
all the paperwork is ready. I have known for the past number of years that it was his 
right to apply and that in all likelihood he  would. Yet for some reason, although my 
mind knew it could be a reality, my heart, emotions and soul denied it. I was afraid to 
think about it, so I put my feelings on hold, something I have grown accustomed to. I 
know how to make certain feelings go numb. I learned how to survive like that.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You see, I have to stay strong because I made a promise to my son as his coffin 
was being lowered into the ground that I would do everything I could as his mom to 
ensure that the person responsible for killing him would be brought to justice. I 
promised I would never leave him until that happened. I know I have to put him to 
rest and that he deserves to be put to rest, but the laws in our country prevent both of 
us from experiencing any peace.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When I learned that Olson had indeed made the application, I was stunned. 
Suddenly many images flashed through my mind. I felt shock but I should not feel 
shock. I felt angry but I should not feel angry. I felt hurt but I should not be hurting. I 
felt betrayed and I felt panic. I could not breathe and I could not stay still. I kept 
pacing from room to room. I wanted to cry. I wanted to scream and I wanted to run 
again-Why do we have to go through this again? I felt weak and vulnerable. I 
cannot lose my dignity again-I went into the family room and took my son's 
picture off the cabinet. I sat down and stared lovingly at him, outlining his face with 
my hands. He looked so perfect. You see, I always have to reconstruct his face in my 
mind because a hammer was used on him. He was beaten beyond recognition. I 
cradled his picture next to my heart and once again made the same promises I had 15 
years earlier.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I got on my knees and I asked God to give me the strength to keep my dignity. 
This is very important to me because after Clifford Olson took my child's life, he 
also took my dignity for a while. I will not let Olson and the system do that again.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The justice minister failed to stop Olson and he failed to protect 
Sharon Rosenfeldt, her family, and the 10 other families whose 
children were murdered by Olson from feeling shock, angry, hurt, 
betrayed, weak, or vulnerable. Instead the justice minister and the 
Liberal government are protecting the rights of Clifford Olson by 
refusing to eliminate section 745 of the Criminal Code. To 
emphasize my statement I would like to quote Mrs. Debbie 
Mahaffy who said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You, this justice committee, and I wager every MP and MPP in Canada, have not 
heard the screams of terror and the cries of their child as she plead with her killers to 
let her live, to let her come home, but everyone has heard the synthetic cries of 
murderers wanting protection in prison for his or her safety, or wanting better food 
or a bigger cell, or no cell mate, or a different cell mate, or release from prison. The 
wants and the wishes of the murderers are even given fiscal priority over the needs of 
victims' families whose members need professional counselling: the mothers, 
fathers, siblings of all ages, grandparents, cousins and friends whose lives are forever 
changed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I cannot begin to imagine the pain these parents experienced 
when they were told their children had been taken from them. I 
attempt to empathize with the families of murder victims, however, 
I cannot fully understand the depth of horror they have gone 
through. To have this agony awakened by a section 745 application 
provided by the Government of Canada is beneath  contempt. Like 
them, I believe the lives of their children are worth much, much 
more than 15 years.
<P>
	Bill C-45 and the justice minister's last ditch attempt to pass a 
bill of this nature clearly shows that the minister does not 
empathize with the families of murder victims and the nightmares 
they endure as a result of the reliving of the heinous crimes 
committed against their children and grandchildren. Instead the 
sympathy is with the murderers of our children, the Olsons and the 
Bernardos.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-45 clearly shows that the letter written to him by Sylvain 
Leduc's grandmother, Teresa McQuaig, had absolutely no impact 
on him. This grandmother's pain and her plea did not change the 
justice minister's support for the early release of first degree 
murderers or his attitude toward justice.
<P>
	Here is what Sylvain's grandmother said in her letter to the 
justice minister:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The most painful thing in life is to live with the knowledge that your child lies 
naked and cold in a morgue. My grandson was in the morgue for three days. I was 
frozen to death. I could not warm up. I was in a hot tub for three days. I could not 
stand it until I knew he had clothes on him.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My heart is a pump that keeps blood flowing through my veins. I have a special 
sacred place situated below my stomach. Some people call this intestinal fortitude, 
but I call it my soul. It is there that love, hate, courage, faith, humour, anger, 
compassion, happiness, conscience and God dwell. The horrible murder of my 
grandson has made my soul very sick. At times it is numb and on other days it is like 
jello. It has lost its desire for living. It does not care much about everyday things any 
more. It has lost its desire for food, sex, enjoyment, travel and books. There is a 
emptiness there, a hole that will never be filled. My grandson left this earth with part 
of it. Horror and fear live there also.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sylvain's murderers have done this to me. When all is quiet I cannot stop my mind 
from imagining the pain and horror Sylvain suffered before dying. I must take 
sleeping medication to dull those horrible pictures. I receive psychiatric care but I 
find it difficult to speak of Sylvain in the past tense and it takes so much energy to get 
there. I find it also hopeless. I feel like a dead flower who has been trampled down. I 
feel like I have been robbed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That forms part of the letter to the justice minister. For the 
justice minister to allow that anguish to keep festering to allow this 
grandmother's wounds to be opened and reopened is wrong. Yet 
that is precisely what Bill C-45 allows. Every time a killer applies 
for a judicial review of his parole the family and society relive the 
horrible memories and live in terror of the day these killers will be 
released early from prison.
<P>
	I would like to share with the House the feelings and memories 
of two other mothers whose children were murdered and who 
presented testimony to the justice committee. The justice minister 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4470"> 4470 </A></B>
<P>
should have been present during Mrs. Boyd's and Mrs. Mahaffy's 
testimony. He should have faced these two grieving mothers and  
publicly explained to them why he places only a value of 15 years 
on the lives of their children and why he is not protecting these 
grieving mothers instead of those who have murdered their 
children.
<P>
	I begin with Darlene Boyd:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In 1982 our 16-year old daughter Laurie was abducted, sexually assaulted 
repeatedly and stabbed 18 times. They did not leave her any dignity. They then 
proceeded to douse her body with gasoline and set her on fire. She was the second 
victim. There was a High River girl. It was the same scenario, but they beat her head 
with a tire iron.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is what we are talking about here. We are talking about people who commit 
heinous crimes like this. I truly believe that the man who took our daughter's life and 
that of the young girl from High River is not and never will be rehabilitation 
material, especially after serving only 15 years in his confined environment. To 
rehabilitate there has to be some spark of remorse, and James Peters did not 
demonstrate any of this. The chance of filtering men like James Peters back into 
society after 15 years through the system we now have is too great a risk. We will be 
digging more graves for innocent people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Truth in sentencing must be addressed here. Our maximum penalty for murder in 
this country is life with no eligibility for parole for at least 25 years. This, however, is 
a lie and the lie is still going on. They are still telling this lie at the time of sentencing. 
Nobody told us about section 745. We found out about it from a newspaperman, not 
from the parole board or the legal system, but from a newspaperman. That demeans 
Laurie's life right there, I would say.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	Section 745, Bill C-45 and the members sitting on that side of 
the House heave demeaned Laurie Boyd's life as they have 
demeaned the life of all Canadians through their continued support 
of a murderer's right to early release. Section 745 provides killers 
with an avenue of early release. This makes a mockery of the term 
life imprisonment.
<P>
	In the absence of the death penalty the only just and fair penalty 
for premeditated first degree murder is life imprisonment. To those 
who say that we do not have a glimmer of hope without section 
745, I would suggest to them that there is a glimmer of hope after 
25 years because that is what the law states. No parole for 25 years. 
They do have an opportunity of parole after serving 25 years.
<P>
	Although Debbie Mahaffy does not support the return of capital 
punishment, she does support the complete repeal of section 745 of 
the Criminal Code. Mrs. Debbie Mahaffy believes section 745 
should be repealed because she believes her daughter Leslie's life 
is worth at the very least life imprisonment without the eligibility 
of parole for 25 years. I quote Mrs. Mahaffy's testimony of June 18 
this year:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To do anything less than that is to say the best is irresponsible, unconscionable and 
does not represent our Canadian values of zero tolerance of violence, but continues to 
erode the sanctity and the preciousness of life and fairness. My family and all victims'  
family members have to recover from a death that is not normal. The bereavement is 
not normal, the grief is not normal, the recovery is not normal, and to build, to redefine, 
to live a new and normal life will take a lifetime, not just 25 years, but the rest of my life.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am talking in absolutes. Twenty five years is absolutely 25 years before 
considering a release back into society, because that is the closest balance our 
government could ever come to my absolute pain and other victims' families' 
absolute pain and slow rehabilitation to a much lesser degree of happiness for the 
rest of my life. This absolute pain is felt by a growing and hourly increase in the 
number of Canadians who feel this absolute loss of joy. Our loved ones are 
absolutely dead. Killers receive nothing more absolute than the guarantee of their 
life in custody for 25 years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Bill C-45 does not provide the absolute guarantee of life in 
custody for at least 25 years. It is precisely for that reason that Bill 
C-45 is being opposed by Debbie Mahaffy, Sharon Rosenfeldt, 
Darlene Boyd, the Canadian Police Association and I would 
suggest a majority of Canadians.
<P>
	On Tuesday of this week the justice minister stood in the 
company of the Canadian Police Association and the chiefs of 
police when he introduced his legislative initiatives in Bill C-55 
with regard to dangerous offenders. In reference to Bill C-55, 
Darlene Boyd said: ``The minister is trying to deflect attention 
from the contentious Bill C-45 by introducing dangerous offender 
legislation. He is trying to take the heat off himself when nothing 
short of a total repeal will do''.
<P>
	The Canadian Police Association and the chiefs of police 
endorsed the justice minister's dangers offender legislation this 
week. And the justice minister capitalized on their support during 
his press conference. I would like to share with the House and with 
Canadians the view of the vice-president of the Canadian Police 
Association on Section 745. In doing so, I would like to point out 
that the Minister of Justice did not broadcast the Canadian Police 
Association or the chiefs of police opposition to Bill C-45.
<P>
	On June 18, 1996 before the justice committee Mr. Grant Obst, 
the vice-president of the Canadian Police Association said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My world entails dealing with victims who have had loved ones yanked from 
them through the most reprehensible crime that can be committed against mankind: 
murder. It's a lifetime of loss to them. It is not a 25-year loss and it is not a 15-year 
loss. There are no judicial reviews or section 745 hearings for victims of murderers 
or for their families. There are no second chances for them. There is nothing to make 
their life whole again. There's no section of the Criminal Code that relieves their 
pain.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I sat through section 745 hearings in my jurisdiction and I have become very 
close with the family of a murder victim. I have seen what these hearings have done 
to them. I have spoken with police officers, my colleagues across this country, and it 
is nearly unanimous that section 745 has to go. That comes from those of us who 
have experience with murder, murderers and victims.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4471"> 4471 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Section 745 creates disgust and distrust in the criminal justice system. To a large 
extent, it is becoming increasingly difficult for me and my colleagues to defend the 
criminal justice system we work for, believe in and want to believe in. Our position 
has been, is and will be that section 745 has to be repealed in its entirety.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Mr. Neil Jessop of the Canadian Chiefs of Police echoed those 
very sentiments, as did Scott Newark, executive director of the 
Canadian Police Association, who on June 18 also said:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Section 745 contradicts fundamentally not only public confidence but the entire 
philosophy of how our criminal justice legal system has grown.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is a bleeding heart mentality of the glimmer of hope advocates 
who contradict the philosophy of our justice system. It is they who 
have made a farce of our penal system by extending rights to 
murderers, rights they deliberately and viciously denied their 
victims.
<P>
	Convicted murderers, rapists and others who take it upon 
themselves to assault or take the life of another human being throw 
all their rights away the minute they launch their deadly attack, all 
their rights except to a fair hearing and humane treatment if 
incarcerated.
<P>
	For the criminal justice system to provide a killer with a 
so-called glimmer of hope or to restore their rights is a further 
injustice to the victim, the victim's family and an offence to 
Canadians. That is the Reform Party's fundamental justice 
philosophy, a philosophy which is shared by thousands if not 
millions of Canadians.
<P>
	Bill C-45 contradicts that philosophy but, more important, Bill 
C-45 demeans the value of a human life. That is why I stand 
opposed to this bill. It is unworthy of support.

Berthier-Montcalm has the floor.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
constituents will be annoyed with you for failing to appreciate this 
riding in the east end of Montreal known for its proximity to the St. 
Lawrence River and its oil companies.
<P>
	I wanted to speak to this bill in support of my colleague's 
amendment, because I want to say that the discourse I have heard 
repeatedly in this House from the colleagues seated geographically 
to my left strains belief, and despite their claims, does not serve 
Canadians.
<P>
	I would also like to speak in support of my colleague's 
amendment because I think that Bill C-45, by its very wording, 
even as presented by the minister, is a bill that  contradicts the very 
essence of the minister's arguments and that also contradicts the 
old reform, which undoubtedly needed to be reviewed, but not 
along these lines.
<P>
	It is important to point out once again, as my colleagues have 
done, that the parole provisions set out in section 745 are not 
frivolous.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Before someone who has committed first or second degree 
murder can be eligible for parole, he must first of all, depending on 
the degree, have served a large part of his sentence, but, above all, 
he must get through three crucial steps. First, a judge must be 
convinced that he can convince a jury; a sort of trial must be held 
before a jury of 12 citizens with witnesses who do not make a 
decision, but who decide whether or not the parole board should 
hear the case and review the sentence.
<P>
	In other words, at the end of a process in which citizens are 
involved as jury members, a process that is certainly not full of 
loopholes, a person who was punished for a first degree or second 
degree crime may be granted parole.
<P>
	The government took advantage of the fact that people in 
western Canada were upset, and understandably so, when a serial 
killer became eligible for parole, and introduced legislation to 
strengthen, in fact to completely transform the conditional release 
process. I would say, and perhaps I am exaggerating, to anyone 
who is not an expert but is able to use his judgment, there is not the 
remotest possibility that Olson, the convicted murderer, would 
have successfully gone through the process leading to parole. It is 
absolutely unthinkable.
<P>
	I intend to prove that by quoting statistics we have heard 
repeatedly, but they bear repeating: as of December 31, 1995, 175 
inmates who were eligible to request a judicial review did not do 
so. Only 76 had filed such a request and 13 of those requests were 
still pending. Of 63 requests processed, 39 led to a reduction in the 
period of ineligibility for parole, and as of December 31, 1995, 
only one offender who benefited from this reduction committed a 
repeat offence when he committed armed robbery.
<P>
	So we must realize that the government has used a situation that 
upset part of the public to act like Zorro coming to the rescue. No 
doubt influenced by Reform Party speeches feeding on intolerance 
and especially on anxiety, the government decided to give in, and it 
did so not unwillingly, because since in Alberta the jury would 
consist of Albertan jurors and in Quebec, Quebec jurors, in that 
distinct society, it is very likely that the same legislation will be 
implemented in widely differing ways.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4472"> 4472 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Why? Because, among other things, this amendment of section 
745 will require the jurors be unanimously in  favour of granting 
parole, while a two thirds agreement was enough in the past. To all 
intents and purposes this clause become unenforceable.
<P>
	We must ask ourselves a question. According to available 
statistics, out of 175 prisoners, 39 have obtained a reduced 
ineligibility period and, as of December 31, one reoffended. This 
goes to show that rehabilitation is possible in prison.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that a number of tools including training 
go into the rehabilitation effort. If individuals who have paid dearly 
for their crimes and cost a great deal of money to keep in prison can 
become valuable members of society, I think they should be given a 
chance. Need I remind this House that first-degree murderers cost 
us $76,000 per year?
<P>
	How can we deprive society of citizens who, having paid their 
debt to society and proven that they were no longer a threat, having 
been screened through a judge, a jury and the parole board, are 
prepared to pull their weight and pay their way?
<P>
	There are, of course, two completely opposite views to this. One 
is centred on punishment, on the pretext of protecting society. How 
can society be protected? How can distressing and murderous 
crimes be prevented from happening again when intolerance is 
promoted left and right?
<P>
	I am no expert, but I see three main categories of crimes. There 
are foul crimes. Then there are what I call sordid crimes, 
outrageous sexual offenses, the kind you can forgive but not forget. 
There are also all sorts of crimes of passion. Under emotional 
strain, people kill for love or because they are overly possessive, 
having thought it through of course. It is a highly reprehensible 
way to solve problems. Prevention in this case does not consist in 
ensuring that these people remain in prison when they have paid 
their dues to society and no longer pose a threat to society. Why? In 
the name of what?
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Whenever we address the issue of prevention, we must also talk 
about values, because keeping inmates in prison for life does not 
guarantee the safety of citizens when the people who are free do not 
share the same values of tolerance and generosity or the belief that 
disputes should not be settled through violence, including violence 
against women, which often leads to crime.
<P>
	We should address this problem and give those who work in 
areas of risk the tools they need. But depriving people who have 
often paid a heavy price of the chance of having their sentences 
reduced is cruel and unnecessary. Instead of protecting society, this 
would create a climate and foster values more likely to generate 
and justify intolerance and violence than the other way around.
<P>
	We must deal with realities. We must also deal with what I called 
the crimes associated with the mafia. This is something else. We 
need suitable tools to deal with this.
<P>
	The Liberal government did not grow in our esteem by 
introducing this amendment, which will make section 745 almost 
impossible to enforce. It may be a little easier to enforce in Quebec, 
but it will still be extremely difficult. That is why, led by our 
colleague from Bellechasse, we in the Bloc Quebecois are asking 
the government to defer passage of this bill, to look at the situation 
a little more closely, to identify the real reason why people do not 
feel safe. Resorting to fearmongering is not the right way to reduce 
violence and reassure people.
<P>
	Furthermore, being able to sentence someone to life without 
parole after going through the usual steps is important, of course. 
As a woman and a mother, I would be the first one to demand that a 
dangerous offender not be paroled, including for his own 
protection. But I know people who are rehabilitated, who are now 
good citizens and who have much more self-control than others 
who have never experienced what they have gone through, which 
will remain present in their minds. It is very important to give those 
who can make a useful contribution to society an opportunity to do 
so.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	A punitive approach whereby the largest possible number of 
people would be imprisoned for life is in total contradiction with 
the creed of the members sitting to my left, the reformers, because 
prisoners cost a lot of money, even though, in some cases, there is 
no solution other than incarceration. As we know, and this is 
particularly true in the case of federal prisons, a person who is 
incarcerated and is not a hardened criminal-and I am not referring 
to dangerous criminals-can be released after two years, and can 
come out a hardened criminal. We have to call a spade a spade.
<P>
	I personally think that when imprisonment for life is advocated, 
in spite of the high costs involved and instead of trying to promote 
preventive measures, we end up with absurd situations. We end up 
with situations such as in Ontario, where the minister responsible 
for security is proposing to build huge prisons in which electronic 
surveillance would be used to reduce costs. This solution was tried 
elsewhere. What happens is that we create enormous jungles where 
prisoners set their own rules. One would rather not think of the 
implications. This is a nightmare that goes beyond one's 
imagination.
<P>
	So, we have to be consistent in our overall approach and be 
careful to avoid giving way to demagogy. We must protect our 
citizens. The little old ladies-and I am one of them-, who go out 
at night, must not be afraid. To be sure, we must try to create a 
society where we can live without fear. But we have to find the 
proper means. And if this means imprisonment only, we will not 
reassure our citizens, because the causes of crime are rooted in  
society itself; they are related to poverty, to criminal networks and 
to the problems experienced by people in their youth, when they do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4473"> 4473 </A></B>
<P>
not get adequate support. Violence also includes conjugal violence, 
which can result in tragedies and which can also destroy children's 
lives.
<P>
	Therefore, I support my colleague. I deeply regret that the 
Minister of Justice has once again yielded to the demagoguery, 
whose goal is not to protect Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to my colleague from the Bloc. I would like to ask her 
a question that I asked witnesses who appeared before the justice 
committee not only on this bill but on other bills that are related in 
topic.
<P>
	It is a question that society wrestles with. What is a fair and just 
penalty for the premeditated taking of an innocent life? What 
should that penalty be? Should it be only three years if after three 
years the individual is completely rehabilitated in the eyes of the 
officials and will never kill again? Should it be 15 years or should it 
be 25 years? That is the question.
<P>
	We must remind ourselves that when we as a society determine 
what that penalty should be, we are placing a value on the life of a 
human being.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	I ask my hon. colleague what she thinks is a fair and just penalty 
for the planned and premeditated murder of an innocent life.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. I should begin by telling you that I am old enough to have 
followed the debates on the death penalty. I was already an adult.
<P>
	What struck me the most was that one of the main reasons the 
Liberal government decided to abolish the death penalty was the 
belief, backed up by studies, that in many cases the death penalty 
itself was not a deterrent to murder. For example, if it was a crime 
of passion, premeditated, but driven by passion, whatever the 
nature of the passion, passion being an integral part of what we are.
<P>
	Your question is a good one, but what do the bill and our 
interventions say? We are not questioning the existing statute, 
which says 25 years, especially since, in certain cases, three 
successive hurdles must be crossed: the judge, the 
jury-peers-and finally, if the jury agrees, the parole board, 
followed by conditions that are rigorous and must be observed, 
failing which the paroled inmate is reincarcerated.
<P>
	It seems to me that for years now people have been creating a 
system that answers I think, or attempted to answer, the question 
you are asking. I would never say three years. In any event, I am 
not qualified to say.
<P>
	What I observe is that this society has for years found ways, 
various ways it is true. Yes, there were some cases, but, in the end, 
should people who are ready to reintegrate society be forced to stay 
in prison because of a few cases? That is why I say that our 
approach must be either punitive or consider that at a certain point, 
the sentence served is sufficient for the offender to be allowed to 
resume his life in society and become part of the community.
<P>
	I think this particular situation, and mind you, I am not an expert, 
I am really your average citizen in this debate, but when we 
consider all the obstacles a person who committed this heinous 
crime must overcome before being granted parole-it seems to me 
that answers your question. Not three years, not six years, but 15 
years minimum. That is a long time.
<P>
	That is the best thing I can suggest but, I repeat, my main 
conclusion is that the death sentence is not a deterrent to crime. So 
yes, society must decide to what extent it makes the offender pay. 
What is it worth to society? Is it worth it to have someone who 
could be a useful citizen after 15 years stay another 10 years in 
prison at a cost of $76,000 annually? Is that what Canadian society 
needs? That is the real question.
<P>
	We think that when someone has gone through three successive 
screenings and has to meet certain conditions, society should give 
him a chance to do his share. That is all we are saying. It would be 
useless and, in fact, counterproductive from the social point of 
view. That is what I wanted to say.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Would all members please direct their 
comments to the Chair, otherwise I get very lonely.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the hon. member.
<P>
	What we are trying to find out here is the price of a human life. 
The member has said that in her mind it is 15 years. If somebody 
plans to murder another person, first degree murder, that person 
would get only 15 years. In my humble opinion that is far too low.
<P>
	When this whole debate took place 25 or 30 years ago in the 
1970s when they changed from capital punishment to a new 
sentence for life, it was life subject to parole after 25 years. That 
was the sentence. That was the trade-off. That is what the 
politicians of the day thought they had agreed to. Life with parole 
after 25 years was the price for taking a life.
<P>
	Where is the truth in sentencing, the deterrent to or the 
punishment for taking a life, instead of capital punishment, which 
obviously the member abhors and says would not be a deterrent? 
There are lot of people who share that point of view, which is fine. 
The replacement was a life for a life. We will not take another  life 
but we will put a person away for life, away from society. ``We do 
not want you to do that. You cannot do that. Your punishment is 
life. However, if there is a chance that you can be rehabilitated, we 
will take 25 years to find out if you have learned your lesson and if 
you can make a contribution to society again''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4474"> 4474 </A></B>
<P>
	Now the person gets another lowered tier opportunity to enter 
society after 15 years. The judge heard the evidence and 
pronounced a sentence. Where is the truth in sentencing when after 
the judge and the jury have declared the punishment for the crime, 
life subject to parole after 25 years, when the criminal after serving 
time in jail can apply to a parole board which had nothing to do 
with the case or the trial, was not there when the evidence was 
given, was not caught up in the emotion of the situation but which 
can then after 15 years decide to lower the sentence or let them out 
earlier?
<P>
	That is an injustice. It is cruel and it is placing the lowest 
possible value on a human life. We need truth in sentencing. If we 
do not favour capital punishment, then a life sentence should mean 
a life sentence and 25 years should mean 25 years. This 15 year 
stuff has to go.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have two points to make in reply. 
First, I know that for 10 years the death sentence was not carried 
out. The average sentence was, at that time, from 12 to 13 years. I 
have heard criminal experts say on various programs that the 
average sentence-I say this to the hon. member who is not 
listening, I am not supposed to say that but I will say it just the 
same-the average sentence when the death sentence still existed 
but was not enforced was not 25 years but around 12 or 13 years. 
Those are the facts.
<P>
	I have every reason to believe the people I heard on these 
programs. They are authorities on the subject and they are reliable. 
I also read some reputable texts. If at the time the actual sentence 
served was 12 or 13 years, the introduction of a sentence of 25 
years with possibility of parole after 15 years did not mean a lighter 
sentence. Considering the system that had existed for 10 years, it 
was more severe, according to my understanding.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	We must call things by their proper names. It seems to me that is 
elementary. My second point is that as soon as we have the 
requisite certainty, and I think that with these three instruments we 
have ways to arrive at that moral certainty, as soon as we have that 
certainty, why leave someone in prison? To keep him from 
committing another crime? We know that is not true. The death 
sentence was no deterrent.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether the hon. member has ever 
experienced the prison environment, from the outside, of course. I 
suggest he do so and find out what it  is like. In many cases, the 
prison environment is a lot like hell. I did not say purgatory, I said 
hell.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to support the motion to hoist this bill. In fact, I agree with 
my colleague from Crowfoot that I would like to hoist that bill right 
out of sight, never to appear back in this House. With any luck 
maybe in the next election we can hoist this social engineer called 
the justice minister. This bill is absolutely aggravating.
<P>
	Colleagues on the other side of the House do not seem to 
understand that we have thousands of Canadians joining Victims of 
Violence because they are not happy. Members opposite do not get 
the message. Mr. Speaker, do you think Canadians enjoy going to 
meetings year after year, gathering together at rallies trying to get 
the message out, if they are happy with this government? No, they 
would like to go home. They would like to have some peace and to 
see things settled.
<P>
	When you enter the House of Commons, you hear day after day 
petition after petition being tabled to abolish section 745. There are 
probably millions of signatures by now not to mention all the 
newspaper articles that have come in, the newspaper ads that have 
been answered. What do we do with section 745? Canadians want it 
abolished.
<P>
	The government does not get the message of the police chiefs 
saying abolish this bill, abolish this section of the Criminal Code. I 
find it hard to understand why a member of the Bloc would sit 
there. They only ones they know how to attack is the Reform 
because we would like to see the people have their way. We would 
like to support the people in seeing to it that some of the things that 
need to happen do indeed happen.
<P>
	We would like to see a referendum on capital punishment but 
then again that might prove that these guys over here are wrong. 
They say they do not want capital punishment. People do not want 
that. The government would not dare have a referendum on it 
because they might be proven wrong. They do not dare have one 
because the polls indicate it is not a good time for that kind of 
referendum. In fact if they were about 15 per cent in the polls, 
which I am sure they will be one of these days, they would not want 
to call an election at that time either.
<P>
	The only thing I can support is a bill that will repeal section 745 
and nothing less. The justice system took a wrong turn back in the 
early 1970s and it has been going in circles ever since. It will 
continue to circle into the future with legislation such as Bill C-45.
<P>
	Suddenly another bill has come out with regard to dangerous 
offenders. Wait a minute, that is going to attract some attention. 
That is what we have been looking for, something to deal with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4475"> 4475 </A></B>
<P>
dangerous offenders. It  appears to be a ploy to get our minds off 
section 745 because they really do not want to get rid of that.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	I do not know how to play the political games that some of the 
experts do, the social engineers such as the justice minister. I have 
to admit they play them well. I would like to see them once present 
something that everybody in the whole House could unanimously 
support, mainly because it supports the will of the people. We are 
really lacking in that area.
<P>
	Back in the early 1970s Jean-Pierre Goyer summed up the 
Liberal government's justice agenda by stating:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have decided to stress the rehabilitation of individuals rather than the 
protection of society.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This philosophy was continued into 1976 when Pierre Trudeau 
and the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce-who is presently with 
us today and at that time was involved with the justice 
department-created section 745. This happened regardless of the 
fact that most Canadians did not want to see the death penalty 
abolished. As for the politicians of today, as with the old line 
parties, it really does not matter what Canadians want. The fact that 
they wanted capital punishment in those days did not make any 
difference, it was ``we know best, we are the politicians''. That is 
called tyranny, just in case anybody forgot the word. It happened 
regardless of what the people wanted.
<P>
	Even with this replacement I feel at that time the sentences were 
clearly defined. In my opinion, they were fair and reasonable but 
they made these changes. The problem is that many of the bleeding 
hearts of our society felt that 25 years was cruel and unusual 
punishment. Therefore, before giving support to abolishing capital 
punishment, they argued that we needed to provide inmates with an 
incentive. If they behaved properly while in prison they could 
apply for a reduction in their parole ineligibility period. This is how 
it became known as the ``faint hope'' clause.
<P>
	The problem is that with all the wheeling and dealing in 
abolishing the death penalty, section 745 allowed the system to 
change for the worse. We see the product of that mistake today. It 
was only back in 1987 that section 745 and its true meaning 
became known.
<P>
	Most Canadians at this point still believed that the penalty for 
first degree murder was life in prison without eligibility for 25 
years. The first judicial review was in Alberta in 1992 when 
William Nichols was in jail for robbery, kidnapping and killing a 
police officer. After the review his sentence was reduced from 25 to 
20 years.
<P>
	Since that first review, and up until April of this year a 
staggering 79 per cent of first degree murderers who had received a 
section 745 hearing have been recommended for some form of 
early release, according to Corrections Canada statistics. By 
December 1995, 63 murderers had  asked for a review. In 50 cases 
juries gave the applicant a chance at early parole. In 33 of those, 
full parole or day parole had been granted. It is obvious from these 
numbers that section 745 has fundamentally changed the sentence 
for first degree murder in Canada. By virtue of its success, section 
745 has made a 15-year sentence for murder a reality for a 
significant number of killers.
<P>
	I had to laugh when I heard the speech from the Bloc asking my 
colleague if he had ever been to a prison. I often wonder if any of 
the people here have been to a prison and visited. How many of you 
have? If you have not I encourage you to do so. You will find out 
these guys are not the type of guys that will come out of a prison 
and then help a little old lady across the street. They are certainly 
not going to sing in the community choir or do anything like that.
<P>
	I do not think they really know the kind of individuals they are 
dealing with. The crime of murder and the pain for the victim have 
been completely forgotten. Punishment is the last thing on the 
legislator's mind today and it is clear that all concessions are being 
made to rehabilitate those that are convicted.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	Traditionally the laws allowed provinces to establish their own 
rules of procedure for judicial hearings. This has resulted in huge 
disparities across Canada in the number of those winning an early 
hearing. For example, as reported in April of this year in Alberta, 
juries heard seven applications and denied five; Ontario juries 
heard eleven but denied only four; B.C. juries faced five killers and 
granted parole eligibility to every one; while in Quebec one has the 
best chance of early parole with twenty-seven of twenty-eight cases 
resulting in a reduction in parole ineligibility.
<P>
	This regional disparity is something that must be recognized. 
The only legislation that would restore everyone to a level playing 
field would be the repeal of section 745. Then everyone would 
serve a full 25-year sentence.
<P>
	It is interesting to listen to those pro-745 groups trying to defend 
the usefulness of section 745. They say that few killers are granted 
early release and only 10 per cent of those who are reoffend.
<P>
	Among the most pathetic reasons given for maintaining section 
745 reviews is that it is giving inmates some hope. By doing that it 
influences them to try to change their lives; or that convicts with 
little hope of release, having nothing to lose, would become far 
more dangerous elements in prison.
<P>
	Another reason is cost related. I have heard a lot of cost figures 
used like $76,000 and other figures. But the figure most used is that 
it costs $45,000 per year to incarcerate a killer, while it only costs 
$10,000 to supervise him as a parolee. If it costs that much, if that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4476"> 4476 </A></B>
<P>
is  too high, we will fix costs. I do not see any problem with that. It 
should not be hard to do at all.
<P>
	Another reason is that it is fair because the creation of the review 
was a political trade-off in Parliament when it abolished the death 
penalty in 1976.
<P>
	The last reason cited is that not all first degree murderers are 
alike and some may very clearly have paid their debt to society 
after 15 years. I hardly think that is the point.
<P>
	It is difficult to fathom that there are those who support section 
745. For example, the vice-president of the Canadian council of 
criminal defence lawyers stated that he did not think section 745 
should be scrapped. He feels that there are some poor offenders 
after a long period of time who are ready to be returned to society.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague from Calgary Northeast pointed out, these 
defence lawyers are activists to maintain a revolving door in the 
penal system because it brings more money to them. We cannot 
overlook the fact that some people count on making a living from 
these kinds of procedures.
<P>
	I have listened to the reasons of the defenders and in my books 
the bottom line is we do not owe these killers any favours by 
allowing them to apply for early release. Even thinking of letting 
them out early is just another way of saying: ``We don't really hold 
you responsible for your actions''.
<P>
	There is already too much leniency in our justice system. To 
those who argue that these criminals can be rehabilitated, let them 
prove this after they have served their full term of 25 years and not 
a moment sooner.
<P>
	I frankly do not care if killers hopes are dimmed by the prospect 
of no early release. We must remember that the victims' families 
have no hope at all of ever seeing their loved ones again. There will 
not be any rehabilitation of the victim who is in the grave. It should 
once and for all be their suffering that is on our minds. That should 
be the thing we think about.
<P>
	The government does not seem to see that all acts of murder in 
the eyes of Canadians are reprehensible. There are no good killers 
or bad killers. A killer should not get special treatment because he 
or she committed merely one murder. This categorization of 
murder by the justice system is an insult to the families of victims 
of one-time killers.
<P>
	By categorizing murderers by the number of victims we are 
adding yet another level of bureaucracy to our over-bureaucratized 
system. We will have one level handling multiple murderers while 
another handles the so-called less harmful one time killers. 
Ultimately this glimmer of hope clause for killers is more 
bureaucratic and more expensive. A first degree murderer will not 
apply directly to a jury but has another hurdle to jump.  Application 
has to be made to a superior court judge, but at what cost?
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-45 contains a royal recommendation which means 
additional money will be expended. The cost for the hearings 
before Bill C-45 was introduced was approximated to be $10 
million by the Canadian police chiefs association. That is based on 
40 murderers applying per year.
<P>
	This cost is sure to rise with the expanded appeal rights now 
available to section 745 applicants in Bill C-45. The applicant can 
appeal to a court of appeal on any determination or decision made 
by the superior court judge and the applicants have the right to 
apply for judicial review more than once.
<P>
	In other words, any judicial decision to reject an application may 
be appealed. The applicants absolute right to a hearing has been 
replaced by an absolute right to apply for a hearing and to launch 
appeals on an unfavourable decision.
<P>
	It is clear to me that this hearing process is still weighed heavily 
in the inmate's favour. The emphasis is still on the offender and his 
behaviour in prison and his rehabilitation possibilities. The 
information about the original crime, the full details and the impact 
of the crime are not presented for consideration.
<P>
	In addition, the murderer will have to be tried by a jury in the 
jurisdiction in which they were convicted. This will mean that they 
will be travelling and there will be extra cost. That will also 
contribute to the risk factor that some killers will have to be 
transported a great distance.
<P>
	In my opinion instead of differentiating between multiple killers 
and single murderers the justice minister, the social engineer of our 
government, could have simplified the system with consecutive 
sentencing. Consecutive sentencing would have at least put a value 
on the taking of a life. For example, Clifford Olson should have 
received 11 life sentences.
<P>
	In our system he killed once and then the second one was free 
and the third one was free and the fourth one was free and so on. I 
think that is pretty sad.
<P>
	The problem is our justice minister does not appear to truly 
understand the significance of murder. For example, during 
question period on June 11 the minister implied that a murderer 
who takes just one life deserves special preference under the law.
<P>
	He told the hon. member for Beaver River that ``if the hon. 
member is not able to distinguish the difference between those who 
take more than one life and those who take one life, I say that she is 
overlooking a fundamental feature''. I cannot fathom how the 
justice minister of this civilized country considers the taking of one 
life not to be as serious as the taking of two. It is just one of his 
many explanations for this bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4477"> 4477 </A></B>
<P>
	I still cannot get over the fact that he had so many years to 
introduce something of this nature and yet he waited until there 
were eight sitting days last June, knowing full well that the bill 
could not properly be debated in that short period of time.
<P>
	Darlene Boyd was quoted as saying the timing of the legislation 
in order to ram it through the House was nothing more than 
cowardly. I certainly agree with her.
<P>
	Once again I see it as another example of this government's 
democracy in action. We have talked about that already today and I 
do not want to get back into that one, mainly because democracy in 
action only exists with this government once about every four 
years, and that is on election day.
<P>
	All and all no one could possibly be satisfied with this feeble 
attempt to remedy this serious loophole in the justice system. 
Section 745, although modified, still exists and the justice minister 
is simply trying to sugar coat it for Canadians. Sprinkle a little 
sugar on it and make the medicine go down.
<P>
	Approximately 600 convicts are soon going to become eligible 
to apply for judicial review. This is a problem that is not going to 
go away. By the end of the century the judicial system could face a 
possibility of one judicial hearing per week.
<P>
	A Calgary <I>Sun</I> editorial said: ``This loophole in the Criminal 
Code that allows killers to apply for early parole was one of the 
most heinous frauds ever perpetrated on voters by the politicians''.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I am proud to say that this politician and those who represent the 
Reform Party want to set the record straight. A life sentence for 
premeditated first degree murder is not about rehabilitation. It is 
about providing a fair and just penalty for the taking of another 
human's life.
<P>
	We do not want to have any part of Bill C-45 and want it 
unequivocally known that all persons convicted of first degree 
murder should be imprisoned for life with no chance of parole or 
conditional release in any form for 25 years, and consequently that 
section 745 of the Criminal Code be repealed. Nothing short of its 
elimination will be acceptable.
<P>
	This ongoing travesty that this section creates must be corrected 
immediately in order to stop future killers from acquiring this same 
right courtesy of section 745. This has the support of 98 per cent of 
the Reform delegates who attended our assembly in June.
<P>
	It has the full support of the Victims of Violence, the Canadian 
Police Association and a high majority of Canadians from coast to 
coast. It has the support of millions of signatures. Abolish section 
745. Quit tinkering with it. We cannot approach the 21st century by  
ignoring the law that has effectively changed the sentence for 
murder in Canada.
<P>
	The old Liberal reasons of economics or prison overcrowding 
will no longer cut it, nor will the bleeding heart philosophy of 
remorse, rehabilitation, deterrence, restitution or any of their 
sentencing excuses, nor will underhanded instructions to offenders 
like those given by Liberal Senator Earl Hastings.
<P>
	He advised criminals, upon approaching a section 745 review, to 
express remorse, apply for legal aid before the 15th year and 
develop good interpersonal relations and communications. 
Develop some leadership skills. Do all the right things when that 
15th year comes and you will be out of here. These are nothing 
more than back door, underhanded, sugar coated baloney. They are 
bleeding hearts and have reasons that just do not cut it.
<P>
	Life means life, nothing more, nothing less. I find it really 
difficult to understand how anybody on that side of the House can 
suggest for a moment that the signatures that are on these petitions 
and that the messages they get from the thousands and thousands of 
people who belong to victims' groups across this country go 
completely unheard. It is all right because we know best. We are 
the government.
<P>
	The sad part about it is that there were 78 individuals who voted 
once upon a time about two years ago from those back benches to 
abolish this section because they knew it was the right thing to do.
<P>
	Now they will turn around a little and support a half measure. I 
heard it called a step in the right direction. I do not think it is a step 
in the right direction. It is a stall. I do not think it has anything to do 
with that. It is simply a matter of where these people in these back 
benches are who voted against section 745.
<P>
	They stood up in this House and said they wanted out. What 
happened to them? Let me guess. Maybe the Prime Minister and 
the champion social engineer said: ``We will change things a little 
and guess what? You are going to support it. If you do not, you will 
be out or punished''.
<P>
	The message is there. Sure enough there was unanimous support 
from that side. The 78 just disappeared. That is too bad.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, although I am sorely tempted to deal with certain of the 
Reform concerns about this bill, I shall restrain myself because I 
feel we are straying rather far from the clause.
<P>
	There could be a debate on everything that has been done, 
everything that is being done, about parole, the pros, the cons and 
so on. Right from the start, I think, it has been said that this bill 
before us may contain things we would have liked to have seen 
changed but that, overall, it is a bill that merits careful 
examination.

<P>
	For those listening to us, who are hearing all of the philosophical 
debates but are not too clear about what the hon. members are to 
vote on, Bill C-45, an act to modify the Criminal Code (judicial 
review of parole ineligibility), it might perhaps be worthwhile to 
understand the context, how it operates, and particularly why we in 
the Bloc Quebecois have some reservations about it.
<P>
	Section 745 of the Criminal Code already covered parole, and 
this is the part the Minister of Justice wants to change with his bill. 
Looking at the summary of this bill, one can see there are three 
major points. It is not a revolutionary change to the entire Criminal 
Code, only to section 745. Three key points are affected by the 
changes.
<P>
	The first removes the right of multiple murderers to apply for 
judicial review. The second introduces judicial screening of 
applications, and the third requires that decisions of juries to 
reduce parole ineligibility periods be unanimous. These are the 
three key points affected by the bill.
<P>
	People need to understand how the system works. First of all, the 
individual ``behind bars'', as they say, who has fulfilled the 
conditions of section 745, applies in writing, according to the 
proposed changes. In the past, this could be a verbal request, but 
now, under subclause 745(1), the person applying for parole under 
section 745 must do so in writing to the appropriate chief justice of 
the province or a judge designated for the purposes of this section. 
That is the first step.
<P>
	The second step is new, and the Bloc Quebecois has reservations 
about it as well, because it is an initial evaluation. The judge, on the 
basis of the written material in his possession, including the 
application, the report provided by the Correctional Service of 
Canada, or any other document submitted by the attorney general 
or the applicant to the judge, will decide whether the applicant has 
shown, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a reasonable 
prospect that the application will succeed.
<P>
	There has already been an evaluation by an appropriate judge, a 
judge familiar with the field, to determine whether there is a 
reasonable prospect that the application will succeed. Our first 
reservation about this is that the judge is not given specific 
guidelines. As far as his evaluation goes, there is no problem. I 
understand that judges have experience in the field, that they will 
evaluate the case, that they will weigh the facts and make an 
informed decision, but I would have liked to have seen something 
clearer, or this part dropped altogether.
<P>
	That is the second stage of the process. After written application 
is made, a judge evaluates it and decides whether or not to 
designate another judge to empanel a jury. Naturally, if the judge 
who examines the application concludes that, on the face of it, 
there is not a reasonable  prospect that a properly instructed jury 
would approve the application, he will obviously reject it.
<P>
	There are two possibilities, according to the amendment: either 
that the inmate will come before a judge in two years, or that the 
inmate will not be entitled to present himself for a specified 
number of years, because his record is not appropriate for parole, or 
no information is given. Then the law calls for the inmate to be 
allowed to make another application in two years.
<P>
	Under 745 (5), if the judge says yes, deciding that the applicant 
has shown that there is a reasonable prospect that the application 
will succeed, the chief justice instructs a judge of the superior court 
of criminal jurisdiction to empanel a jury to hear the application.
<P>
	The third step is another evaluation, this time before a twelve 
member jury. The jury has a whole series of criteria to apply. I have 
absolutely nothing to say on the criteria set by the minister; they 
are in keeping with jurisprudence and with what is being done at 
present. I have absolutely no comments to make on this.
<P>
	Where I do have something to add, where we in the Bloc see an 
obstacle, is where it is stated in 745.3, subsection 3: ``The jury 
hearing an application under subsection (1) may determine that the 
applicant's number of years of imprisonment without eligibility for 
parole ought to be reduced. The determination to reduce the 
number of years must be by unanimous vote''. This is what bothers 
the Bloc Quebecois, the unanimity of 12 persons. Twelve people 
will have the file that has already been examined by a judge. The 
judge has said ``Yes, there is a reasonable possibility of the 
applicant's being able to convince a jury, so we will move it to a 
jury''. The jury of 12 examines all this and has to reach a 
unanimous conclusion. That will be very hard.
<P>
	Finally, if the government had decided that section 745 ought to 
be abolished, that ought to have been done, but without imposing 
excessive criteria, because it is excessive to require unanimity on a 
case of this kind.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are telling me I have only two minutes left, but 
I thought I was entitled to 20 minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> At 5.30 p.m., we will proceed to 
consideration of Private Members' Business.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> In that case, I will give a very quick 
summary, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	The main aspect of this bill, an aspect to which we object, is 
unanimity, and we also object to the government's rushing to get 
this bill through the House. That is why my colleague, the hon. 
member for Bellechasse, tabled an amendment seeking an 
additional six months so that we can examine and study this bill 
and perhaps improve it. The government has shown undue haste, 
although this is a bill that deserves particular consideration.
<P>

	The House resumed from May 16 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-201, an act to amend the Criminal Code (operation 
while impaired), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on February 29 this year I seconded Bill C-201, 
introduced by my hon. colleague from Prince George-Bulkley 
Valley, and I would like to thank him at this time for the 
opportunity to speak to and support the bill.
<P>
	This is the second reading of the bill. It has been deemed votable 
by a committee of the House. The bill essentially would amend 
section 255(3) of the Criminal Code of Canada to impose a 
minimum seven year sentence for a person convicted of the crime 
of impaired driving causing death.
<P>
	This is a piece of legislation known as a private member's bill 
and it really deserves the support of every person in the House. I 
really and sincerely hope the Prime Minister will allow a free vote 
on this and that every member of the House will look at this piece 
of legislation and throw their political affiliation aside and listen to 
the debate and hopefully support it.
<P>
	Before I go into many of the reasons here, I would like members 
to imagine for a moment what we must do in order to seriously 
consider drunk driving as a very serious type of behaviour, 
something we should not tolerate in our society.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	We have done a lot of educating of members of the public to 
make them aware that they should not drive while impaired and 
much of that education has been taken to heart, but education in 
and of itself does not do it all. Other signals must be sent to society 
to illustrate how serious this is, something that no one should ever 
do, something akin to manslaughter. To take the life of someone 
while impaired is unacceptable.
<P>
	This bill has the potential to save lives, much more potential than 
some of the other legislation that the justice department has 
brought down. I would like to make the point that good laws and 
punishment do not necessarily make people good but they do 
restrain evil, unacceptable behaviour and that is why this bill 
should be supported.
<P>
	A drunk driver going down the highway is very much like a hand 
grenade lying on a playground with a timing device that has an 
arbitrary time on it. This hand grenade has had the pin pulled but 
the timing device as to when it will explode is completely 
unknown. We do not know if there is going to be someone in that 
playground when it goes off or maybe it will explode in the middle 
of the night when there is no one there. Maybe it will go off when 
there are a lot of people around.
<P>
	That is what it is like when a drunk driver is going down a 
highway unable to completely control his vehicle and react 
appropriately to something that may happen very quickly. We 
would not tolerate someone placing a hand grenade in a playground 
not knowing when it would go off anymore than we should tolerate 
a drunk driver going down the highway. That is why this bill is 
really important.
<P>
	Here are some of the reasons why I second this important piece 
of legislation in addition to what I have just said. Three times the 
number of people are killed by drunk drivers than are murdered. 
That is a lot of people in comparison to the number of murders. 
Even though the Criminal Code provides a maximum penalty of 14 
years for drunk driving for killing someone with his car, the actual 
sentences are only one to four years. I ask members of this House is 
that all a person's life is worth?
<P>
	We have to send a signal through our courts to people in society 
that this is very serious and they should obey the law. Such low 
sentences do not provide a meaningful deterrent to those who 
continue to drive while drunk, while out of their minds. Such low 
sentences do not reflect the public's concern for this type of crime. 
Impaired drivers are responsible for 90 per cent of the fatal car 
crashes in which they are involved. That is an unacceptably high 
level.
<P>
	One of the main reasons the carnage on our highways does not 
stop is the present leniency of our courts. Imposing a minimum 
sentence of seven years for killing a person while driving drunk 
will send the strongest of messages that the lethal consequences of 
driving while impaired will not be tolerated by society.
<P>
	Here are some other facts which I think need to be repeated. 
Forty to seventy per cent of impaired drivers have had prior alcohol 
related offences. They know they have a problem. It takes between 
200 to 2,000 incidents of driving while impaired to produce one 
arrest, not a conviction, just an arrest. And 57 per cent of those 
charged had at least one similar offence in the previous five years. 
Impaired driving charges are dismissed or reduced in 40 per cent of 
cases. Our courts need to deal more seriously with these things.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-201 has had the support of many organizations. Here are 
some of them: Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, Canadian Youth

<P>
	I understand there has been material circulating in the 
government benches disputing the support of Mothers Against 
Drunk Drivers, MADD Canada. Let me quote from two letters sent 
to the hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley. On March 
20, 1996, Mr. Jim Wideman, executive director of MADD Canada 
wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On behalf of the Board of Directors of MADD Canada, I would like to reaffirm 
our support of Private Member's Bill C-201. I am aware that other correspondence 
has been made to Mr. Rock's office. Let me reiterate that the National Board of 
MADD Canada, our Chapters and Members wholeheartedly support Bill C-201.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On May 16, 1996 Jane Meldrum, president of Mothers Against 
Drunk Drivers Canada, wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is my understanding that during the last hour of debate that [the hon. member

of this person as an individual and not of that of the Board. This letter was not 
approved by the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors and was not 
approved to be sent on MADD Canada letterhead. This individual has been advised 
of this and has been requested to retract his statement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to now respond to a couple of other criticisms of this 
bill in the short time I have remaining.
<P>
	We have heard that some Liberal backbench MPs oppose this 
amendment because the minimum sentence would be inconsistent 
with the sentencing provisions of other sections of the Criminal 
Code, in particular section 220, criminal negligence causing death.
<P>
	While we thank our hon. colleagues for pointing this out, the 
solution is not to oppose this bill but to propose an amendment or 
introduce another bill that would make sentencing provisions 
consistent.
<P>
	We heard another concern that the mandatory minimum sentence 
might discourage accused drunk driver killers from pleading guilty 
and thereby typing up more time in the courts and causing more 
pain for the families of the victims. One of the most important 
principles of our criminal justice system is that the punishment 
must fit the crime. It is clear that drunk drivers who kill are quite 
literally getting away with murder.
<P>
	If the average sentence for those convicted of impaired driving 
causing death was half the maximum sentence of 14 years, 
permitted under section 255(3), I would say let us leave well 
enough alone, but this is not the case. The average sentence for 
impaired driving causing death ranges between one to four years. I 
think the majority of Canadians would agree with me that this 
punishment does not fit the crime.
<P>
	As for the rights and interests of the victim's family, the most 
important issue for them is to ensure there is a sense of closure to 
the case and, above all else, that the sentence equates with real 
<P>
justice. The victim's family also needs to know that the death of 
their loved one served some purpose, that the punishment of the 
crime will in some way prevent someone else's death. This is what 
a mandatory minimum sentence will do. This is why thousands of 
Canadians have told us to support this bill.
<P>
	Finally, our critics tell us that the minimum sentence of seven 
years for killing someone will be challenged under the charter of 
rights and freedoms because it is cruel and unusual punishment. If 
anyone really thinks that this sentence is cruel and unusual 
punishment, I would ask them to conduct a poll of all the families 
that have had a loved one killed by a drunk driver and ask them 
what they think.
<P>
	While there are lawyers out there who would love to make some 
money bringing forward a charter challenge, and while the Liberal 
government is even willing to pay the lawyer to bring the case 
forward under the reinstituted court challenges program, and while 
there are judges who might agree with their claim regarding seven 
years in jail for impaired driving causing death, the government 
will lose the case in the most important court, the public opinion of 
this land.
<P>
	Frankly, I believe we need to support this bill. I think I have put 
forth some good arguments and hopefully all members will be open 
to it.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to split my time with the member for Sarnia-Lambton 
who also supports this bill.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My colleague may not realize that the 
debate ends at 6.11 p.m., so there should be time for both to speak. 
I am not sure that on a private member's bill unless except by 
unanimous consent we can split 10 minutes into five and five, but if 
there is unanimous consent we certainly can. Perhaps the member 
will indicate his position. This time will not count against him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> I would request that unanimous consent be given 
then.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Very well. Is there unanimous consent to 
split the 10 minutes into two parts?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That will be five and five.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, impaired drivers kill innocent 
Canadians. No one in the House would dispute that fact which is so 
obvious. The question therefore is to what extent do our laws deter 
the impaired driver from getting behind the wheel of a car. I would 
like to contribute my perspective on this matter highlighting  some 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4481"> 4481 </A></B>
<P>
of my firsthand experience which I gained as a police officer who 
served in Calgary for 22 years.
<P>
	First I can say with assurance that the current Criminal Code 
section 255(3) penalty for impaired driving causing death is not 
tough enough. When I say that it is not tough enough, I mean that 
the penalty is by no means an effective deterrent. I would argue that 
many lives would be saved if the penalty for impaired driving were 
increased, that is, through increased deterrence.
<P>
	For my soft on crime friends, let me be precise as to say that the 
philosophy and definition of deterrence is just that, deterrence. The 
key instruments of deterrence are the certainty and severity of 
punishment. Deterrence prevents crime and saves lives. When 
potential offenders, considering the risks and severity of 
punishment, decide to commit fewer crimes, logically the number 
of people willing to commit crimes decreases as the danger of 
punishment increases.
<P>
	Consequently the Criminal Code amendment presented today by 
my colleague from Prince George-Bulkley Valley is not only 
good legislation but one which is desperately needed by frontline 
police officers, attorneys general and prosecutors for the crown to 
deter drunk drivers everywhere.
<P>
	At present section 255 of the Criminal Code provides a 14-year 
maximum penalty for impaired driving causing death. The 
legislation proposed today would require a judge to prescribe a 
minimum seven year penitentiary sentence to any individual 
convicted of drunk driving causing the death of a human being.
<P>
	I can relate a situation that happened in my own riding not too 
long ago where an impaired driver ran over a seven year old boy, 
dragged him down the road. The boy died. The driver looked at him 
laying on the road, got back into his car and drove away. The court 
case finally came about and the individual driving that car got only 
nine months. That is totally insufficient. It shows that the 
sentencing in Canada is far too lenient for impaired drivers.
<P>
	Let me also say however that the criminal justice system in 
Canada is at a crossroads. Two competing visions of the future 
direction of the criminal justice system exist. One view which is 
promoted by socialists argues that the failure of the criminal justice 
system to stem the increase in the long term trend of crime can be 
remedied through the welfare state criminology. This view 
espouses the belief that the solution to criminal behaviour is to 
redirect resources away from the punishment of crime toward 
alternative measures and jailing.
<P>
	With alternative measures, just exactly what is going to happen 
now with that provision on the books to an impaired driver and one 
that may even kill someone? If an impaired driver will receive nine 
months now for killing someone, what are alternative measures 
going to do? They argue that crime is a product of social conditions 
and that the most effective remedy is for the state to intervene 
through programs such as stepped up welfare payments and other 
tax funded social experiments.
<P>
	Thirty years after the first programs of Liberal criminology and 
penology were introduced, violent crime has increased by 400 per 
cent. I cannot see why impaired driving causing death should not 
be considered a violent crime. Property crimes have increased by 
500 per cent. And impaired drivers continue to maim and kill 
innocent Canadians. For this reason, it is time to change the course 
of our criminal justice system back toward a system that deters 
criminal conduct through rigid sentencing guidelines for serious 
crime. Impaired driving causing death certainly falls into this 
category.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	If there is any doubt as to why this type of legislation is needed, 
consider the lenient sentences handed down by soft on crime 
judges. Let us look across the country. Regina v. Lewis, New 
Brunswick 1992: The accused killed a woman after crossing the 
centre line of the highway. The accused received a one-year 
sentence. Regina v. McLean, Ontario 1990: The accused struck a 
motorcycle and killed its rider. McLean received only a two-year 
sentence. Regina v. Elkas, Ontario 1990: Elkas rear ended a car and 
killed two people. Even though the accused had a lengthy criminal 
record, the judge ordered only a four-year sentence.
<P>
	Let us look at some other facts. In 1994, 87,838 people were 
charged with impaired driving. Also in 1994, 1,414 people were 
killed as a result of impaired driving, which is three times higher 
than deaths resulting from murder. Ninety per cent of impaired 
drivers are primarily responsible for fatal crashes in which they are 
involved. Out of the 1,315 fatalities in 1993 in Ontario, 565 were 
alcohol related. The statistics go on and on and on.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that every member in this House has an 
opportunity to take some action on this type of crime. I would urge 
them to vote in favour of this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is my pleasure to speak in favour of Bill C-201, which as we have 
heard, is an amendment to section 255(3) of the Criminal Code 
dealing with impaired drivers.
<P>
	I do not want to go into the background. I know a lot has been 
said on this. There has been a lot of talk of victims. I think 
everyone in this room and probably people who are watching these 
proceedings, we all know of someone or some family who has been 
touched by this.
<P>
	I will deal with a particular part of this bill. I have heard the 
criticism that any minimum sentence fetters the discretion of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4482"> 4482 </A></B>
<P>
judiciary. As a general rule, I believe that is true. There is no 
question that we do not want to fetter the discretion of the judiciary.
<P>
	Judges have to deal with all the facts. They have to consider all 
the evidence and then they will pass a sentence. That is why in our 
system of laws, as a rule we do not impose a minimum sentence. 
We impose a maximum. In the case of section 255 it is 14 years. 
However, we are dealing with the exception here. There are always 
exceptions. In law there is the old expression of exceptions to the 
rule.
<P>
	The hon. member has struck on one topic that has become a 
problem in this country: Too many people are careening around on 
the roads in an impaired state. According to the most recent 
statistics, approximately 88,000 people were charged with 
impaired driving. More important, more than 1,400 people in 1994 
lost their lives as a result of impaired driving. To me the telling 
statistic is that this is three times higher than the murder rate in 
terms of victims.
<P>
	The argument could be made that we do not have a minimum 
sentence for murder so why would we want to impose one on 
impaired driving? The answer is quite simple. We recognize that 
murders are committed for various reasons. Some are premeditated 
but more often they are crimes of passion; they are done on the spur 
of the moment.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	Impaired driving involves two steps. One is putting yourself into 
the position of being impaired and that is not an act of passion. That 
is not an act that happens on the spur of the moment. That is 
something that in most cases people can control. I do acknowledge 
there are people in our society who have addiction problems, but 
people have some degree of choice in whether or not they will 
drink. They ought to realize before they start drinking that they 
have a vehicle somewhere in the neighbourhood.
<P>
	Once people get into that impaired state they lose all judgment. 
As a result we see there is a problem on the roads and highways in 
this country. In 1994 it caused 1,400 people to be killed, not by a 
crime of passion, not by somebody who got into a state on the spur 
of the moment, but they were killed by someone who ought not to 
have been behind the wheel. As I said earlier, we all know someone 
who has personally been affected by an impaired driver.
<P>
	There were 1,400 people in 1994, three times the number of 
people who were murdered, acts of passion, being killed. It is a 
problem. We do move to address problems in this House. We are 
required and it is our duty to address problems. I commend the 
member for moving to do it.
<P>
	I want to deal with the whole question of minimum sentencing. 
Whether seven years is appropriate or not, I am not certain. 
Whether two years is appropriate or not,  I am not certain. But this 
is a situation that we have to deal with. This is a signal.
<P>
	There are those who suggest that we could use the money we are 
going to spend incarcerating people on an education campaign. 
Education campaigns on this have been going provincially for 
years. There are road checks, spot checks, the RIDE program in 
Ontario. They have reduced it some. Every year there are various 
ways of dealing with it. Some people are either immune to it or not 
affected by the education programs, whichever. The end result is 
we have to take a more extraordinary measure to tell people they 
have a choice as to whether they are going to drink. We have to tell 
people to think about it before they climb into that car if they have 
had a drink because they are the risk on the road.
<P>
	The time has arrived for this place to send this bill to committee 
and let the committee decide whether seven years is too severe, or 
maybe three years is more appropriate, perhaps one year. In 
principle, without any equivocation I believe that we have to look 
at a minimum sentence.
<P>
	This is not saying to the judiciary that we want to fetter their 
discretion. This is saying to the judiciary that we believe this is an 
extraordinary circumstance and we believe we have to tell them 
what the parameters are at the bottom and at the top rather than 
saying just what the top is.
<P>
	People in this country want this. This is not falling into a trap. It 
is an exception to the rule. It is an exception to our normal rules of 
jurisprudence but this is an exceptional problem and sometimes we 
must take extraordinary measures.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first on a question of timing, I am going to try very hard to leave a 
little time for my colleague the member for Skeena to say a few 
words. However if we fail, we would like to receive a one-minute 
warning from you, Sir, at five minutes after the hour so that there 
are five minutes left for the sponsor of this bill, the member for 
Prince George-Bulkley Valley.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak in support of Bill C-201, an 
act to amend the Criminal Code in the case of impaired driving 
causing death. This is a bill that Canada really needs. It is long 
overdue and it deserves the support of members from both sides of 
the House.
<P>
	I respectfully ask that all members dispense with partisan beliefs 
in order to pass this bill. With this in mind for the remainder of my 
intervention in this matter, I will refrain from any political 
implications of any type. All I ask in return is for hon. colleagues 
on both sides of the House to do the same so that we can avoid the 
usual political sniping that seems to plague our deliberations.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4483"> 4483 </A></B>
<P>
	I firmly believe that the subject before us now transcends 
political differences and should unite us in a common cause. This 
is not a bill reflective of any given political party. It is a bill that 
seeks only to protect Canadians. Nothing more and certainly 
nothing less is asked for.
<P>
	We have all heard the horror stories associated with driving 
while impaired accidents. They are called DWI. The yearly carnage 
which is altogether senseless and tragic must end. I do not delude 
myself into believing that the passage of this bill will entirely stop 
people from dying in DWI accidents. However, it will go a long 
way to giving the family and friends of victims some semblance of 
closure and the idea that justice was served.
<P>
	This bill's greatest value may also be in its deterrent value to 
new drivers. They are the ones who can be educated on the perils of 
driving while impaired whereas those who are repeat offenders 
would only be stopped by the punitive sanction of a minimum 
seven-year sentence.
<P>
	Organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving and Ontario 
Students Against Impaired Driving will say that the status quo in 
sentencing can no longer be tolerated. They have seen too many 
tragedies and buried too many loved ones.
<P>
	We have all heard the stories. Each member in this House has 
one and I will share yet another. His name was David Peters, a local 
boy, 25 years of age who was somebody's son, brother and friend. 
On June 24, 1989 he drove his motorcycle down Albion Road, 
south from where we are. A car travelling at a high rate of speed 
crossed the dividing line and hit him head on. He was killed 
instantly and the driver, as well as the passengers in the other 
vehicle, were taken to hospital with various injuries.
<P>
	The driver was subsequently charged with impaired driving 
causing death. In the end, however, he walked free and received no 
custodial sentence. David Peters family and friends were crushed. 
A life had been extinguished and they deserved at the very least to 
see the perpetrator punished. Still, they resigned themselves to the 
fact that this cruel scenario plays itself out time and time again 
every single year.
<P>
	It has been said before by the member for Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley but it deserves to be said again. Victims 
should not pay the penalty for impaired driving. Here are some 
government statistics that members heard a little of already to show 
how much of a problem this has been.
<P>
	A 1992 Ottawa <I>Sun</I> editorial pointed out that over 13,000 people 
in that one year were killed or injured because someone drove 
while impaired. In 1994, 1,414 people were killed as a result of 
impaired driving. This is roughly three times the number of people 
murdered in Canada but one could argue that it is essentially the 
same  thing. It is murder. Think about that number, 1,414 people.
<P>
	If this Chamber were made four times larger, it still would not 
hold all those people. In 1993, of the 1,315 people who died on 
Ontario roads, 565 were alcohol related deaths. Sentencing for this 
crime, especially if it involves a fatality, is too lenient. That is the 
rationale behind this bill.
<P>
	There is no ulterior motive save to bring justice to the families of 
victims and the sentencing of offenders.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to close on that note and again urge members to put 
aside politics and vote, please, in support of this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief 
because I know my colleague from Prince George-Bulkley Valley 
would like to say a few words in closing the debate.
<P>
	I know my friend from Prince George-Bulkley Valley brought 
this bill forward in response to a very horrific accident which 
happened in his riding. It had very clear implications for my riding 
because a father and his two children were killed in an accident by 
a drunk driver who had previously been charged twice for the same 
offence.
<P>
	This victim, Mr. Jim Ciccone, lived in Prince Rupert for many 
years. The victims of this particular accident are not just Mr. 
Ciccone's family, relatives and friends. It is the whole community 
of Prince Rupert because he and his family were well established in 
that community. There were very valuable members of the 
community, well known and well regarded. I cannot communicate 
how important this family was to the community.
<P>
	In one thoughtless evening of drinking and driving three 
members of that family were killed. The people of Prince Rupert 
and I am sure the surviving members of the Ciccone family waited 
to hear what would happen as a result of this. When the sentence 
was announced it was three and a half years, just a little more than 
one year for each life that was taken by an individual who had a 
record of disregarding the law and driving while impaired.
<P>
	What do we say to Mr. Ciccone's family when that kind of a 
sentence is given? Is that what their lives were worth? The question 
we have before us today is, are we in the House actually prepared to 
do something about this or are we just going to continue to talk 
about it while these kinds of horrific accidents take place and lives 
are lost?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley will now close the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to close the debate on 
the second reading stage of Bill C-201.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4484"> 4484 </A></B>
<P>
	I close the debate on Bill C-201 on behalf of all the victims 
of drunk drivers and on behalf of the families of victims who have 
died at the hands of a drunk driver and, unfortunately, on behalf 
of people who will in the future become the victims of drunk 
drivers.
<P>
	Impaired driving is an issue which touches every single region of 
our society. I would hazard to say that there is no one in the House 
tonight who does not know of someone, a family, a relative who 
has not been a victim of impaired driving. This issue touches 
everyone.
<P>
	Many provinces in Canada have taken positive steps to deal with 
drunk driving. They have taken some very positive steps and we are 
happy to see that. But there have been no steps made at the federal 
level, no changes in the Criminal Code that would send a message 
out to the people of Canada that the Parliament of Canada takes 
impaired driving seriously, that reflects a zero tolerance toward 
impaired driving. The time to take that step is now with the passing 
of this bill.
<P>
	Since introducing Bill C-201 in excess of 25,000 signatures have 
come into this Parliament and to the office of the Minister of 
Justice supporting this bill.
<P>
	I did a walkabout on Sparks Street yesterday and talked to over 
20 people. The media was there. We wanted to see what the person 
in the street had to say about it. There was 100 per cent support for 
this bill.
<P>
	The Liberals know that this bill is supported by millions of 
Canadians who are fed up with the weak manner in which drunk 
drivers who kill are treated in the courts in this country.
<P>
	This bill is also supported by numerous anti-drunk driving 
associations across the country, most notably MADD Canada, 
Canadian Students Against Impaired Driving, Ontario Students 
Against Impaired Driving, the Nepean Association Against Drunk 
Driving. This bill deserves the attention of the Liberal government.
<P>
	As was pointed out earlier, and I am really saddened by the 
action on behalf of the government, but yesterday, purposely in this 
House, there was an attempt at circulating disinformation among 
the Liberal members. That was talked about by those who spoke 
earlier. The disinformation attempted to convey the message to 
Liberal members that MADD Canada did not support this bill.
<P>
	I am absolutely ashamed of the people responsible over there 
who sent out this letter in a deliberate attempt to misinform the 
members and sabotage this bill on the very eve of the vote. They 
clearly knew, because we dealt with this in the spring, that MADD 
Canada's association with 110,000 members across this country, 
were 100 per cent in favour of supporting this bill. However, 
because they knew that this bill has broad support among the 
Liberal members, they attempted, through a disinformation 
program, to sabotage this bill. I am ashamed of that and ashamed 
for them.
<P>
	Bill C-201 is not the magic bullet to eliminate impaired driving 
but it is an important first step. Other measures need to be pursued 
in order to stop this crime. Let us get this bill to the justice 
committee so that witnesses can be called and this bill can be 
discussed and receive the attention it deserves.
<P>
	In closing, I would say to every Liberal member who is thinking 
about voting against this bill, if there are any, to ask yourself the 
question: Can you face the family of a victim of an impaired driver 
and tell them why you will not support this bill? I ask them to ask 
themselves that question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, conforming to an order made 
earlier today, the motion is deemed to have been put and a recorded 
division deemed demanded and deferred until Tuesday, September 
24, 1996 at the expiry of the time provided for government orders.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It being 6.12 p.m., this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.12 p.m.)
