Canada Elections Act to allow the registration of political 
parties by the chief electoral officer only when the party 
nominates candidates in at least seven provinces that have an 
aggregate of at least 50 per cent of the population of all the 
provinces and in at least half of the electoral district in each of

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure today to present to the House of Commons pursuant 
to Standing Order 36 a petition on behalf of many of my 
constituents as well as others who reside in Saskatchewan. 
These petitioners are interested in seeing Bill C-91 repealed 
because of the dramatic effect it has had on the price of 
prescription drugs in Canada.
<P>
	In essence, Bill C-91 has driven up the price of prescription 
drugs by over 120 per cent in the last five years. This has been a 
severe problem financially for those people who require 
prescription drugs. It also has hindered provincial governments 
across the country in terms of restricting and reducing the drug 
plans they have.
<P>
	The Canadians from Saskatchewan who have signed this 
reside in Semans, Duval, Nokomis, Earl Grey, Assiniboia, 
Craven, Southey, Cupar and Strasbourg to name a few of the 
communities.
<P>
	I summarize by saying they are begging and requesting this 
Parliament to repeal Bill C-91, the drug patent legislation.

Question No. 10-<B>Mr. Simmons:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What action, if any, has the Department of Fisheries and Oceans taken to 
resolve the many long-standing deficiencies- in management practices of the 
fishing vessel insurance plan, including a rapidly declining insurance base, rising 
deficits, and declining efficiency, the failure to improve client service and the 
process for reviewing and approving claims, the plan's deteriorating 
performance, and the Department's lack of corrective action, as raised by the 
1992 Auditor General's report?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> The 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans has taken a number of steps 
to address concerns raised in the 1992 Auditor General's report.
<P>
	In February 1993, a general manager at the executive level 
was appointed for the program with headquarters in St. John's, 
Newfoundland. This concentration of full line autority for 
managing program resources across all regions has streamlined 
decision making and reduced opportunities for diverting funds 
away from the program. The consolidation of two regional 
offices and a reduction of staff complement through attrition has 
resulted in increased efficiency at decreased costs.
<P>
	Steps have been taken to ensure the implementation of a 
national FVIP data base by the first quarter of fiscal year 
1993-94. This will provide needed management information for 
ensuring more efficient administration, establishing appropriate 
rate structures, maximizing revenue and setting national 
standards in a number of areas.
<P>
	A training program developed for field officers on vessel 
appraisals and claims adjustments is now in progress. The first 
two week session began on February 28, 1994 and the second 
two week session started March 12, 1994. Training will also be 
provided as part of the data base implementation.
<P>
	Updated procedures for the review and approval of claims 
now ensure that claims are forwarded to head office with proper 
documentation. As a result, HQ approval has been reduced to 
one week thus improving overall service to clients.
<P>
	A report has been prepared assessing the reasons for the 
declining insurance base and recommending measures to 
reverse the trend. This report is now being analyzed.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Since today is the final

House will go through the usual procedure to consider and 
dispose of the supply bills.
<P>
	In view of recent practices do hon. members agree that these 
bills be distributed now?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, indeed we, the Official 
Opposition, feel that it is important to make this House and the 
government aware of the need to worry, and not just talk, about 
employment in Canada.
<P>
	Four heavyweight ministers-I do not intend to put them on a 
diet -participated in the last G-7 conference. We are waiting 
for them to inform us of the innovative solutions they learned at 
that conference to help Canada improve the tragic situation of 
unemployment here.
<P>
	I must admit however that I am anxious to see what these 
senior ministers will propose, considering that when the 
previous crisis occurred, the G-7 advocated drastic measures to 
control inflation and Canada subscribed to those, so much so in 
fact that it tried to show the way and applied a solution whose 
effects were worse than the problem.
<P>
	In fact, it seems to me that the federal government must ask 
itself what kind of policy would stimulate employment, as 
Quebec has done perhaps because it has been experiencing 
serious unemployment problems for a long time. Quite often 
countries, including G-7 members and those which are most 
easily and naturally prosperous because they have been wealthy 
for a long time, think that employment is what is left once 
everything else has been looked after. So the government looks 
of course after problems such as inflation and the deficit, which 
is largely the result of its anti-inflationary policies, and what is 
left in the end is the employment situation.
<P>
	Then nice speeches are made to say how sorry the government 
is to learn of the plight of the poor ordinary citizen who is in real 
trouble, who has no security, and who is deprived of what little 
hope he may have had of at least getting a minimum income for a 
while through UI benefits. So the government makes nice 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2583"> 2583 </A></B>
<P>
speeches to the effect that it is concerned about employment, 
and it gets elected by pledging to look after the problem but, in 
fact, it is essentially business as usual.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to tell members of this House- 
even though their previous income level was not necessarily the 
same-that very few Canadians and Quebecers enjoy the same 
peace of mind as we do. Indeed, many of them live in a great 
state of insecurity which has a profound influence on the rest of 
their lives.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Of course, when we are in office, we are surrounded by 
advisors who tell us: You must not worry about it. It is a jobless 
recovery, it is the same everywhere, and you must get used to 
people's anger. You have to be thick skinned and not let yourself 
be moved if you see people who are having a hard time.
<P>
	I would like to take the time allotted to me to say that there are 
two main types of economic policy. The first, the most common 
kind, is a sort of laissez faire, as I was saying; you look after the 
fashionable parameters and live with the outcome once that is 
done, and that is the more or less long-term unemployed.
<P>
	We know that since the 1980s, some ideas that were in in the 
1930s have come back in fashion; they say that basically only 
the strong can survive, so let us help the strong and as for the 
weak, well, too bad, they are disadvantaged so let them suffer.
<P>
	But other countries over the years have developed other types 
of policies where employment is not a leftover, not a residual 
concern about which nothing can be done; no, they say: the 
purpose of the economy must be to give ordinary people a 
minimum, not just enough to keep them from dying, but enough 
to live with dignity, to have some hope and fulfilment, and in our 
societies for a long time to come, the key will still be 
employment.
<P>
	Some societies have taken the trouble to give themselves 
instruments, not just macro-economic instruments, not just 
monetary policy, not just a policy on the deficit, not just a trade 
policy, but a policy concerned with how jobs are actually created 
and lost and how, with patient effort, by influencing 
macro-economic policies, through common effort and working 
together, asking questions, even tough questions, the future of 
people can be assured.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we must admit that in politics, these methods 
often take time and politicians, men and women in politics, 
because I distinguish the two, can be in a hurry, their time is 
limited. However, there can be no quick-fix solutions-there 
are none. There is only the ability to look at a situation and to 
develop approaches with people at the grass roots.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will understand that I will talk about 
decentralization at some point and I will talk about Quebec. But 
before that, I want to remind you of the situation, not for the fun 
of it, because it is not at all funny. The latest figures show 
1,559,000 unemployed people. Remember that the unemployed 
counted here are those who are actively looking for work. You 
can be unemployed but not counted in this category if you are a  
discouraged worker. It is more practical that way; you are 
forgotten.
<P>
	In Quebec, how many are officially unemployed? There are 
428,000, not counting all the long-term unemployed who are on 
welfare. We can say without exaggeration that there are about 
800,000 unemployed people in Quebec who are actually looking 
for work, although not as Statistics Canada sees it. The lives of 
800,000 people in Quebec alone are tied to the ability to find 
work. It is a question of self-esteem, of parents being able to 
face	their children or help them, of people being able to build a home, have children. According to Statistics Canada, there are 1.5 million unemployed in this country.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	The Liberal government came to power on a worthwhile 
slogan. In either French or English, it was ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. 
The government rose to power on the heels of this catchy slogan.
<P>
	The Liberals conducted a clever campaign. Their slogan 
amounted to: ``Vote for us, vote Liberal''.
<P>
	So, what has this government done to follow through on its 
promise to create jobs, jobs, jobs?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It has created jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Since being elected? You must be joking. 
Look at the record.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, would you kindly remind hon. members to be 
courteous and to look at the latest Statistics Canada figures?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> As the hon. member should.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> I have seen quite few figures, sir.
<P>
	So then, what is the government doing? It does not like to be 
reminded of its record, but that is our job. What action has it 
taken? First of all, it cancelled the helicopter deal, without 
giving any thought to preserving high-tech and scientific jobs, 
as the Bloc had recommended.
<P>
	Next, it increased unemployment insurance premiums. It is 
trying to make people forget this decision any way it can by 
saying that it will lower the premiums next year. I will come 
back to this point.
<P>
	The government plans to inject $1 billion a year into its 
largest initiative, the Infrastructure Program. It hopes that the 
provinces and municipalities will match this amount. After two 
years, the government hopes to have created between 45,000 and 
65,000 temporary or short-term jobs. It is a simple matter to 
calculate the cost of each one of the 65,000 jobs, in light of the 
problems.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2584"> 2584 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the members opposite should stop saying that 
they have created jobs. If that was their slogan, and if they are 
satisfied with the Infrastructure Program-some bad language 
comes to mind, but I realize that members cannot speak such 
words in this House, unless they are willing to temper their 
remarks and I have no desire to do so.
<P>
	At best, the Infrastructure Program will create 65,000 jobs. 
According to the Johnson government, the program will create 
20,000 in Quebec. By extrapolating, we see that this initiative 
will create 20,000 jobs, while the lives of 800,000 depend on 
finding a job, often any job.
<P>
	Therefore, when the government says it has followed through 
on its promises when we know that this program is only a drop in 
the bucket, it is showing a certain lack of understanding and 
compassion, as well as extreme thoughtlessness. Its actions 
must be sternly denounced. Can anyone argue that this is the way 
to create jobs? However, for the government to be satisfied with 
creating 65,000 jobs-and this is not done yet-by the end of 
this period and to claim ``mission accomplished'', words fail 
me, Mr. Speaker. Let me just leave it at that.
<P>
	The government's next move was to bring down a budget, 
which it claimed, with great fanfare, would get Canada out of the 
woods.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	What was not mentioned too often though is the fact that the 
forecasts-not the targets but the actual forecasts-for 
employment in this budget see the overall rate of unemployment 
move from 11.2 per cent in 1993 to 10.8 per cent by the end of 
1995 in Canada. This means that the government itself is 
resigned to doing nothing more than what is outlined in the 
infrastructure plan and hope it stirs things up a little.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, this is my first mandate as a member of 
Parliament, not that I did not try to get elected before, and if my 
constituents have elected me to represent our riding, it is to 
testify to the best of my abilities to the misery and despair of so 
many people. I will never tolerate that the government does 
nothing after running on a platform of ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. And 
especially after claiming-and this shows its lack of 
imagination-that 40,000 jobs will be created by the end of 
1996 because it did not further increase unemployment 
insurance premiums.
<P>
	The government says-and I know the word for saying the 
opposite of the truth cannot be used in this place-that it will 
create jobs, when in fact the only thing it will be doing is not 
further hindering job creation. The truth is, based on 
Employment and Immigration Canada's indicators, that the 
January UI premium increase probably prevented the creation of 
9,000 jobs. That is the truth. We are expected to applaud the 
government for not preventing the creation of 40,000 jobs by the 
end of 1996! That is not my idea of a good employment policy.
<P>
	The government has all the tools of a powerful state. In spite 
of its huge debt, Canada is part of the G-7, although it is closer 
to being booted out than ever before. It is among the have 
nations. This wealth, admittedly, was acquired for a large part 
owing to the richness of Canada's subsoil. As the government is 
now discovering, its true strength rests with its human 
resources.
<P>
	Unfortunately, there is no easy recipe for investing in human 
resources development, and job training, as powerful a tool as it 
may be, is not a cure-all. I have spent a lot of time, along with 
other members of the Committee on Human Resources 
Development, in hearings where we were told repeatedly by the 
people involved in assisting individuals looking for a job how 
many of them have qualifications that they cannot even use. 
Painting in glowing colours the advantages of a little job 
training, which would be made compulsory, and having people 
believe that this would solve all their problems and create these 
jobs they are looking for is not permissible. In fact, it is 
absolutely forbidden. In any case, it goes against the testimony 
we heard from people working in the field. In Quebec alone-I 
do not know the latest figures but I will use slightly lower 
figures than those recorded during the last recession-over 
4,000 engineers were jobless; we are talking about engineers 
and not about someone who took a little three-month course to 
upgrade his or her skills in some area. I am not underestimating 
the value of such courses. But I am saying that to make people 
believe they can get jobs after a short, compulsory training 
period is fiddling with the truth.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	We will have many opportunities to come back to this issue. 
However, I wanted to say that I participated-I did not check the 
time I have left, I will be quick, I could have asked you before 
continuing-with 1,200 other people in the Quebec forum on 
social solidarity. What I want to say is this: There has been, at 
least in Quebec, perhaps because the unemployment problem 
there has been serious for a long time, a change in mentality. We 
do not simply ask others to show their concern about jobs. We 
know-and it may be true of unions, it is true of businesses, 
governments, and individuals-that the unemployment problem 
can only be tackled by means of a policy of solidarity. Solidarity 
means that everyone, including the rich, will have to do their 
part. We cannot simply let the rich carry on with their business 
while telling others they must tighten their belts because we can 
no longer afford to pay for social programs.
<P>
	We in Quebec have been working on these issues for a long 
time. We have developed the ability to act in concert with 
employers, unions, citizens' groups, and governments. After a 
long debate, we developed a capacity to reach a consensus. 
Many see sovereignty as a project because we can no longer 
afford to waste time on discussions. We want to act quickly to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2585"> 2585 </A></B>
<P>
use the resources  at our disposal in pursuing the priorities 
developed in the regions of Quebec.
<P>
	I am making this speech in this House because I know that 
other regions of Canada are facing tremendous problems, that 
they can no longer rely on their previous wealth, that they may 
have to undergo a long process. But, if the government is not 
aware of this, if it thinks it can collect revenues and leave those 
in difficulty out in the cold, it is on the wrong track. It can 
change course and that is the purpose of today's motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Paul):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, instead of always criticizing everything this 
government does, she should realize there is more to this than 
infrastructures. Members should look at the situation for small 
businesses in their ridings, get organized and help create small 
businesses. These generate a lot of jobs and can be created in all 
regions. I think that if all members look after their ridings as 
they should, a lot of jobs could be created in the days, weeks, 
months and years to come.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	I think the hon. member should look around in Quebec, as I 
have been doing, since we have already started into small 
businesses, and we have made a start with creating jobs. We are 
looking in my riding at all the agencies that take care of job 
creation and training, to ensure that people are not being trained 
for jobs that do not exist. If we provide training and if once 
people finish their training, they have no jobs, it is no use 
training them.
<P>
	We should have on-the-job training, with the assurance of a 
job for at least the next few years because, as you know, small 
business creates 85 per cent of the jobs in this country. I want to 
ask the hon. member what she has done in her own riding since 
she was elected and what kind of initiatives she has introduced.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to smile when I see 
someone who wants to put the employment problem right back 
on every member's doorstep. I find that amazing. I do not see 
why a party would want to get elected and have the power and 
the instruments it needs to run the economy, if it means making 
members responsible for job creation.
<P>
	However, I will give you my thoughts on small businesses, 
and I can tell you the concept was not discovered by the 
newly-elected Liberal government. It has been common 
knowledge for years. Anyone who is concerned about 
employment issues knows where the jobs are. There are jobs in 
the public sector, which are being cut because it is felt the public 
sector is costing too much, which means fewer jobs and less 
money in circulation. However, one soon realizes that jobs are 
created by the business sector. At one time I was working for a 
union and I said, at great personal cost to myself, that unionized 
workers should be concerned about productivity.
<P>
	Yes, small businesses do create jobs. But the federal 
government, which runs Employment and Immigration Canada 
and which has, and this is just an example, I am hitting the ball 
back in your court, Self-Employment Assistance-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I might 
remind hon. members on both sides of the House that they are to 
address their remarks through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I said this in the heat 
of the debate, and I apologize. I certainly would not be able to 
maintain this intensity when addressing the Chair.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I wanted to say to the hon. member that 
Employment and Immigration Canada, which has what could be 
an effective mechanism, called Self-Employment Assistance, 
decided, despite the unemployment rate we have in the Montreal 
area, to restrict the number of persons-I think it is 125 or 
165-to be given assistance in starting a small business. 
However, it has been proven this option is effective. Throughout 
the Montreal area, we see people who have projects but often do 
not have enough money to make the initial investment. They 
lack a framework and need help in the start-up stage- I have 
done that sort of thing, and I know what I am talking about. 
There are a lot of people like that. Unfortunately, governments 
are only concerned about macro-economic policies and do not 
care about how jobs are created or lost. We have businesses 
closing that should not close, but they say these are lame ducks, 
and so forth. There is a lot of time and effort involved in starting 
a business, and sometimes all it takes is a few adjustments and 
some management restructuring. With a little more attention 
and assistance, far more could be done for these businesses.
<P>
	As far as small businesses are concerned, I am looking after 
my riding and helping specific businesses, but the hon. member 
is not about to make me responsible for what a government 
should be doing, including the obligation to know what has to be 
done at the grass roots level.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rex Crawford (Kent):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. 
member's speech which, and this might amaze her, I enjoyed. 
Now I am asking her and her party to help me. I am not passing 
the buck.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	What I am referring to is last week in my riding of Kent in 
southwestern Ontario, the provincial government removed the 
excise tax on ethanol and also contributed $5 million to the 
building of a $160 million to $170 million company in the 
riding. I have been asking our government if it would do the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2586"> 2586 </A></B>
<P>
same as the provincial government did and keep the excise tax 
off ethanol for at least the next 12 years.
<P>
	It is in the red book. It is environmentally friendly. The job 
creation factor is that over 90 employees will work in this 
factory, with a spinoff of over 400 to the agricultural area, taking 
in the corn in the area to put into ethanol.
<P>
	The next factory to be built after the completion of this 
factory, anticipating the passage of this bill in the House, will be 
in Quebec. It will be the same size; a $170 million plant to help 
not only Quebec but Ontario. Another is being built in 
Saskatchewan as well as an addition on the one already there.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I know that 
members would want to seize the opportunity in the limited time 
of questions and comments to make them directly to the last 
spokesperson. If we are going to have a triumvirate discussion, 
excluding the Speaker, we would have great difficulty getting to 
the issues of the day.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kent, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crawford:</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker. I ask the hon. 
member if I could have her support and her party's support in 
this very important matter of ethanol.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, you can tell the hon. member that 
I will be very interested in learning more about that. From what I 
understand, he could get our support.
<P>
	If I may, I would like to add that, in Quebec, we have really 
developed an expertise, because we had some problems, we 
always have serious problems and we know how important it is 
to combine in a synergic effort-although I do not really like 
that word-forces that exist in an area. It takes time, but it is the 
only sure recipe. Governments must know that macro-economic 
policies absolutely have to be implemented, promoted and, 
surely, prevented from interfering with what is going on at the 
local and regional level.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise to respond 
to the motion moved by the hon. member for Mercier.
<P>
	I am very glad to reiterate for all hon. colleagues of the Bloc 
Quebecois the Liberal vision of Canada. It is a Canada that 
offers to all young Canadians the kind of opportunities to work, 
to grow and to prosper as so many other Canadians enjoyed 
before them.
<P>
	It should be noted that part of a government's vision is 
responding in an accountable, responsible and innovative way to 
what it sees around it, and not only responding to the problems 
but capturing the spirit of the potential that is there. This is what 
we as a government are attempting.
<P>
	I also welcome the opportunity to expand on this 
government's actions to date on how we will create jobs and 
opportunities through an integrated and effective approach to 
investing in people. As the Secretary of State for Youth and 
Training, I specifically would like to address the House on what 
concrete measures this government is taking to improve the job 
prospects of our young people, to get young Canadians back to 
work in the mainstream of the workforce.
<P>
	I should perhaps preface the rest of my speech with some 
comments about how inspired I have been in my travels across 
this country since having been appointed secretary of state. I 
have met young people from all across the country, from the east 
to the west, from the north to the south. It has been very 
inspirational for me to know there is vast potential for us to work 
with.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	We have a wealth of resources in the ideas, the energy and the 
leadership among young people. It should be noted that 
generally young people have the potential, the talent, the ability 
and the willingness. They need the opportunity and this is what I 
would like to address today.
<P>
	Other hon. members of the government will rise to speak on 
the Liberal vision for Canada and how that vision is fuelling 
concrete measures on several fronts to mobilize Canada's 
economic and human resources to create jobs and opportunities 
for all Canadians.
<P>
	During the election last fall the Liberal Party articulated a 
vision for a Canada where people live and prosper with a sense 
of hope and opportunity. Our vision was clearly spelled out in 
the Liberal platform called ``Creating Opportunity'' or the red 
book.
<P>
	It is a vision of an independent country that is economically 
strong, socially just, proud of its diversity and characterized by 
integrity, compassion and competence. These are the guiding 
principles that generations of Canadians live by and they laid the 
foundations for a great country and a fair society. The 
government stands behind these principles and we will create 
opportunities that reflect our strong belief in them.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Mercier is no doubt aware, the Liberal 
vision for a strong, cohesive and productive country hit a 
responsive chord among many Canadians. They increasingly 
felt isolated by their institutions, worried for our young people 
and uncertain about their future.
<P>
	The previous government adopted a wait and see attitude to 
social and economic policy and left Canadians to fend for 
themselves. However, this government has acted quickly to 
address the new social and economic realities of a global 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2587"> 2587 </A></B>
<P>
economy by inviting Canadians to engage in a far reaching 
examination and rebuilding of the very structures that have 
made this country so great.
<P>
	The impetus for change can be seen all around us. Where 
Canadians were once sure footed, they now feel they are 
slipping. Nowhere is the degree of uncertainty and the desire for 
change greater than when we hear the call from our young 
people to give them opportunities to contribute to their 
community, their country and to join in with other Canadians in 
building a brighter future for this nation.
<P>
	Canada cannot risk seeing a generation of young people 
sidelined in the job market because we did not have the right 
programs at the right times. Canada had over 400,000 young 
people under 25 who were looking for work each month in 1993. 
That is an unacceptably high unemployment rate of over 18 per 
cent. Without opportunity they will lose hope.
<P>
	In human terms, there are a lot of idle young people whose 
talents are being wasted. We need to ensure that young people 
have better opportunities like access to work, education, job 
training or community service. It is not for lack of interest. It is 
for lack of opportunities that this situation exists.
<P>
	The most recent labour force survey shows that while the 
number of unemployed in Canada is down, the youth 
unemployment rate is rising. It reached 18.1 per cent last month, 
its highest level since last June.
<P>
	We want to rebuild the social safety net for young Canadians 
who need help to get their lives back on track. In restoring the 
sense of security and opportunity, we want to offer choices that 
will help them make their way in the workforce. That is what the 
social security reform will accomplish.
<P>
	I want to make it clear that helping young people make the 
transition from school to the workforce is a major focus of social 
security reform.
<P>
	The government is calling on all Canadians to join in 
rebuilding our social security net. We are strongest when we act 
as a team. We are strongest when we combine the talents of 
governments, business, labour, educators, community groups 
and our youth. Together we have the human resources necessary 
to find solutions. Together we can do a better job.
<P>
	Young Canadians have as much to contribute and to gain from 
the rebuilding of our social safety net as any other age group in 
the country. They are a top priority because they are our future 
workforce.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	Young people will be the beneficiaries of these revitalized 
social programs. They will see the productive outcomes of a 
social security net that rewards effort, offers incentives to work 
and restores hope for the future.
<P>
	Our vision is to create a more productive economy by 
investing in the potential of our young people. To do this we 
have to recognize the needs of young people who are in the 
workforce now and looking for a meaningful outlet for their 
talents, energies and ideas.
<P>
	We also have to plan for the next generation too: those 
students who are just entering high school now and who will be 
planning their careers for a yet unknown job market and the 
generation after them as well.
<P>
	Social security reform is being propelled by a strong desire to 
meet the social and economic needs of Canada head on. 
Canada's social programs have served us well but they were 
designed in a different time for different circumstances. We 
cannot keep waiting. The realities of the next century are on us.
<P>
	On January 31 the Minister of Human Resources 
Development announced a three stage process for social 
security reform. It involves the participation of Canadians from 
all levels of the community.
<P>
	A parliamentary standing committee has been holding public 
hearings and is scheduled to submit its report to the House later 
this week. We have met a number of times with our partners at 
the provincial and territorial levels. These meetings will 
continue. A task force has been appointed to advise the minister. 
From these discussions an action plan will be drafted and tabled 
in the House in late April or early May. Canadians will be 
consulted on proposals for social security reform to be outlined 
in the action plan.
<P>
	We are moving quickly because the economic prospects of 
young Canadians can only improve if our system which can help 
them make that transition from school to work is redesigned and 
improved to meet their pressing needs.
<P>
	It is time to rethink our priorities and come up with a plan to 
meet the needs of our young people, our workforce and our 
society in the 1990s and beyond. In doing so we will also put in 
place a system that is responsive, compassionate and 
economical.
<P>
	The majority of jobs created now to the year 2000 will require 
at least 17 years of education and training. That is high school, 
plus four or more years of further schooling. Employers have 
raised the ante. Yet approximately 60 per cent of young people 
go looking for work right after high school. The doors to entry 
level jobs will be closed to them unless we give them the 
opportunities to improve themselves.
<P>
	Youth unemployment is directly linked to education and 
training. Between 1990 and 1993 jobs held by university 
graduates increased by 17 per cent. The uneducated and 
undereducated are being squeezed out of the workforce. The 
longer they are out of the job market, the harder it will be to get 
back in. The gaps on a young person's résumé will put them at a 
great 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2588"> 2588 </A></B>
<P>
disadvantage when they are up against newer graduates just 
entering the workforce.
<P>
	Young Canadians have the highest unemployment rate and are 
the most vulnerable to economic downturns. There may be 
fewer youths compared to their baby boomer predecessors. 
However, their needs are more pronounced because of the 
increasingly complex world they are entering, in terms of the 
workforce, what is productivity for a nation per se and because 
of global competitiveness as well.
<P>
	The federal government is offering jobs and hope to young 
people who have been hit hard by the recession and have fallen 
between the cracks in trying to find a job after leaving school. 
The failure to make that transition has a ripple effect on the 
economy and society.
<P>
	What is particularly disturbing is the growing number of 
young people who have never held a job. That is why it is 
essential that we help young Canadians.
<P>
	The Liberal government is committed to helping young 
Canadians make that transition. It is a top priority and that is 
why we are moving ahead with the youth service corps that was 
outlined in the red book. The youth service corps will help offer 
young Canadians an opportunity to serve and learn about their 
country and gain important skills and valuable work experience.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	The government will reach out to young people to prepare 
them for the challenges of the future. Liberals believe now more 
than ever that Canada needs the skills, talents and energies of 
every young Canadian. The youth service corps will get 
unemployed youth working in community service projects to 
address the diminishing opportunities for young people as a 
result of the tough job market.
<P>
	It is not a question of whether young people want to work, 
because they do. It is a question of giving them the opportunity 
to do something constructive and rewarding that benefits the 
individual, improves their community and strengthens our 
country.
<P>
	Canada simply cannot afford a lost generation. Demographic 
trends clearly demonstrate Canada will soon suffer a worker 
shortage. As baby boomers leave the workforce in large 
numbers we will increasingly count on your young.
<P>
	To compete globally in the next century we will need a highly 
educated, highly skilled workforce. You need not be a futurist to 
know our continued growth and prosperity depend on the 
workers of tomorrow who are generally the unemployed youth 
of today.
<P>
	This venture will be less costly than unemployment insurance 
and welfare and will give young people the tools to build better 
lives for themselves and for our society. Young people are 
searching for relevant work experience that will give them 
saleable skills to get their foot in the job market door.
<P>
	During my discussions with young Quebecers on the concept 
of the youth service corps I heard firsthand their enthusiasm for 
such a program. Quebec youth eagerly identified with the goals 
of the youth service corps to give them practical skills and work 
experience while contributing in a meaningful way to their 
country.
<P>
	The youth service corps is a smart and necessary investment 
in our future workforce. It is a concrete measure which 
addresses the serious need to help the unprecedented number of 
youth who are squeezed out of the workforce, who are giving up 
on finding work. Canadians age 18 to 24 who are out of school 
and unemployed will have opportunities to gain a sense of 
accomplishment, self-reliance and marketable skills through 
practical work experience in the community.
<P>
	Do we act now to offer young people opportunities so that 
they can acquire some skills and learn good work habits? Or do 
we write off a generation of youth and leave them unprepared to 
compete for jobs? The government has decided to act.
<P>
	The youth service corps represents one of several concrete 
measures by the government aimed to better prepare youth for 
the fast changing labour market. It is part and parcel of our 
underlying vision to invest in Canadians. The same vision is 
behind the social security review process.
<P>
	Young people today want what other Canadians want: good 
jobs; opportunities to enter and re-enter the workforce; the right 
to be part of the mainstream and to be treated with dignity. That 
is the essence of our vision for young people.
<P>
	The government stands for creating opportunities for young 
people. For the great majority of Canadians, jobs are at the top 
of the list. A job is the best form of security. We want to give 
young Canadians all the tools necessary to aim for, prepare for 
and find jobs.
<P>
	I should mention a number of other things that relate to youth 
between the ages 18 to 24 who are unemployed, left on the 
sidelines, out of reach of the opportunities. We also have a 
general preoccupation with the poor, the disabled, the street 
people, the people who are most in need and at risk. The 
initiatives we have outlined in the red book express that very 
well.
<P>
	Let me give a few examples. We have proposed an aboriginal 
head start program that will deal with preschool child 
development. It will help greatly those sole parents who 
struggle on their own with their children in the area of parenting 
skills and nutritional skills. We have a great need there. These 
are for the inner city poor.
<P>
	In a particular area of Winnipeg, one out of three children 
lives in poverty. This program is designed for the inner city 
poor. We now have a program designed to help keep young 
children in school called the stay in school program. It has been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2589"> 2589 </A></B>
<P>
hailed as a success across the country. Many regions have 
supported the program.  There has been a marked difference in 
the attendance of people who have been impacted by the 
program.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	We also have the brighter futures program, which is a 
carryover from the last government. We do not discard what 
works. We try to perfect, adjust and make better things that 
would work under our mandate.
<P>
	We now have Youth Services Canada which will break the 
cycle of dependency. It will take youth between the ages of 18 to 
24 years off unemployment insurance and assistance. It will be 
an enabling process.
<P>
	We also have the summer challenge program on which the 
minister will speak later. It is a very successful program. It is a 
program for the young people of Canada who are out there right 
now educating themselves, training and working. This is their 
opportunity to work between the months of April and 
September. They want to work and they are working.
<P>
	We also have the proposed youth internship program. I could 
go on and on about the wonderful things we want to do but my 
time is running out. We have laid out our priorities. We have 
expressed a commitment. We have looked at the human side of 
all the misery out there. We have laid out our plans concretely. 
For the first time in the history of the country the government 
has come forward and laid out on paper what it wants to do.
<P>
	In particular reference to my mandate we are committed to 
helping our youth. Our commitment will be expressed over the 
months to follow. It has only been since November that I have 
been in this mandate. Conversely I have been inspired by these 
young people. They are knowledgeable. They are mature. They 
want an opportunity. They are a leadership resource and we aim 
to work with them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Mr. Speaker, I very much 
appreciated my colleague's speech and the enthusiasm and 
determination she showed in talking about the Youth Service. 
She said that, thanks to that program, young people will have the 
opportunity to get off unemployment insurance. We must 
understand however that, given the recent unemployment 
insurance reform, they will not go from unemployment to that 
program since they will no longer be eligible for UI benefits.
<P>
	If the prospects presented in that famous red book are so 
extraordinary, please tell us why, after just a few months, the 
Prime Minister got such a bad reception in the Maritimes and in 
Shawinigan? What is perfectly clear for Canadians is that the 
government made promises and that we are now being presented 
with some well-intentioned measures that are totally out of 
proportion with the real problems of our society and the extent 
of those problems. The government promised us heaven on 
earth.
<P>
	Just remember what happened when Ms. Campbell said, 
during a debate, that the unemployment rate would stand at 9 per 
cent at the end of the century. She was treated like a pariah. Well, 
I suggest you read our Minister of Finance's budget. What does 
it say the rate will be in 1996 and in 1997? What are the 
medium-term projections for the unemployment rate? We will 
know in August.
<P>
	The reality is that we are facing problems of a massive scale, 
the Liberal Party made irresponsible promises and now it is 
unable to abide by them.
<P>
	I believe the last campaign was totally irresponsible as 
concerns public finance; the idea was it would not be necessary 
to cut government expenditures, all that was needed was job 
creation. Now we see major cuts, particularly in social 
programs, and we get some small measures totally out of 
proportion with the problems; that is why people are so 
disappointed.
<P>
	I understand that a program of such a scale as the one 
announced could be reasonable for a village or a small region.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	It is totally ridiculous to talk of investing $25 million in 
venture capital for small business. We would end up with about 
$60 per business for the whole of Canada. Twenty-five million, 
fantastic! It would make more sense if we gave this amount to a 
region in particular, to a small group of credit unions in the 
south-western part of Montreal for instance. An amount of $25 
million in venture capital for small business all over Canada can 
only excite the imagination. But it has absolutely nothing to do 
with reality. The problem is there are more than a million small 
businesses in Canada. In the long term, the program is said to 
amount to $200 million, but in the short term, it is $25 million a 
year or $25 per small business. It is totally absurd.
<P>
	The solutions you propose are out of proportion with the sheer 
scale of the problem. Throughout the campaign, the government 
described a situation becoming progressively easier. We now 
notice that it is rapidly deteriorating and, what is worse, that 
interest rates are affected more and more. Could the member 
explain to what extent the measures she mentioned are geared to 
the problems?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to 
respond to some of the concerns raised by the hon. member.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2590"> 2590 </A></B>
<P>
	I can understand the cynicism on the part of the Bloc 
Quebecois. I have been to Quebec and probably the most 
enthusiastic response in terms of the youth service corps 
specifically was from the youth in Quebec with whom we 
consulted. They were the unemployed, people dealing with 
justice, young offenders, street people and street youth 
organizations. They were very enthusiastic and wanted to 
endorse it.
<P>
	Opportunities big or small are not shunned by people who 
need the opportunities. Opportunities for youth in Quebec to do 
something with their lives, be it an opportunity for one person or 
opportunities for twenty people, will not be pushed to the side by 
young people. These young people were very enthusiastic. 
Every opportunity for every person is worth gold to those people 
whether or not the hon. member agrees.
<P>
	We never said that we had magical solutions. I salute the 
Prime Minister; I congratulate him. He went to the source. We 
knew there were concerns. We knew there would be a lot of 
reluctance. Change is difficult. Change is not without pain. 
Change is not without the kinds of difficulty and the controversy 
we are not afraid to confront. We know there is no pretty way 
around making the changes that will eventually lead to long term 
gain.
<P>
	In the interim we as a government are prepared to face the 
kinds of responses there are. We are prepared to make greater 
gains in the long run: short term pain for long term gain. We 
know there really is no pretty way around it. We never said we 
had magical solutions, but we believe every opportunity we 
create is for people who want it.
<P>
	Perhaps as politicians we tend to extrapolate on what is good 
for people in terms of jobs when we do not really have the right 
to do so. Those young people want those opportunities. They 
told us that. They endorse the programs enthusiastically.
<P>
	We hear the concerns about job creation and small and 
medium sized businesses. That was part of our platform. We 
never promised paradise to Canadians because we knew the 
problems that would be there when we were elected. We 
promised commitment. We promised to work hard. We promised 
to consult. We promised to try to create opportunities for those 
people to do for themselves, not to do for them what they could 
do better than we could as a government.
<P>
	That is where we are going. That is our intention. I would like 
the hon. member to be there to help us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the secretary of state outline 
the plan of yet another program.
<P>
	No one can deny that there is a serious problem in the country 
with youth unemployment. Certainly I am aware of it. The 
secretary of state talked about the government getting its 
priorities straight. I think the government does not have its 
priorities straight.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	In the period leading up to the election members of the Liberal 
Party did their homework. They did polling to find out the cause 
of the lack of jobs in the country. The message came back from 
the very people who create jobs, the majority of whom are small 
and medium sized business people, that the cost of doing 
business was simply too high. The government's prior and 
current neglect of the fiscal problems has caused high taxation. 
It has driven up prices and the cost of doing business.
<P>
	Jobs do not come from more government programs. There is a 
direct correlation between the deficit and the financial problems 
of the country and unemployment. If the government wants 
reassurance of that it should go back and ask the people who 
create jobs and will create jobs, the small and medium sized 
business people.
<P>
	The answer to youth unemployment and to unemployment in 
general is not to put more programs into effect. There are no jobs 
in the country. Small and medium sized businesses have so 
much uncertainty about taxation levels and the cost of doing 
business in the future that they are simply not expanding. 
Investors are not investing because they do not know what the 
taxation levels will be. Consumers are not spending because 
there is so much uncertainty about the government getting its 
fiscal house in order. We have university students with diplomas 
clutched in their hands applying for jobs at McDonald's. There 
are trained people out there but there are no jobs.
<P>
	I would suggest the government should re-examine its 
priorities and start to show some light at the end of the tax tunnel 
to encourage small and medium sized businesses to start 
creating jobs.
<P>
	More social programs are not the answer. That is the 
philosophy of the government that started 30 years ago, a time 
when there was no deficit, a time when the debt was 
manageable. It has instilled in youth an attitude of entitlement, a 
``don't worry, don't take responsibility for yourself'' attitude 
because the government will look after them with social 
programs. The generosity of social programs has created this 
attitude among our youth. Why would they work when the 
government will look after them?
<P>
	The government should look at where jobs come from, the 
small and medium sized businesses, start to attack the problems 
people are telling it about, and the jobs will be created.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am hearing a 
fundamental difference in vision here. We have our priorities 
right. We want to create jobs. We do not believe that investing 
resources to better the lives of young people who are 
unemployed, out of school and between the ages of 18 to 24 
years is a poor investment. We cannot afford not to do it because 
those young people are actually a drag on the social safety net. 
We are either paying them unemployment insurance or welfare. 
We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2591"> 2591 </A></B>
<P>
have the choice of deciding whether they should be  productive. 
This is an effort to enable these young people.
<P>
	If I might explain in detail, once young people use the 
opportunities in community based pilot projects they get what is 
called a completer's bonus. This bonus could be in the form of a 
tuition voucher, a loan forgiveness note or a portable wage 
subsidy. It could also give them a credit note to start a small 
business or work with a small business. This is all directly 
related. It is not a government program for government people. 
It is the government's effort to provide adequate resources so 
that young people can have opportunities they do not now have.
<P>
	It is a modest effort. It will not solve all ills. However in our 
review we are looking at every opportunity or every avenue to 
do better. We are not saying that we will solve all the problems 
of the world with one program. We are saying we cannot do 
everything but we know we have to do something.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	We have to help those young people out there. If the Reform 
Party chooses not to, it sounds a little anti-youth to me and it 
sounds like a bit of a downer on the attitude toward youth.
<P>
	I have met many youth who are capable, who want to work, 
who want the opportunities, who are on the cutting edge, who 
show leadership and who are very good at what they do. I could 
give many examples. I suggest that the hon. member go out there 
and meet with some of those young people.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Resuming debate. I 
wonder if the member for Elk Island could assist the Chair and 
indicate if he will be splitting his time with a colleague or taking 
the full 20-minute complement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, the very first thing 
on my agenda was to give notice that on behalf of the caucus 
co-ordinator, called the whip in the standing orders, according 
to Standing Order 43(2), our speakers on this motion will be 
dividing their time.
<P>
	The motion before us today is quite clear and quite succinct. It 
states that this House deplores the absence of vision and 
concrete measures from the government with regard to policies 
toward job creation.
<P>
	There is really no need to work on establishing the fact that 
there is a job crisis in Canada today. The unemployment figures 
are quite convincing. When one adds the innumerable 
individuals who are unemployed and who have given up and 
whose names are not even on the lists of the unemployed, there 
is little doubt that there is a crisis in this area.
<P>
	In the strictest sense of the wording of this motion, it should 
be opposed. We should really be opposed to the motion and 
hence appear to be siding with the Liberal government on its job 
creation plan. As the members on the opposite side might have 
applauded, some will be  asking why. Is this motion before us 
not in agreement with what the Reformers have been saying 
about jobs?
<P>
	In a way it is but if one takes the wording of the motion 
exactly as it is stated, at least the last part, one cannot accurately 
state that the government has failed to declare some concrete 
measures with respect to job creation. It seems to me that this 
government has proposed concrete measures for job creation in 
line with the vision of this government.
<P>
	The fundamental problem is that this government's so-called 
jobs plan is the wrong plan. It will not work. I am sure members 
opposite will correct me if I am wrong, but here is the summary 
of what I see in their plan.
<P>
	There is government deficit spending to review social 
assistance programs. There is government deficit spending to 
assist the space sector. There is government deficit spending to 
establish an apprenticeship program. There is government 
deficit spending to establish a youth service corps. There is 
government deficit spending on day care potentially. There is 
government deficit spending on home renovations, otherwise 
known as the RRAP program. There is government deficit 
spending on the granddaddy of them all, the infrastructure 
program.
<P>
	I hear a howl of protest because I am saying deficit spending. 
Stop to think about it. Just saying that this money is being 
transferred from other areas where we will not now be spending 
it is an inadequate explanation.
<P>
	My wife would be delighted if I told her that I have decided 
not to buy a new luxury car. We will have all this money to do 
renovations to the House. I would have had to borrow the money 
for the car. Therefore it would be quite deceptive to indicate that 
we now have a bunch of free money available.
<P>
	We would now be borrowing it for another purpose but it 
would still have to be borrowed, and so it is with these proposed 
programs. As long as we have a $40 billion deficit we are doing 
what we are doing with borrowed money. Instead of borrowing 
for helicopters, we are borrowing for the things that I have 
listed.
<P>
	There is a jobs plan. The leader of the Liberal Party said often 
during the campaign: ``We have the people, we have the plan''. 
The problem is that the plan, based on borrowing and deficit 
spending, will not provide any long term solution at all to the 
problem.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	If the government could really solve the problem, and if the 
only problem were jobs, then it would work for the government 
to hire people to dig holes in the ground and then hire other 
people to fill them in again. Obviously with that facetious 
example I have shown that the job must add to the real wealth of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2592"> 2592 </A></B>
<P>
the country if it is to improve our standard of living and our 
economic well-being.
<P>
	It seems to me the only real wealth we have is in the provision 
of goods and services that have a market among our citizens and 
the people of other countries. Therefore, and I hesitatingly 
admit this but I think it is true, to the extent that the 
infrastructure program enhances our ability to create real 
wealth, it is useful and will contribute to a longer term 
well-being, but only to that extent. There seems to be much in 
the planned activities of this program that is temporary, short 
term and that does not add to the ability of our nation in 
providing needed goods and services.
<P>
	Let me also bring to the attention of the House the problems 
inherent in the government's debt-deficit plan. To a question I 
asked in the House last week I was given the answer that the 
deficit is under control. This government has stated publicly in 
the recent election campaign, in the red book, in the budget and 
in numerous statements both inside and outside the House that 
its goal is to bring the deficit down to 3 per cent of the GDP. I 
must state seriously that I doubt this will happen.
<P>
	This first year spending is actually going up and the reduction 
in the deficit as a percentage of GDP is minimal and based on 
some fairly generous assumptions on economic growth. If we 
assume that the government assumptions are right, there is still a 
huge flaw. If we assume that government spending will help the 
country's economy, then the deficit as a percentage of GDP 
should drop dramatically during periods of high growth. The 
relationship should be the inverse of what is being stated. 
Conversely, the deficit would normally increase as a percentage 
of GDP in periods of low growth.
<P>
	This is not to say that even if the government had it right, its 
interventionism would be the right policy. Adam Smith said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The statesman who should attempt to direct private people in what manner 
they ought to employ their capitals, would not only load himself with a most 
unnecessary attention, but assume an authority which could safely be trusted to 
no council whatever, and which would nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands 
of a man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise 
it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Is this what our government is doing? I say yes, just look at 
government spending. Using the government's own projections 
the deficits and debts will be growing year by year in perpetuity. 
Using the government's own 3 per cent target, by the year 2000 
our debt will be approximately $700 billion.
<P>
	I challenge anyone to convince me or any of my constituents 
that this is an acceptable level of indebtedness. It is 
unbelievable that this government will undertake as a goal 
taking the people of this country further and further into debt. I 
cannot be convinced that this will have anything less than a 
devastating effect on our long term well-being definitely as it 
relates to the job problem. At the rate given by the government's 
projections we will have $1 trillion of debt by the end of the first 
decade of the next century.
<P>
	What will work? Let us hear Franklin Roosevelt:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A programme whose basic thesis is, not that the system of free enterprise for 
profit has failed in this generation, but that it has not yet been tried.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	People do not need the government's assistance or 
interference so much as they need it out of the way.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	How do we get it out of the way? We reduce the deficit, then 
debt, then taxes because the component of interest which is 
growing so rapidly decreases. Then we will instil confidence, 
both consumer and investor, so we can get the private sector 
hiring again. We can eliminate interprovincial trade barriers. 
We can eliminate the red tape barriers to business. We can help 
with training, among others.
<P>
	Perhaps I am forced to admit that the government has taken 
hesitant steps in this direction. By mixing its incorrect theory 
with some correct theory it is accomplishing nothing but 
annoying both sides: the entrepreneur, and the worker who 
cannot find a job.
<P>
	I highly recommend that the government take the most 
courageous step any politician can make to really spur job 
growth and get out of the way. In the words of Lord Acton, the 
finest opportunity ever given to the world was thrown away 
because the passion for equality made vain the hope for 
freedom.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with a great deal of interest to what the hon. member 
had to say. I found it rather interesting that the hon. member was 
quoting different sources basically to suggest that government 
should not intervene in any way whatsoever in the domain of 
business.
<P>
	However, I noticed a real contradiction with what the hon. 
member had to suggest. I find it rather odd because he is 
certainly agreeing with the Liberal policy of this particular 
government. He suggested that government had a role to play in 
training. I find that if government is not to intervene at all in the 
domain of business, training is one of the most important areas 
of business. I would like the hon. member to comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to respond 
to that. I was previously involved as an educator for 31 years and 
therefore am well aware of the need for training and the 
effectiveness of it.
<P>
	I would like to indicate in answer to the question that there are 
areas where government needs to be involved. I do not think that 
anyone would deny that. There are many areas in which we can 
collectively as a nation do things better than individuals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2593"> 2593 </A></B>
<P>
	However, having worked in the technical field I have found 
that we work best when we work in consort with the businesses 
that are hiring our graduates. I worked in a technical institute 
and we did that. In many areas and many times we provided as 
individuals and as an institute services on demand from industry 
for specific training where they needed the help.
<P>
	Therefore, I would not ever say that government should not be 
involved at all. However, there are many areas where 
government interferes. I would like to give a quick example.
<P>
	At the technical institute where I worked there are some 750 
instructors. About a year or so ago in January when we got our 
cheques, our deductions for UI had increased sharply. Being in 
mathematics some of us were doing quick calculations and 
computed that collectively the 750 instructors of the institute 
were contributing about $1,200 per year into the UI fund, 
matched by the employer with a total of about $2,800 per year.
<P>
	Had we been able to keep that money we could have spent it on 
things we like. I could have had my roof repaired. Someone 
could have been hired to do that. Instead we were simply 
contributing an amount of money which would have provided 60 
jobs at $35,000 per year just on that UI. That is an interference 
of government: taking money by coercion to give it to people to 
meet their basic needs without really providing jobs for them.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Catterall (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
comment generally on the comments the member has made. I 
really think it is up to him to be quite open and forthcoming with 
Canadians about the kind of impact the deficit reduction targets 
his party proposes would have on Canadians.
<P>
	What the Reform Party proposes is exactly a more 
concentrated version of what we have seen in this country for the 
last nine years. They are the kinds of programs that have left 1.6 
million Canadians unemployed and over six million Canadians 
dependent in one form or another on unemployment insurance or 
social assistance.
<P>
	This is not the particular issue I want to raise with the 
member. I would ask for some elaboration on his final comments 
where he seemed to disparage the concept of equality as 
somehow destructive of freedom and democracy.
<P>
	I know that some people do not quite understand that equality 
does not mean being the same. My personal view is that our 
world, our nation and our communities require a multitude of 
talents that our people possess. To not allow those talents to be 
fully and completely used and developed through various 
equality measures would limit our capacity as a society.
<P>
	I really would like the member opposite to explain what he 
has against equality and why he thinks that some groups really 
are not quite as equal as he is perhaps. Could he just expand on 
what he has against equality.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment on both. 
Since I graduated from university at a time when the debt and the 
deficit were more or less under control we had a choice of jobs, 
as many members in the House will know. That has changed 
remarkably. There is almost a 100 per cent correlation between 
the size of the debt in this country and the level of 
unemployment.
<P>
	There is no doubt in my mind that the deficit and 
unemployment are closely related. The government is pulling 
more and more money out of the pockets of individuals, 
entrepreneurs and business people just to service the debt that is 
resulting. That is the first part.
<P>
	The second part concerns equality. Indeed I do believe in the 
equality of people but in quite a different way from the way of 
those who tend more toward the socialist end. I do not believe 
that anyone in this country should suffer because of lack of 
health care or lack of educational opportunities because of lack 
of ability to pay.
<P>
	I believe we need to make sure that in our governmental 
system we provide equality of opportunity. However, I do not 
believe we serve ourselves well, in fact I believe it is very 
detrimental if we use government policies, especially in the 
fiscal area, to provide equality of circumstance irrespective of 
what the individual does.
<P>
	We really need to get back to a system of solid rewards for 
efforts expended. That would still provide everyone in this very 
rich country the ability and the circumstance to provide for 
themselves and to be very well off compared with the rest of the 
world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
address the opposition motion which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House deplore the government's lack of vision and lack of concrete 
measures relating to job creation policies.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is my belief that to stimulate the economy and to increase 
revenues for government, lenders, investors and consumers 
must possess a larger pool of disposable income. Jobs are 
created in the private sector, which the government readily 
admits is up to 87 per cent, which follows the laws of supply and 
demand. They would do a better job of creating long term 
meaningful jobs with $6 billion in cash than the Liberal 
government would do with its infrastructure program.
<P>
	The role of government should be to do what government can 
only do: peace, order and good government. It is not job 
creation. It should regulate, administer, pass laws, defend 
borders but it should not enter the marketplace to create jobs. 
With regional development funds, grants and subsidies to busi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2594"> 2594 </A></B>
<P>
nesses, governments distort the private sector, create temporary 
jobs and promote unfair competition within industry sectors. 
When will governments acknowledge that they are in fact part of 
the problem and not the solution.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	I would like to educate this Liberal government on the reality 
of the private sector and not the perceived reality of the Liberal 
government.
<P>
	Government overspending results in the raising of tax dollars. 
Higher taxation means that less capital is available in the 
marketplace which leads to a drop in demand. When demand 
drops, consumption drops, businesses close their doors and the 
cycle continues. This vicious circle is the main reason why 1.6 
million Canadians are unemployed.
<P>
	It takes money to create wealth but the government takes too 
much of it away from the people who know how to spend it. It 
takes it out of the system and then wonders why unemployment 
goes up.
<P>
	The root of the unemployment problem in this country is the 
debt. The Liberals would have us believe that the debt is only 
one of many symptoms causing millions of Canadians to be 
unemployed. The fact is that the government is now adding 
another projected $41 billion-let us hope it is only that-to this 
debt which will take it to $550 billion at the end of this coming 
fiscal year. It is the debt and the interest to service that debt that 
is causing the problem.
<P>
	Currently the unemployment rate is at 11.2 per cent. At the 
end of the year with the finance minister's own projections that 
he has defended in this House, including the $6 billion 
infrastructure program and the 168,000 short term jobs that it 
will create, the unemployment rate will drop to 11.1 per cent 
after 12 months.
<P>
	This is one-tenth of 1 per cent. Is this what the Liberals call 
job creation? Are Canadians across the nation and especially in 
central Canada truly getting the changes that they demanded and 
were promised by the Liberal government? The answer is no.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development has said in 
this House that capital creates jobs. So far he is right on. As a 
businessman I know this to be true. But what politicians on the 
other side of the House do not seem to realize is that there is a 
big difference between the spending of debt capital that is 
borrowed money and equity capital that does not have to be 
repaid.
<P>
	The private sector understands the difference. It is time 
politicians did too. At risk money motivates; government 
money wastes. The government is going to spend $6 billion on 
infrastructure programs. Since it is going to spend the money 
anyway that money should be spent improving the kind of 
infrastructure that permits the productive sector of the economy, 
the private sector, to function more efficiently which in turn will 
allow it to create real long term jobs.
<P>
	The government's role should be to develop an economic 
atmosphere, an environment, an infrastructure that facilitates 
investment, not to make the investment itself directly. The 
private sector will do that.
<P>
	In his speech at the G-7 jobs conference in Detroit in the last 
two weeks, the Minister of Industry spoke of developing a 
national technology extension network to offer technological 
services across Canada. Sounds great. The minister stated: 
``Small business will be encouraged to work more closely with 
public sector research institutions to improve the 
commercialization of new technology, base products and 
services''.
<P>
	When will the government listen to what small businesses are 
saying: ``Get out of our pockets, get off our backs, and get out of 
our way so that we can create the long term meaningful jobs''.
<P>
	Let me give a specific example of this. When the government 
talks about creating an information superhighway in 
conjunction with the public sector backed by the government 
with more government money, my suggestion is that it look 
south to the United States and see how it is addressing this need.
<P>
	Two entrepreneurs, William Gates and Craig McCaw, have 
joined forces to build an extensive global communication 
superhighway. It is the marketplace that is addressing the needs 
in the states of consumers and not the government. I reference 
the article. It is in the <I>Financial Post</I> of Tuesday, March 22, and 
if anybody on the Liberal side of the House would like to read it, 
they may learn something from it.
<P>
	The government need not build an information superhighway 
with taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	Freeing up the marketplace from government intervention 
creates opportunities, incentives, and real long term meaningful 
jobs. It generates real revenue and sends a message to investors 
and to all Canadians that this country wants a future based on 
prosperity not on government handouts and high debt.
<P>
	The Liberal government must encourage the spending of 
equity capital from the private sector and not debt capital as is 
the current situation. For too long our governments have relied 
on the spending of borrowed money, not equity capital, in the 
funding of short term job creation programs that benefit specific 
groups and not society as a whole.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	In a speech at the G-7 conference the Minister of Industry 
stated: ``Well planned infrastructure spending offers a potential 
for immediate job creation in the short term'', that is, while it is 
being built. ``As well, there will be a payoff in the longer term 
through the support of higher levels of economic activity when 
it is operational''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2595"> 2595 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us put this theory to the test. The Calgary city council just 
last night at a marathon meeting agreed in a 9 to 6 vote, this is at 
the municipal level, to use part of the infrastructure program of 
the government to renovate the Saddle Dome. For those 
members in the House who do not know what the Saddle Dome 
is, it is a hockey rink, a facility used in Calgary to house the 
Calgary Flames, the major tenant, and other programs and 
events throughout the year.
<P>
	Is this infrastructure money being well spent? Does this 
benefit the city as a whole or just a select few?
<P>
	In my opinion, there are a multitude of roads, bridges and 
buildings that urgently require immediate attention that would 
make it better for investors and businesses to live in Calgary. 
This is not the proper use of infrastructure funds. Only a few 
taxpayers will benefit at the expense of all taxpayers. Few if any 
new jobs will be generated in this instance because most jobs 
will go to contractors and workers who are already employed.
<P>
	Federal funds will once again be used to interfere in a private 
sector matter. This issue is between the Stampede board and the 
Calgary Flames hockey club. With the Liberal program it now 
involves all the taxpayers. The federal government has no 
business allocating taxpayers' money to influence the outcome.
<P>
	If the infrastructure program is intended to create jobs with 
the benefit being an improvement to the nation's basic 
infrastructure, then how can this be justified? The maintenance 
of basic infrastructure has always been the responsibility of 
governments which leads one to ask: What have they been doing 
for the last 25 to 30 years to bring about such negligence with 
regard to the basic responsibility?
<P>
	The answer is instead of using taxpayers' dollars to take care 
of the fundamentals such as roads, sewers and bridges, the 
government has been squandering the nation's wealth on 
inefficient, expensive social programs. Those programs in many 
ways encourage people not to work, that is high UIC benefits 
and generous welfare payments that all started with the Liberal 
government in 1968 under Pierre Elliott Trudeau.
<P>
	Once again it is a vicious circle. Government ignores its basic 
responsibility with respect to infrastructure in order to 
concentrate on an extensive and expensive social agenda. It 
increases the tax burden to finance that agenda, kills jobs 
through the tax burden, declares job creation as part of the social 
agenda, then spends more tax dollars to create jobs, working on 
the very infrastructure it ignored in the first place. Have fun, 
Liberal government.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by quoting the hon. member for 
Calgary Southwest who has stated many times, and in my 
opinion is worth repeating many times: ``A dollar in the hands of 
a lender, taxpayer or investor is much better than that same 
dollar in the hands of a bureaucrat, a lobbyist or a politician''.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I could hardly contain myself sitting in this seat when 
the hon. member talked about the infrastructure program. I am 
afraid he does not understand the legislative structure of the 
Government of Canada, the provincial governments and the 
municipal governments.
<P>
	If he were to understand that municipal governments are those 
people elected by the grassroots citizens, the taxpayers of 
Canada, and it is the municipal governments, whether they be 
city governments, rural towns or very rural county 
municipalities, those local governments are responsible for the 
maintenance of their own highways, snow removal, their 
bridges, their sewers, their water treatment plants, that entire 
fundamental basic infrastructure that keeps Canadians doing 
their day to day business.
<P>
	It is not the federal government which has been squandering 
its money. Its money comes from property taxes at the very basic 
level. The reason the infrastructure program was brought in 
arose from those municipal governments. I was part of one. 
Many of the member's colleagues in this House were also. We 
lobbied through our FCM to the federal Government of Canada 
for the past decade to get the government to cost share in 
infrastructure projects because they were falling by the wayside 
and property taxes could no longer afford to maintain basic 
infrastructure.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	I reiterate that it was not the federal government squandering 
money. It was the lack of property taxes by all Canadians that 
could sustain our basic needs. We have shown the generosity, the 
fulfilment of that need from municipal councils to cost share so 
that we could build up those basic needs and maintain their 
industries, their citizens, their competitive edge and provide 
those jobs through a solid infrastructure. I would challenge the 
member to debate and refute the municipal councils across this 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
history lesson on municipal government. I would also like to 
comment that it is awfully nice to say how generous the Liberal 
government is with money and funding to help, but whose 
money is it? It is other people's money. It is borrowed money 
and we have to stop borrowing because we have to stop adding to 
this debt.
<P>
	There are lots of income taxes around. Municipalities have 
lots of ways to raise money to sustain themselves. This 
infrastructure program is going to people who already have jobs, 
who already are skilled. We need accountability.

period of questions and comments usually allows for lively 
debate but I would hope that whoever has the floor and in this 
instance, the member for Calgary Centre, would be able to 
conclude his remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Perhaps the hon. member who said that I do not 
know what I am talking about does not know the rules. The 
standing orders probably would help that member quite a bit.
<P>
	The problem with the infrastructure program that the Liberal 
government has put forth is that there has to be a mechanism for 
accountability that it has created new jobs.
<P>
	Our concern is that it is not really creating the new jobs, 
witnessed by the member's own evidence that at the end of the 
year the drop in unemployment is only one-tenth of 1 per cent.

business, starting as a small business person.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> You should have stayed there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> The hon. member says that I should have 
stayed there, but I think I can contribute to this House just like 
he feels and that is why I am here. I want to comment and talk 
about some of the points made.
<P>
	The budget the Liberal Party put forward talks about small 
business. It takes action on where the jobs are created. 
Eighty-five per cent of all jobs created are in small business.
<P>
	I want to tell members about the infrastructure program. The 
hon. member said that was not creating jobs. In December I was 
in Singapore. There one learns how important infrastructure is. 
Its economy is booming. It has a very low unemployment rate 
because of a strong infrastructure.
<P>
	Infrastructure is very good for the long term because it creates 
efficiencies. It lets business become more efficient and if one 
looks at what has happened in Singapore, it has an incredible 
ports system and an incredible airport system. All that has 
created a tremendous economic boom there where it has become 
the hub of that area.
<P>
	The Liberal program is all about creating jobs. It is about 
economic growth. If one looks at the Reform Party's position, 
what it wants to do is bulldoze everything and cut the deficit in 
three years. It thinks that will build confidence in the economy. 
It thinks that will create jobs, that getting rid of thousands of 
jobs is going to create confidence in the economy.
<P>
	This is a dream for the Reform Party. It is not true that one can 
create jobs by cutting $40 billion in a matter of three years out of 
the economy. What we need is economic growth. What we need 
is small business, incentive to create jobs and that is what we are 
doing.
<P>
	We are reducing the paper burden for small business. We are 
looking at ways that small business can take advantage of 
research and development. We are looking at ways in which 
small business can export to other markets and that is where the 
jobs are going to be created.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to tell the member that we have not heard any concrete 
solutions from that side except cutting things like CMHC. If we 
cut CMHC, all the funding for CMHC-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Having been 
reminded of the rules of this House, I will try to interpret them as 
fairly as I possibly can. In the timeframe that we have I would 
ask the member for Calgary Centre for a short reply please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> My first response, Mr. Speaker, is that the 
infrastructure program of the government represents only 
one-half of 1 per cent of the gross domestic product. For the 
wonderful things that this is going to create, like the leader of 
my party says, that is like trying to fly a 747 with a flashlight 
battery.
<P>
	When the hon. member talks about our plan and how bad it is, 
we have not had a chance to implement it. Give us a chance. He 
talks about job creation. When the finance minister first 
introduced the budget he said: ``Give our budget six months at 
least. Do not hold anything that happens in the economy against 
us for at least six to seven months. Then give us a judgment''.
<P>
	Now the report comes in that higher employment has been 
achieved and the Liberal government is quick to jump on the 
bandwagon and try to take credit for it. There is no consistency 
of logic there.
<P>
	With respect to the fact that the government's budget in this 
infrastructure program is well thought out and well planned and 
that it is going to take action, I would continue to debate that. It 
is all rhetoric. It is all talk. No action is being taken. It is filled 
with 14 or 15 new committees to study everything from social 
programs to a new study on the GST when the hon. member's 
own leader-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. It is in that spirit of 
continuing debate that we will resume debate with the hon. 
member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is interesting to see how the opposition motion 
dealing with ``the government's lack of vision and lack of 
concrete measures relating to job creation policies'' draws the 
members' attention to this problem,  which is a very real one, as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2597"> 2597 </A></B>
<P>
we saw during the election campaign. The interest shown here is 
much greater than in the case of previous motions calling for the 
striking of committees. It seems that on the government side, 
they are either getting highly specialized in that area or just 
falling asleep. The motion before the House today is giving rise 
to an interesting debate, and so it should.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, the two major tasks the government was 
supposed to tackle to meet voter expectations after it was 
elected, were control of expenditures and job creation.
<P>
	The budget tabled by the Minister of Finance was a blatant 
indication of this government's failure to give itself enough 
room to manoeuvre and make the cuts required to invest in job 
creation. Because of this budget, Canada still has to pay a risk 
premium on the money it borrows abroad. I think that this is 
proof enough of the lack of efficiency and commitment on the 
part of the present government in the area of job creation.
<P>
	The most blatant betrayal of their election promises can be 
found in the job creation field. I read somewhere in the <I>Liberal 
Plan for Canada</I>, which is not ten years old but only six months 
old, that unemployment was a waste of human and economic 
resources. And that the top priority for a Liberal government 
would be job creation.
<P>
	And yet, this Liberal government is offering nothing more 
than an infrastructure program. It will take a lot more than a 
project, which might create 45 000 temporary jobs, to give hope 
to the 1 565 000 Canadians who are out of work, 437 000 of them 
in Quebec. The government's action does not reflect the sense of 
urgency to create jobs they talked about during the election 
campaign. Why is it? I think it is due to a lack of vision on the 
part of the government. It is unable to show the kind of vision 
necessary to face these tremendous times we are going through.
<P>
	The structural changes brought about by the globalization of 
the economy make the conventional wisdom obsolete. To meet 
their objectives, the Liberals are counting on the economy 
recovering on its own. For the Canadian economy to reach its 
full potential, the annual growth rate should be above 4 per cent 
over the next four years.
<P>
	The few measures taken now will not be enough to meet this 
objective; they are mere window dressing.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	The initiatives undertaken by the Liberals only touch upon the 
problem and the government refuses to do something about 
structural unemployment, which prompted the minister of 
Finance to say that it would be unrealistic to think that the 
unemployment rate would drop below 8 per cent within five 
years. Is it no longer urgent to create jobs?
<P>
	What would have been the building blocks of a stringent and 
efficient policy to fight unemployment, which is a waste of our 
very own human resources? The first building block would have 
been to restore consumer confidence.
<P>
	The election campaign restored hope among Canadians and 
Quebecers for some major changes, including a change in 
attitude for the government, and voters thought they finally saw 
some light at the end of the tunnel. Instead, Canadians and 
Quebecers learned that the estimated deficit of the Liberal 
government would reach an all-time high, at $39.7 billion. They 
cried wolf for several months and came out with a miserable 
little policy.
<P>
	Second negative signal, going after the unemployed instead of 
unemployment. Following the unemployment insurance reform, 
you will have to work more weeks in order to be entitled to less 
weeks of UI benefits, and those benefits would, in several cases, 
be reduced. Given that, the people in Quebec and in Canada have 
no reason to regain confidence and to decide, for example, to 
buy a house.
<P>
	A young couple with no job security, where both spouses hold 
seasonal jobs, will understand from the messages sent 
concerning UI reform that, in a year or two, they will not be able 
to get the income support provided by the unemployment 
insurance program, because of the increased number of weeks 
claimants have to work, and for that specific reason they will 
decide not to buy a house. It would be totally irresponsible to 
decide otherwise.
<P>
	The government sent another negative signal when it decided 
to wait until 1995-96 before reducing the unemployment 
insurance premiums from $3.07 to $3, which proves that the 
Liberals do not feel the situation is very urgent. To send a 
positive signal to Canadians and Quebecers, they would have 
had to freeze the premiums at $3 in 1994-95, and not only 
starting in 1995-96.
<P>
	No, job creation is not really an obsession for the government, 
it is not even a priority, if you ask me.
<P>
	Indeed, the government itself is undermining the confidence 
of consumers by recognizing that these measures will only have 
a minor effect on unemployment, since it is said in the Budget 
that unemployment will hover around 11 per cent in 1995.
<P>
	In my last years at university, an 11 per cent unemployment 
rate would have been so totally unacceptable that people would 
have taken to the streets. In those days, unemployment was at 3, 
4 or 5 per cent and even then, it was considered unacceptable. 
We are now told in the budget speech, which reflects the official 
position of the government, that we can live with an 11 per cent 
unemployment rate. This demonstrates, I think, that the 
government is not up to its responsibilities and, above all, to its 
campaign promises.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2598"> 2598 </A></B>
<P>
	I think one rare encouraging signal in the Budget is the 
permanent renewal of the program enabling people to use RRSP 
funds to buy a first house. However, as I have just said, 
employment insecurity dampens the enthusiasm of many.
<P>
	Another building block of a stringent policy would have been 
to send a clear message to the government machinery as a whole 
that the government is engaged in a ruthless battle against 
unemployment. Instead, the Governor of the Bank of Canada is 
replaced by another of the same philosophy. The monetary 
policy of the Bank of Canada is praised even though it is 
responsible for the fact that the recession was harsher in Canada 
than in the United States.
<P>
	The demagogic struggle which the Bank of Canada has led 
and is still leading while the Canadian economy is plummeting 
has contributed to kill whatever confidence consumers had in 
the future of their economy. We must stop being afraid to be 
afraid and achieve a new dynamism. It is not with this kind of 
message that we will succeed in making progress.
<P>
	If you compare the United States with Canada today, you will 
understand why the Americans are far better off than we are. 
Between 1989 and 1992, the United States pursued a monetary 
policy aimed at containing the recession and stimulating 
economic recovery. American monetary authorities are willing 
to accept an inflation rate that is higher than ours. There is an 
economic principle that says that if you fight inflation, 
unemployment will go up, and vice versa. This principle is 
long-standing and very fundamental since it is taught in any 
introductory course in economics. So, we have been very 
dogmatic and the results of that are obvious in the situation we 
are facing today.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	The third building block of a measure that could have been 
adopted is a job creation policy specifically directed towards the 
main groups of unemployed Canadians that should be put back 
to work.
<P>
	I have been sitting on the human resources development 
committee for a few weeks and I am very surprised by the way 
people talk about how we are going to get things from the 
disadvantaged. We are always on the defensive, whereas we 
should take advantage of a department like the Department of 
Human Resources Development to initiate positive measures, to 
turn to people who are doers and who will help us turn the 
situation around instead of simply guarding the status quo.
<P>
	The primary group that should be targeted is young graduates, 
people between 20 and 35 years of age. Nowhere in government 
commitments is this group mentioned as being the target of 
structural projects.
<P>
	There could be other structural projects, but there is one 
example that we have been focussing on in the House for a long 
time, and I think that we will keep coming back to it. The Bloc 
Quebecois would like the high-speed  train project in the 
Quebec-Windsor corridor to be carried out. The realization of 
this project could have a ripple effect similar to that of the great 
hydro-electric projects of the 1970s. We feel it is essential that 
Canada and Quebec invest in railway infrastructure for 
transportation of goods and passengers.
<P>
	We have a vast territory and the maintenance of the road 
network is very costly. Moreover, developing a competitive 
economy while banking on individual transportation is not an 
environment-friendly solution. The Bloc Quebecois is not 
opposed to restructuring the railway system if this helps 
increase its profitability. However, we have to proceed while 
taking into account possible alternatives instead of abandoning 
this mode of transportation bit by bit.
<P>
	Rail transportation is not just nostalgia, it can also be a major 
development tool, as much for Canada as for Quebec, and it is 
urgent that we become aware of that and take action accordingly. 
Canada and Quebec must therefore adopt an efficient public 
transport policy.
<P>
	The Quebec City-Windsor high-speed train project would 
cost about $7.5 billion over a ten year period, but 70 per cent of 
it would be funded by the private sector. The remaining 30 per 
cent, about $2.3 billion, would be funded by the Quebec, Ontario 
and federal governments. By getting involved in this HST 
project, this government would help stimulate a $5.3 billion 
investment by the private sector, not counting the spin-offs.
<P>
	During construction, tax revenues generated by the project 
would amount to $1.8 billion. Thus, the funding provided would 
soon be recovered. The HST requires less funding than the 
infrastructure program and is an investment rather than an 
expenditure.
<P>
	This investment by the federal government would not 
increase the Canadian debt and would help make VIA Rail 
profitable. It would create almost 120,000 jobs annually, 
including 80,000 direct jobs in the construction of the 
infrastructure and the manufacturing of equipment for the HST, 
and 40,000 indirect jobs upstream and downstream from the 
project. It would reduce unemployment insurance costs for the 
government.
<P>
	In 1991, the Ontario-Quebec Rapid Train Task Force made a 
comprehensive feasibility study. Extensive public consultations 
concluded that people in the areas affected by the rapid train 
project would support it. It has been said many times that the 
Quebec City-Windsor corridor is crucial and that it is important 
that the cities in that corridor be made more effective in order to 
succeed in a competitive market.
<P>
	Since the committee concluded that the project is relevant, a 
committee with representatives of the federal, Quebec and 
Ontario governments was set up to make a cost-benefit analysis 
of different technologies. The Bloc Quebecois advocates the 
implementation of an environment-friendly technology. The 
HST would reduce government spending. It would provide 
intercity  transportation at a much lower cost than an expansion 
of road or air transportation services. This is a good example of a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2599"> 2599 </A></B>
<P>
streamlining of expenditures which would have a positive 
impact on job creation.
<P>
	The multiplier effect of the HST project would contribute to 
strengthening of local economies. In Europe, it has been 
demonstrated that the HST can be an engine of growth for job 
creation and economic renewal. It would attract hotels, office 
buildings, convention centres, restaurants and other commercial 
and tourist activities.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	During the election campaign, the finance minister 
acknowledged the structural erosion in Montreal and made a 
commitment to look for ways and means of solving this 
problem. He made the following diagnosis: the industrial 
structure of Montreal is obsolete and fragile and it is not being 
replaced by new, dynamic, and technologically interesting 
manufacturing industries. Why is it that the government does 
not take any action consistent with this diagnosis?
<P>
	The HST would be an industrial force for Canada and Quebec. 
Our standard of living and our competitiveness depend on 
decisions we make now. We cannot sign away our future by 
rejecting the high-speed train or any other infrastructure project 
of this kind. Time is running out. If governments act right now, 
we will have a strategic lead on the North American high-speed 
train market. There are 20 projects of this type in the United 
States, a market estimated at more than $200 billion for the next 
15 to 20 years. If we are the first on the market, our businesses 
will benefit from exports of technology.
<P>
	The Canadian government must have a long-term vision and 
restart the economy by implementing innovative projects. The 
high-speed train seems to be a much better way to create jobs 
creation and increase competitiveness for a lower public 
investment level.
<P>
	Furthermore, we must also ensure that productivity gains 
made by using new equipment, for example, in forestry, do not 
benefit only investors. These people have a right to make 
profits, but we must at the same time invest in tomorrow's 
forests, thus allowing the workers who were replaced by 
machines to work in tree planting, which will prevent in the 
medium-term stock shortages like those which fishermen are 
cruelly experiencing at the present time.
<P>
	If we do not learn from the fisheries example, we will face the 
same problems in forestry 20 years from now. Above all, we will 
cause a serious social crisis in regions where traditional forestry 
communities have maintained a balance between production 
capacities and the growth of the forest. Given the new 
machinery now in use, other means must be developed to 
counterbalance the increase in production, or tree felling, 
through adequate forestation techniques. A skilled workforce is 
ready to take over such trades, but these people will never enrol 
in high-technology training programs. They are qualified  for 
forest jobs, which I think we should provide them with.
<P>
	Canada's slow recovery from the recession is also indicative 
of the inability of the federal system to face the increasingly 
deep changes sweeping the global economic order. 
Jurisdictional conflicts, overlap and duplication, and 
bureaucratic centralization all contribute to our slow responses 
and to the inefficiency of the measures taken. Think of the 
infrastructure program! I agree that this program is very good in 
itself, but when it takes three governments to decide whether or 
not a stretch of sidewalk should be laid in a village, I think 
efficiency is definitely lacking.
<P>
	On top of jurisdictional conflicts, unemployment is a problem 
which is even more apparent to me on my riding tours. The 
unemployed need training programs, but the whole array of 
programs confuses them, not for lack of the required brochures, 
not because civil servants neglect their jobs, but because too 
many governments play a part in this jungle, and we have not 
really developed the tools which would allow us to reach the 
unemployed in serious need of adequate training programs.
<P>
	There are 1.5 million unemployed in Canada, but only some 
600,000 available jobs. That imbalance stems from the system's 
inability to adapt rapidly to emerging manpower needs.
<P>
	Moreover, Canada has not solved its regional disparity 
problem, in spite of all the efforts made during the last 30 years: 
federal-provincial agreements, federal economic intervention 
in provincial fields of jurisdiction, and grant programs. Again 
last week, the whole issue of regional development in Canada 
came up once more, because we turned away from real 
solutions, which require assigning responsibilities, powers and 
the appropriate level of government's ability to tax.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	The problem has not been not solved since the solution lies in 
deep structural changes which have yet to be settled after 30 
years of constitutional debate. Some will say that Canadians do 
not want to hear about the Constitution. However, they want to 
put an end to the personal difficulties encountered by those 
unemployed individuals searching for jobs, whom they meet 
everyday. It is for us to propose solutions. Social program 
reform is part of the same logic that brought about the disastrous 
conditions we are experiencing today.
<P>
	To conclude, I feel that the government should learn from the 
past. In order to allow his country to emerge from the Great 
Depression of the thirties, President Franklin Roosevelt did not 
hesitate to look for new ways to restore confidence among 
Americans. He undertook important programs, such as the one 
in the Tennessee Valley, which restored the confidence of the 
American people. Essentially, one only needs to have the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2600"> 2600 </A></B>
<P>
political will and the necessary vision to put Quebecers and 
Canadians back to work.
<P>
	To build a society, one needs the participation of all human 
resources and a revolutionary change in attitudes and practices 
in order to allow each segment of this society to build its 
development on its strengths.
<P>
	The present government was not elected to act as the steward 
of Canada. It was elected to turn things around and to give to 
Quebecers and Canadians a sense of pride in their achievements. 
There is still time to act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
the day after the Academy Awards the remarks of the hon. 
member opposite are interesting in the sense that they were very 
flashy. It was a good performance.
<P>
	I tried to follow his logic. I had problems listening to the 
litany of events historically and of statistics quoted by him in the 
early part of his speech which he attributes to the repercussions 
on job creation. Like most members of the party opposite he 
always refers to Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	I have a question but I want to draw an analogy first. I live in a 
border riding not far from the city of Detroit. In the late 1960s 
we saw in Detroit the rise of the city state, a city at that time of 
some six million people, not unlike the province of Quebec in 
terms of population. In the late 1960s we saw the rise of a certain 
economic pride in the black community. We saw the rise of a 
saviour by the name of Mr. Coleman Young who became the 
mayor of Detroit. Mr. Young promised the people of Detroit that 
he would lead them out of the wilderness into some sort of 
economic nirvana.
<P>
	In 1993 Mr. Coleman Young decided he would not run again; 
at 75 years of age he had had it. At the same time we find that the 
population of Detroit has declined. The economic base has 
declined and I ask the simple question why. It was the so-called 
city state, this type of nationalism that arose in that city that 
killed business. In fact development did occur in the state of 
Michigan. It did occur in the United States but it did not occur in 
Detroit because of the economic policies of that city.
<P>
	Using the analogy that there is a certain element of 
nationalism, much like in the city state of Detroit in the late 
1960s, will this have a repercussion on job creation, the 465,000 
people he claims to be unemployed in the province of Quebec-I 
do not dispute that number-and are the policies of his party 
also not contributing to that uncertainty, the creation of the 
mentality that nobody wants to invest in the province of Quebec 
because of the policies put forward by his party?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should know that I 
talked not so much about the actual government's policy but 
rather its lack of policy regarding job creation.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	As for nationalism which the member mentioned without 
going into specifics, he was probably referring to the 
nationalism of Pierre Trudeau who, by creating the Foreign 
Investment Review Agency, caused serious investment 
problems in Canada, problems which had to be corrected in 
order to restore Canada's international image. My colleague was 
probably referring to that kind of nationalism.
<P>
	As for pride, I think we have shown in Quebec that despite the 
current system's shortcomings we were able to develop 
instruments for capital funds management. For example, the 
influence of the Mouvement Desjardins and the Fonds de 
solidarité des travailleurs has been such that, whereas Ontario 
members of the industry committee are trying, in a roundabout 
manner, to find ways to enrol them in a way that will allow them 
to get closer to contractors, in Quebec we have already found a 
solution to that problem.
<P>
	We have also found a solution to another problem, namely 
worker consultation and everyone in Quebec, be it employers, 
union members, the government or political parties is asking for 
the patriation of the jurisdiction on labour. There is a unanimous 
agreement on that. Therefore, a sound nationalism is compatible 
with positions that further a society's progress.
<P>
	Let us not forget that our nationalism has also permitted North 
America to sign the Free Trade Agreement because Quebec is 
the province that gave the most active support to the agreement 
and contributed the most to the initiative that will create a 
certain economic boom in North America. In that sense I can be 
proud of what we have accomplished.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope the previous 
speaker from the Reform Party listened to my hon. colleague 
because he would have learned something about history that my 
hon. friend mentioned and that I was going to mention earlier. 
We had a depression when the law of supply and demand held 
sway in the country, on this continent and in the world. We had a 
mini replay of the thirties in the eighties. We got heated up and 
there was to be no tomorrow. Interest rates went as high as 19 per 
cent.
<P>
	My question has to do with the jurisdictional wars I heard 
about. In the House committee I am serving on we are working at 
harmonizing matters between departments and levels of 
government, not having wars. The infrastructure program was 
very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2601"> 2601 </A></B>
<P>
careful in putting decision making at the local level, at the 
municipal level, and that is where it is. I have seen no evidence 
of jurisdictional wars.
<P>
	Perhaps my hon. friend does not have that kind of 
co-operation in his riding. I do in my riding. People are very 
pleased with the fact that they are deciding at the grassroots 
level where the money is to go.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe it would be appropriate to 
repeat my position on infrastructures to make sure it is well 
understood.
<P>
	To provide this country with adequate infrastructures is fine 
and is something we need. However, the present Canadian 
system calls for too much manoeuvering between the three 
levels of government-federal, provincial and local 
governments-which have an input in decisions that, in my 
opinion, should be taken at local level only. Without laying on 
the table that the one solution is sovereignty, it is clear that the 
centralized decision-making process is a problem in Canada, 
one which we have tried to bypass in many ways. In terms of 
regional development, departments were established in order to 
be able to deal directly with clients because the federal 
bureaucracy could not reach those regions.
<P>
	Therefore, there is a structural problem. And the federalists 
should have a vision about what they can do to be more efficient 
and effective and stop developing tools aimed at making 
governments more visible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a brief comment. As the hon. member was 
speaking about rapid transit, modern communications and rail 
fast track, I too could sympathize with those thoughts. Coming 
from Nova Scotia, we would like to have a better transportation 
system. We believe that rail is far more sustainable than 
highway. We are looking in those same directions.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	However, what puzzles me is that as the member talks he 
sounds as if he is talking as a federalist, as a complete Canadian 
nationalist. He wants railways to go from Quebec to Ontario. He 
wants them to be sustainable, to serve all Canadians. I am 
wondering how this serves Canada and at the same time how he 
can separate his thoughts from the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, if having a vision means that we are 
looking for the economic development of Quebec and Canada in 
an adequate and coordinated way, whether federalist or else, I 
am saying that when Quebec is sovereign, there will still be 
transportation needs to and from Canada, the United States, 
Mexico, South America, Europe, every part of the world. Since 
we will always need tools, we might as well have the best.
<P>
	In 1867, the Canada compromise was based on the east-west 
road. Why not redefine the territories, the jurisdictions and say 
that Quebec is a country and Canada is another one, and that the 
high-speed train could serve as one of the main communication 
links between those two countries?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Catterall (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very glad 
to have the opportunity to address the members of this House 
and to reply on this motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The motion would condemn the government for a lack of 
vision in the area of job creation. I would like to comment on 
this point. A motion saying that the House should deplore the 
government's lack of vision and lack of concrete measures 
relating to job creation policies shows very little vision and very 
little concrete policies in and of itself.
<P>
	It is a very shortsighted motion and a very shortsighted view 
of the program the government has placed before Parliament. 
All members of the House know what major issues are facing the 
country: the economy, the deficit and job creation. These are 
easy to see.
<P>
	We have the example of previous governments that chose to 
address one or another of these problems at the expense of the 
others. Recent history has proven that an attack on the deficit 
only aggravates problems in the other areas, stifles economic 
growth, makes fewer jobs available to Canadians, and makes the 
deficit worse. Our view is that we must see the interdependence 
of all different problems we are trying to solve. This requires 
actions based on an integrated plan or a vision.
<P>
	Our plan is to provide support to the economy, to reduce the 
deficit as quickly as possible without handcuffing economic 
recovery and to create jobs in the process. By keeping a keen eye 
on the process and the progress of each of the government's 
initiatives we know we will see results.
<P>
	We as a government have put before the House and before 
Canadians a first step. It will not solve everything overnight, but 
it will provide a basis upon which we can build. It is the first step 
to economic recovery, to the well-being of individual Canadians 
and to the elimination of the deficit.
<P>
	We have listened to Canadians. We are implementing our plan 
which includes jobs and growth. During the election campaign 
we were very clear about the solutions we were proposing. We 
are following through on them. One of the best and most visible 
examples is the infrastructure works program, a government 
program to rebuild the country's infrastructure over the next 
three years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2602"> 2602 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The infrastructure program is a shared-cost initiative to 
which each level of government in Canada-federal, provincial, 
territorial and municipal-will contribute $2 billion, for a total 
of $6 billion over the next two years. There will also be some 
flexibility so as to allow limited financing in the third year. The 
program is based on the collaboration of all levels of 
government in supporting infrastructure investment. The 
private sector will also be invited to invest in these public 
initiatives if their investments are considered useful to local 
governments.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	The federal funds have already been divided among provinces 
and territories according to a formula based on the population 
and unemployment rate of each. I might add that that formula 
was approved by the First Ministers last December. Each 
province and territory will match the federal government's 
contribution, as will municipal and local governments.
<P>
	The infrastructure program is intended to stimulate the 
economic recovery while responding to the need for 
infrastructure renewal and improvement in Canada. In this way, 
the program should help municipalities and communities to use 
new, efficient and environmentally sound technology while 
improving competitiveness and productivity.
<P>
	We noticed a major reduction in the amounts spent for public 
infrastructure in Canada. In 1960, our three levels of 
government invested 4.3 per cent of the gross domestic product 
in fixed capital, but by 1980 it had dropped to 2.5 per cent.
<P>
	Members opposite stress that right now, our financial 
resources are too tight to invest in infrastructure. We, on this 
side, do not agree at all with them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The health of our cities and towns is absolutely central to the 
health of our economies. Good, efficient roads and 
transportation services reduce costs to individuals and 
businesses, avoiding expensive tie-ups, reducing wear and tear 
on vehicles, reducing operating costs. In the same way modern 
water and sewage systems are vital for servicing industry and 
commerce, as well as for the health of Canadians and the health 
of our environment. Without such services our communities 
cannot attract new industries or maintain the industries they 
have; local economies stagnate and communities die.
<P>
	Our infrastructure has started to deteriorate and it will only 
continue to deteriorate. We have heard much about leaving a 
debt to our country and to our children. The cost of replacing 
infrastructure we do not maintain is far greater than the cost of 
maintaining it. If we do not do something now the debt we will 
be leaving our children is in collapsing sewers, unsafe water 
supplies, corroded bridges and crumbling roads.
<P>
	There are longer term benefits to improving the infrastructure 
and the quality of life Canadians have come to expect. Improved 
infrastructure means improved environmental quality and 
improved amenities. It is vital to our quality of life, whether 
creating a clean and pleasant environment or a hospitable 
environment for working, living and doing business.
<P>
	There are major issues in each of our cities that require urgent 
investment in infrastructure to remain competitive. These 
projects are needed to allow Canada and communities across the 
country to remain competitive and to continue enjoying the 
Canadian quality of life.
<P>
	Our goal is to develop economic, social and technological 
infrastructure to support the efforts of all Canadians to make 
Canada stronger in coming years. Infrastructure works is a 
national program. We are investing in each province and 
territory. The provinces and the territories, as well as the 
municipalities, are matching our investment.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	The infrastructure program is now a reality. Framework 
agreements have been signed with all partners, getting Canada's 
three levels of government working together for jobs and 
working together for Canadians. It is a tribute to the government 
that within barely two months of taking office we were able to 
get all the partners to the table and get the agreements.
<P>
	People across Canada are interested in our country's 
economic well-being. They have businesses they want to keep 
working. The needs and commitment of these Canadians are 
also necessary to achieving the goals of the program.
<P>
	All members have realized that in one way or another this 
program will affect their ridings and their constituents. All 
could probably list from memory a number of worthwhile 
projects that have been brought to their attention by the people 
who elected them. Not only will these projects be good for 
communities but they will also give a boost to the businesses in 
those communities. In each of those communities these projects 
will put people back to work. There will be jobs for people who 
are not working right now. This is job creation where it matters: 
in the homes, in the businesses and in the neighbourhoods right 
across Canada.
<P>
	In every province projects will be submitted to a joint 
management committee by municipalities, by school boards and 
by other local groups. This means that the local level, the 
communities across Canada will be the key to the program. The 
projects that local governments are willing to approve, the 
projects that local communities identify as their priorities, will 
be the projects that make up infrastructure works.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2603"> 2603 </A></B>
<P>
	This is truly rebuilding Canada from the grassroots up, 
rebuilding Canada in a democratic and equal way across the 
country.
<P>
	There is also a responsibility in this program for every 
member of the House. Members can discuss with their town and 
city councils their local priorities, their local needs so they 
understand them and give them the support they can.
<P>
	People will ask what infrastructure is. By agreement with 
each of the provinces it has been defined as the physical capital 
assets of our communities. That means the physical capital 
assets of the nation, with an emphasis on physical infrastructure 
associated with municipal services at the local level, things like 
water treatment, water distribution systems, sewage and 
drainage, roads and other transport facilities, buildings, 
machinery, equipment, earth works, related construction 
activities.
<P>
	It can go further. The program has the flexibility to include 
smart infrastructure such as information highways or social, 
cultural and other economic priorities.
<P>
	We have heard a great deal about government getting out of 
the way of businesses. A number of members of the House are 
obviously not aware that this program has the endorsement of 
the industry associations that will be involved in doing this 
work. The government does not go out and build roads and 
bridges. Companies across the country go out and build roads 
and bridges. We are giving them the opportunity to work again.
<P>
	We hear a great deal from the opposition about listening to 
people and representing our constituents. Therefore I find it 
hard to understand why parts of the opposition have so much 
trouble listening to the people and the level of government that 
is closest to those constituents in their local towns, villages, 
townships and counties. These are the people who for 10 years 
have been asking their national government to take the 
leadership to bring all three levels of government together to 
rebuild the infrastructure of Canada. They continue to be strong 
supporters of the program, as do the business associations that 
will be involved in implementing the program.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	The framework agreements specify the criteria that must be 
met for project approval: incremental and/or acceleration of 
investment; short and long term job creation; enhancing 
Canada's economic competitiveness; use of sound, innovative, 
smart technologies; bringing infrastructure up to community 
standards. Also included in the criteria are: codes and bylaws; 
enhancing long term skills in the workforce; enhancing 
environmental quality and sustainability; the use of sound, 
innovative, financial techniques, including the use of private 
capital and distribution of program benefits within a province or 
territory.
<P>
	Yes, there will be an evaluation component so that when we 
reach the end of the program and as it proceeds we will know 
what it is accomplishing. This program will put people back to 
work this construction season. We will see 50,000 to 65,000 
direct jobs and many more indirect jobs as suddenly 
construction workers and others in related industries have 
money in their pockets. They will have the money to go out and 
buy goods and services and to contribute to the public treasury 
as well.
<P>
	A great deal of the initial $2 billion investment we have made 
will come right back to the government and to the people of 
Canada through the contributions of those people who are now 
working on this program instead of being unemployed.
<P>
	From across the House we also hear a disparagement of 
construction jobs as if these are only old style job creation 
schemes and not real work for people. I am sorry, but somebody 
who digs a ditch, who operates a crane, who moves cement 
blocks, who puts a trowel to bricks is doing valuable, important 
and constructive work for this nation. We are proud of the jobs 
we are going to be creating. The people who will have those jobs 
will be proud of them.
<P>
	We have heard that unemployment figures are up. 
Unemployment figures are up because this among other 
programs is bringing hope back to the country. People who have 
kept away from the job market are coming back because they 
believe now, with a new government in place, there may be a job 
for them.
<P>
	The government believes it should keep its promises and put 
Canadians back to work. We ask for support, not criticism, from 
the other side of the House as we try to do that. By launching this 
infrastructure program we are helping the economic growth, 
helping Canadians get back to work and helping to reduce our 
deficit.
<P>
	I truly hope that when motions come forward from the 
opposition, if they cannot be totally laudatory of our programs at 
least they might be more constructive.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I listened carefully to my Liberal colleague's speech and there 
are a few comments I would like to make.
<P>
	First a general comment followed by a case in point. This 
government does not promote job creation as it said it would 
during the 45 days of the election campaign, and in its now 
defunct red book. I think the red book can be thrown out, 
considering the latest Budget brought down by the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	Of course, the infrastructure program will create between 
45,000 and 60,000 jobs, depending on whom you talk to. 
However, what are 45,000 jobs, compared with 1.5 million 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2604"> 2604 </A></B>
<P>
unemployed Canadians, including 428,000 Quebecers? These 
45,000 jobs, the cornerstone of the platform of the Liberal Party 
of Canada, are peanuts.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not realize that this measure is totally 
inadequate and provides no structural improvement of the 
employment situation? Does she not realize that all the 
measures taken by her government since the morning of October 
26 have clearly compromised job creation and this country's 
economic recovery?
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I will give you a few examples which I have 
found particularly revealing since we took up our duties on the 
morning of October 26.
<P>
	First of all, her government, after spending years criticizing 
the high-interest policies pursued by our defunct Conservatives, 
has now opted for the same policy. This means that as soon as 
there is the slightest increase in inflationary trends, of the kind 
we saw in the first quarter of 1990, the new Governor of the 
Bank of Canada will administer exactly the same horse medicine 
as his predecessor, which was vigorously condemned by the 
present government. What does this mean? It means that as soon 
as there is the slightest hint of economic growth, interest rates 
will rise, and this will undermine job creation.
<P>
	Second, since this government came to power, it has failed to 
correct the laissez faire approach taken by the budget in recent 
years. The latest Budget brought down by the Minister of 
Finance is a failure as far as control of public spending is 
concerned. So much so, in fact, that financial circles are starting 
to express concern about the government's lack of control. This 
means that we can soon expect an increase in the rates of interest 
charged on government borrowing, a trend that may continue in 
the foreseeable future.
<P>
	I repeat, the government is undermining job creation, 
although for months, if not years, it has been saying that the 
Liberal Party of Canada is a party that promotes job creation. It 
is part of the tenets of the red book as well.
<P>
	Third, Mr. Speaker, as you know, the present government 
insists on playing a role in manpower training, although this 
comes under the jurisdiction of Quebec and the other Canadian 
provinces. When it goes on about job creation being so terribly 
important, the fact is that by not withdrawing from this area, the 
Liberal government is undermining our chances of creating 
durable jobs and quality employment in the years to come.
<P>
	How can members on the other side of the House say that the 
government is doing something about creating jobs, when the 
infrastructure program is merely a drop in the bucket, 
considering one and a half million Canadians are unemployed, 
and when the government takes the kind of measures it does in 
this Budget?
<P>
	Another point I would like to raise, if I may, Mr. Speaker, is 
that on the other side of the House they keep saying they are 
doing something about unemployment and want to intensify the 
measures that will create jobs. What we find in the last Budget is 
more like a planned attack against the unemployed, because in 
the next three years, the government is going to take a little more 
than $5.5 billion out of their pockets.
<P>
	That is how the government wants to create jobs and attack 
poverty, while refusing to restore the budget for social housing, 
for instance, as it has been promising for years. If that is the way 
it wants to improve the well-being of Canadians, as it did by 
attacking old age security pensions and tax credits for the 
elderly, well, Mr. Speaker, I am truly astonished that the hon. 
member is still proud to be part of a government that is as far to 
the right as its Conservative predecessors if not more so.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Catterall:</B> First of all, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
my hon. colleague for his speech. I regret that I do not have time 
to respond to all of the statements made, but I will do my best.
<P>
	Yes, it is true that the infrastructure program is just the first of 
many more initiatives to come. We acknowledge that this is only 
the first step, a building block, but one that will create jobs in an 
industry that is truly the cornerstone of the economy, namely the 
construction industry. Therefore, it is very important to begin 
here because projects can start immediately.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	These initiatives will create both direct and indirect jobs.
<P>
	The hon. member spoke of controlling public spending. This 
government has slashed $17 billion from its expenditures. I 
would like to ask my colleague opposite the following question: 
Which programs would he cut? In which areas would he reduce 
spending and which Canadians would feel the effects of these 
cuts?
<P>
	The hon. member also spoke about training for all Canadians. 
He knows very well that current programs are, by our own 
admission, inadequate. We have called for broad program 
reforms, for example, integrating training programs with social 
programs. The hon. member knows that we are currently seeking 
input from the Canadian public on ways to improve programs. 
We will continue to follow this course of action.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned unemployment insurance 
recipients. While we may have reduced our spending in this 
area, our goal is to provide improved service to the unemployed 
who have lower incomes.
<P>
	Getting back to another point, the hon. member said we failed 
to control spending. Now, he is criticizing one of our spending 
control initiatives. Again, I ask him: Where would he have cut? 
Which Canadians would have been affected?
<P>

<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The debate between the 
hon. Parliamentary Secretary and the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot is a very interesting one, but other 
members should be given an opportunity to speak.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the time remaining, approximately five minutes to the 
parliamentary secretary, I would like to recognize two members 
who are seeking the floor. I will first recognize the member for 
Lisgar-Marquette and we will come back to the member for 
York-Simcoe.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
enjoyed the remarks of the hon. member from the Liberal 
government. I would like to give some constructive criticism.
<P>
	When the infrastructure program was announced I thought 
right away it was becoming too political. It was not really for job 
creation. When I saw a $27 million grant being made to Quebec 
City for a convention centre even before the guidelines were laid 
out I was frustrated with the program.
<P>
	This is my concern right now. I was just informed by some 
constituents in Manitoba who talk to me quite regularly on this 
issue that the provincial government now seems to have control 
of about 40 per cent of that money designated to Manitoba. It is 
not really going to go to the communities where these projects 
are desperately needed. It is becoming a political issue in 
Manitoba because of the provincial election due there in the next 
year.
<P>
	I would like the government to look at this and maybe change 
some of the guidelines if that is the problem. It will not be 
infrastructure for the benefit of the taxpayers; it will be 
infrastructure for the benefit of provincial governments. That 
worries me a bit. Could the member comment on that, please?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be quite happy to 
comment on that. As I said, one of the strengths of this program 
is that it is all three levels of government working together. 
When projects come forward such as the one in Quebec City that 
he mentioned it is because that is seen as the priority of the local 
community for its long term economic development and health.
<P>
	Similarly, while we have worked out agreements with all the 
provinces and territories based on exactly the same principles I 
enunciated, there is flexibility within each province and 
territory to meet the requirements of that community. That 
respects the diversity of this country and the different needs 
across Canada, the different needs of different kinds of 
communities.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	The minister has made it quite clear that members of 
Parliament have a role to play in this. Not just government 
members of Parliament but all members of Parliament will be 
consulted about the program and its use in their own 
communities. All members' views will be  sought and taken 
seriously. I can assure the member of that.
<P>
	If the member feels there is a problem I urge him to speak to 
me or the minister responsible for the infrastructure program. If 
it is truly a problem we will try and do something about it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have just a few comments.
<P>
	I want to congratulate the parliamentary secretary for her very 
articulate and comprehensive outline of the infrastructure 
program. I want to reiterate some of the points that she made in 
her speech to the members in the House.
<P>
	It is important to note that infrastructure is very important to 
the economic well-being of this country as well as to the health 
and the environmental sustainability of our communities. As 
vice-chair of the parliamentary committee on environment and 
sustainable development I am very concerned about those 
issues. The parliamentary secretary was very good in her 
explanation of how new sewers and things like that can enhance 
the health and well-being of our communities.
<P>
	When one takes a look at it in the long term, when one can get 
rid of some of the problems that may cause illness and problems 
associated with health as well as environmental pollution, that 
can make a substantial saving in our deficit.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member has just 
emphasized the point that this is an investment in the long term 
health, economic and otherwise, of our communities. She is 
absolutely right. If we allow untreated sewage to be put into our 
lakes and rivers and to be dumped on our landfill sites we simply 
end up leaving our children and grandchildren much bigger and 
much more expensive problems than we have now.
<P>
	Any member of this House can look around their own 
community and find perfect examples of where, had problems of 
contamination been prevented, it would have been far cheaper 
than trying to clean up those problems after they occurred. I 
thank her for raising the point.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I rise today to participate in this crucial 
debate, given the current social and economic situation in 
Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague the hon. 
member for Mercier who has introduced on behalf of the 
Official Opposition this motion denouncing the lack of 
innovation, imagination and vision of this government in terms 
of job creation, because we must realize the magnitude of this 
problem in this country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2606"> 2606 </A></B>
<P>
	In January 1994, unemployment in Canada was still hovering 
around 11.5 per cent and 12.5 per cent in Quebec. This means 
that there are currently 1.6 million unemployed individuals in 
Canada, 425,000 of whom are in Quebec. That is unacceptable 
and honest minds will see this constitutes an emergency, a 
situation which calls for action, concerted action.
<P>
	The Liberal Party of Canada apparently understood this at the 
time-because timing is important here-of drafting the red 
book presented to the voters during the October 1993 election 
campaign.
<P>
	On page 15, you can read the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-Canadians are facing hardship: 1.6 million unemployed, millions on 
welfare, a million children living below the poverty line, record numbers of 
bankruptcies and plant closings.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our overriding preoccupation is to offer a government that will help in solving 
problems and in creating opportunities for Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	``Jobs, jobs, jobs'' was their theme. A catch phrase that the 
people of Canada heard over and over, raising the hopes of 
many, particularly in Atlantic Canada and Ontario, that the 
government would finally see to it, as promised, that this 
hardship be alleviated as mentioned earlier.
<P>
	At this time, I would like to digress for a moment to deplore 
the fact that this type of conduct seems to have become 
contagious. When we see Quebec Premier Daniel Johnson 
making easy, demagogic promises over which he has no control, 
there is a common denominator: everywhere we find Liberals 
who do such things. But have no fear, Mr. Speaker, Quebecers 
know the score; they are not so naive and will not be fooled; they 
will be able to judge those who have been in office for nine years 
and who let this situation deteriorate.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Let us return to the federal scene, which is our immediate 
concern. What are the Liberals doing now about the 
commitments they made in their red book? What about it, Mr. 
Speaker? There is a huge gap between what they say and write 
and what they do. What has come out of these commitments? A 
coast-to-coast infrastructure program, in which the government 
will invest $2 billion, it seems, with the co-operation of the 
provincial and municipal governments. How many jobs will we 
create for the 1,600,000 unemployed? It seems that we will 
create 45,000 temporary jobs. How many in Quebec for its 
425,000 unemployed? Fifteen thousand temporary jobs. You 
should realize that this is what this government has proposed to 
meet its commitments: 45,000 temporary jobs, which include 
not only jobs that are created but also jobs that are maintained.
<P>
	Of course, there is the Youth Service Corps that is also 
mentioned in the red book. Here is what it says on page 35: No 
group faces bleaker economic prospects than Canadians under 
25. A Liberal government will help return hope to young 
Canadians by creating the Canadian Youth Service Corps, which 
will involve 10,000  young people a year. Mr. Speaker, do you 
know how many people under 25 were unemployed in Canada 
last month? There were 428,000 unemployed Canadians under 
25, 18 per cent of this age group in the labour force, and this 
percentage and this number are increasing every month. What 
do they propose? A youth service corps with a fourfold mandate: 
community service; discovering and understanding Canada, as 
my colleague, the member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, said 
last week in this House; environmental awareness; and personal 
growth.
<P>
	That is very nice, it is well intentioned, but we have seen other 
Katimaviks, we have seen other schemes dreamed up by 
senators, but that is not what Canadians and Quebecers need, 
especially the young people we were just talking about. They 
need specific job creation measures to meet their needs, to give 
them back their dignity and, in the case of young people, to give 
them back their collective future and their personal future.
<P>
	We do not need projects like Katimavik, but we know how 
interesting it could be before a referendum to take young people 
who are vulnerable, especially in Quebec, and give them the 
proper conditioning to show how much people care about them 
and how good it is to live in this very democratic country that 
has no work for them. We know all that can be done with that 
target group to win some more votes to keep Quebec dependent 
on Canada.
<P>
	In these two cases, faced with the same unemployment 
problem, we see the very serious problem of joblessness 
affecting the Canadian economy and the people of Canada. All 
that this government has been able to find so far are 
half-measures, the infrastructure program and the youth service 
corps, things that skirt around the issue, that do not really solve 
the problem but that can be described as a sort of smoke screen, 
pseudo-solutions for problems that the government seems 
completely unable to solve, despite its claims.
<P>
	The same goes for the information highway, a scientific and 
technological project, but what are they doing about it? What is 
the action plan? What funds are being allocated to it? All we 
know is that since October 25, 1993, the minister concerned, the 
Minister of Industry, recently appointed an advisory committee 
that will study the information highway, behind closed doors. 
Meanwhile, our American neighbours apparently have a fairly 
well-defined action plan, which has the full support of the U.S. 
Vice President.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Without knowing where we are going, we have appointed an 
advisory committee that, until further notice, will meet behind 
closed doors: such is Canada's electronic highway, Mr. Speaker. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2607"> 2607 </A></B>
<P>
This illustrates very well the attitude of this government; we do 
not know where it has been nor where it is going.
<P>
	Regarding these commitments, we can honestly say without 
fear of being mistaken that this government has disappointed us, 
that it is beyond the hopes it had raised or tried to raise among 
Canadians with respect to infrastructure and the Youth Service 
Corps; it has only addressed unemployment in science and 
technology in the manner we just mentioned. The government is 
letting us down.
<P>
	I would now like to speak to an issue I am particularly 
interested in as industry critic: industrial conversion. Let us 
refer once again to the red book stating the government's 
intentions in this area and others. On page 55 we read this: ``The 
defence industries today employ directly and indirectly over 
100,000 Canadians. The end of the Cold War puts at risk tens of 
thousands of high-tech jobs. A Liberal government will 
introduce a defence conversion program to help industries in 
transition from high-tech military production to high-tech 
civilian production''.
<P>
	That was the vision, the intentions of the Liberal Party of 
Canada in terms of industrial conversion. It was a wise, 
enlightened vision of the situation but unfortunately, after this 
document was released, we never heard again of this 
government's so-called vision or intention to encourage the 
conversion of military production to civilian production.
<P>
	Yet, this sector is in dire straits. Between 1987 and 1992, the 
deliveries of arms manufactured in Quebec fell by more than 48 
per cent, almost by half, from $1.6 billion in 1987 to $810 
million in 1992.
<P>
	Businesses in the defence industry are value-added high-tech 
manufacturing ventures where salaries are high. The number of 
Quebecers working in arms production is estimated at over 
46,000. Electronics, aerospace, general transport and EDP are 
the most active sectors in the defence industry. The major 
defence companies are very well known: Bombardier, CAE, 
SNC, Lavalin, Pratt &amp; Whitney, Bell Helicopter, Expro, Héroux, 
Marconi, Paramax.
<P>
	All these companies were successful in finding their niche in 
an international competitive environment. Together, they are 
responsible for over one quarter of all the research and 
development work done in the Montreal region. They have 
always enjoyed the federal government's financial support to 
develop defence capacities.
<P>
	This shows how the conversion of these defence companies, 
given the geopolitical changes occurring all over the globe, is 
important, especially in Quebec, to maintain a healthy 
high-tech industry.
<P>
	During the election campaign, the Liberals made four major 
commitments regarding industrial conversion. First, to expand 
the mandate of the Defence Industry Productivity Program or 
DIPP, to help the industry convert and diversify, a $150 million 
program. Second, to establish an economic conversion 
commission, with the participation of industry and labour, to 
facilitate and  coordinate the process of conversion in the 
defence industry. Third, to develop joint conversion 
arrangements with the United States, the market for 80 per cent 
of our defence exports, in order to establish a concerted 
conversion strategy. Fourth, the conversion of Canadian 
military bases, for example in training centres for peacekeeping 
forces.
<P>
	As we saw earlier, the government's intentions were 
illustrated by the closure of military bases, without reference to 
any kind of conversion. As for the new mandate of DIPP, it is 
said in the budget speech that, indeed, this mandate will be 
expanded in three years to possibly include some form of 
assistance for conversion and diversification. But at the same 
time, the government says that in three years, and not right now, 
the budget allocated to that program will be reduced by $10 
million per year.
<P>
	One wonders why wait three years given the problems of that 
industry, a slowdown of all activities, a reduced number of 
contracts in general, as well as a need to transform that military 
industry into a civilian one.
<P>
	Moreover, we never again heard anything about this idea of 
setting up a commission to look at the conversion issue with the 
companies and workers affected.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Yet, there is in Quebec an example which seems to serve as a 
model for all researchers and university people interested in this 
issue. I am referring to EXPRO, a company specializing in 
military products, which is famous for having experienced all 
kinds of problems throughout its existence, including labour 
relations problems. When it realized that it was obviously and 
clearly in jeopardy, the company decided to come to grips with 
its problems, this with the support of its workers. It set up a 
manpower committee, made an in-depth review of the situation, 
hired consultants, established a diagnosis, and now EXPRO is a 
company with a civilian production instead of a military one. I 
think this is an example to follow. EXPRO is showing that where 
there is a will, there is a way.
<P>
	Yet, the situation is serious, and some members of the 
aerospace industry have already reacted to the government's 
intentions, and especially to its lack of vision, as illustrated by 
its decision to cut in the military sector and elsewhere, without 
having planned anything to make up for the impact of these 
measures.
<P>
	So, last week, representatives of this industry, who worry 
about the government's intentions, asked for an urgent meeting 
with the Minister of Industry to find out just what these 
intentions are and to discuss them with him. I am talking about 
such prestigious industries as CAE and SPAR Aerospace, which 
asked to meet with the minister because of the government's 
attitude and lack of planning. We do not know what transpired, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2608"> 2608 </A></B>
<P>
but we sense that there is a malaise in this industry regarding the 
government's actions, or lack of action.
<P>
	We have to be aware of the dangers which would threaten our 
economy should inertia, a lack of planning, or a lack of vision 
guide the government's actions and policies.
<P>
	There is a precedent in Canada. A very high-tech industry of 
the time-I am referring to the AVRO ARROW case in the 
fifties-had to cease operations, which resulted in thousands of 
Canadian engineers leaving the country to go to the United 
States, thus triggering a massive exodus of brain drain.
<P>
	If the government fails to take any action, the same will 
happen to the Canadian economy which, in a matter of a few 
years, may lose a very substantial number of qualified people 
who might otherwise have stayed here to try to turn the situation 
around.
<P>
	Furthermore, while in Canada there seems to be a conspiracy 
of silence in this respect, in the United States the Clinton 
administration plans to provide $20 billion in assistance over 
the next five years for defence conversion. Here in Canada, $150 
million will be spent over the next few years on defence 
research, and this $150 million will decrease by $10 million 
annually, starting in 1996-97. There is a difference in vision 
between the two administrations which is enormous.
<P>
	What is particularly exasperating, and shocking as well, is 
that there are plenty of projects that could be converted. The 
Bloc Quebecois was very clear about that during the debate on 
cancelling the helicopter contract. It is not just cancelling the 
contract but knowing how we can make the best of the situation 
and convert a project that was rather questionable, from the 
military point of view, to civilian production that will benefit 
the population and ensure that the know-how will stay, in 
Quebec in this case, and that it will be used for civilian purposes 
and that the budgets will be maintained.
<P>
	At the time we said that after cancelling the helicopter 
contract, the government should proceed with construction of 
the high-speed train. The manufacturing process would require 
equally complex technology which would have made it possible 
for our researchers and scientists to stay here and continue to 
develop and do research, but this time for civilian industries. If 
the government were to go ahead with this project, it would be 
able to develop new expertise in a field with a very promising 
future, apparently, in North America, and Quebec and Canada 
would be able to capture a substantial part of the market so that 
the principal expertise in North America would be spread from 
Quebec City to Windsor, via Trois-Rivières. However, the 
project is on the back burner, and the government does not really 
know where it is headed in this respect. Once again, the 
government lacks vision. There is also the sad case which we 
will not forget, despite the government's apathy, namely the 
case of MIL Davie of Lauzon. This company, which built 
military vessels primarily for the Canadian government, is 
facing a situation where it will no longer receive any contracts 
because of the  government's decision to pull out of this field. 
The company has come up with its own conversion plan 
depending on the good will of the current government which 
could, if it wanted to, award the contract to build the Magdalen 
Island ferry to this shipyard.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	We learned again yesterday that the government does not 
know where it stands. It still does not know whether it will order 
a new ferry to be built or whether it will purchase one from a 
foreign shipyard. If the political will existed, the contract would 
have been awarded to MIL Davie a long time ago, since it has a 
conversion plan in place and has the facilities to build the ferry. 
If the government were to proceed on this, it would be killing 
two birds with one stone, that is it would be keeping our 
domestic know-how here in Canada and would be conducting 
research and development and converting former military 
facilities for civilian purposes.
<P>
	In conclusion, I have to wonder where all of this is leading. 
Clearly, this government is guilty of lacking vision and empathy 
for the situation experienced by hundreds of thousands of 
Canadians and Quebecers. This government does not know in 
which direction it is heading. It lacks not only vision, but also 
the political courage to address the real problems facing people.
<P>
	The red book is nothing more than smoke and mirrors. 
Personally, I am deeply disappointed and concerned because 
these are old methods which today have led to public cynicism. 
People realize that during election campaigns, candidates say 
just about anything. Once in office, however, they continue to 
provide the same kind of government and style of administration 
they once criticized. Nothing changes. This type of cynicism is 
encouraged and this contradicts the nice statements made in the 
red book.
<P>
	How is it that today's Liberals and yesterday's Tories seem to 
have so much in common? I will conclude on this note, Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps because there is a common denominator. Both 
parties are financed by the same persons. They both feed from 
the same trough and both produce the same results.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member speaks about Quebec youth and their 
vulnerability to federal Liberal programs.
<P>
	I would have to differ. I have great respect for the Quebec 
youth. I believe the young people of Quebec are just as 
intelligent, if not more so, than the rest of our young people in 
Canada. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2609"> 2609 </A></B>
<P>
We have smart, competitive, aggressive, intelligent young 
people throughout this country.
<P>
	He would suggest that the young people of Quebec are 
vulnerable, they are susceptible, they are less than knowing of 
what kind of program they might get into if they pay allegiance 
to the youth corps program. I disagree. I would give them more 
credit. The young people of Quebec are very intelligent and they 
will decide whether it is a good program or not. It is not 
incumbent upon us to suggest that they are not that intelligent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for her 
question. I do not think that we have to wonder if our young 
people are intelligent or not; we can take that for granted with 
the great performances recently turned in by Quebec youth 
internationally in the Olympics. We saw how competent and 
intelligent our young people could be.
<P>
	What gets me, and I refer to something that happened to us in 
the past, is everything the federal government could do when 
Quebecers were deciding their future. We know how much the 
federal government got involved. We had Katimavik with 
Senator Jacques Hébert at the time, all that can be done to give 
our young people a feeling of belonging to the Canada of today 
and tomorrow.
<P>
	We certainly know what the federal government tried to do in 
the 1980 referendum campaign. There was the Council on 
Canadian Unity through which the federal government got 
involved, although Quebec had a law limiting the ``yes'' and 
``no'' sides to $2 million each. The federal government's 
involvement in the 1980 referendum is estimated to have been 
between $15 and $20 million. We are expecting a similar kind of 
operation when we see the government, as if by chance, come up 
with a similar initiative called Youth Canada which seeks to 
promote better understanding of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	I repeat what your colleague, the member for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, said, a better understanding of 
Canada. He told us about the four main projects, the four major 
thrusts, and I think that in complete intellectual honesty we can 
suspect this government's intentions, what it intends to do about 
the future (of Quebec) and to make Quebec stay in 
Confederation, and as we say in Quebec, what are a few 
thousand bucks, Mr. Speaker, it never bothered them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for Trois-Rivières for his speech.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	He mentioned in it the real problem, le vrai problème. It 
seems that one of the real problems we are facing, the solution to 
which will help everyone in Canada and particularly I hope the 
young people to whom he refers, is simply getting the economy 
moving.
<P>
	I know that the member listened to the parliamentary 
secretary's remarks earlier about one aspect of the budget which 
was the infrastructure program. She stressed the jobs which will 
be created and she stressed the value for our economy in the 
future of improved infrastructure, as he knows.
<P>
	There is one aspect which relates to this business of getting 
the economy going that she did not stress greatly. That is that 
through the infrastructure program which affects Trois-Rivières 
as it does the riding of Peterborough, already capital is being 
released, capital which is already there.
<P>
	I do have a question about this, with respect for the hon. 
member for Trois-Rivières. In my riding for example, there is a 
seniors group which has already raised a great deal of money, 
some hundreds of thousands of dollars toward a new building. 
They are able to move on that building sooner than was the case 
before. I believe the flow of those moneys will help stimulate 
the economy.
<P>
	There is also an arts group which has done the same thing. It 
has not raised quite as much yet but these are moneys which are 
there which will be released into the economy because of the 
infrastructure program.
<P>
	Also in the public sector I would have to say one of the 
townships in my riding has money from dump fees. J'ignore 
l'expression française de ce terme.
<P>
	The township is in fact being paid for the discomfort of having 
a dump on its property. It has accumulated those fees and it is 
going to spend them constructively on local projects with some 
jobs and by the way local raw materials, sand and gravel and 
things of that type.
<P>
	Once these projects start, and in my riding we are talking 
about scores of construction projects in 17 or 18 townships, in 
the city, in the county, in the university and in the college, scores 
of these projects all starting when the frost is out of the ground. 
Again the wages will be paid, the wages will be spent. This 
capital which I have mentioned will flow across the country.
<P>
	If it scores in Peterborough, I do not know if it scores in the 
Trois-Rivières area, hundreds if not thousands of those projects 
will take place and all of them we hope will stimulate the 
economy and that will help the young people and all the people 
of Canada.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would care to comment on that point 
from the point of view of what is going to happen in 
Trois-Rivières once these projects start.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. We in the Bloc Quebecois are not against the 
infrastructure program. We are against it being the solution the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2610"> 2610 </A></B>
<P>
Liberal government seems to have found to deal with a very 
serious problem in this country with 1,600,000 unemployed 
people.
<P>
	I think this is easy to demonstrate. The government says it 
will create 45,000 temporary jobs, and we must remind you that 
when they talk about jobs, they talk about maintaining jobs; 
45,000 jobs created and maintained for 1,600,000 unemployed 
workers. I do not see how the hon. member for Peterborough can 
think this will solve in any way the situation in his riding. 
Assuming that unemployment should be around 10 per cent-it 
is now around 13 or 14 per cent in my riding of 
Trois-Rivières-it is no reason to rest easy and tell ourselves 
that the government is up to the task.
<P>
	Especially since-and I see the Minister of Human Resources 
is here-this same government is going after the unemployed 
rather than unemployment, the poor instead of poverty itself. 
We hear the government tell the poorest among us, those who are 
already in a bad spot, because unemployed workers are in a bad 
spot, that from now on they will get 55 per cent instead of 57 per 
cent of what they were earning and work longer to receive less, 
for a shorter period. I think they are going after those who are 
poorest.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	They say we must modernize and revamp-the words they use 
are exceptionally subtle in denoting intellectual honesty-our 
social programs. We do not know how but we do know one thing 
as I speak: the government was able to figure out how much it 
will cost in two or three years, so it can spare the public purse by 
going after the unemployed and the poor: $7.5 billion, including 
$5.5 billion in unemployment insurance. We know that already. 
That is what I rise against when I hear such comments.
<P>
	First of all, we have no real solution for reducing 
unemployment since the so-called infrastructure program is not 
a solution, it is not even a half-measure. At the same time, the 
government is going after those who are already hard pressed 
while leaving the richest Canadians alone. They create 
committees to examine whether their measures are justified or 
not. The time has come to review our thinking because the 
underlying process, as everyone is increasingly aware, is the 
disappearance of the middle class, like in an underdeveloped 
country with few rich people and a lot of poor people. This is 
what we think.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to speak at this time, particularly in light of the 
comments just made by the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	First of all, the motion before this House is incorrect and so 
are the comments made by the hon. member from the 
opposition. I will take this opportunity to set the record straight.
<P>
	For one thing, this year, there will be more jobs for Canadians, 
and particularly for Quebecers. The Conference Board said 
there could be as many as 57 per cent more jobs for Quebecers 
this year, as compared to last year.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the opposition fails to mention the positive 
initiatives, measures and efforts the government and the private 
sector have made to create employment across Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In saying that, I do not think we are here just to argue about 
figures. I think we are here to argue or talk about a very deep felt 
need by Canadians to have the opportunity to share in work, to 
have a sense of dignity, of making a contribution to their own 
and their family's well-being. The prospect, the hope for a job, 
for themselves and for their children is one of the great 
ambitions that we have always held out to Canadians.
<P>
	What is not recognized in anything I have heard or listened to 
by opposition members so far is any recognition whatsoever that 
the world of work has changed and that we cannot simply fall 
back on old methods, that we cannot simply defend the status 
quo, that we cannot simply argue on a rhetorical basis for what 
used to be.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I found particularly interesting, for example, this comment 
from the editorialist for <I>La Presse</I>, Mr. Alain Dubuc: ``Program 
reform is simply a must for everyone's sake. Lucien Bouchard is 
making himself the advocate for status quo''. And I would like 
to draw point out this line: ``Out of demagoguery or sheer 
narrow-mindedness, the Bloc Quebecois nationalists are 
turning into advocates for inflexibility and inertia''. How true! 
It is true that the members across the way are advocating 
inflexibility and inertia and using demagogical arguments.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is not a time for that kind of narrowness of spirit, that 
unwillingness to change, that attempt to exploit people's deep 
concerns for immediate partisan advantage.
<P>
	We have to talk about how to put a good employment strategy 
in place in this country, something that takes into account 
various elements. There is no single answer. There is no panacea 
for the creation of employment. It is something that is affecting 
every country and it is going to take a full, concerted, 
comprehensive approach.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2611"> 2611 </A></B>
<P>
	When I attended the job summit last week in Detroit where the 
seven major industrial countries were brought together, we 
talked about the fact that in those seven countries alone there 
were over 30 million people unemployed and the number is 
growing.
<P>
	In Europe there has not been any job creation or any growth at 
all for the past year or two. In the United States there is job 
creation but it is low level jobs, part time jobs, insecure jobs at a 
wage that is not reasonable to live on.
<P>
	The Canadian answer is to find a balance somewhere between 
the two. We must make sure there is growth and job creation, 
that we stimulate the economy, that we provide a boost in the 
private sector to give a new sense of momentum to the broad 
base of job creation that the private sector must provide. At the 
same time we must recognize that there are fundamental 
changes going on in the labour market, that it is not simply good 
enough to have a job at a minimum wage if that minimum wage 
is below the poverty line. It is not good enough to say to workers 
that they can have a 20-hour part time job if there are no benefits 
attached.
<P>
	Those are the kinds of questions we are wrestling with. 
Unfortunately members, particularly those in the Bloc 
Quebecois, do not want to face those issues. Their 
representative on the parliamentary committee refuses to deal 
with the fact that there must be some change. Instead they go 
out, organize a demonstration and say to keep things the way 
they are. If we stay with the status quo then the jobs will not be 
there, the income will not be there, and the opportunity will not 
be there.
<P>
	When this government is asked where is our vision, our vision 
is to undertake one of the largest, most comprehensive attacks 
on the question of unemployment ever seen in this country. We 
have initiated on a number of fronts a broad based employment 
strategy.
<P>
	We have already heard some of the measures that have been 
brought forward today. There is the infrastructure program 
which by estimates could create 60,000 to 70,000 jobs. This is a 
way of providing a catalyst to get a spark into the economy. Now 
that we are beginning to grow at a level of 3 per cent a year there 
has to be a little bit of an electric shock treatment to get people 
hiring again. The infrastructure program should not be 
measured simply in the numbers of jobs directly created but also 
what it does to send a signal that begins to say to Canadians that 
we can start doing things again.
<P>
	I must say when I listen to members of the Reform Party or the 
member for Mercier say it is a waste of money it seems to me 
those members do not really quite understand what it is all 
about. It is not a waste of money if you invest in better roads, 
better transportation and better infrastructure because that 
creates productivity. It creates the ability to generate more 
wealth.
<P>
	If you allow your infrastructure to deteriorate, if you have too 
many potholes in the roads, if you cannot move information 
along an electronic highway or if you cannot begin to rebuild 
your schools and universities, then you will not grow.
<P>
	We may argue about spending the money. It may be asked who 
is going to invest in a new road system. Is an oil company going 
to invest in new roads? Is the bank going to invest in a new 
training college? Are they likely? That is the responsibility of 
the public sector. It is the responsibility of government. That is 
why we have taken on that responsibility.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	I hear members opposite say that it is a waste of money. That 
simply indicates to me they are not serious about the issue. They 
are not really looking at a growth strategy or an employment 
strategy. They are caught up as the apostles of rigidity or 
demagoguery, as the editorialist in <I>La Presse</I> said.
<P>
	We introduced a number of measures in the budget. The 
infrastructure program was one. There is significant support for 
small businesses because the records show that is where jobs 
will come from. They will become the engine of job creation if 
we give them the right incentive or the right signal.
<P>
	I find incredible the ignorance of members opposite who have 
criticized our efforts to relieve small business of the payroll 
burden in order to create jobs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I find the Bloc Quebecois' position incredible. They are 
against efforts to reduce UI premium rates which will have a 
positive impact on small business.
<P>
	Here is a good example to illustrate my point. Take a small 
business with 100 workers. As a result of this initiative or plan 
to reduce UI premium rates, this business will save $30,000. 
That is enough to hire another worker, one more employee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	How can we argue against a measure clearly designed to say to 
small businesses that by bringing down their cost structure, by 
giving them better cash flow and by reducing some of the burden 
placed upon them they will be given the incentive to go out and 
hire people?
<P>
	I met a week or so ago with representatives of the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business which represents hundreds 
of thousands of small businesses across the country. They said 
that was one of the best things any government had done because 
it began to say to them that we would rely upon them. They said 
that their membership would now take up the challenge because 
we have taken the initiative to show we care.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2612"> 2612 </A></B>
<P>
	Yet we hear members on the opposition side saying that it 
does not matter or it does not count. I happen to believe it is very 
important to give the right incentive and the right stimulus to 
small business as part of an employment strategy to free up 
creative juices and to give the cash flow that is necessary. 
Members opposite-and I know they would not do it 
deliberately-distort the impact of that. They make all kinds of 
claims that changes in the UI system will have an enormous 
effect upon the poor.

	I think it was Mrs. Trépanier, Quebec's Minister of Income 
Security, who said that it had a slight impact.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our own figures show that it will be no more than an 
additional $100 million in terms of people coming off the rolls. 
People do not recognize that simply because we increase the 
level of weeks of work does not mean to say that people will stop 
working. A lot of companies and a lot of organizations presently 
cut their work time to suit the 10-week period. There may even 
be more work to do, but they cut it and put people on the 
unemployment insurance rolls as a way of helping their own 
balance sheets.
<P>
	A member of Parliament in our caucus who was chairman of a 
major school board in Ontario said it was a common practice for 
school boards to hire people on nine-month contracts and then 
let them go for three months in the summer so that they can pick 
up UI. That is not a practice we condone. That is one reason we 
are saying if we begin to relate the weeks of benefit to the weeks 
of work we begin to provide the proper relationship. We begin to 
say that one works to earn benefits; one does not get benefits by 
not working.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	It is no wonder the editorialist in <I>La Presse</I> says: ``Il y a les 
apôtres de la rigidité et de la paralysie''. C'est une bonne raison 
pour cette déclaration. They are not thinking. They do not have 
an employment strategy. They do not have any strategy that 
encourages people to go back to work.
<P>
	That is a lot more important than collecting UI. UI is a crucial 
program to help people make transitions from work to work. It is 
not long term dependency. That has been part of the problem. 
Over the years we took a good program and started changing it to 
the point where it became a program not to make that transition 
but to try to solve all other problems.
<P>
	We are saying let us have a proper program dealing with long 
term unemployment. That is one of the reasons we are 
conducting a major review. That is one reason we invited the 
participation of members opposite even though they now refuse 
to participate.
<P>
	Let us have a special program for long term unemployed 
people. They should not be kept on UI in perpetuity but they 
should have programs of training, job creation, income 
supplements or whatever the proper mix will be, so that we find 
ways of getting someone who can no longer stay in the labour 
market back in. We should focus or target that need exclusively. 
We should have programs designed for that need, not try to 
tinker with old programs that no longer fit the bill.
<P>
	This is why we are conducting the review. Opposition 
members say there is no vision, but that is the vision. Where is 
their vision? There is nothing in their motion or in anything they 
have said. Our vision is to get people back to work.
<P>
	Let us talk about young people. Let us talk about what is 
happening to the close to half a million young people between 18 
and 24 years of age who are without work. It is probably one of 
the most tragic circumstances we have. How do we come to 
grips with the difficult problem of enabling people to make that 
changeover from formal education back to work? In many cases 
formal education does not even work any more for them. Many 
young people no longer fit into the school structure; they drop 
out. There is a 30 per cent dropout rate. It is a tragedy.
<P>
	If we do not have sufficient levels of education and training 
we know there will be no jobs. We are not back in the age where 
skills are unimportant. We are in an age where if one does not 
have that basic element one will not work.
<P>
	That is why we place a lot of emphasis on this point. We have 
included in the red book-and I will be introducing them very 
shortly in the House-initiatives for a major program of 
apprenticeship-internship. It will take tens of thousands of 
young people to give them experience in the workplace. It will 
be a combination of education and good, solid experience in 
employment so they can acquire the necessary skills. That is the 
commitment we made. That is a vision. That is a proposal. It is 
part of our program. We are negotiating with the provinces now 
to make sure they are on side.
<P>
	The secretary of state spoke this morning about proposals for 
a major youth corps to give community employment experience 
for young people right across Canada. When they cannot obtain 
their first employment we get them into a setting where they 
learn skills, produce their first resumé and learn how to do 
something useful and important. It will give them some hope.
<P>
	We are looking at major changes in student aid and student 
loans programs to give another incentive to young people to get 
back into the training and educational stream. Along with the 
discussions we are having with the provinces we are putting in 
place a serious, broadly based youth employment strategy. I am 
very pleased to announce today that as part of the strategy we are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2613"> 2613 </A></B>
<P>
substantially increasing the amount going into summer 
employment by 20 per cent so we can say to  young people: ``Go 
back to school and we will help you get a job to get there''.
<P>
	That does not come easy. We have reallocated money. We 
have brought together another $20 million which will mean that 
over 60,000 young people this summer will have an opportunity 
for employment sponsored in a wide variety of circumstances. 
When the opposition says we have no plans or actions, I say we 
just announced another one today as part of a broadly based 
scheme.
<P>
	It is interesting that not once did we have a question from 
members of the Bloc or members of the Reform Party about 
summer employment and what we are going to do with summer 
students. They were so deeply concerned about our young 
people they never got around to asking questions about that. 
They have only been here for a couple of months but they never 
quite got around to the question of what will be happening to 
young people this coming summer.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Members of Parliament in my own caucus asked me about it 
every week. They had the good sense and understanding of what 
was happening to young people, and that is one reason the 
government responded to its own caucus.
<P>
	The question of employment will take a real effort by many 
Canadians. I hope the committee will report this week on what it 
heard from a broad base of consultation in the first phase. We are 
also negotiating seriously with all the provinces to talk about 
how we change training programs and how we change social 
security to get people back into the workplace.
<P>
	We are meeting with a wide variety of advisory groups. In the 
past two weeks I have met with 15 different groups across the 
country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
Today, comprehensive consultations are being held in Montreal 
with several social groups to discuss changes relating to the 
social security net.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are talking to Canadians to involve them and to say that 
change is necessary but we can do it together. We can do it as a 
country united in the fundamental objective of getting people 
back to work and of restoring the dignity of work.
<P>
	The only people absent from the debate, the only people who 
seem to be withholding their participation, are members of the 
opposition. They do not seem to think it is important enough to 
look seriously at how we can change our social assistance 
system by giving incentives to go back to work. They do not 
think it is important enough to be looking at what is happening 
to young people in our society. They do not think it is important 
enough to look at long term unemployment and how to get a 
much better mix of programming to deal with the problem. All 
they want to ensure is that there is somebody to go to the 
barricades, organize a  demonstration and say: ``Stay with what 
you have''. Fortunately that is not the message of Canadians.
<P>
	We are listening to the people who are not in the extreme 
groups on the left or the right. It is interesting that one group of 
people on the far right is saying that we should trash every 
program we can find and the group on the left is saying that we 
should keep every program we have. Fortunately a large group 
of Canadians in the middle say that change is necessary but it 
should be done responsibly and carefully so that we can get the 
country back to work again.
<P>
	I ask members opposite to help create a climate in which there 
can be jobs for Canadians. They should help to put together the 
building blocks of an employment strategy that recognizes the 
creation of employment in the private sector, that relieves the 
burden of payroll taxes, that has a specific target for the long 
term unemployed, that looks seriously at a child care system, 
that enables women to participate fully with a sense of security 
and that works in dealing with our young people.
<P>
	If we can put those elements together, if we can put the right 
package together over the next several months, we will create a 
new vision for the country. We will have given Canadians a new 
sense of identity. It will not be tied up with some kind of false 
debate about the Constitution, who controls this or who is 
responsible for that. The fundamental point is that we will have 
restored for Canadians a sense of hope and opportunity that they, 
their families and their kids can go back to work. That is the real 
meaning of what the country is about, and we intend to do it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I take note of the number 
of members interested in asking questions of the minister. I will 
try to accommodate as many as possible. I would ask members 
to keep in mind the great interest stimulated by the intervention 
of the minister.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the Minister of Human Resources Development, and 
not Natural Resources as I said last week. In any case, I wonder 
if ministers have any real powers, regardless of the department.
<P>
	So, I listened carefully to the minister, whom I have known 
for some time now. I must say that he is very articulate and he 
sounds convincing but, once again, the content of the red book 
and the speeches we hear every day are the absolute opposite of 
reality. I must first ask the minister how he thinks he can create 
jobs by, on the one hand, investing one billion dollars in 
infrastructures and, on the other hand, taxing UI benefits for the 
unemployed, to the order of $800 million for 1994-95, 
following changes to UI which is within the scope of his 
department. What does that mean? It means that, on one hand, 
the purchasing power of Canadians is reduced by $800 million 
while, on the other hand, one billion dollars is invested in 
infrastructures. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2614"> 2614 </A></B>
<P>
That means that nothing is created. On the one hand purchasing 
power is reduced,  while on the other hand money is being 
distributed, and we are told that people will spend more and that 
jobs will be created. The minister does not understand the 
economy at all, because he is not creating anything. The results 
are almost non-existent.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Moreover, the minister says that he will create jobs while also 
increasing taxes and personal income tax by $1.7 billion over 
the next three years. Over that same period, he will also increase 
taxes by $1.8 billion for small businesses. And he thinks he will 
create jobs that way. He is completely wrong and he does not 
understand anything about the economy. If jobs are created in 
Canada, it will certainly not be because of the Liberal Party and 
its alleged vision on economic development and employment. If 
jobs are created, it will be thanks to the initiatives of individuals 
and certainly not because of this government's measures. 
Indeed, there is absolutely no vision in its way of doing things, 
which is to tax Canadians even more and then try to create jobs 
with an inadequate program. If you want to create jobs by 
investing one billion dollars and then take back $800 million, 
not to mention the fact that Canada's gross domestic product is 
somewhere around $700 billion, I can tell you that one billion 
will not make much of a difference.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would also like the minister, who is responsible 
for manpower training to tell us when he will fulfil a request 
which the Quebec government has been making for at least three 
or four years. When will he delegate manpower training to 
Quebec? In doing so, he would immediately save at least $300 to 
$400 million, while at the same time ensuring more effective 
manpower training in that province? All Quebecers, whether 
they belong to the business sector, the unions or the government, 
support this request. When will the minister do something about 
this?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg-South-Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, I would like to say to the hon. member that I did 
address these issues directly and that I am surprised by all the 
contradictory statements he made. On the one hand he says that 
we have to bring down the taxes and rates, and on the other hand 
he says that we should not touch the unemployment insurance 
system. We have done that. We have reduced the UI premiums. 
That will stimulate employment and help small business to 
create jobs. Our policy has had another major impact on 
workers. It has increased by $70 to $80 the income each worker 
can spend on goods and services for his or her family, which is 
also good for small businesses. That is not too bad. Workers now 
have more money in their pockets. At the same time, we provide 
stimulus for small businesses and for workers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am trying to tell the hon. member that his party is very 
confused. On the one hand members say not to touch UI. On the 
other hand they say to bring down the premiums. We have done 
that; we have brought down the premiums and the stimulus 
effect is there. However, to bring down the premiums we have to 
make sure that we can still pay for the deficit of the UI system 
which this year is $6 billion. We have to bring down the deficit 
of $6 billion. That is the reason we balance it out. In a way it 
ensures more benefits going to the poorest people, not less.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately members opposite in their statements 
somehow forget the facts, which is too bad. I feel sorry they have 
this selective memory. It is not a good thing in a situation like 
this to be so selective in your memory. It gets you into trouble.
<P>
	We have increased the benefits for the poorest in society. We 
have created a new linkage between work and benefits and we 
have given stimulus to private enterprise to create new jobs. It 
seems to me that is not so bad a proposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
opposition motion deplores the lack of vision in the Liberal 
policies on job creation and I think the minister missed the point 
here.
<P>
	The infrastructure program has no vision because it amounts 
to less than half a per cent of the gross domestic product. That is 
like a family of four winning $200 in the Lotto 649 in a whole 
year.
<P>
	Then the minister goes on to say that high unemployment 
affects every country. That is simply not true. Places with low 
taxes like Hong Kong and the Cayman Islands have more than 97 
per cent of their people employed. There is a direct link between 
taxes and unemployment.
<P>
	Countries with high tax loads have high unemployment. 
There is a terrible lack of vision from the government in failing 
to recognize that it is the high tax rates that are causing 
unemployment and that the problem can be cured by reducing 
government spending.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that high taxes are the cause of 
unemployment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, one 
important revelation from this debate is that we now understand 
the employment strategy of the Reform Party. It is called the 
Cayman Islands employment strategy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2615"> 2615 </A></B>
<P>
	An important set of principles can be taken to heart. How do 
the Cayman Islands support their projects? A group of offshore 
companies register there in order to escape the tax burdens of all 
the other countries in the world.
<P>
	What the member is suggesting is that Canada should be a tax 
haven for all the misfit companies around the world that want to 
escape their rightful obligation to pay their taxes to their rightful 
government.
<P>
	Now there is one hell of a good employment strategy coming 
from the Reform Party. Let us have a Cayman Islands 
employment strategy, says the Reform Party. Except I do not 
think Canadians want to have a Cayman Islands employment 
strategy.
<P>
	Canada is a serious industrial country, one of the top seven 
countries in the world. Canadians realize we need a 
comprehensive strategy, not just infrastructure but a wide 
combination. Infrastructure is important in one element; 
stimulation to small business is another; reduction of the payroll 
tax for small business; serious training programs; real attempts 
to get their educational system in place, a broad based 
comprehensive program.
<P>
	That is what is going to create jobs, not following the precepts 
and principles of the Cayman Islands.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first I would like to express some gratitude on behalf of Tom 
Hanks who, had the Minister of Human Resources Development 
sought a different career, may not have won the award he 
received last night.
<P>
	I would like to point out a couple of things. The minister 
talked about the apprenticeship programs, student loans, the 
youth service corps. He lumps them all together and says that we 
reject them. That is wrong. Certain programs have more merit 
than others.
<P>
	For example, the apprenticeship program leads specifically to 
a direct career job and is something well worth pursuing. On the 
other hand to say that our poor youths after graduating from 
college can be helped by putting them in a make work 
community project which does nothing to enhance their career 
expectations may not be good value spent.
<P>
	I would look to the unemployment insurance rebates. We 
often hear about smoke and mirrors. Let us look at that 
particular one. After we carry away the mirrors and disperse the 
smoke what we have is a raise in UI premiums by the 
government which, even before it implemented it, says: ``We 
have created another job in small companies''. I would suggest 
if that were true what the minister should have done was raise 
the rates by $3 instead of the 30 cents. Then the government 
could have knocked that entire $3 off and would have had 10 
times as many jobs.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	If the infrastructure program is needed, fine. Let us talk about 
the need for infrastructure repair. Let us not bring in the smoke 
and mirrors again and call it job creation because it does not 
create jobs. We have already discussed at length the fact that 
most of these jobs will be put to contract which will go to 
companies that have their crews and it will not create any new 
employment at all.
<P>
	In creating the jobs we are talking about, the government will 
spend $70,000, according to studies, to create a $35,000 job 
which produces a $10,000 benefit to the government.
<P>
	To create jobs for $1.6 million worth of people we would need 
$96 billion. Even if the roof of this building opened up and that 
money dropped in and it was spent without increasing the 
deficit, we would still have no jobs at the end of that year when 
that money was spent. The government's infrastructure program 
does not create employment. It simply addresses a different 
problem and the problem remains.
<P>
	How is the government going to bring on long term jobs when 
it maintains the old Liberal strategy of tax and spend and not 
addressing the deficit?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
really thrilled that the hon. member with such a profound 
question left me 30 seconds to answer it. The question deserves 
that length of answer.
<P>
	How do we do it? It seems to me that there is one fundamental 
principle the hon. member should understand. It is that investing 
in our country, investing in infrastructure, investing in schools, 
investing in roads is one of the primary elements of creating 
growth and jobs.
<P>
	By opposing the infrastructure program that was called for by 
every municipality across the country to improve its 
transportation system they are standing in the way of long term 
job growth development.
<P>
	In the meantime they are also facing the fact that 40 per cent 
or 50 per cent of construction workers are out of work and this 
job creation program is one element among several that will get 
them back to work, create growth, and show the Reform just how 
their Cayman employment strategy makes no sense.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being two o'clock p.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to statements by 
members, pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there have been repeated calls in this House for reform of MP 
pensions, especially in the matter of double dipping. This, as 
members know, involves taking a government salary with the 
right hand while accepting a government pension with the left. 
My colleagues of the Reform Party opposite have been most 
eloquent in attacking this practice.
<P>
	The taxpayer's dollar is the same dollar whether it comes 
from provincial pockets or federal pockets. I would therefore 
ask my Reform colleagues to join with me in urging that all 
parties institute a code of conduct whereby no MP collects a 
salary and a taxpayer funded pension at the same time.
<P>
	I am sure all would agree, for example, that a $61,000 Alberta 
government pension on top of an MP's salary is a flagrant 
example of double dipping.

Must I remind that Hyundai received substantial grants from the

	Now, we are told that company officials refuse to meet the

company like Hyundai treat its workers so offhandedly?
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois urges the federal government to act 
immediately to preserve these workers' jobs as well as to make 
sure this never happens again. More than ever, the government

would like to call the attention of the House to a potential 
tragedy for Canadian aviation history.
<P>
	In a Prince George RCMP hangar rests the Grumman Goose. 
This plane was built in 1944, can land on water, snow or ground 
and has logged over 24,000 flying hours. It has seen service on 
both coasts, in Ottawa and the high Arctic. It has been used for 
drug busts, surveillance, rescues and air shows in addition to 
ferrying people and equipment.
<P>
	The RCMP may have to sell this 50-year old plane and the 
National Aviation Museum cannot afford the estimated price tag 
of $300,000.
<P>
	I implore the RCMP and the government to reconsider the 
possible sale of this plane to give Canadians the time to find 
alternatives for raising the money to preserve this piece of our 
heritage. If not, the last flight of the Goose will probably take it 
out of Canada forever, heading south of the border to the highest 
bidder.

	Canadians from all regions of this country have responded by 
tightening their belts and going without many necessities they

others have continued to live high on the hog.

	There are many examples of where fiscal restraint has not 
been practised to the same degree. One such example is the 
recent lavish farewell functions to honour the outgoing 
Governor of the Bank of Canada. Almost $30,000 was spent to 
bid farewell to John Crow. It is  outrageous that Canadians are 
expected to foot the bill for this lavish spending.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Without waiting for the results of its foreign policy review, 
the government has already made its decision. It has made a 180 
degree turn and set a course that is guided by strictly 
commercial interests, thereby turning its back on protecting 
human rights.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister whether he would confirm 
that his government intends to promote Canada's trading 
relations at the expense of human rights. I also want to ask him 
whether on his trip in China, he will allude to the oppressive 
policies of this dictatorial regime only in very polite terms and 
in private, on the weak-kneed advice of his Minister of Foreign 
Affairs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2620"> 2620 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
whenever we have a chance, we raise the issue of human rights 
throughout the world, and that includes when we discuss politics 
with the Chinese. We also discuss the problem when it is time to 
make decisions on distributing envelopes for development 
assistance.
<P>
	However, we realize that we must maintain normal trading 
relations with China as with other countries. We also believe, as 
has been the case in the Soviet Union, that these countries 
become more open as a result of economic growth and trade with 
democratic countries, and that when they experience the 
benefits of market economies and democratic freedoms, 
obviously attitudes change.
<P>
	When I go to China, I intend to raise the issue of human rights, 
but at the same time, I would like to maintain normal trading 
relations with that country. I think this is the best way for 
Canada to protect our commercial interests and at the same time 
be present so that we can raise the issue of human rights with the 
authorities of that country.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, does the Prime Minister realize that by letting 
commercial interests prevail over human rights, Canada is 
relinquishing its historic responsibility, since the Prime 
Minister knows perfectly well that polite comments behind 
closed doors will have no impact on foreign leaders who 
systematically violate human rights? I would like to ask him 
whether that is why Canada did not express public support for 
U.S. protests against China on the issue of human rights.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we always raise this issue, and we did. We have an international 
policy that is different and does not depend on the position of the 
United States, and I think Canadians want Canada to take an 
independent position in this respect. For instance, we were the 
first country, well before the United States, to recognize China. 
It was not until after Canada recognized China that the United 
States did so.
<P>
	I think Canada has always raised the issue of human rights and 
has always traded with China. Under the Diefenbaker 
government, we were already selling wheat to China. We have 
had trading relations with the Soviet Union, and we always 
raised the issue of human rights. We did not change our 
priorities, but we know, and we say this quite frankly, that it is 
no use being holier than thou. If I told the President of China, 
who represents 1.2 billion people, that the Prime Minister of 
Canada was telling him what to do, he would laugh in my face. I 
think the best way to accomplish something is to help this 
country develop its potential, and once they have had many 
exchanges with the Western world, they will understand the 
benefits of democracy and respect for human rights and 
economic progress in a market economy.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> The 
Chinese leaders are not going to be impressed by our dollars. 
What they will respect is an international conscience which 
Canada has always brought to bear throughout the world and on 
which its present prestige in the world is based.
<P>
	There is a clear lack of continuity between the great 
international accomplishments that are largely the work of the 
Liberal Party, and its heirs here in the House today, who are 
frittering away that legacy.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Prime Minister whether this means that 
on his trip to Mexico, he will not raise the issue of human rights 
violations in the province of Chiapas with the Mexican 
President, although as a trading partner, he will be in a position 
to do so.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as soon as we were informed of the problems in Chiapas, we sent 
a note of protest to the Mexican government. If you read the 
notes that came from Mexico, you would see that we were one of 
the first countries to do so and one of the countries that protested 
most vigorously.
<P>
	Nevertheless, we believe that it is normal to have trading 
relations with Mexico. I am surprised to hear the Leader of the 
Opposition say we should not have trading relations with 
Mexico and China because we do not like the way they govern 
their countries.
<P>
	We have always had trading relations, and it would be 
hypocrisy to claim that we can cut off our trading relations with 
countries with whom we disagree on the issue of human rights. 
We have always traded with China, the Soviet Union and 
Mexico. We intend to continue and to raise the issue of 
fundamental freedoms at the same time.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as expected, the Dominion Bond Rating Service of Toronto 
lowered the federal government's credit rating yesterday, 
justifying its move by the government's inability to put its fiscal 
house in order. This lower rating, which will translate into 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in costs to the taxpayers of 
Quebec and Canada, revives the spectre of major hikes in 
interest rates, a scenario which occurred before under the 
Liberals in the early 1980s.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance not agree that this lower rating is 
tantamount to an unequivocal condemnation of Canada by the 
financial community, signalling the failure of his budget with 
regard to public spending control?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, in lowering this rating, 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2621"> 2621 </A></B>
<P>
DBRS was following the lead taken by another agency last year, 
that is to say before our budget. So, no  connection can possibly 
be made between our budget and what has just happened.
<P>
	Second, this rating relates to only 2 per cent of our debt, 
namely foreign currency. As for the budget, it is very 
unequivocal. Our goal is to bring the deficit down to 3 per cent 
of the gross domestic product within three years. We will 
achieve our goal and ultimately eliminate the deficit. That is our 
goal and we will achieve it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Dominion Bond Rating Service quotes explicitly the budget 
as the reason for lowering the credit rating.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance not recognize that failing to take 
seriously our proposal, the Bloc Quebecois proposal, to review 
and cut the fat in federal government expenditures was a bad 
move and that such an irresponsible move could end up costing 
the people of Quebec and Canada hundreds of thousands of 
dollars, while at the same time causing job losses and allowing 
interest rates to skyrocket?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, I have not heard the 
Bloc Quebecois propose any cuts. All I heard was: ``Do not 
touch military bases. Do not touch unemployment insurance. No 
reform. No restructuring. Do not do a single thing.'' That is the 
Bloc's position. So, we have no lesson to take from them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last week we asked the Prime Minister if he would respond to the 
falling dollar and rising interest rates by making a stronger 
commitment to deficit reduction.
<P>
	The Prime Minister refused to do so and now just yesterday, as 
has been mentioned, the Dominion Bond Rating Service 
downgraded its credit rating on the federal government foreign 
currency debt.
<P>
	The DBRS said in making its downgrading that the federal 
government policies are not stringent enough to get the 
government out of the debt trap and if it wants a better rating it 
will have to include some meaningful spending reductions in the 
1995 budget.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister now prepared to direct the finance 
minister to bring forward a stronger deficit reduction program 
before the government's credit rating is further downgraded?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, what the DBRS said was that we have a 
high level of foreign debt at the federal-provincial level, that is 
the corporate level. That is true. That is the situation. We as a 
country are heavily indebted at the federal and provincial levels 
and it is going require co-operation with the provinces which we 
have already begun, and that is true.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	The Dominion Bond Rating Service said that our productivity 
is up, our inflation rates are down and there is great room for 
strength within this economy. It also said that it was putting the 
downgrade on but 2 per cent of our foreign debt and it 
maintained the triple-A level on our Canadian debt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary question.
<P>
	Surely the finance minister is not suggesting that this 
downgrading was done lightly or frivolously. Surely members 
across the way know that the eyes of investors and borrowers are 
on the frontbenches of government, looking for signs as they are 
worried about the government's fiscal situation.
<P>
	Is not the minister concerned that this downgrading could be 
the beginning of a trend and what steps is he taking to prevent 
downgrading of all of Canada's outstanding debt?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all our budget was well received 
by the majority of the rating agencies.
<P>
	Second, we very clearly set out that in the first stage of our 
budget that we were going to arrive in three years at a deficit 
target of 3 per cent of GDP and it will be the first time in the last 
15 to 20 years that that has been attained.
<P>
	Furthermore, we said this is the first stage of a two-stage 
budget. We also said that cutting at the margins and nibbling at 
the edges does not apply. Fundamental reform to unemployment 
insurance, to defence, and the way the government operates is 
what is required and that is what this government is going to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is not how members of this House, either on this side or that 
side, react to the government's signals. It is how the money 
markets react and that reaction has been negative.
<P>
	Increasing scepticism that the federal government is not 
really prepared to come to grips with the deficit problem is now 
leading to concerns that the government may attempt to inflate 
its way out of a portion of its debt and cause interest rates to rise, 
the bank rate today rising from 4.25 per cent to 5 per cent.
<P>
	Will the minister assure the House that the government will 
resort to deeper spending cuts before it will allow inflation rates 
to rise above present levels?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the only inflation I hear 
about in this House is that party that wants to inflate the number 
of members of Parliament who are in this House.
<P>
	Let us be very clear. Prior to Christmas the Government of 
Canada and the Governor of the Bank of Canada arrived at a set 
of monetary targets which we did within the first month of 
taking office, something that it took the previous government 
two and a half years to arrive at. Those monetary targets are 
among the most stringent of any industrial country in the world 
and we are very proud of them.
<P>
	This is a low inflation country. We have paid a great penalty to 
get there. We are not going to lose the benefit. We are going to 
remain a low inflation country.

<P>
	Yesterday the minister encouraged us to continue reading the 
<I>Toronto Star</I>. Well, this morning I took him at his word. I learned 
that at least five Canadian publishing houses had already 
expressed an interest in acquiring control of Ginn Publishing.

	How does the minister explain the fact that the CDIC has not 
responded to Canadian publishers interested in purchasing Ginn 
Publishing? Furthermore, will the minister recognize the need 
to conduct an inquiry into the actions of the CDIC, which has 
systematically rejected all efforts made by Canadian publishers 
to buy Ginn Publishing?
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday we were fortunate to have a few documents 
tabled. They clearly indicated that certain Canadian publishers 
were interested in buying Ginn. However, I did not see a specific 
purchase offer in these documents.
<P>
	We are not so much concerned about events which took place 
nearly 10 years ago as we are about what has happened since this 
government took office. And I have seen no direct offer to 
purchase Ginn since this government has been at the helm.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is surprising, nonetheless, that no purchase offer has 
been made. The CDIC had promised to issue a monthly 
prospectus and it has not done so. Therefore, the minister must 
admit today that while no offer has been made, some interest has 
been expressed nevertheless. An offer can be made if there is a 
prospectus. But this government never issued one.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata): </B>How can the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage seriously continue to claim that 
the CDIC was determined to sell Ginn to Canadian interests, but 
received no serious offer, when the evidence he has points to the 
contrary? Will he not agree that he is losing all personal 
credibility as far as this matter is concerned?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not the manager of the CDIC. I do not have the 
financial skills to take on that job. Moreover, I do not think it is 
up to the Minister of Heritage to start doing some advertising 
outside his field.
<P>
	My area of responsibility is Canadian cultural policy. 
Regarding this matter, I have stated clearly on several occasions 
that I consider Ginn to be an exception. While admittedly this 
may not have been a particularly fortunate transaction, the 
policy itself is sound. It calls for supporting and protecting the 
Canadian cultural industry, including the publishing industry.

	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for the 
Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	I wrote to the minister several weeks ago expressing objection 
to his announcement of a $60 million U.S. credit arrangement to 
finance a new South African aluminium smelter.
<P>
	In his response the minister stated that several Canadian 
companies either received or retained business contracts as a 
direct result of this export credit.
<P>
	Officials from the South African embassy informed my staff 
that only one Canadian company, SNC-Lavalin, is directly 
contracted on this project, that they secured their contract 
almost two years ago and were well under way prior to the 
federal government's credit deal.
<P>
	Will the minister be forthright and tell the House precisely 
what motivated the government's decision to extend almost a 
$100 million Canadian credit for this South African smelter 
project?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, when I spoke on a previous occasion about the 
number of companies participating it was under the umbrella of 
SNC-Lavalin in Montreal which has the contract for the design 
of the plant.
<P>
	The other companies that are gaining the benefit are suppliers 
to and associates of the principal contractor.

	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question. Does the minister not acknowledge 
that the use of Canadian taxpayers' funds to assist in the 
construction of aluminium smelters in South Africa is extremely 
unfair to the British Columbians and Quebecers employed in the 
aluminium industry who pay those taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
No, Mr. Speaker. It is our expectation that any excess supplies 
on world markets will disappear by the time the proposed 
refinery comes into full operation. We do not believe it will have 
any adverse impact on the Canadian aluminium industry.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage decided to allow the sale of Ginn 
Publishing to Paramount only for fear of being sued by 
Paramount.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	The <I>Star</I> quoted Paramount's lawyer, Mr. Grover, who 
yesterday ruled out the possibility of Paramount suing the 
minister if only the minister had stood up to them.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. Now 
that I have reassured the minister that he no longer has any 
reason to fear being sued, will he do what he should have done 
from the beginning in the Ginn Publishing case and cancel the 
sale to Paramount?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am surprised to discover that our colleague's advisors 
are Americans. Mine are Canadians and I believe what they tell 
me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the 
minister's information, it is the Toronto lawyer of Paramount 
who made that statement. Toronto is still in Canada, Mr. 
Speaker. Tell the minister that! It is not very far from Kingston 
either.
<P>
	Not only do we read English-language newspapers but we 
usually read a contract before we sign it. Since Paramount's 
lawyer himself expresses serious doubts about his client suing 
the Canadian government, it would be rather surprising if the 
government's lawyers had produced a legal opinion without any 
reservations that would have prevented the minister from going 
back on the deal.
<P>
	Does the minister, who has failed miserably in his first test as 
defender of Canada's cultural heritage, not believe that he 
should table the legal opinion to show that he is really above 
reproach on this?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very happy to know that the lawyers in question 
are Canadians but I believe that they serve an American master.
<P>
	As for the legal opinion, I am pleased to be asked this question 
in this House after being asked the same question outside the

documents which, according to the settlement negotiated 
between a previous government and this one, cannot be

	On February 14, I asked the minister why he had approved a 
$60 million credit for the construction of a new aluminium 
smelter in South Africa, when this plant will be competing 
directly against Canadian producers.
<P>
	The aluminium industry is very important for Canada, 
especially British Columbia and Quebec, since almost 10,000 
people are employed in our ten smelters. These plants are 
located in Shawinigan and in nine other ridings represented by

implying, by predicting a better balance between supply and 
demand, that we can expect more cuts and layoffs in the 
Canadian aluminium industry?

Mr. Speaker, the current difficulties in the aluminium industry 
basically arise from the supply excess from Russia.

resolve itself through the more orderly marketing of Russian 
excess production and in the near future we will see a return to 
more normal circumstances in the world aluminium trade.

my question is for the Minister of Finance, who is also 
responsible for regional development in Quebec. In answer to a 
question on the future of the Hyundai plant in Bromont, the 
Minister of Finance confirmed yesterday that he had begun 
discussions with the Quebec government and with Hyundai, in 
order to find an alternative proposal. Today, we learned that 
none of the big three American automakers showed any interest.
<P>
	Given the refusal of GM, Ford and Chrysler to take over the 
Bromont facility, can the minister tell us what alternatives are 
being considered by the federal government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, this Friday, officials 
from the Quebec Government, the Federal Office of Regional

company will propose a recovery plan or some options. 
Following this meeting, senior officials from both governments 
will meet with us, that is myself as minister responsible for the 
Federal Office, the federal Minister of Industry, and Quebec 
government's officials, at which time appropriate decisions can 
be made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
hope that Hyundai will give these people a better reception than 
this morning, when it refused to meet with the mayors. Given 
that Hyundai did not respect the commitments it had made to get 
government grants, does the minister intend to recoup the $26 
million paid by the federal to the company, and will he pledge to 
reinvest that money to develop sub-contracting activities in 
Quebec's auto industry, so as to alleviate the impact of the 
closure of Hyundai's plant, until the facility reopens?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, the money provided, 
that is $23 million by the federal but $46 million in total by the

question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	The Ontario government is embarking on a new system of 
long term health care reform for seniors which will favour the 
not for profit home care providers, eliminating the commercial 
provider agencies. As well 20,000 health care workers are 
employed in Ontario by the private sector agencies.
<P>
	What does the minister intend to do to ensure that the federal 
tax dollars transferred to the Ontario government are spent in a 
cost effective manner?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Government of Canada transfers a great deal of money to the 
provinces to provide extended health services for home care, 
residential care and nursing home care. Approximately $550 
million goes to Ontario alone.
<P>
	I must add that the Canada Health Act does not dictate how 
these dollars should be spent other than to say that they are for 
extended health care. We believe they are being spent in this 
manner.
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	The exercise of how the dollars are spent and how they 
organize extended health care is under provincial jurisdiction.

	I would emphasize however that I believe they should 
seriously consider continuing private enterprise in terms of jobs 
in that sector as it is a cost effective manner of delivering the 
services within some non-profit agencies.

is for the minister of agriculture.
<P>
	Many Canadian farmers say they would like to choose 
between marketing their product through the Canadian Wheat 
Board, other grain companies or directly with buyers in the 
United States or other countries.
<P>
	What steps is the minister taking to give farmers the choice 
they want and allow farmers and others to compete with the 
Canadian Wheat Board?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, a variety of representations have 
been received by me on this particular point. The 
representations go both ways. Some farmers and farm 
organizations are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2625"> 2625 </A></B>
<P>
strongly advocating support for the Canadian Wheat Board and 
its traditional strength as a marketing agency on behalf of 
Canadian farmers. Others are taking a different point of view 
and supporting the  argument that is contained in the question 
that has just been asked.
<P>
	As I say, I am receiving a large number of these 
representations. Some of them propose the notion of a plebiscite 
as a method of resolving this controversy on the prairies with 
respect to grain marketing systems.
<P>
	To those who have proposed the notion of a plebiscite I have 
responded with a number of technical questions that I think they 
ought to address and think carefully about before rushing to 
embrace that particular form of solution.
<P>
	At this moment in time, to my knowledge, I have not received 
any replies to those questions but I anticipate I will. That will be 
a part of the input that the government will take into account as 
we consider this question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question for the minister.
<P>
	Canadian grain farmers have been demanding for years that 
the wheat board be democratized and that the board monopoly 
be brought to an end.
<P>
	In a recent poll only 29 per cent of grain farmers want the 
wheat board to remain the sole marketer of barley to the United 
States.
<P>
	When will the government stop resisting farmers' requests for 
more choices in marketing their barley and hold a plebiscite on 
this issue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the first question, I 
indicated there were a number of serious issues that those who 
advocate the notion of a plebiscite might want to consider very 
carefully, one being the legal basis on which a plebiscite might 
be held.
<P>
	Those who recall the previous government might remember 
that government was ensnared in some rather serious legal 
difficulties because it acted without the proper legal authority, 
according to the Federal Court of Canada.
<P>
	There are a whole range of other questions having to do with 
the structure, the voting list, the wording of the question and the 
kind of majority required to carry the question. There are eight 
or nine technical and logistical questions that need to be 
answered very seriously before one would rush to embrace this 
particular proposal.
<P>
	I have put those questions very seriously and sincerely to 
those who advocate the notion of a plebiscite. I await, with a 
great deal of interest, their response to those questions.

question is for the Prime Minister. Yesterday the Minister of 
Human Resources Development stated that the federal 
government had no plans to introduce specific adjustment 
programs to help workers who lose their jobs because of recent 
international trade agreements. Once again, the Liberal 
government is doing an about-face on a major economic issue. 
Before the election, the Liberal Party stressed in particular the 
need for free trade adjustment measures.
<P>
	My question is as follows: Can the Prime Minister confirm 
that his government does not intend to introduce specific 
adjustment programs for workers displaced by NAFTA, 
considering that this was a sine qua non condition for his 
supporting NAFTA?

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

would like to point out that in addition to the NAFTA agreement 
we have also just signed a major agreement on the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. A number of other major 
changes are taking place internationally.
<P>
	When I answered the question I said we are not providing 
specific adjustment for one event; we are providing adjustment 
for all workers affected by major changes internationally and we 
will continue to do that.
<P>
	I would simply say to the hon. member she could be far more 
helpful if she participated in the development of those 
adjustment programs rather than opposing them as she has for 
the last several months.

NAFTA and GATT, I would like to suggest some very 
enlightening reading material to him.
<P>
	The red book will soon be a source of embarrassment for the 
Liberals. It states the following and I quote: ``Governments 
must assist individuals and firms to deal with the restructuring 
that is occurring as a result of trade liberalization. Such 
assistance is critical to building acceptance of structural

that is what I meant in answer to that question earlier from the

does the minister still maintain that the decisions reached by this

	With respect to the decisions that are made by port authorities 
in various parts of the country, it is the intention of the

decision making process.
<P>
	Beyond that, and I want to make it very clear, at the port of

fill the grain sales of committed grain and the grain that we will

5,000 hopper cars.

	Without these additional cars, grain sales will suffer and the 
ports of Vancouver, Prince Rupert and Thunder Bay will suffer

	It certainly saddens me that the leaders on the government 
side have been in politics for so long that they really have no 
idea any more of how jobs are created in the private sector.
<P>
	During the 1993 election campaign the now Prime Minister 
took the position that the economy simply needed a kick-start 
and that the infrastructure program proposed by the government 
would be that kick-start.
<P>
	At the time the leader of the Reform Party stated that trying to 
start the Canadian economy with a $6 billion infrastructure 
program was like trying to start a 747 with a flashlight battery.
<P>
	Six billion dollars represents such a tiny portion of the gross 
domestic product that any effects of it are probably impossible 
to measure. If I were grading the performance of the Prime 
Minister I would have to say that he earned a <I>D</I> for believing it 
was possible to kick-start the economy with a $6 billion 
infrastructure program. If he were playing a game with the 
public vote I would have to award him an <I>A+</I> for his ability to 
convince the public that this would actually work.
<P>
	Just how much of a kick-start to the economy is this program? 
Statistics Canada puts the gross domestic product for Canada for 
1992, that is, the sum of all the goods and services produced, at 
$688.5 billion. The $6 billion job creation scheme at $3 billion 
per year for two years represents just .44 per cent of the gross 
domestic product. That is less than half a per cent of the gross 
domestic product. How could anyone seriously think that could 
kick-start the economy?
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	To put things in perspective, it is a little bit like a family with 
a gross income of $60,000 per year winning $264 in Lotto 649. 
What difference would it make to its living standards? It would 
not even pay for the kick-starter on a motor bike.
<P>
	I have to wonder whether the members on the government 
side ever bothered to do the calculations or whether they just 
took the red book at face value. If they just accepted the red book 
proposal without doing the calculations then every single one of 
them should be ashamed for failing to show leadership, for 
failing to do the basic research that is essential if we are to be 
leaders.
<P>
	On the other hand, if they did the calculation and came to the 
obvious conclusion, realized the implications and still failed to 
tell their constituents then they should be ashamed for deceiving 
the voters. There is no way out for the government members. 
They must admit to lack of research ability or they must admit to 
deception.
<P>
	Reluctantly I must give them all a <I>D</I> for deception or an <I>F</I> for 
failure.
<P>
	Think about who is paying the price for this boondoggle. The 
federal government is putting up one third, the provinces are 
putting up one third and the municipalities are putting up one 
third. There is only one taxpayer. Clearly this money has to 
come from the taxpayers and since the federal and provincial 
governments are running deficits, obviously it has to be 
borrowed. At the municipal level at which they are not permitted 
to run deficits it will obviously increase property taxes.
<P>
	The whole program is a disgrace. We may benefit in the short 
run but it will be our children and grandchildren who carry the 
mortgage into the future.
<P>
	I know that government members are itching to say: ``Will 
you take the share of the infrastructure program in your 
riding?''. I know they think they can paint me into a corner on 
that. The people of North Vancouver have to carry their share of 
the debt burden for this program so it is only just that they take 
their share of it as well.
<P>
	Nobody wants to pay interest on somebody else's loan for 
infrastructure and neither do the taxpayers of North Vancouver 
want to pay interest on somebody else's infrastructure program 
in Canada. We will take our share but it does not mean that we 
agree with the program.
<P>
	Prior to being elected I was in business for 13 years. I owned 
and managed a successful communications company with a staff 
of 10 until 1990 when I sold that business to start a leasing 
company. That company specializes in leasing to the small 
business sector, particularly home based businesses. Many of 
my friends are business people employing staff in the range of 
10 to 15. I understand small business and I know what helps 
create jobs. I know what it is like to meet a payroll. I also know 
the job killing effects of excess taxation.
<P>
	This is something that many of the government members do 
not know because they have always worked in the public sector, 
they have always been aldermen, they have always been 
politicians. How could they know what it is like? Their pay 
cheques arrive in their bank accounts each month and they have 
always done so. It is easy for them to broaden the tax base 
because they do not have to foot the bill.
<P>
	However, let me explain what is like to be in a small business 
in which everything is so competitive that one does not get the 
choice of raising the prices the same way that the government 
can raise taxes.
<P>
	On the sale of a fax machine for $600, a typical dealer in that 
industry will make about $75. That is the gross profit. In B.C. 
the combined GST and PST comes to $84. The two levels of 
government get $9 more than the dealer does for the sale of that 
product. Out of the $75 the business has to pay all the overhead, 
the salaries and the commissions and, if there is anything left 
over, 25 per cent tax on what remains.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2629"> 2629 </A></B>
<P>
	In any particular month a business may have to remit income 
taxes, employee deductions, GST, PST, municipal taxes, 
workers compensation and property taxes. It is very 
disheartening for small business people to be remitting two or 
three times as much tax as they make for the companies and 
themselves. This is the single biggest disincentive to job 
creation. It causes business owners to avoid expansion. It causes 
them to avoid staff hiring because of the support costs. It 
encourages an underground economy full of cash only deals. 
Excessive taxation is killing jobs and forcing honest people into 
a tax revolt.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	Compare this situation with a place like Hong Kong where the 
tax rate for corporations is only around 15 per cent and the 
unemployment rate is only 1 per cent. Nobody minds paying 
their taxes when they get to keep 85 per cent of what they earn.
<P>
	It is time that this government admitted it has a spending 
problem, not a revenue problem, and began taking steps to 
drastically reduce government spending. If it would do this the 
business sector would realize that something is finally being 
done about government spending, confidence would be restored 
and there would be a promise of tax relief in the future. This 
would encourage business expansion and the creation of new 
jobs.
<P>
	I know this is true because I am from the small business 
sector, which is more than many of the government members can 
say for themselves. The light at the end of the tunnel would turn 
back on again and companies would begin reinvesting in new 
jobs and expansion.
<P>
	We need to move the emphasis away from the public sector. 
We need to move it away from the public sector to the private 
sector if we are ever going to again experience a strong and 
healthy Canadian economy with the potential for adequate new 
job creation.
<P>
	This House should be saddened by the lack of vision of the 
government side and I urge the government to take a real look at 
the situation. It is not magic, it just common sense. If we could 
get our corporate tax level down there would be a rush of all 
those businesses that have relocated into the United States back 
into Canada to create jobs for the people who need to live and 
work here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like 
to thank my hon. colleague for his speech and assure him that I 
come from the small business sector as well. I am a chartered 
accountant and worked many years with small businesses and I 
even have two or three of my own small businesses still in 
operation. Much to his chagrin, that is just not the case on the 
government side of this House.
<P>
	The hon. member made a comparison between Hong Kong 
and Canada. That is very easy to do. He talks about a 15 per cent 
income tax rate, but he did not really tell us about whether Hong 
Kong has a medicare system or whether it has other kinds of 
social welfare systems that the people of Canada have learned to 
expect and live with.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member could mention some of those 
points.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for his two questions.
<P>
	I am pleased to know that he has been involved in the small 
business sector. As a chartered accountant, which he says he is, 
he would know the tax difficulties that small businesses face. An 
accountant spends most of his time trying to help small 
businesses with their tax problems. Everybody knows that the 
taxes are too high.
<P>
	I would also thank the member for bringing up the situation of 
Hong Kong. I put it into my speech exactly to elicit that sort of 
question.
<P>
	Obviously Hong Kong is at the other extreme from Canada at 
which there are no social programs but everybody is working 
because they absolutely have to.
<P>
	I would not suggest that we turn Canada into that sort of 
situation. I do believe that there is a position somewhere 
between where we are now and the situation that is represented 
by Hong Kong that would be a much better place for Canada to 
be today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Madam Speaker, in 
listening to my friend in the Reform Party talk about the $6 
billion as representing such an infinitesimal part of the gross 
domestic product, it makes me wonder if he has ever been a 
farmer or ever been a gardener and planted a seed. When one 
plants a seed it grows and it bathes in the sunlight and takes 
nutrients from the soil and multiplies. That is exactly what this 
infrastructure program is intended to do. It is the seed that we 
have planted.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	In the great riding of Halton-Peel I have had reports from the 
municipalities which say that the choices they have made for 
infrastructure renewal will have a spin-off effect in those 
municipalities for the next 10 to 15 years. Therefore, I would say 
to the hon. member that when he is thinking about this 
investment in infrastructure this is not just a two-year wonder 
that will employ a few people and then end. If the projects are 
well chosen, I can assure him that it will help greatly with 
economic renewal in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the 
member for mentioning the $6 billion job creation program 
again. The B.C. share represents only .33 per cent of the 
spending on infrastructure for this year. It is very tiny.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2630"> 2630 </A></B>
<P>
	The member raised the comparison with a seed. Before 
getting into this position I used to grow my own vegetables so I 
know how a tiny seed can grow into a very large plant. In this 
case, although the government may have the intention of 
planting a seed and having it grow, we all know in our hearts that 
it is not going to work. There may be the occasional good 
program that comes out of this but there are plenty of examples 
already. I made a statement in this House about this a few days 
ago. There are already many examples of where this 
infrastructure program is being used for political rewards: 
private boxes in stadiums and things that do not contribute to the 
overall benefit of society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I have a couple of comments and a question for the hon. member 
from Vancouver.
<P>
	I do not think we Liberals need to take any lessons from the 
Reform Party when it comes to small business. We realize how 
important small and medium sized businesses are to the 
economy. It has been said many times and I will repeat it here. 
Small and medium sized companies have produced about 85 per 
cent of the new jobs in this country in the past few years. They 
are an important segment of the economy.
<P>
	I would warn the hon. member from Vancouver to be careful 
in his simplicity about reducing taxation. I know that taxation is 
sensitive and one can take taxation too far with respect to 
business. In many cases we have taken it too far. When he uses 
the Hong Kong example, I can come back with the example of 
the United States of America which has an unemployment rate 
of about 6.5 per cent. It sounds good at the surface but there is an 
enormous price to pay for that because of their inability to 
distribute wealth in any reasonable way. The United States of 
America has an enormous problem when it comes to poverty. 
Poverty turns into disaster. There is the matter of crime in the 
United States. It is directly attributable to poverty.
<P>
	When the hon. member talks about taxation he should also be 
very mindful about distribution of wealth or does he not care 
about the distribution of wealth? Would he just leave it to the 
marketplace and all of its inherent injustices?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Madam Speaker, since I have 
to be brief I will only make a comment on the distribution of 
wealth.
<P>
	It is well known that if one took 100 per cent of the income 
from all of the people who earn more than $100,000 a year and 
gave it all to the poor, they would get a couple of hundred dollars 
each. What use is it taking money off people with high taxes on 
this pretext of redistributing wealth? It does not work.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's):</B> Good 
afternoon, Madam Speaker. I extend my congratulations on your 
Speakership. This is my first opportunity when  Madam Speaker 
was in the chair to say that and I wanted to very much.
<P>
	Now I want to do some other things. My good friend from 
Mercier brings before this House a resolution. Let me say 
something else, Madam Speaker, that as long winded as I love to 
be, I am going to be all of 10 minutes because my good friend 
from Durham is going to follow me for the second 10 minutes of 
our 20 minute period.
<P>
	My friend from Mercier would have the House deplore the 
government's lack of vision and lack of concrete measures 
relating to job creation policies.
<P>
	I say to her that is a marvellous resolution. It is certainly 
grammatically correct. All the words are in the right place. It is 
procedurally correct. It is in the correct form for the House. It is 
certainly politically correct. That is what an opposition 
normally does. It says that it is not good enough, we want more.
<P>
	Procedural, political and grammatical are three of the four 
litmus tests that one must always apply to any resolution before 
this Chamber.The fourth is whether the motion is substantively 
correct. Is it correct in substance?
<P>
	My friend from North Vancouver as always is in the Chamber. 
He is nodding so vociferously I have a feeling he has something 
going with the member for Mercier. He must have written the 
resolution. He is pleased with the wording in the resolution and 
annoyed at me for suggesting it might not be absolutely letter 
perfect.
<P>
	How gracious do you want me to be? I have already conceded 
that it is at least three parts correct, so we are 75 per cent of the 
way there.
<P>
	Let us look at the other 25 per cent. Is it correct in substance? 
By analogy I say to her you can lament the poverty of a rich man, 
but that does not render him poor. You can cry in your beer about 
the low alcoholic content of your beverage, it will dilute the 
beer, but otherwise will not prove your overall thesis.
<P>
	The smart thing to do, I say to the member, before rushing out 
to deplore, to lament or to cry in your beer is to analyse the beer, 
find out what it is you are about to deplore, and satisfy yourself 
that you know what you are talking about before you begin 
deploring it, let alone talk about it.
<P>
	What are some of the cold hard facts? There are several, but 
there is a word in this motion, I love it, vision. Vision connotes 
something down the road. It suggests that somebody back there 
had some perception of what ought to be or what might be and so 
you say to yourself: ``Who's the author of this resolution''. 
Ostensibly it is the member for Mercier, my good friend, but just 
possibly it is her House leader.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2631"> 2631 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	Just possibly it is her leader. Just possibly it is a committee 
project. Perhaps all 54 had a hand in this. I do not see too many 
taking credit, but let us give her credit. She is at least the author 
of record and she uses the word vision. Let us look at the vision 
of the author because it is very insightful.
<P>
	Could it be the same author who wrote a document called ``A 
New Party for the Turning Point'' last May? Could it be the 
author of a document that was circulated widely during the 
election of last fall in Quebec? Could it be the document that 
talked extensively about the separation of Quebec? I understand 
that because it is a publicly stated part of the party's platform. I 
have no difficulty as a matter of principle with that being in the 
document. It would be deceptive on the part of the party if that 
were not in the document. I do not decry that. However, since 
this is a party that decries the lack of vision of others then the 
implicit question is this: How about its vision on this same 
subject?
<P>
	We go to the document. They had a fair amount of hindsight 
on page 7 of the document, the first reference on employment. It 
says that naturally there has been a considerable increase in 
unemployment. That is not exactly vision. It is not a bad 
observation but it is based on past experience, not on what might 
be.
<P>
	Then we slave through the document, which makes for some 
pretty good reading actually, and wind up on page 22. On page 
22 there is a table which again, for the second time now in 22 
pages, refers to job creation by name or by inference.
<P>
	There it says that in 1988-89 the federal government spent 
$2.7 billion on job creation exclusive of transfer payments. That 
is not bad but it is also hindsight. It is also what has been. There 
is not one solitary sentence about what the vision of the member 
for Mercier would be on the subject she now deplores.
<P>
	What are the cold hard facts? I suppose a not too cold but 
certainly hard fact is: ``66,000 lost jobs returned'', a story a 
week ago in the <I>Financial Post</I>. Another not too cold but 
certainly hard fact: ``New jobs jump in February'' in the Toronto 
<I>Star</I> a week ago. These are some of the hard facts, not 
particularly cold.
<P>
	``Job rate drops to 11.1 in February''. My good friend from 
Calgary Centre enters the debate. I am so glad to see him. His 
favourite paper, the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, says that the job rate 
dropped to 11.1 in February. These are just a few of the cold hard 
facts.
<P>
	I see my time is quickly running out. Let me come to one more 
issue. The issue is Chicken Little, the sky is falling. The easiest 
thing in the world is to say that everything is wrong with the 
world. The easiest thing to say is that the sky is falling. Unless 
members have some information for me to say how they are 
going to prop it up, I do not want to hear it. If I am going fast, I 
would like to go without knowing.
<P>
	It is true whether on the issue of separation from Canada or on 
the issue of job creation that my good friend from 
Lac-Saint-Jean, the Leader of the Opposition, had a Damascus 
road experience, no question about it. The day he left the Tory 
cabinet, he had a true Damascus road experience.
<P>
	For those members who are not as biblically correct as I 
pretend to be, Paul on the road to Damascus did a 180 degree 
turn and saw a light. The member for Lac-Saint-Jean did a 360. 
He did a turn on the road, but when he finished turning he was 
still going in the same direction, away from the light.
<P>
	I stick to the issue of job creation. He realizes that the party he 
aided and abetted for a number of years was on the wrong track 
economically, with regard to national unity and a number of 
other issues.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	I respect his decision to see the light. What I lament about 
with his behaviour is that he did not just do a turn, he twirled. He 
turned not only into the light but back away from it and in the 
process missed a great opportunity to not only to help build a 
great country but to get more young people, more people of all 
ages, back to work. That is what I lament over.
<P>
	That is why the deploring in this motion is about all the wrong 
things. The basic premise of the resolution does not bear 
scrutiny. I appeal to the members of this House to treat the 
motion for what it is worth, a politically correct motion that the 
Official Opposition was obliged to move. We respect its 
adherence to political correctness. We appeal to the House to do 
the right thing and stick by the government which has a program 
for youth, an apprenticeship program, that I could go into. I have 
pages. I have not even started my several page speech here.
<P>
	There are so many things we are beginning to do. Have we 
done it all in four months? Not quite, but we are working on it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the hon. member's parody. I think he should 
immediately sign up, in fact I strongly recommend that he sign 
up with the Quebec national theatre school. There, he will find 
an appropriate forum to put his great public speaking skills to 
the service of Quebecers first and Canadians second. As far as I 
am concerned, his approach with respect to the people of Canada 
and Quebec is unacceptable. He has tried to play on the word 
``vision'' and make a joke of it. However, we must admit in this 
House that the Liberal government has indeed lacked vision in 
all the projects it has proposed so far.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2632"> 2632 </A></B>
<P>
	I will simply remind my hon. colleague that 400,000 jobs are 
presently vacant with no one to fill them for lack of training, of 
adequate training that is. I will also remind him that we have 
1,500,000 unemployed people in this country. So, can he make a 
serious commitment to put everything having to do with 
manpower training, duplication and overlap in the hands of the 
provinces so to speak, to allow surpluses to be made and 
millions of dollars to be set aside to help our young people to 
create, to be creators instead of mere welfare recipients? Is he 
prepared to admit or submit to his government that job training 
should come under provincial jurisdiction?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague and 
friend from Chicoutimi, a man of great vision and foresight, the 
first person to recognize my skills and qualifications for the 
Quebec national theatre.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	Despite the member's opening remarks about my parity and 
so on, I am sure what I was doing did not escape him at all. In 
effect I was saying practice what you preach and preach what 
you practice.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	In the opposition's document of last fall there were only two 
fleeting references to unemployment and both related to past or 
current events. Neither gave any indication nor any inkling as to 
what the Parti Quebecois would like to see done insofar as the 
issue is concerned. It is difficult to preach to others if one does 
not have the solution. That was the thesis of what I was 
attempting to say. If I said it badly I apologize to my good friend 
from Chicoutimi.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as always the hon. member for Burin-St. George's 
said what he wished to say eloquently. It is absolutely amazing 
how he is able to say so little but so well. I applaud the hon. 
member.
<P>
	As this is such an exceptionally serious topic that we are 
debating today and the hon. member knows so well that his 
home province, of all the provinces, suffers the most from 
unemployment, could he say something about having the 
portability of labour across the country that includes Quebec so 
that people from all parts of this country can go wherever they 
want to find employment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and 
colleague from Edmonton Southwest.
<P>
	Let me first address his concern about my style of speaking. 
Newfoundlanders in the foyer at a funeral tell jokes. That does 
not mean they are glad the guy is dead. That means they have a 
very particular way of dealing with an issue. If we can get a 
message across with a bit of humour or relieve a situation with 
humour we do it. Whether it works is for others to judge.
<P>
	However, the subject is deadly serious. I can give the member 
an example that we have chafed under for a long time in 
Newfoundland. If the member knows the border between 
Labrador and Quebec he will know that there are two 
communities, one called Labrador City just east of the border 
and one called Fermont, Quebec just to the west, 12 miles from 
Labrador City. The person who lives in Fermont can drive down 
and work in the drug store or the shop in Labrador City, as she 
does and has for many years, but the son of the guy who owns 
that store cannot get a job in Fermont, Quebec. That has gone on 
there for many years. That is wrong.
<P>
	The lack of labour mobility across this country is wrong and 
discriminatory. It has caused a fight between Ontario and 
Quebec recently. I concur completely with my colleague that-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Resuming debate, The 
hon. member for Durham.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Madam Speaker, it is always 
a great delight to follow my hon. colleague, the member for 
Burin-St. George's.
<P>
	Concerning this motion brought forward by the hon. member 
for Mercier, lack of vision and lack of concrete measures 
relating to jobs, I have to speak against it.
<P>
	I want to talk about unemployment. Unemployment in this 
House has been regarded as something bad, something 
unfortunate, something systemic of our capitalist society and 
something that is wrong about where we are going in our life.
<P>
	I would like to give a little history lesson, going back to the 
17th century when people did not understand the concept of 
unemployment, when people worked seven days a week and 
basically dropped dead from work. There was no such thing as 
unemployment. They had to survive by working day in and day 
out.
<P>
	By the 19th century we were into the industrial revolution. 
Things were not necessarily any better but there was a better 
standard of living. People started to live longer. By the time we 
got to the 20th century and the Second World War we discovered 
that we had developed all kinds of new technologies, all kinds of 
things that made our businesses and our lifestyles more liveable. 
We discovered that we did not have to work the long hours we 
did in the past.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Around that same time the labour force participation rate in 
Canada went up. In other words, more people, mainly females, 
joined the workforce. We had a huge increase in the supply of 
labour, all at the same time that our technologies were becoming 
innovative.
<P>
	Now we are abreast with the 21st century. This is a knowledge 
based society. New technology has come to the fore: computers, 
computer graphics, laser technology, all kinds of new 
innovations that have made this the knowledge based society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2633"> 2633 </A></B>
<P>
	What has this done? This has created even further 
unemployment. I wonder if people could put their eyes on the 
concept that unemployment is merely a factor between needed 
productive hours and productive capacity. By that I mean we 
need <I>x</I> number of labour hours to produce our output. The reality 
is that these relationships have been changing over time. As we 
become a more technological society, we suddenly discover we 
need less labour input.
<P>
	I question whether this is a failure of our system or whether it 
is something to be proud of. Are we evolving into a society in 
which we have to work fewer hours?
<P>
	I can remember when I was very young my parents working 
six days a week. During my working years we have all worked 
five days a week. The question is do we need to work as many 
hours as we do and why are we working as many hours as we do? 
Maybe we are chasing a materialistic society. Maybe we are 
chasing all kinds of things that we do not really need.
<P>
	The reality is unemployment has continued to go up from the 
17th century right up until today. We can look at a number of 
features if we want to focus on the unemployed; those 1.559 
million people currently out of work in Canada, plus a certain 
number of those on welfare, who could be gainfully employed.
<P>
	As a consequence we have a huge mass of people not working. 
At the same time we have people in our workforce who are 
working 60 hours and 70 hours a week. Clearly the problem with 
unemployment is not that it exists but that it is concentrated in a 
small group of people. Unfortunately it is getting larger.
<P>
	What is the solution to this problem? The problem is that 
unemployment is concentrated in the youth, the unskilled and in 
those who have watched their skills change. This is probably a 
growing sector of our unemployment. Those people possibly in 
their forties who started off in the job market believing that they 
had a job for life have found that structural unemployment has 
caught up with them and put them out of a job.
<P>
	How are we going to change our unemployment rate? Our 
unemployment rate, as I mentioned, is merely a factor of 
required labour hours. Either we increase the number of labour 
hours by increasing our business activity or we change the 
labour hours to some extent. I will leave the debate about 
changing labour hours for another day.
<P>
	Basically our other orientation is to increase the number of 
required labour hours by increasing productivity. Within that 
parameter of increased labour hours we also have to look back at 
the pool of the unemployed, the people who are unskilled, those 
people who have structural change in their lives where their 
skills have disappeared and the youth who possibly have 
dropped out of school at a very early age and similarly are 
unskilled. How could we address increasing the number of 
labour hours? We can do it in two ways. We can increase our 
productivity.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	The government has enacted legislation regarding a reduction 
in payroll taxes. It would reduce the costs of businesses to 
employ people. It would create an incentive for businesses to 
employ more people and to expand in our society. It would 
create a demand for more labour hours. This is something our 
government has done, and I go back to the original motion, in 
terms of concrete measures.
<P>
	We have implemented an infrastructure spending program to 
create assets, to create productive resources. One municipality 
in my riding has agreed to increase the size of its arena. It has an 
employment policy to employ local workers. People who are 
unemployed will be working. There is a promise of work. The 
infrastructure spending program is what I call seed capital 
because it has a tendency to grow. If a job is created for one 
person working on the arena, he goes downtown and buys more 
products. He consumes more. He creates more jobs. It is a way to 
increase productivity.
<P>
	We have addressed to some extent the need of small and 
medium sized businesses to have access to better capital. We 
have done it in a number of ways. We have talked about 
implementing a code of ethics with the banks to allow small 
businesses better access to capital markets. We will also 
implement other programs to deal with access to equity capital 
markets. Once again it will give business an incentive to create 
new jobs.
<P>
	Another initiative of ours is the information highway. It is 
another aspect of 21st century technology; it brings Canada into 
the 21st century. It is the second stage of our technological 
revolution.
<P>
	Finally, we have to increase the opportunity for wages and 
employment. We have to look at the pool of unemployed people. 
Do not mistake what I have said. I did not say it was good that all 
these people are unemployed. I am saying that unemployment 
may be with us for a long time. It may be an asset if we handle it 
properly.
<P>
	To effect skills so that people who are unemployed today have 
better access to the job market when expansion occurs we have 
the youth corps. It will teach some skills to young people who 
are currently unemployed and have dropped out of the high 
school system. We have implemented an apprenticeship 
program to give young people and others job experience. It will 
give better skills to those people whose skills have shifted over 
the years.
<P>
	The original motion refers to lack of vision and lack of 
concrete measures. That is not so.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Madam Speaker, again, in 
his speech the hon. member referred to this famous 
infrastructure program. Let me tell you that this program which, 
according to government members, should solve the 
unemployment problem in Canada, is in my opinion simply a 
way to shift the deficit burden to the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	The deficit burden is and will continue to be off loaded on the 
municipalities since-and I have the figure to prove it-several 
municipalities in my riding, before they can participate in this 
infrastructure program, will have to invest an amount about 
equal to their federal subsidies.
<P>
	Let me also point out that municipalities willing to participate 
in this infrastructure program but unable to afford it will have to 
increase their debt load. Who will pay for this? It is always the 
same taxpayer who must pay, whether the money comes from 
the federal, provincial, or municipal government.
<P>
	I would like to hear his opinion on the money that Canadian 
taxpayers will have to spend on the infrastructure program, 
without solving the unemployment problem in Canada and 
Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question. Basically he is quite right. There is only one 
taxpayer in Canada. The question is how to best utilize our 
economic resources so that we create employment. The 
infrastructure spending program, as I just mentioned, has an 
expansionary effect. In other words as people go back to work 
they start paying taxes and reducing the deficit. Clearly we 
cannot continue with such high levels of unemployment. The 
real way to reduce our debt is to get a lot of people back to work.
<P>
	I am always amazed hon. members to my left invariably talk 
about the federal deficit as if it were some kind of unusual 
phenomenon of the Canadian federalist system. The province of 
Quebec has a debt. The province of Ontario has a debt. France 
has a debt. The United Kingdom has a debt. There is nothing 
unique about the federal government deficit. They all have debt. 
The problem is that we have to deal with it.
<P>
	Trying to turn this whole system on its head and blaming the 
federal government for the fact that we have to pay interest on 
our federal debt is not a realistic argument.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Madam 
Speaker, with regard to the debt and the infrastructure program, 
has the hon. member considered the whole concept of the 
amount of our debt and what we should do with regard to it?
<P>
	Unemployment is a direct result of overtaxation. Canadian 
consumers have less disposable income and consequently 
companies have more expensive products with fewer people 
trying to buy them. The infrastructure program should be dealt 
with as an infrastructure program and nothing else. It does not 
create any permanent jobs. It increases government debt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Madam Speaker, I will give the hon. member 
a brief example. The erection of a building will create 
technological innovation for my riding. I do not believe once the 
building goes up the function that goes on there will suddenly 
not have an ongoing factor. It is just the reverse. I believe 
infrastructure spending will continue.
<P>
	By the way, why do we not talk about Japan? Japan has a 
surplus and it still has unemployment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
always keenly interested in taking part in a debate when the 
subject is job creation. The subject becomes all the more 
stimulating when we tack on the words ``concrete measure'' and 
the mandatory ``urgent''. Concrete and urgent action. That is 
what hundreds of thousands of unemployed people are 
expecting. It is absolutely essential that these words be reflected 
in the government's day-to-day initiatives. The ministers who 
have the means to improve the horrendous job situation quickly 
and efficiently have to realize that when the will to introduce 
concrete and urgent measures is lacking, the government is 
condemning hundreds of thousands of unemployed people to 
harsh, intolerable living conditions.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	The extent of the unemployment situation has harmful 
consequences and deeply affects our social fabric. Unemployed 
persons, along with their families and children, quickly find 
themselves living in hellish conditions, without adequate 
financial resources. Day-to-day survival becomes a problem. 
Tensions mount and the pressure increases as the unemployed 
scramble to meet basic needs. Many households experience 
crises, dramas and break-ups.
<P>
	Intolerable living conditions brought on by unemployment 
affect the mental and physical health of those involved. In the 
long term, significant social costs are incurred and it is we who 
ultimately must pick up the tab. These things are happening in 
every one of our ridings and the situation is deteriorating. Our 
social fabric is unravelling and the public's anger is simmering. 
The Prime Minister can say what he likes but the way he was 
welcomed last week is proof that the public is fed up with pious 
wishes and nice speeches.
<P>
	The people no longer believe in promises. They want action to 
get them back into the labour force quickly. If the members 
opposite fail to understand the message and to respond quickly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2635"> 2635 </A></B>
<P>
to the demand for jobs, they will expose our society to more 
serious problems very soon.
<P>
	If the government does not pay enough attention to the 
repeated warnings heard in recent days, I sincerely believe we 
are moving towards a dark future. Our children will pay for this 
inertia. For some such as the well-off, including some of the 
members opposite, the daily problems of the jobless may appear 
trivial, not very important, since their own current assets allow 
them to secure their descendants' future. If I were in their shoes, 
I would worry and start asking myself serious questions.
<P>
	We have seen great empires melt away because of crises 
caused by serious socio-economic problems. In my riding the 
situation is alarming: over 30 per cent of the labour force are out 
of work. Worse still, these people see no light at the end of the 
tunnel. Signs of employment recovery are non-existent. The 
members opposite promised us job-creation measures. They 
said over and over it was their priority with a capital ``P''. 
Where are these measures? Where is this well-publicized 
job-creation plan?
<P>
	The people in my riding are now seeing the Liberals' lack of 
imagination and unwillingness to create jobs. The government 
is falling back on its infrastructure program, which is clearly 
insufficient to put people back to work. What a crock! It is not a 
project creating or maintaining 45,000 temporary jobs that will 
restore confidence to the 1,559,000 Canadians and 428,000 
Quebecers without jobs.
<P>
	For workers, it is disappointing to see this government take an 
almost passive attitude in the face of the unemployment crisis. It 
throws out a few crumbs and then sits and waits for the expected 
economic recovery to turn the situation around. However, 
economists agree that this recovery will not bring a miraculous 
increase in the number of jobs. Miracles do not happen in this 
world, as the members opposite know full well. So what are they 
waiting for to take action? What are they waiting for to innovate, 
introduce new programs, stimulate the economy wisely?
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Nice speeches are not concrete and urgent measures to create 
jobs. In my riding, the infrastructure program will create or 
maintain only a few hundred temporary jobs. It is not very 
convincing from a party that proclaimed itself, before October 
25, of course, the saviour of the economy and the great creator of 
lasting jobs. It already admits that these measures will only have 
a minor effect on unemployment, since the budget forecasts that 
the unemployment rate will remain around 11 per cent in 1995.
<P>
	The government always says it cannot do more given the 
current financial situation. The lack of money has become the 
favourite tune of the members opposite whenever the Canadian 
people ask them to invest more money. This tune is 
unacceptable. In its last budget the government decided not to 
trim fat or eliminate waste. Had it listened to us and shown the 
will to thoroughly examine all these programs, it would have 
had enough  financial leeway to foster and invest in job creation. 
But it has made its bed and must now lie in it.
<P>
	In the March 21 issue of <I>La Presse</I>, we read that 1,000 
Canadian entrepreneurs will participate in the Expo 1994 trade 
fair in Mexico. This is not a bad thing. These business people 
will test the ground and look at the opportunities offered by that 
country's 86.5 million people. This is all well and good but when 
these entrepreneurs need help to penetrate that market, what 
kind of support can they expect from a government that decided 
to maintain waste and fat instead of giving itself greater 
flexibility? Fat and waste are not concrete and urgent 
job-creation measures.
<P>
	The same applies to small and medium-sized businesses. 
They must be supported in their development and their plans for 
the future. Where is the Liberal government's flexibility? It 
does not have any, just crumbs that do not allow for real 
development. Our economy is based on regional small and 
medium-sized businesses. We must stimulate, even favour their 
creation. The government must get out of its rut and support 
dynamic environments such as universities, polytechnic schools 
and engineering departments; it must go there to find new ideas 
and people able to start new small and medium-sized 
businesses.
<P>
	If the members opposite just sit and wait for an economic 
recovery, do you really think the economy will pick up? So far, 
the Liberals have not shown any vigour, any new idea in their 
job-creation strategy. Roads, aqueducts, sewers, viaducts and 
bridges are all they came up with. They will create or maintain 
small, precarious jobs, spend some $2 billion without, in the 
end, investing anything in new medium and long-term projects, 
when such projects could create jobs in addition to stabilizing 
and strengthening our economy.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I would now like to draw your attention to an 
issue I deeply care about, which I have often raised with the 
ministers opposite. It is the construction of new social housing 
units and co-ops throughout the country. As we know, the 
Liberals have maintained the Conservatives' decisions in this 
area. Low-cost, co-op and non-profit housing programs were 
abolished on January 1st; from now on, not one cent will be 
spent on providing decent accommodation for the 1,200,000 
Canadians in urgent need of housing.
<P>
	Yet, these programs aimed at helping the poorly housed also 
created many jobs.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Statistics indicate that building 1,000 new housing units 
generates 2,000 jobs in the construction sector. That is a lot of 
jobs. We kill two birds with one stone: Employment is 
stimulated and living conditions are improved. I am convinced 
that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2636"> 2636 </A></B>
<P>
many contractors and construction workers in my constituency 
would be very pleased if several hundred social housing units 
were to be built in our riding. This would be a concrete social 
measure which would be beneficial from a  socio-economic 
point of view. Unfortunately, members opposite decided 
otherwise. They chose to leave poor families in slums and 
instead go for fat and waste. This, for me, will always remain a 
shameful decision.
<P>
	When we talk about employment, we must necessarily deal 
with professional training. In that regard, we are all aware that a 
significant amount of public money is wasted because of 
program duplication and the federal government's interference 
and desire to control and centralize.
<P>
	For a long time now, there has been a consensus in Quebec to 
the effect that the federal must delegate all powers to the 
province regarding this field of jurisdiction.
<P>
	It has been clearly demonstrated that the vocational training 
system in place is more and more obsolete. In Quebec alone, 
$250 million could be saved every year by eliminating 
overlapping. The system shows obvious flaws under the 
pressures of new technologies and new forms of work 
organization. In fact, the system does not allow individuals to 
quickly and adequately meet market needs. It is too 
burdensome, slow, complex and costly. The federal government 
interference in this field is certainly not conducive to promoting 
an efficient training system. It is individuals who pay the price 
for this interference. The system simply does not work. 
Individuals and labour markets are both adversely affected. We, 
Bloc Quebecois members, are asking the federal government to 
completely withdraw from this sector. However, as long as 
Quebec remains part of Canada and keeps paying taxes, the 
federal government will have to transfer to the province its fair 
share of public money. This patriation will finally allow Quebec 
to train efficiently and quickly its manpower, based on the needs 
of the labour market.
<P>
	This is another concrete measure which will help develop the 
ability to work of the unemployed, and consequently reduce the 
unemployment rate.
<P>
	In conclusion, I ask members opposite to take a close look at 
reality. Good horse-sense should tell them it is time to shape up 
and have a vision. Look beyond the immediate future. Try to see 
what the next few years hold; try to see what will happen with 
labour and consumer markets, services and products of the 
future, as well as new technologies. Look at all this and try to 
find initiatives which will make us ready. If you do not 
undertake this exercise and come up with a vision now, in ten 
years we will still be building roads to support our economy. I 
am very aware that this technique was once very profitable for 
old parties, but individual workers want more than just using a 
pick and a shovel for a short while to earn a living.
<P>
	Our workers are intelligent and they want to be considered as 
such. University students work very hard for three or even five 
years to earn their degree. And then what do they find on the job 
market? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Yet these people 
represent our future: they have all the skills and knowledge 
necessary to rebuild the economy.
<P>
	I ask the government to open its eyes wide and invest in real 
employment, as opposed to short-lived programs, so that all 
these young people can have a future.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have some esteem for the hon. member and I 
was a little disappointed-I understand that she belongs to the 
Official Opposition-when she made comments like ``cut the 
fat'' that feed into people's fears, this dishonesty propagated by 
members of the Reform Party.
<P>
	As a former deputy minister, I saw how much fat there was, 
and there was not so much because we have been cutting the fat 
for years. This does not mean that we cannot review what is 
going on to see if we could do better. But I find the suggestion 
exaggerated, not to say dishonest-that would be 
unparliamentary. It gives the impression that we could wipe out 
the debt, the deficit and everything else. I have so much esteem 
for my colleague that her statement surprises me. If I 
misunderstood her, she can correct me.
<P>
	This proposal before us today lacks a certain credibility. It is 
incredibly gloomy and pessimistic. I would never believe that 
my colleagues in the Bloc are so pessimistic and gloomy. 
Frankly, it pains me; I think that I will throw a little party to try 
to cheer them up a bit.
<P>
	When they talk about housing, they talk about a certain kind 
of people and they use what is going on in an attempt to give a 
very wrong impression. They do not talk about the $100 million 
to be spent over two years to repair houses across the country. 
They do not talk about the $2.1 million to be used to maintain 
650,000 existing homes. They do not talk about the $170 million 
in savings. And the hon. member does not know if there might be 
some social housing initiatives. How pessimistic: everything is 
dying or falling apart.
<P>
	What really bothered me is that they do not understand. Do 
they not listen to what is going on? They talk about the 
infrastructure program as if it were only about spades and 
shovels, but she did not study the programs, because there are 
very few spades and shovels. We are talking about a training 
network across the country. Is that spades and shovels? We talk 
about setting up high-tech companies. Is that spades and 
shovels? Yes, you have to break the ground with spades and 
shovels 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2637"> 2637 </A></B>
<P>
to build the building so that we can have information networks, 
but their view is very narrow. They do not see beyond spades and 
shovels. I find that very disturbing.
<P>
	When we talk about small and medium-sized businesses, for 
example, we have known for a long time that more than 85 per 
cent of jobs come from such businesses. We know that these 
businesses need capital. We know that they need to invest in 
research. We know that they need to group together and that is 
what we are doing. It is too bad that my colleagues in the Bloc do 
not understand that it is happening.
<P>
	Why did they not talk about summer jobs that will increase by 
20 per cent? Did they not know? Are they badly informed? Do 
they not have a research office? Do they not talk about it? What 
is going on? Did they talk about the Youth Service Corps? No, 
they did not! Did they talk about the apprenticeship program? 
No, they did not! There are so many good things that could have 
been mentioned, but no, all they see is doom and gloom. What a 
pity!
<P>
	Maybe the hon. member would like to react to what I said. If I 
misunderstood, I will gladly apologize with a big smile.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Madam Speaker, our dear parliamentary 
secretary certainly has acting talents. He sings even while 
talking to us.
<P>
	About the fat, he may not like that term, but it refers to tax 
shelters, to family trusts and that sort of thing. It is not 
mentioned explicitly but that is what it is about.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	That is where cuts should be made to be able to invest, to 
invest in jobs, in social housing, in social housing construction 
projects. We have been given the same old song and dance about 
social housing since the beginning by this Parliament. No 
investment has been made in new social housing units. From one 
year to the next, CMHC is allotted exactly the same $2 billion 
budget to administer. A $100 million amount is earmarked over 
two years for RRAP, the residential rehabilitation assistance 
program for home buyers. We know our programs, Madam 
Speaker. There is no need to tell us what we already know. We 
know.
<P>
	Our research services work very well. They are really very 
efficient. All I have to say is that certain projects, some section 
25 projets, these DEPs we all use in our committees-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Are you going to cut them?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> They intend to cut even the DEP program. 
Liberal members will have nothing left to give their voters. Of 
course, there are summer job programs, but that is not enough. 
These programs do not create permanent jobs. Summer jobs are 
only temporary.
<P>
	Steady jobs must be created, high-tech jobs, in areas where 
there are vacancies right now and no one to fill them. Above all, 
we have to create these jobs through manpower training, our 
own program, the one already in place in Quebec and that we are 
fighting to keep.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Paul):</B> I hear my 
hon. colleague opposite say that she is familiar with section 25 
programs and with direct employment programs and that she 
uses them. Well, I use them too and I am a Liberal. I am a French 
Canadian and I use both of these initiatives, direct employment 
programs and section 25 programs. Since I was elected, 38 
permanent jobs have been created in two small and 
medium-sized businesses in my riding. I would be curious to 
know how many jobs the hon. member opposite has created in 
her riding since taking office?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> I am not sure I understand the hon. member's 
question, but I will say what is being done in my riding to boost 
employment. Direct employment programs and section 25 
programs are temporary measures. They are designed to help 
certain unemployment insurance and welfare recipients get back 
into the labour force.
<P>
	In my view, which I believe is shared by several of my 
colleagues, these programs do not create long-term jobs. They 
were introduced to help people for a certain period of time, 
perhaps six months. Some programs have lasted one year, but 
there are no guarantees that the employer will ask an employee 
to stay on.
<P>
	People often benefit from a section 25 initiative and then go 
back on unemployment for six months or a year. These are not 
effective programs. They do exist and we do use them because 
people need food to eat and a roof over their heads. Of course we 
will use these programs for as long as they exist. After all, they 
are paid for with our tax dollars, yours and mine.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
not sure if it has been 10 minutes or 20 minutes that has been 
allotted to me. If it is 20 minutes, I would like to split the time 
and give the last 10 minutes to the member for Vancouver East.
<P>
	It is a pleasure for me to speak this afternoon to the motion put 
forward by the Bloc Quebecois on job creation. If we are to 
listen to my colleagues in the Bloc, it would be our belief that 
the opposition believes that this government has no plan for job 
creation. Nothing could be further from the truth.
<P>
	The entire Liberal platform as outlined in the red book is 
about job creation. I and every other Liberal member of 
Parliament campaigned for 47 days about job creation with a 
concrete plan of action. No government in Canadian history has 
moved as quickly as this government has to create jobs. For over 
two years the government has advocated a $6 billion cost shared 
program to improve public infrastructure in Canada. Just two 
months 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2638"> 2638 </A></B>
<P>
after the election the Prime Minister received the agreement of 
10 premiers to implement this program.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	If the members of the opposition want to see a concrete plan to 
create jobs, they should wait for a few more weeks until the 
construction season starts. Canadians will then see real concrete 
being poured across this country creating real jobs, and it will 
not be only with picks and shovels.
<P>
	In the next two years tens of thousands of jobs will be created 
in the construction industry alone, building projects under the 
infrastructure program. If that is not vision then I do not know 
what is.
<P>
	The government's job creation policies do not stop at the 
infrastructure program. The budget paper called <I>For Growing 
Small Businesses</I> provides a litany of government proposals and 
initiatives to help small businesses grow and create jobs. The 
decision of the government to reduce unemployment insurance 
premiums next year will reduce payroll costs to businesses and 
free up money to hire new employees.
<P>
	This government is actually reducing taxes to create 
employment. The Canada investment fund will provide capital 
assistance to businesses. Capital funding is essential if new 
technologies are to be properly developed and marketed. This 
will directly lead to the creation of highly skilled jobs in all parts 
of this country.
<P>
	The government will sponsor the creation of business 
networks. These networks will allow smaller companies to pool 
their resources and realize some of the benefits that only large 
companies now enjoy.
<P>
	This government also realizes that such networks can only 
work if they are controlled by the private sector. However, we 
will be providing matching grants to make the networks as broad 
ranging as possible. These networks will allow small businesses 
to expand their operations and hire new employees.
<P>
	The information highway will also help job creation. Most 
experts believe that information industries will become 
dominant in the coming years. With the advent of the 
information highway companies in all parts of this country, in 
towns large and small, will be able to access, process and sell 
information. As telecommunications networks improve it will 
not matter where you or your business is located. All you will 
need basically is a computer and a telephone line and you can be 
in business.
<P>
	As we rebuild resource based industries like the fishery for 
the small communities in my district, information based 
companies may be the provider of jobs. The highway will reduce 
communication costs for existing businesses and allow 
information based businesses to set up shop almost anywhere in 
the country, including my riding of St. John's West.
<P>
	The restoration of the RRAP will also help low and middle 
income families renovate their homes and live more 
comfortably. On top of this, the money supplied by the federal 
government for this program will be spent in small building 
supply companies, many of which my riding consists of, and 
will be used to hire skilled trades people like carpenters and 
electricians. Restoring the RRAP will create jobs in 
communities large and small across Newfoundland and Canada.
<P>
	The apprenticeship program will help our young people learn 
valuable work skills and increase their opportunities for 
employment. We are all well aware that there are shortages of 
skilled labour in some parts of Canada. The apprenticeship 
program will train young people to perform some of these jobs, 
thus providing employment to a generation faced with 
staggering unemployment and a pessimistic outlook to the 
future.
<P>
	The apprenticeship program will also help break the vicious 
cycle of no job without experience and no experience without a 
job. When they graduate from their programs, young people will 
have the skills and experience to fill the job.
<P>
	For the Reform Party any investment by the federal 
government to create jobs is too much. They would rather see 
the government cut untold billions from the budget and set every 
unemployed worker adrift. The Reform policy is a do nothing 
policy. This government was elected with a strong mandate to do 
something and that is what we intend to do.
<P>
	For the Bloc, its main interest is to prove that the federal 
government does not work and cannot do anything to solve the 
problems of Quebecers or other Canadians. If the government 
spent $100 billion in Quebec the Bloc would complain that there 
is one worker in Montreal who does not have a job, and therefore 
Canada does not work.
<P>
	For those few Tories left in the country, they say that our 
policies are exactly the same as theirs. This is not true. The 
Tories put together half measures and hoped that the problems 
would disappear. In the election we saw that the only thing that 
disappeared was the Conservative Party. The truth is that we 
have prepared a balanced approach to job creation.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Government can no longer do it all when it comes to job 
creation. There is not a bottomless pit of money to throw at the 
problem. This government is using its scarce resources to 
stimulate the economy and prod businesses to create jobs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2639"> 2639 </A></B>
<P>
	No one person or group of persons has all the answers and we 
do not claim to. However, this government is prepared to work 
with business, labour and individuals to provide real job 
creation opportunities.
<P>
	With goodwill and a sense of determination from all parties 
we will recover from the recession and provide lasting 
employment to Canadians in all regions including 
Newfoundland, including St. John's West.

	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the hon. member. I am from 
Quebec and she is from another province. Being the Official 
Opposition critic for natural resources, I get phone calls from 
the Maritimes, especially from New Brunswick. People in 
forestry, in farming say: ``You must help us''.
<P>
	If the Liberal Party agenda was that good, I would probably 
get a lot less phone calls. These people tell me and I quote: 
``They cut back in social services, in programs, cut back in 
unemployment insurance, cut back in health care and especially 
in forestry and farming''. Very few things for small business.
<P>
	Of course, what the hon. member is saying repeatedly, and 
rightly so, is that there is nevertheless an effort made with 
regard to the infrastructure and that must be recognized, and I 
do. But we are saying and I cannot repeat it 20 times: this spring, 
this summer or this fall, that program will work and I thank the 
government for it, but after that, what will the future hold for 
federal youth programs? What will the future hold for small 
business? What will the future hold for farmers and people in 
forestry? I put the question to the hon. member and I would like 
her to answer me. What will the future hold for all these people?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Payne:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I am not sure if the hon. member is aware of the fact 
that I am from Newfoundland and not from New Brunswick. As 
the hon. member realizes, in Newfoundland we have more of a 
fisheries crisis than we do of anything else.
<P>
	The problems that the hon. member spoke about in forestry 
and in farming certainly to a lesser degree are experienced in 
Newfoundland.
<P>
	I want to say again to the hon. member that the infrastructure 
program that was announced by this government was very 
welcome in my riding. As I said in my remarks earlier we in St. 
John's West cannot wait for that program to come into place. In 
my riding we have a very high unemployment rate because of the 
fisheries crisis and for other reasons.
<P>
	We certainly look forward to these programs being put into 
place in order to create even the short term employment which at 
this point in time will be very welcome. However, this program 
was not meant to create short term employment solely. It is also 
a means to  kick-start the economy so that other businesses will 
in turn create long term jobs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to start by quoting from the speech of my colleague. 
She said: ``Government cannot do it all when it comes to job 
creation''. This is very nicely put, and we agree with that. 
However, we feel that the government should not be doing 
nothing, which is precisely what it is doing right now.
<P>
	The reliance on an infrastructure program takes us back to the 
Trudeau era, and maybe even earlier than that. This recipe for 
restructuring the economy dates back to the 1930s, at the time of 
the great depression, when an infrastructure program was put in 
place. I believe that times have changed. The economy has also 
changed and I just hope that the Liberals have kept pace with 
those changes.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The way this infrastructure program will work is dreadful, 
and I will give you an example. I do not know whether the people 
in my riding have come to the same conclusion, but here it is. In 
a small town of my riding, Repentigny, the council had to 
borrow $6 million in order to get its share of money from the 
infrastructure program. After it has borrowed the $6 
million-and I am not talking about Montreal here, I am talking 
about a town of 50,000 inhabitants-the town will receive the 
same amount from the federal government. How much is this 
going to cost in interest payments? How much more taxes will 
the residents have to pay? And how long will the program last?
<P>
	I regret, Madam Speaker, but I must say that it is disgrace for 
the government to come up with such a program, claiming it is 
going to create jobs, and nothing else.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Payne:</B> Madam Speaker, I am not sure that the hon. 
member asked a question. I think it was more a comment than a 
question. However, I do understand the hon. member's problem 
there. I suspect that there probably are some communities that 
will not be able to take advantage of this infrastructure program.
<P>
	However, I have talked to all of the municipal people from 
every community in my riding over the past couple of weeks. We 
have worked out a plan whereby almost every community will 
be able to take advantage.
<P>
	I do not say that there are not some exceptions. There 
certainly are. However, I believe that with some ingenuity and 
some imagination almost every community in my riding will be 
able to take advantage of this program in one way or another.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to rise in this House to participate in 
this debate on job creation because I believe the government's 
proposal is full of vision.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry recently made at a G-7 meeting in 
Detroit a speech in which he stressed the need to maintain a 
stable economic environment to stimulate job creation.
<P>
	The economic challenges facing Canadians are well known. 
Unemployment is too high and budget deficits undermine 
governments' capability to take remedial action.
<P>
	All G-7 nations are facing similar problems. Within most 
large economies, consumer confidence has generally remained 
low, reflecting unemployment rates which are high and still 
rising as well as continued uncertainty with regard to 
employment. We cannot take a piecemeal approach to these 
problems. A comprehensive approach is required.
<P>
	The government recognizes that the task at hand is as simple 
and at the same time as difficult as setting the economy back on 
the road to growth, because the solution to our problems is just 
that, growth.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government has begun the work of implementing a long 
term growth strategy for a durable recovery and job creation. It 
has three elements. The first is reducing the deficit. Canada is 
committed to reducing its deficit to GDP ratio 6.4 per cent in the 
fiscal year 1993-94 to 3 per cent by 1996-97. This is a realistic 
plan based on cutting $5 in expenditures for each $1 in new 
revenue raised.
<P>
	Second, it will reduce the impediments to growth by ensuring 
the right framework for business expansion in the three areas of 
trade, training and infrastructure. The signing of the GATT and 
NAFTA agreements will be a major boost to our exports and will 
lead to many jobs and opportunities in Canada. We are also 
increasingly focusing on the Asia-Pacific region and was in 
which Canadian companies can participate.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development's initiatives 
to ensure that Canada's labour force is ready to tackle the new 
opportunities will be a major determinant of our success. Social 
security reform will create jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	Further, the government's infrastructure program is helping 
the economy to get moving again. This is a short term job 
creation program that recognizes the impact that smart 
investments in infrastructure can have on long term job creation.
<P>
	Third, the government will provide leadership for Canada's 
transition to the new economy. Growing companies take risks 
and use science and technology to the fullest. They are, in a 
word, innovative. There is much that can be done to promote 
innovation but this was perhaps the area of greatest neglect by 
Canadian  governments in the 1980s. It is the area of greatest 
potential for restoring growth in the economy in the 1990s.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To provide adequate leadership for transition to this new 
economy, we must promote the development and use of new, 
innovative technologies by the private sector; examine the 
needs of small businesses and the opportunities coming their 
way, particularly in the case of extremely innovative businesses; 
co-operate with the private sector to put in place the 
infrastructure required by the new economy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The approach to job creation that the government is following 
relies on the ability of technology, whether newly created 
through R and D or adopted and more effectively diffused to a 
greater number of companies to create jobs.
<P>
	Technology and innovation are central to the solution of the 
unemployment crisis. Higher productivity brought about 
through the application of new technology and innovation leads 
to higher income and to more and better jobs.
<P>
	A recent study by the Department of Finance found that 
technology intensive industries produced 47.7 per cent of the 
new jobs created between 1984 and 1991. Industries that were 
both high tech and high knowledge users contributed 46 per cent 
of new jobs, although they accounted for only about one-third of 
total employment.
<P>
	In the recent budget we began the process of implementing a 
new agenda through which technology plays a central role in our 
approach to job creation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Another driving force of our economic growth is small 
business. Not only do the vast majority of existing businesses 
fall into that category, but they are also our main source of job 
creation. In fact, during the 1980s, 87 per cent of all new jobs 
were created in that area. In 1991, 53 per cent of all Canadians in 
the private sector were either self-employed or working for 
businesses with fewer than 100 employees. Technology, 
combined with horizontal management structures and 
flexibility, can help small businesses adjust quickly to respond 
to changing consumer needs.
<P>
	According to a recent government study on the growth of 
some 2,000 small businesses, companies that make use of 
technology, develop their own innovative technologies or 
concentrate on technology diffusion or adoption achieve better 
results in terms of growth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2641"> 2641 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Although small businesses create jobs they can face serious 
impediments such as restricted access to capital, inadequate 
management skills, a lack of skilled employees, limited 
technological sophistication and underdeveloped marketing 
abilities, especially abroad.
<P>
	We must work on removing the impediments they face. We 
must also encourage small businesses to become aggressive 
innovators. Therefore, the government is committed to 
improving the business environment for small business and 
reshaping government policies and programs in support of small 
business.
<P>
	In summary, the government has outlined its agenda for small 
business which underlines the government's determination to 
work closely with all the stakeholders to ensure that this vital 
sector continues to provide economic growth and create even 
more jobs.
<P>
	Another important hallmark of the new economy is the world 
of telecommunications. In its plans for the future, the 
government will focus on the development of the information 
highway as a necessary infrastructure for the new economy. The 
information highway links the major elements of the new 
economy: users, content, technology and networks.
<P>
	Well planned spending on this new type of infrastructure 
offers the potential for immediate job creation in the short term, 
while it is being built. As well, there will be a payoff in the 
longer term through the support of higher levels of economic 
activity when it is operational.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To conclude, the Government of Canada has carefully 
examined the international situation with regard to growth and 
job creation. While high unemployment and the increasing 
number of low-paying jobs may have many causes, they are 
basically due to the inability of economies to innovate and 
adjust to technological progress as well as changes in the 
international trade structure.
<P>
	The Canadian program to promote innovation in all economic 
sectors and invest in people is on track.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Madam 
Speaker, first I would like to thank the hon. member for 
Vancouver East for her always very heartfelt, very moderate 
remarks, and I would like to make two or three comments that 
will take the form of questions. As you can appreciate, today's 
opposition motion does not mean in any way that we believe 
jobs can be created by waving a magic wand. It simply says that 
this government does not offer us hope for the future, an overall 
vision regarding job creation. On a more fundamental level, 
beyond this lack of vision, we see structural obstacles in the 
presence of two governments that have clearly not found a 
balance in terms of job creation.
<P>
	For us, the best government is not the one that intervenes the 
least. The best thing that could happen to Quebecers is to have 
one less government. So much for the general framework.
<P>
	In the meantime, since we must continue to work within that 
system, I would like to ask the hon. member for Vancouver East 
this: Does she agree with me that, at the national level, the 
sectors that will create jobs, where workers will be needed in 
coming years, surprisingly enough and contrary to conventional 
wisdom, are often sectors with strong community involvement? 
I am thinking in particular of the whole issue of support services 
for seniors. The hon. member knows that the number of senior 
citizens will double in Quebec and Canada. That is something 
we have in common.
<P>
	As an eminent economist from the Université du Québec à 
Montréal, Ruth Rose, pointed out, there is also the child-care 
sector. We live in a society where people work split shifts. It is 
not like in the old days when people got up at eight o'clock in the 
morning and worked until five in the afternoon before going 
home. People now work irregular hours and governments will 
have to invest very heavily in a national network of child-care 
centres.
<P>
	In closing, I will talk about the recreation sector, especially 
for handicapped people. We are fortunate to have in this House a 
member such as the hon. member for Mercier, whose keen 
intelligence and talent is well known and who has always said, 
like most members of the Bloc Quebecois believe, that 
economic growth and job development must go hand in hand 
with community network development.
<P>
	I therefore ask the hon. member if she believes we can, within 
her government's job proposal, emphasize community 
networks. Can we rely on her dynamism and her sense of 
involvement; will she become her government's social 
conscience if it ever decides to cut job-creation programs?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Do you want me to join the Bloc Quebecois?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> No, that is not necessary.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Thank you. I have a great social conscience 
because I come from a riding that needs to have a social 
conscience. I also see the need to find other sources.
<P>
	I believe that we must redefine the question of work now. 
Work is no longer what we knew. Now we talk about technology 
and support. You are right. We also talked about child care, for 
which, as you know, the Liberal Party and the government 
promised to create 50,000 spaces when economic growth in 
Canada allows.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2642"> 2642 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe that we must work together. For example, the private 
sector should support us in all this, the other governments too, as 
you said, and I believe that if all governments worked together, 
it would be easier.
<P>
	Finally, there are all the consultations to find out what we 
really need. Of course I would like the situation to be otherwise 
but I also know that it is not possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena):</B> Madam Speaker, first I would like 
to apologize for missing my rotation and I am grateful for 
having the opportunity to come back on. I would like to begin by 
saying that I probably would agree with the intent of the motion 
of the Bloc Quebecois although we are probably going to come 
at it from a different angle.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	I come at it from the angle that government does not create 
jobs. Every time I hear this term job creation by somebody in 
government it is almost like running a fingernail down a 
chalkboard as far as I am concerned. Government does not 
create jobs. What government can do however is facilitate the 
creation of jobs.
<P>
	I have lived in the northwest of British Columbia for all my 
life and for many years I was the partner in a construction 
business in northwestern British Columbia. It was a successful 
business. We started in 1981-82 with five employees and when 
we sold the business in 1990 we were employing up to 200 
people at various times of the year.
<P>
	We did this without any government grants, any handouts, any 
subsidies. As a matter of fact, and I say this with all sincerity, we 
did it in spite of government, not with any government help.
<P>
	I have also been involved in the business community in 
Kitimat for many years with the Chamber of Commerce and 
many of my good friends and acquaintances come from the 
business community. Of course as a community we often 
associate and we talk about the various problems we face in our 
businesses and the various things that hinder or help us.
<P>
	I can assure everyone that virtually all of the business 
contacts I have do not look at government as being some kind of 
boon to their existence. As a matter of fact they share the 
feelings I have that if government would only get off their backs 
and leave them alone they would have a lot better opportunity to 
create jobs or expand their businesses, to be profitable, to grow 
and to prosper.
<P>
	I have some examples of the failure of government policies, 
some anecdotal evidence, that maybe some of the members here 
would be interested in.
<P>
	Back in the early 1980s we contracted on the construction of a 
road that the federal government had put out for tender. In the 
contracting business when you submit a tender you are locked 
in. Your price is fixed. If your price is accepted then you are 
obligated to complete that job or project for the price you 
tendered.
<P>
	At the time we were bidding the job there was no federal sales 
tax on explosives. Historically it had not been included. For 
whatever reason it had never been a part of the federal sales tax 
regime.
<P>
	We bid the job. We got prices for explosives because it was a 
major component of the job and subsequent to submitting our 
tender and being awarded the job, but before we even got started 
on the project, the finance minister of the day came along and 
imposed a federal sales tax on explosives. We immediately went 
back and said to the minister that we were working for him, the 
government. We fixed the price to do this job, and after we fixed 
our price he had come along and increased our costs by $50,000 
and we thought we ought to be able to get that back.
<P>
	Do you think the government would do it? This was a Liberal 
government I might add. It was not the Conservative 
government. We never had any success.
<P>
	These are the kinds of problems businesses come up against. 
Let me give you some more examples of government 
intervention in the marketplace.
<P>
	For many years there was a successful ready-mix business 
operated in my community and that ready-mix business as part 
of its operation had a small block plant. On rainy days when 
there was nothing else to do the employees, rather than being 
sent home, would manufacture masonry blocks.
<P>
	There was a fellow in a neighbouring community who got the 
bright idea that he should be in the block business. He secured a 
$700,000 loan or a loan guarantee from the federal government 
to put his business into operation, to create a huge block plant 
that could not possibly ever sustain itself for the market area it 
was trying to service. He drove the fellow in Kitimat out of 
business. His block plant had to close down. The employees lost 
the benefit of employment on rainy days when there was nothing 
left to do. In the end the new business failed simply because it 
was not a good business idea in the first place. If it had been a 
good business idea I suggest that he would not have had the 
problem in coming up with the funds.
<P>
	Any time the government gets involved with funding these 
kinds of operations it is generally because it is a bad business 
idea. It is generally destined to fail. Not only are the taxpayers 
hurt but usually the competitors of that business are hurt. They 
are the ones that are contributing to the tax base. In effect their 
tax dollars are being used to support these businesses that are 
built up to compete against them.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2643"> 2643 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	These are the kinds of federal policies that we have had to live 
with in the business community in the past. When I hear about 
job creation it just does not ring true with me.
<P>
	Let me give a most recent example. In the House today we 
were talking about a subsidy on the part of the government for a 
new aluminium smelter in South Africa, a $60 million U.S. 
dollar or close to a $100 million Canadian export credit to a new 
South African aluminium smelter. If the government is talking 
about job creation they must be interested in creating jobs in 
South Africa but certainly not here.
<P>
	We have 10,000 people in Quebec who are employed directly 
in the primary production of aluminium and 2,000 people 
employed in British Columbia in my riding at Kitimat in one of 
Alcan's largest smelters anywhere. These people are paying 
their taxes and contributing to Canadian society and they see 
their taxes being used to support the construction of a new 
aluminium smelter in South Africa. How are we creating jobs in 
Canada by that measure? Where is the consistency in 
government? I just do not see it.
<P>
	Some of the irritants and costly policies that government 
follow are that small businesses in Canada are acting as the 
agent of the government in collecting taxes, UIC premiums, 
CPP premiums and personal employment data. As well as being 
an unpaid job, the fact is they are liable for any mistakes they 
might make. They are liable for doing the government's work 
for them. In addition to acting as an agent they have to make 
payroll deductions and remit that money on a regular basis. In 
the case of my business it was on the 15th of each month. In the 
past we had to have our cheques postmarked by the 15th of the 
month so that we would avoid penalties and interest.
<P>
	Now the government that talks about aiding small business 
wants to have electronic transfers of those funds on the 15th of 
the month. If you do not get your electronic transfer done in time 
you are going to be faced with a 10 per cent penalty right off the 
bat let alone the interest charges. Now I ask, how is that assisting 
or helping small business?
<P>
	This policy is tantamount to paying taxes in advance. When I 
was in business we had to meet our payroll and pay our expenses 
often long in advance of receiving the revenues that were 
attached to those expenses. I do not think the government 
fundamentally recognizes just how difficult it is.
<P>
	It is one thing to talk about job creation and how we are going 
to assist small business, but it is quite another thing to sit there 
on a Thursday afternoon and try to make sure you are going to be 
able to cover your payroll on Friday. That is something that 
small business right across Canada has to face all the time and it 
is something that we in government-and I include myself now 
because I have become part of the guilty as it were-all  too 
often fail to recognize. It is an extremely difficult existence out 
there for small business.
<P>
	A small business person does not get a pension plan. They can 
maybe make use of the registered retirement savings plan but 
they do not have their own pension plan. They are not entitled to 
unemployment insurance benefits if their business fails. 
Oftentimes they are putting in 60, 70 or 80 hours a week and not 
receiving benefits. Many people who are working in regular jobs 
would be surprised. I think a lot of times people expect that 
entrepreneurs in small and medium sized businesses are very 
wealthy. The case is really that very few people actually become 
fabulously wealthy and successful. Most people just make a 
living at it and as a government we have to recognize that.
<P>
	I have seen no evidence to this point that the government is 
taking any steps to rectify the problems that business faces. 
Taxation rules for example, are becoming more complex rather 
than simpler. I recall that when I was in business I looked at the 
tax act on a couple of occasions and neither myself, my 
accountant or my lawyer could not figure out what it meant.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	How can we expect small business to be able to prosper when 
it has to deal with ambiguous tax laws? When you are trying to 
make a business decision on the best way to acquire a new asset 
or to open a new business, you have to spend all your time trying 
to figure out the best way to do it taxwise rather than getting on 
with the job and letting your entrepreneurial talents run toward 
creating the business and making it work. That is the kind of 
thing that government can do for small businesses, make it 
easier for them to exist.
<P>
	Diversification funding, regional development funding and 
all the things I talked about earlier are still very much alive and 
it is still very much the attitude of members opposite that this is 
the way we are going to help business and industry. It is not.
<P>
	As long as government prevails with this attitude, we are 
going to have a continual drain on tax dollars, we are going to 
have continual failures in the individual areas where these 
moneys are invested and it is going to hinder rather than help 
small business. While the Bloc is talking about no vision for the 
future, my vision is to get government out of these things and let 
small business prosper on its own.
<P>
	I am going to conclude my remarks by saying that there is an 
opportunity right now for government to show leadership, to 
change some of the policies it has been following, to recognize 
that government does not create jobs, government does not 
create wealth. It certainly has the ability to expropriate wealth 
and it does that with remarkable ability.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	The only jobs that government ever creates are jobs that are 
created as a result of the expropriation of somebody else's 
wealth in the first place. We have to recognize that. When 
government does recognize that-

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member. It is almost five o'clock.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the 
House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve-Canada Labour Code; the hon. 
member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead-Federal Deficit.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Madam Speaker, in concluding my 
remarks I was saying that there is an opportunity for government 
to show some leadership, to change policies and develop a 
vision for business and industry in Canada by being partners in 
the sense that we get out of the way and allow small business the 
opportunity to do what it can do very well if given the 
opportunity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I really did appreciate the remarks of the hon. member 
for Skeena, particularly the matter of direct grants to business.
<P>
	A lot of us would agree that often this does not work very 
effectively but I wish he would give credit to this budget where 
credit is due. I point out to him that the government has 
cancelled the $608 million KAON accelerator project which is a 
classic example of the type of thing that he is talking about.
<P>
	I would like him to comment on that and tell me whether he 
agrees that the government was wise to cancel KAON.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his intervention.
<P>
	I would remind him that KAON was not a regional 
development initiative. It was a science initiative. Having said 
that, the member asked to give credit where credit is due in the 
budget.
<P>
	We have subsequent to the new government being elected not 
only development incentives and grants taking place within 
Canada but it was only recently announced that the federal 
government was going to provide a $100 million Canadian 
export credit to a new aluminum smelter in South Africa. That 
tells the whole story. The government has not yet accepted the 
fact that you cannot do it that way.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member for Skeena talked about small business in a 
way as though Liberals in the country had never heard of small 
business. I can assure the gentleman that thousands of Liberals 
are business people and that thousands of businesses support the 
Liberal Party.
<P>
	We know some of the problems faced by small business. If the 
gentleman from Skeena would have read the budget a little more 
closely, he would have noticed that small business plays a big 
part in the budget. We are attempting to do many things to make 
its life a little easier.
<P>
	For example, we will be developing what we call a lending 
code for banks, because small businesses have been 
complaining vociferously for years about the way they are 
treated by banks. We will be establishing a venture capital fund. 
We are expanding information centres across the country 
because we know how important information is to small 
businesses that are not wealthy, as he pointed out, and do not 
have the resources to get information on their own hook.
<P>
	We will be expanding the technology network because 
technology is important to small business. We will be expanding 
the parameters of the Export Development Corporation because 
exports are important to the country and important to small 
business. Small business can do a lot more in the way of exports. 
Right now only 8 per cent of our business community exports.
<P>
	We have recognized some of the problems facing the small 
business community. It is recognized in the budget. I think the 
Reform Party does not do a service to this institution when it, it 
appears, deliberately ignores what was stated in the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Madam Speaker, I point out that we live 
in a democracy. Those business people who support Liberals are 
allowed to be wrong.
<P>
	I touch on what the hon. member said about the expansion of 
the Export Development Corporation. This is exactly what I am 
talking about. The Export Development Corporation announced 
the $100 million Canadian loan credit to build the new South 
African aluminium smelter. If this is what the hon. member is 
talking about, I rest my case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to ask a very brief question. In his initial remarks, if I heard 
them correctly, my colleague indicated that governments do not 
make jobs. I think I understand what he was getting at. Normally 
there are conditions under which businesses operate. If they do 
well their profits create jobs for Canadians or wherever they 
happen to be.
<P>
	I would like my colleague's reaction to the following. While I 
accept that-and I am assuming I have interpreted his comments 
correctly-would he not agree that government involvement, 
for example in student employment as will be occurring this 
summer and as has occurred during the last few summers 
particularly during periods of study, is a noble and supportive 
enterprise on the part of government?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2645"> 2645 </A></B>
<P>
	Would my colleague agree, for example, that the program we 
want to initiate, the youth corps, is a noble and worthy initiative 
that should be supported by all parties?
<P>
	What about the apprenticeship program the government wants 
under way, particularly in areas of high tech and where jobs will 
be required in future growth areas?
<P>
	What about those kinds of initiatives? Is the Reform Party's 
policy against those kinds of initiatives? I understand the basic 
philosophy is that if we reduce taxes more jobs will be created. 
However does that exclude those kinds of initiatives for youth, 
the new apprenticeship programs and the like that I have 
mentioned?
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Madam Speaker, in the area of 
educational assistance such as apprenticeship programs, 
provided there is a cost benefit and the benefit outweighs the 
cost, certainly our party is in favour of it. We believe we have to 
make a stronger effort to educate and train our people so that 
they are ready to go into the workforce.
<P>
	As far as the youth corps and the youth development program 
are concerned and as far as I am personally concerned, we are 
really looking at a handout. We are not looking at a hand up. We 
are not looking at preparing people and getting people into 
positions where they will be entering the workforce. What we 
are really doing is handing out taxpayers' assistance to youth.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member disagrees with me, but that is the 
way I see it.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Madam 
Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> You have until 5.15 p.m.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mercier:</B> Madam Speaker, to emerge from its economic 
doldrums, our country needs a large-scale collective project, 
one which will generate our enthusiasm and mobilize us. Such a 
project exists, but an act of government good will is needed to 
get it off the ground. I am referring to the project to build a 
high-speed train to service the Quebec 
City-Montreal-Laval-Ottawa-Toronto-Windsor corridor. 
Several studies have already concluded that this project would 
be economically viable.
<P>
	The minister is waiting for a new report to be released this 
summer. However, based on the information he already has, he 
should be able today to say, without jeopardizing the terms of 
the venture: ``Yes, we will proceed with the high-speed rail 
project''. If the minister were to make this statement now, he 
would not be hurting the authors of the expected report in any 
way.
<P>
	This kind of statement would pleasantly surprise us and would 
show that our government can at least boast of the three things 
that my hon. colleague for Laurentides criticized it earlier for 
not having, namely vision, vision and more vision to create 
``jobs, jobs, jobs'', as promised in the red book.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	There are so many reasons to support what could become the 
major project of this decade that I hardly know where to start, or 
should I say, I hardly know what I should leave out, to finish my 
speech on time. In any case, first of all, studies have shown that 
the market is large enough to ensure the project's economic 
viability. According to information released by Bombardier, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2646"> 2646 </A></B>
<P>
company's pre-feasibility study has shown that this railway 
service would serve a population of eight million  and attract 
nearly 5,300,000 travellers annually, an increase of 3,700,000 
over the current ridership.
<P>
	We now have information that emphasizes the benefits of 
HST connections for travellers in terms of security, travelling 
time and cost. According to the study, travelling time from 
station to station, calculated with a top operating speed of 300 
kilometres per hour, would be 1 hour and 35 minutes between 
Quebec City and Montreal, 1 hour and 5 minutes between 
Montreal and Ottawa, and so forth. The time saved, even 
compared with flying, is considerable.
<P>
	Furthermore, as is the case in Lyon, the HST could provide a 
very efficient way to solve the problem of transportation to and 
from Mirabel and Dorval and could also provide a quick 
connection between these airports by adding a loop where the 
train would run only at certain times.
<P>
	Another reason to support the HST is, of course, the 
environment. Per passenger, the HST consumes half as much 
energy as the automobile and one-quarter as much as a jet 
aircraft.
<P>
	If the line could be fully electrified, as is the case all over 
Europe, there would be even less impact on the environment, 
because there would be no emissions and the train would 
consume energy that is abundant in Ontario as well as Quebec, a 
province that is trying to export surplus energy.
<P>
	I will now discuss job creation, since that is the purpose of 
this debate. The HST would create a total of nearly 120,000 jobs 
annually. This initiative would reduce government spending 
under the Unemployment Insurance Program. I say this in 
connection with the expected loss of hundreds of jobs as a result 
of the merger between CN and CP. Ideally, the HST would 
absorb these workers.
<P>
	Without a plan for the future, Quebec's railway industry is 
doomed. The HST would give VIA Rail a second lease on life 
and a chance to finance railway lines operating at a loss, as the 
SNCF does in France.
<P>
	The cost, and I have not had much of time to discuss this 
aspect, is evaluated at $7.5 billion, but there would be 
revenues-

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should amend the Income 
Tax Act so that child support payments are no longer considered taxable income

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2653"> 2653 </A></B>
<P>
	She said: Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to stand in the 
House this evening to speak to the following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should amend the Income 
Tax Act so that child support payments are no longer considered taxable income 
for their recipients.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This motion holds a great deal of interest throughout the 
country.
<P>
	In 1942 Canada introduced a taxation policy on child support 
payments which allowed the payers to deduct the full amount of 
the payment from their income while the recipients must include 
the full amount in their income calculations. The policy has 
been criticized as discriminatory to women because it places an 
unfair tax burden on the custodial parent, usually the mother. 
Evidence shows in theory and in practice that this criticism is 
valid. This situation can be partially explained by historical 
changes, more specifically in patterns of the lives of men and 
women in Canada over the last 50 years.
<P>
	When the policy was introduced in the 1940s it was designed 
to provide relief to the taxpayer burdened with both a wartime 
increase in taxes and the obligation of spousal and child support. 
The father was typically the only income earner and therefore 
the sole taxpayer in the separated family. It was logical at that 
time that tax relief be awarded to him. It was assumed the 
mother would still pay no tax.
<P>
	Today, most single mothers have earned income and pay taxes 
on this income whether or not they receive support. What are the 
changes that have occurred in our society since this tax policy 
was implemented in the 1940s? First there have been 
demographic changes. The phenomenon of lone parenthood 
affects many more people today than in the past. Due to divorce 
and remarriage, lone parenthood is not always a lifetime, 
permanent situation. Rather is a phase of life of varying duration 
experienced by many parents. While lone parenthood itself may 
not be a permanent situation, the consequences have a lasting 
impact on women and children, particularly where the period of 
lone parenthood is lengthy and income is subsequently 
inadequate.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	As well, the practical support networks of extended family 
and community which usually provided financial and other 
forms of support have shrunk due to urban development and 
increased mobility.
<P>
	Second, there has been a number of social changes. Today 
violence against women is being recognized as a societal 
problem that takes many forms and influences many aspects of 
women's daily life.
<P>
	When negotiating a separation or divorce agreement many 
women are left in a very vulnerable position. Often they simply 
wish to get out of their relationship and to get on with their lives. 
This often creates pressure to capitulate to inequitable 
settlements in order to end  confrontation and avoid long drawn 
out custody battles. Returning to court later to seek a variance of 
child support is usually economically prohibitive for women 
and can carry many of the same dangers as the initial 
negotiation.
<P>
	The report by the Royal Commission on the Status of Women 
in 1970 was the first study to examine the economic and social 
disadvantage of women in Canada. Since then many other 
studies have overwhelmingly identified and described the 
feminization of poverty and its direct relationship to the unpaid 
work involved in raising children and other tasks related to 
human maintenance.
<P>
	Third, policy changes over the years have had a significant 
impact on the situation of women, families with children and in 
particular lone parent families. There has been decreasing 
support for families with children through the tax transfer 
system over the past two decades. The value of deductions and 
credits for children as a proportion of income has been steadily 
reduced. The reduction of the number of tax brackets from 10 to 
3 today has also had an impact on families and on the tax 
treatment of child support.
<P>
	Often after a divorce it is very difficult to find work with 
adequate pay to meet the needs of the children in the household. 
Therefore, mothers are forced to rely on social assistance. 
Social assistance policies in Canada however are not designed to 
take into consideration child support. Dollar for dollar of child 
support payments are deducted from the mother's social 
assistance cheques leaving her in a disadvantaged position of 
having little money for her children.
<P>
	Fourth, there have been a number of economic changes in our 
society which impact on the taxation of child support. Perhaps 
the most significant change is the steady increase in the number 
of women, including those with children, participating in the 
labour force. However, they are still paid at the lower end of the 
pay scale.
<P>
	After divorce family resources are often inadequate to 
continue to meet children's needs, yet it is the single mother who 
continues to be solely or primarily responsible for the financial 
needs of children because of the extremely high rate of default 
and child support awards.
<P>
	The evidence is overwhelming. Given the number of changes 
that have occurred over the last 50 years it is paramount that we 
revisit the 1940s policy of the tax treatment of child support 
payments. We must ask ourselves if this policy is still, or for that 
matter, whether it has ever met its original goal of providing tax 
relief to the tax burden and encourage the payment of child 
support.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2654"> 2654 </A></B>
<P>
	The rationale that the deduction for child support payers 
automatically requires inclusion as income by the recipient does 
not hold water. While they were married the father's support of 
the children was not income to the mother. While they were 
married the father's support of the children was not deductible. 
Likewise, now that they are divorced the custodial mother does 
not get to deduct what she spends on the children. The parents 
have now gone their separate ways. Why should the father's 
support of his children now become taxable income to the 
mother?
<P>
	Child support payments were not income to the custodial 
mother prior to the 1940s because they did not fit the income tax 
concept of income. The Oxford Dictionary defines income as 
money received during a certain period as wages or salary. Child 
support in the custodial mother's hands is not new wealth from 
the production of labour or capital. It is simply the father's 
payment for his share of his children's expenses.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	The most important rationale for the reduction-inclusion 
treatment is that it will encourage higher support payments by 
shifting income from a higher tax paying parent to a lower tax 
paying parent. This is expected to cause a surplus tax saving 
available to increase child support payments.
<P>
	The policy expects that the father's tax savings will always be 
greater than the mother's tax liability. Because of this the 
non-custodial parent should be able to pay the custodial parent's 
increased taxes through what is commonly referred to as a tax 
gross-up added to the child support payment. Then the policy 
assumes there will still be an additional surplus tax saving 
which can also be used to increase child support.
<P>
	However, as we all know, theory and reality do not always 
produce the same end results and this is definitely the case with 
the deduction-inclusion policy.
<P>
	First, although the father's tax saving may be greater than the 
mother's tax liability, neither the Income Tax Act or family law 
legislation requires the father to pay the mother increased tax 
liability. The report of the federal-provincial-territorial family 
law committee of May 1992 entitled ``The Financial 
Implications of Child Support Guidelines'' noted that while tax 
consequences should be an element of every child support 
determination, there is evidence to suggest that these 
calculations are not routinely made. If the father does not use his 
tax savings to pay the mother's tax liability, the consequences 
are very serious.
<P>
	Let us use another example. A support order has determined 
that the father's fair share of the children's expense is $10,000 
for the year. Under family law principles, this determination is 
based on both parents sharing the cost of raising the children. 
The mother is also independently contributing to the children's 
support.
<P>
	This $10,000 child support award should be grossed up by 
about $2,600 to reflect the mother's increased federal and 
provincial taxes. The grossed-up award then to the father should 
be $12,600 for the year. The father can pay the extra $2,600 
because he has a tax savings from the deduction. The custodial 
mother needs the extra $2,600 to cover her tax increase from 
having to include the support in her income.
<P>
	Let us consider what will happen if the gross-up is not added 
to the award. The mother still must pay the $2,600 in taxes. She 
will now be left with only $7,400 from the father's support 
payment. There will be a shortfall from the original $10,000 that 
the judge has awarded her. The onus for this shortfall is on the 
custodial mother and this causes hardship for the children. The 
father, on the other hand, still gets the benefit of the full tax 
savings.
<P>
	A further flaw in the deduction-inclusion policy is the use of 
tax bracket differentials to deliver overall tax savings. This 
perspective is examined in great detail in a report entitled 
``Child Support Policy: Income Tax Treatment and Child 
Support Guidelines'' by Ellen Zweibel and Richard Shillington.
<P>
	Zweibel and Shillington note that there is an overall tax 
saving only when the non-custodial father's tax savings on 
support exceed the custodial mother's liability on support. The 
Zweibel and Shillington report found that a tax saving only 
occurs in 51 per cent of the cases and no saving occurs in 49 per 
cent. Furthermore, when a saving was realized, that saving was 
minimal.
<P>
	The study revealed another troubling effect of the 
deduction-inclusion provisions. So far in this discussion we 
have been assuming that the non-custodial parent's tax savings 
will be greater than the custodial parent's tax liability thus 
creating a surplus tax saving. What happens if this is not the 
case?
<P>
	If the mother's increased tax liability is greater than the 
father's tax savings, the system works against the separated 
family. The father can no longer pay the mother's increased tax 
liability from his tax savings.
<P>
	In the Zweibel and Shillington report, 20 per cent of the cases 
fell into this category. Not only did the system fail to produce 
the possibility of a higher award, the system actually worked 
against them to decrease their already scarce resources.
<P>
	The final rationale holds that the savings that occurs through 
the deduction-inclusion gross-up policy is supposed to benefit 
the children by generating further revenues for their support. 
Again reality must step in. Even when the saving is realized, the 
money sits in the hands of the father parent and there is nothing 
to say that he will forward that money to his ex-wife for the 
children.
<P>
	This policy ignores that child support is a very contentious 
issue and that non-custodial fathers seeking to minimize their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2655"> 2655 </A></B>
<P>
payments may not readily agree to  either a gross-up or to a 
further sharing of any tax saving above the gross-up.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	This is not just a tax issue but one of wider social injustice 
which affects the well-being of Canada's children and 
subsequently Canada's future. Article 2 of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of the Child states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The child shall enjoy special protection and shall be given opportunities and 
facilities, by law and other means, to enable him or her to develop physically, 
mentally, morally, spiritually, and socially in a healthy and normal manner and in 
conditions of freedom and dignity. In the enactment of laws for this purpose the 
best interest of the child shall be the paramount consideration.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is our children who now bear the immediate consequences 
because the current system is not providing the effects it was 
intended to produce. If the current policy is not changed it is the 
children who will go on paying the consequences every day, not 
just in some cases and not by accident, but deliberately by our 
failure to redesign an outdated tax mechanism.
<P>
	The causes of child poverty have been linked to family 
breakdown, at least in part, in many areas of the world including 
Canada. Average family incomes for single parent families 
headed by women are significantly lower than those of two 
parent families. When parents separate the cause of maintaining 
two households will mean that at least some members of the 
family will suffer from reduced income.
<P>
	Unfortunately the predominant pattern is that women, who 
are the vast majority of custodial parents, and their children 
experience a marked decrease in standard of living while men 
who no longer live with their families experience an 
improvement in their material circumstances.
<P>
	The Divorce Act sets out to maintain a similar standard of 
living for both parents after separation or divorce. Yet the 
standard of living for custodial parents and their children tends 
to decline as much as 73 per cent, whereas the non-custodial 
parents rises as much as 42 per cent.
<P>
	When a father makes a child support payment he is 
transferring money he has earned toward the care and 
maintenance of his children. There is no difference between a 
parent living with their spouse and providing them with grocery 
money, paying for piano lessons or shoe laces than there is for a 
parent living separate from the their spouse or a parent of their 
children and making the same financial contribution.
<P>
	There is no similar tax exemption for married persons or 
persons living common law whereby one or both of the spouses 
provides financially for the family. If the children were living 
with anyone other than the parent and those caretakers were 
receiving financial support, they would not be obliged to claim 
it as personal income  and be taxed accordingly and that is 
happening in this country all the time.
<P>
	I have demonstrated to the House this evening the failings of 
the Income Tax Act on child support payments. I will run 
through six predominant areas.
<P>
	First, I have demonstrated how Canadian society has changed 
demographically, socially, politically and economically. The 
deduction-inclusion policy on child support payments has been 
in existence since 1942. It is time that it be revisited and 
revamped to fit today's Canada.
<P>
	Second, the taxation principle which holds that where a 
deduction has been claimed there must be an inclusion is false, 
absolutely false.
<P>
	Third, tax subsidies from the deduction-inclusion principle 
only exist in some cases and it is often very minimal. 
Furthermore, there is no provision to ensure that where a savings 
exists that money is forwarded to the children to improve their 
standard of living.
<P>
	Fourth, history has demonstrated that the availability of a tax 
deduction for the non-custodial parent has not proven to be an 
incentive for the support payer to make payments in full and on 
time. I believe that was one of the reasons that they instituted 
that in the first place.
<P>
	Fifth, the standard of living for custodial parents and their 
children tends to decline while the non-custodial parents tends 
to rise. Taxing support payments works contrary to any efforts to 
raise these households out of poverty.
<P>
	Finally, child support payments should be seen for what they 
are, a continuation of the non-custodial parent's obligation to 
the raising of their children.
<P>
	Canada's tax policy taxes child support payments, unlike 
what we see in the United States, Australia, Britain, Sweden and 
in many other countries. While the average child support order 
covers less than half the minimum cost of raising a child, the 
government deems it fair to take up to one-third or more of 
support payments that are meant to feed and cloth children. It is 
time that we as legislators in the House of Commons, in the 
Parliament of Canada stood up and put a stop to this and bring 
justice and fairness into our tax system, particularly as it relates 
to the future of our children.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Thank you, Madam 
Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to speak on this motion 
which I care about on the tax treatment of child support 
payments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2656"> 2656 </A></B>
<P>
	First, I must relate some important facts which justify my 
speaking in this House and which I think are extremely 
significant, on the economic situation of women who are single 
parents.
<P>
	In Canada, 10.7 per cent of all families are headed by a single 
mother. A brief from the Canadian Advisory Council on the 
Status of Women presented to the federal-provincial-territorial 
committee on family law in December 1992 gives us the 
following picture: 82 per cent of one-parent families are headed 
by women; in 1986, 56 per cent of single mothers had an income 
below the poverty line; the percentage of poor children raised in 
single-parent families headed by women more than doubled 
between 1979 and 1988, from 17.9 per cent to 39.1 per cent. That 
is frightening! Seventeen per cent of children are poor; 35.5 per 
cent of them live in single-parent families headed by a woman.
<P>
	I am not telling you anything new when I say that in most 
cases child custody is given to women and their income is less. 
This issue of pay inequity has been and continues to be a subject 
of debate. Clearly, the inequality of women in our society in 
general is felt even more strongly by women who must raise 
their children alone.
<P>
	Studies on child support payments show that they do not cover 
even half of the actual expenses incurred and that usually the 
spouse with custody of the children must make up the 
difference. We cannot close our eyes to such a situation and 
therefore we must turn towards legal mechanisms to ensure the 
viability of families.
<P>
	The United Nations has declared 1994 the International Year 
of the Family. Celebrating the family also means being aware of 
changes in it and ensuring that every member of the family can 
live in dignity if the family is separated or breaks up.
<P>
	Family law has undergone major reforms over the years. This 
is not pure coincidence. The family is evolving, it is changing 
and rules of law must be adjusted to the new reality.
<P>
	The Constitution splits legislative powers in these fields 
between the federal and provincial governments. Divorce and 
corollary measures such as custody and support are regulated by 
the Divorce Act of 1985.
<P>
	From a tax point of view, the Income Tax Act provides that, in 
calculating his income for a taxation year, a taxpayer must 
include any amount received during that year in the form of 
allowance or support payments. Conversely, a taxpayer can 
deduct any amount paid as allowance or support. This is the 
deduction-inclusion rule.
<P>
	Many requirements must be met before the amount can be 
paid or received, and before it can be deductible or taxable. In 
fact, there are six of them.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	The amount must be paid or received as support payment or 
other type of allowance. It must be paid or received in 
compliance with a decision from a court of competent 
jurisdiction, or in compliance with a written agreement. It must 
be paid or received to support the needs of the recipient, of the 
children of the marriage, or both. The alimony or allowance 
must be payable regularly; the spouses or former spouses must 
be separated by virtue of a divorce, legal separation or written 
separation agreement. The spouses must live separately at the 
time the payment is made or received and also the rest of the 
year.
<P>
	As you can see, many requirements have to be met before a 
payment can be made. Once all these conditions are fulfilled, the 
deduction-inclusion rule comes into play. This tax policy is also 
based on four principles which the Minister of Finance 
explained in the report of the federal-provincial-territorial 
committee on family law.
<P>
	It is a tax principle that when a deduction is claimed by a 
taxpayer regarding an expense, the recipient must pay tax on the 
amount. Recipients of alimony payments must be taxed the 
same as other taxpayers receiving the same income from other 
sources. The tax deduction granted to the payer makes the idea 
of providing support more palatable. Finally, this tax treatment 
is a form of subsidy which benefits children, since it is an 
incentive for the payer to provide more support.
<P>
	Let us go back to each of these points. First, let us look at the 
deduction-inclusion rule. One approach points to a variety of 
approaches. For instance, Australia treats support payments as a 
debt or a non-deductible obligation. In the United States, 
however, a distinction is made between child support and 
spousal support. The non-custodial parent pays income tax on 
child support payments but spousal support is deductible.
<P>
	These examples indicate the range of variations in terms of 
tax policy. The deduction-inclusion principle benefits only 
families where the support payer is in a higher tax bracket than 
the recipient. Is tax policy fair when it is based on income 
disparity? Should we not focus our support on low-income 
single parent families?
<P>
	Canadian society has changed tremendously since 1942, when 
the first tax provisions on support payments were introduced. 
The number of tax brackets has been considerably reduced, and 
creditors and debtors may be subject to the same tax rates, 
although one may have a higher income than the other. Finally, 
if the non-custodial parent has a lower tax rate that the custodial 
parent, the total amount of taxes paid will be higher.
<P>
	The tax deduction granted the support payer, which was 
thought to be an incentive for people to pay support payments, 
did not have that effect. Support mechanisms had to be put into 
place when women experienced problems collecting these pay-
<P>

<B><A NAME="2657"> 2657 </A></B>
<P>
ments. In 1974, the Law  Reform Commission estimated that in 
as many as 75 per cent of all cases, people defaulted on their 
payments.
<P>
	It is obvious that single parent women-and I am aware my 
time is running out-are particularly vulnerable economically, 
and we can turn this situation around to some extent by 
providing for a tax scheme that would meet their needs.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	The government could give this question serious thought and 
do so quickly. It should revise concepts that are very damaging 
to the economic security of women who are single parents.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is therefore in favour of amending the 
Income Tax Act so that child support payments are no longer 
considered taxable income for their recipients.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
motion we are debating today, that in the opinion of the House 
the government should amend the Income Tax Act so that child 
support payments are no longer considered taxable income for 
the recipients, serves one major and very useful purpose. It 
draws attention to one of the major problems of single parents, 
mainly women, and the high cost of raising children.
<P>
	This issue should be discussed in the House and all its related 
problems and solutions pointed out. This I will do further on in 
my speech.
<P>
	This motion implies that somehow the current income tax 
laws on alimony and maintenance payments are unfair, 
contribute to the problem and therefore should be amended. On 
this point I disagree as do the majority of my colleagues in the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	The logic is that since the money is paid to a parent in support 
of raising children, by taxing this income governments are 
taxing our children.
<P>
	This particular logic is fundamentally flawed and the 
alternatives suggested by this motion may result in children 
being even worse off.
<P>
	Under the current Income Tax Act, section 60(b) and (c), the 
supporting parent is permitted to receive a tax deduction for 
alimony and maintenance payments while the receiving parent 
is required, under section 56(1)(b) and (c), to include the receipt 
of such payments as income if the amount was received under an 
order or decree made by a competent tribunal in accordance with 
the laws of a province.
<P>
	Therefore we are assured that tax is being paid by one parent 
and the income is not double taxed.
<P>
	In addition, the receiving parent is given a child tax credit 
similar to any other parent raising children.
<P>
	Therefore the alternative in this motion, which suggests a 
complete overhaul of sections 60 and 56 of the Income Tax Act, 
may result in less moneys going to the recipient.
<P>
	Revenue Canada argues that it gives tax breaks to parents who 
make support payments to compensate them for the loss of 
dependent deductions lost after a divorce.
<P>
	In other words, the support recipient now receives the child 
tax credit and the personal tax exemption which was being 
deducted by the supporting parent.
<P>
	This confirms an important accounting principle that is the 
very basis of the Income Tax Act that where a taxpayer claims a 
deduction in respect of an expense, the recipient should pay the 
tax on it.
<P>
	Herein lies the major problem to the motion before us today. 
Who will pay the tax on the child support payment if it is no 
longer considered taxable income for the recipient?
<P>
	As alluded to before, it is logical to argue that if it were 
non-taxable for the recipient then Revenue Canada would make 
it non-taxable for the parent making the payment.
<P>
	Then my question would be would this result in lower 
maintenance payments by the supporting parent?
<P>
	Would this motion, if adopted, generate less revenue to the 
recipient than the status quo?
<P>
	The rationale for the current system is simple and sensible. 
First, the spouse who claims the child tax deduction should also 
be the one responsible for claiming the income associated with 
raising the child.
<P>
	Second, if this money were not to be taxed at all it would 
create a situation in which separated families are given 
preferential treatment under the Income Tax Act to that granted 
to complete families, especially if the receiving spouse is also 
allowed the child tax credit.
<P>
	Third, the tax deduction makes the payment of child support 
more attractive and enticing for the supporting parent to make 
despite the statistics mentioned by the former member of the 
Bloc Quebecois. This is a major concession on the part of 
Revenue Canada because there are no limits to the amount. All 
that is needed is an agreement.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	Fourth, the current arrangement can have an income splitting 
effect whereby between the two parties less tax is paid overall 
and more money is available for the child.
<P>
	Fifth, good, bad or indifferent, whatever the point of view, the 
current system maximizes the support payment for 
maintenance.
<P>
	Having stated why the current system is probably as good as 
can be expected, I would like to address some of the problems 
that the motion tries to correct.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2658"> 2658 </A></B>
<P>
	First, the real problem is that support recipients spend the 
money without paying taxes.
<P>
	Second, as of March 1, 1992 approximately 75 per cent of 
non-custodial divorced parents who had been ordered to make 
child support payments were in arrears.
<P>
	Third, this forces support recipients to turn to social 
assistance, costing taxpayers money that otherwise should have 
been paid by the non-custodial parent.
<P>
	Fourth, insufficient funds either to pay the taxes or care for 
the child creates stress and extra concern for the custodial 
parent.
<P>
	Fifth, in many instances supporting spouses leave the 
province in order to avoid paying child support. Since it is a 
provincial responsibility to administer the child support and 
alimony system authorities are virtually helpless. The result is 
an increase in welfare costs to the provinces.
<P>
	What are some of the solutions? We argue against the motion 
but what can we contribute in the House to help solve this very 
important problem?
<P>
	We could leave the current system in place and encourage the 
courts to recognize better the financial needs of the recipients 
and the high cost of raising children. We could change the 
federal-provincial laws to allow interprovincial tracking of 
non-payers. We could initiate a campaign of shame on those 
parents who wilfully avoid payments to support their children 
and reminders to support recipients to remit some taxes 
periodically throughout the year to reduce the lump sum 
requirement at tax time. We could lower the tax rate for 
everyone by lowering government spending. That could be a 
tough sell in the House.
<P>
	Unless there is an agreement between the two parents the 
non-custodial parent does not get the maintenance deduction. 
Therefore both parties when in divorce court should be made 
aware of the tax consequences before final agreement is 
reached. The support recipient should seek more equity through 
the support system itself and not through the tax system.
<P>
	In the 1992 federal budget a new child tax benefit was created. 
It was designed to aid in the fight against child poverty by 
targeting federal moneys to those families in financial need. The 
motion helps point out a problem in society but the Income Tax 
Act did not cause the problem. It was caused by human error on 
the part of parents for whatever reason. The solution lies in 
public awareness and education for divorcing couples so that 
they do not make deals at the kitchen table or, if they make deals 
at the kitchen table, they are cognizant of the impact of their 
decisions.
<P>
	The reality is taxable support payments are better than no 
support payments. Income tax is far too complicated and too 
intrusive when involved in dictating through tax preferences our 
social behaviour. Our entire taxation system should be 
reviewed, reformed and simplified.
<P>
	In conclusion, a flat tax for Canada would help solve our 
social program funding with higher personal exemptions, 
improve the tax system through simplification, and, for 
members across the way, create more jobs because taxpayers 
would have more disposable income.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak today on 
this important motion. I would like to take the opportunity to 
congratulate the hon. member for Nepean for bringing forward 
this issue to the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	The motion before us addresses the changing social and 
economic nature of Canadian society, namely the increasing 
number of single parent families and the difficulty these parents 
face in providing for their children. I support the motion because 
I believe that by addressing the issue of child support payments 
we are also addressing the broader fundamental problem of 
child poverty.
<P>
	Our government has made a commitment to invest in people 
and to create opportunities for all Canadians. All our economic 
and social policies have aimed to achieve this objective. I 
believe the motion before us is consistent with that goal. It gives 
us the opportunity to ensure that children of lone parent families 
are provided with the resources necessary to live successful and 
productive lives.
<P>
	The level of child poverty in Canada is unacceptably high. 
Recent statistics show us that 1.2 million children in our country 
are living in poverty. Canada's poor children live extremely 
disadvantaged lives. These children often live in poor housing 
conditions. They have a greater likelihood of experiencing 
unemployment in their families and have far less access to 
quality child care.
<P>
	Further, according to Campaign 2000 of the Child Poverty 
Organization with which I met this morning, poor children can 
expect to have a shorter life span, suffer from illness, require an 
increasing amount of emergency food assistance and are more 
likely to drop out of school.
<P>
	The rate of child poverty in single parent families in 1991 was 
about 61 per cent. In other words, three of every five children 
living in a single parent family lived in poverty. On average poor 
single parent families need an extra $9,000 a year just to reach 
the poverty line. These figures are particularly true for female 
custodial parents. After divorce, custodial mothers experience a 
dramatic increase in the economic burdens and income earning 
limitations linked to child rearing responsibilities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2659"> 2659 </A></B>
<P>
	Close to about 60 per cent of all female lone parents live in 
poverty. Although this group represents only 3 per cent of all 
Canadian households they bear 17 per cent of Canada's total 
poverty burden. This problem must be addressed by all members 
of the House.
<P>
	In my riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants there are 
approximately 2,300 female lone parent households. I have had 
the opportunity to speak with many of these parents. They have 
raised many of the same arguments placed before the House 
today. It has become increasingly difficult over time for single 
parents to provide adequately for their children. For custodial 
parents, a single portion of the support payment is lost to taxes. 
As a result support payments often do not meet the needs of 
children the payments are intended to assist.
<P>
	In light of these statistics we must ensure that children of lone 
parent families do not suffer the consequences of inadequate 
levels of child support. Unless we address the problem the same 
children will continue to suffer the consequences of a system 
that is not providing the effects it was designed to produce.
<P>
	When the inclusion-exclusion tax policy was developed in 
1942 its purpose was to ensure that as much money as possible 
was going to children of single parent families. By taxing the 
custodial parent who is generally in a lower tax bracket rather 
than the child support payer, more money was left over in those 
times to meet the needs of the children.
<P>
	However much has changed since 1942. We must ensure that 
our laws reflect these new social and economic realities. There 
are more single parent families now than we had in the past. The 
majority of these single parents are women who after divorce 
suffer a decline in their standard of living.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	Presently there are only three tax brackets as opposed to ten in 
1942 as we heard earlier. There is a greater likelihood therefore 
that both parents earn the same tax bracket. This negates any tax 
savings that would have been generated in the earlier years.
<P>
	Upon divorce, family resources are often inadequate to 
continue to meet the needs of the children or the two households 
that must be maintained. Therefore by taxing already low child 
support payments we are in effect taking money away from the 
families and the children who need it the most.
<P>
	As the motion indicates child support payments should not be 
taxed. Instead these payments should be seen simply as a 
continuation of the obligation of support payers toward their 
children. By adopting the motion we could help ensure that 
single parents and their children are not unfairly targeted by a 
system that is no longer working as it should.
<P>
	In 1989 an all-party resolution was unanimously adopted 
calling for the elimination of child poverty by the year 2000. 
While many faces in the House may have changed since then we 
must continue to support this commitment. I believe the motion 
offers all members of the House an opportunity to renew our 
fight against child poverty.
<P>
	In closing the motion alone will not bring an end to child 
poverty, but I believe that by supporting the proposed change we 
can take concrete steps to ensure more money is being directed 
to those children who need it the most.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Madam Speaker, I will be 
brief and to the point. First of all, I would like to congratulate 
the hon. member for Nepean for her marvellous initiative. This 
issue has been talked about for a number of years by heads of 
single parent families but today, finally, a motion is introduced 
in this House. I hope it will lead to a rapid solution to this 
problem.
<P>
	I was already familiar with this issue, but the hon. member for 
Nepean brought us facts and findings which have made me even 
more aware of the perverse impact of the taxation of alimony 
payments for the custodial parent.
<P>
	I believe that the materials she quoted and the facts she 
presented, which clearly demonstrated that indeed children in 
the present situation have less than they had previously, will 
convince our colleagues in the Reform Party to revise their 
position and adopt a frame of mind more in tune with the 1990s 
and shortly the year 2000.
<P>
	I will conclude by congratulating again the hon. member for 
Nepean and hoping that this House will strongly endorse the 
motion and that the government will act upon it without delay.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain):</B> Madam Speaker, 
for many Canadians the taxation of child support payments 
remains the great divide between their responsibilities as 
caregivers and their capacity to meet these obligations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As members of the House of Commons, we will have to face 
this inequality and to bring in fairness.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Current tax laws state that child support payments paid by the 
non-custodial parent are considered as tax deductible, while the 
payments received by the custodial parent are lumped into his or 
her taxable income. On the face of it this law runs against the 
grain of decades of Liberal policies designed to support families 
and children.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2660"> 2660 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me offer the House some of the history that fosters the 
current state of injustice. Present tax laws concerning child 
support payments were enacted in the 1940s. Society and 
government have been radically altered since then, but tax laws 
have not been altered. There is no question that the time has 
come to bring these laws up to speed with the modern era. We as 
a government must take action to modify these laws not only to 
bring about greater fairness but to reflect the needs of custodial 
parents today and in the coming years.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	It is no exaggeration to say that the unfairness of the federal 
income tax system is driving custodial parents into bankruptcy 
and depriving their children of thousands of dollars in support 
payments.
<P>
	The Income Tax Act actively discriminates against custodial 
parents by forcing them to pay tax on the support they receive 
from estranged spouses.
<P>
	Across Canada there are almost one million single custodial 
parents. Of this number more than 750,000 are women. This 
issue like too many others involves the continuing suffering of 
disadvantaged women and children. We cannot remain unmoved 
by the adversity imposed on these Canadians by our tax regime.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Income Tax Act much be changed to reflect the needs of 
women heading single parent families in this country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Nations the world over have decided to make absent parents 
more responsible for their children. Foreign governments have 
taken the initiative to change their child support tax laws so that 
the parent who has left the home has a greater financial 
responsibility to the custodial parent and child.
<P>
	When we look at our neighbours to the south we do not see the 
inequities encountered in Canada. In fact, the taxation laws 
concerning child support payments in the United States are the 
reverse of our own.
<P>
	In the United States child support payments are deemed to be 
non-taxable income for both the payers and the recipients. If I 
may say so, this seems to be a more logical and equitable way to 
handle the issue.
<P>
	In Britain the child support tax laws have only recently been 
changed and the government intervention has only recently 
moved to lessen the plight of single mothers. Nearly all absent 
parents have been tracked down in England and forced to pay an 
amount derived from an originally applied formula. This 
formula makes child support a top financial priority, placing 
great emphasis on the parent's income and the cost of raising the 
children while sanctioning few excuses for delinquency.
<P>
	The British system emulates that of the United States by not 
taxing child support payments. Britain's approach to this issue 
has emerged as one the world's toughest. This government must 
join the worldwide march toward tougher child support laws and 
take immediate action.
<P>
	In 1991 Statistics Canada revealed that there had been a 34 per 
cent increase in lone parent families in the previous ten years. 
By comparison, the number of two parent families with children 
rose by just 6 per cent over the same period. The end result is 
that lone parents accounted for 20 per cent of all families in the 
year 1991, up from 17 per cent in 1981.
<P>
	One child in five resides in a single parent household. 
Moreover, these statistics clearly show that children are hit the 
hardest by the obsolescence of tax laws concerning child 
support.
<P>
	The facts are plain and simple. Female lone parents remain 
consistently less likely than other parents to be employed and 
there have been sharp drops in employment levels of lone parent 
women during the recessions in the early 1980s and the 1990s.
<P>
	Lone parent families have lower incomes than two parent 
families. In 1990 the average income of female headed lone 
parent families at $22,000 was just 38 per cent of the $57,000 
earned by dual parent families with children.
<P>
	These numbers demand action by this government. When we 
are struck by the appalling state of the current child tax laws we 
must ask ourselves why this issue has not been dealt with before.
<P>
	It is clear that the current tax laws have created inequities 
between the payers and the recipients of child support. The tax 
treatment of child support payments makes a very complicated 
issue out of one that should be as straightforward and simple as 
possible. No other country treats the taxation of child support 
the way Canada does.
<P>
	We know who the victims of the current state of child support 
tax laws are. It is a statistically proven fact that single women 
and their children are being financially devastated and socially 
marginalized.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	They are the ones who bear the economic consequences of 
divorce and separation. If the current policy is not changed it is 
the children of single parent families who will go on paying, not 
just in some cases and not just by misfortune, but by our 
deliberate failure to recognize the problems with our existing 
tax laws.
<P>
	Modernizing our primitive treatment of child support 
payments is an issue that must be remedied through the tax 
system. Better child support guidelines and enforcement 
mechanisms are essential and must be addressed within the 
justice system.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2661"> 2661 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must acknowledge the problems of current legislation and 
pass the measures necessary to improve the situation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me now introduce some of the proposed improvements to 
the current tax law. We should remember that the combined 
impact of income tax and child support policies must be 
measured by its impact on the standard of living of the affected 
family.
<P>
	There are a number of changes that could be affected through 
federal legislation and policy measures. The avenues this 
government needs to explore are several. The Income Tax Act 
could develop child support guidelines that reflect the cost of 
raising children and that are compatible with revamped tax 
treatments of child support payments.
<P>
	This act would support the efforts of lone parent families in 
Canada, specifically the single mother. We could follow the lead 
of the American tax system and not include child support 
payments in the calculation of our taxable income. This would 
treat child support costs in the same manner for tax purposes for 
custodial and non-custodial parents. This would also result in 
equal treatment of child support costs in families in which 
parents live together and in those in which parents are separated 
or divorced.
<P>
	As insurmountable as these problems may appear, we must 
attempt to reform the existing tax on child support payments 
which, quite frankly, is the government's punishment to those 
women who, for whatever, reason have separated from their 
spouses.
<P>
	The current law is extremely limited as a means of 
distributing tax relief for the benefit of children and in most 
cases it is detrimental. Women and children are its victims. I 
hope all members will join the women and men in this House 
who hope to right this injustice.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> We have about a minute 
left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I too am delighted to rise in support of the motion of my Liberal 
colleague, the member for Nepean.
<P>
	The motion states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should amend the Income 
Tax Act so that child support payments are no longer considered taxable income 
for their recipients.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We heard a lot of presentations earlier and I agree that the 
motion raises the issue of fairness. Is it fair to tax support 
payments earmarked for children? In that question is inherent as 
well the question are we committed to the children of our 
country, the children who are the future resource that will help 
build our nation even stronger, the children who cannot vote but 
nevertheless who need our help? We have a duty and an 
obligation to support them.
<P>
	As well, this motion is a commitment to single parents and our 
commitment to eliminate poverty in this nation as this House did 
on November 24, 1989, unanimously adopted. In conclusion, I 
would like to state that we have an obligation to our nation's 
children, to support them and make child support payments no 
longer taxable in the hands of the recipients.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The time provided for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the list of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADALABOURCODE">CANADA LABOUR CODE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I understand that you are giving me the floor regarding 
a question I asked the Deputy Prime Minister, on February 18, 
about the POWA Program.
<P>
	I will remind the House that, on February 18, I asked the 
Deputy Prime Minister what her intentions were regarding the 
support program for workers affected by collective lay-offs. 
The POWA Program is a joint federal-provincial program 70 per 
cent of the cost of which is covered by Ottawa and the remaining 
30 per cent is paid by the provinces. At that time, the Deputy 
Prime Minister was, unknowingly I believe, in the wrong when 
she said that this program was in some way connected with the 
Canada Labour Code, which is totally false, of course.
<P>
	I rise today to point out that the POWA Program, which 
replaces the Workers Assistance Program created in 1988, 
discriminates against workers in the Montreal area. Everybody 
knows that, under the terms of this program, for workers to be 
eligible for benefits, which are half-way between 
unemployment insurance and social assistance, there must be a 
certain number of workers laid off. In the Montreal area, with a 
workforce of over 500 000 people, the administrative agreement 
says that at least 100 workers must be laid off for them to be 
eligible for benefits.
<P>
	However, with its clothing and textile sectors, the industrial 
fabric of Montreal is such that most businesses that would apply 
for the POWA Program have a workforce of between 20 and 30 
people. It is so true, so disturbing and alarming, that 83 per cent 
of all applications made by Montreal companies under the 
POWA program, the Program for Older Worker Adjustment 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2662"> 2662 </A></B>
<P>
which is, let me remind you, a joint federal-provincial program, 
have been rejected.
<P>
	This goes to show, Madam Speaker, that this is a very 
discriminatory program. I would like to remind the House that 
the members for Saint-Léonard and Saint-Henri-Westmount 
have tabled petitions on that subject. They decided to represent 
the workers so that the government, Tory in those days, would 
remedy the situation.

	There is an enormous consensus in Montreal. The mayor, 
unions, employers, and naturally workers, all pray that a 
much-wanted and almost urgent modification be implemented 
very soon. At the end of my speech, the minister suggested I 
table a private member's bill. You all know how much I always 
make it my duty to please the Deputy Prime Minister so I am 
happy to announce that I will indeed be tabling a private 
member's bill. As concerns the respect for workers, the 
challenge is now to find out if the government majority will be 
consistent, will stand by the Bloc Quebecois, will support that 
bill and make sure it is votable so that we can put an end to that 
unacceptable discrimination as the various sectors of the 
Montreal community have requested.

	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member stated that the program for older 
worker adjustment, known as POWA, discriminates against 
Montreal.
<P>
	I would like to make a very strong case that it is not the case at 
all.
<P>
	The program for older worker adjustment is a program 
designed to help older workers who have been involved in major 
permanent layoffs and who have little chance of finding 
re-employment.
<P>
	Major layoffs are defined according to the size of the 
community. In larger communities such as those of over 500,000 
inhabitants a major layoff would involve at least 100 workers. In 
smaller communities such as those with a population of under 
10,000 a major layoff would involve at least 20 workers.
<P>
	POWA does not discriminate against Montreal compared with 
other cities. The same guidelines are applied across the country.
<P>
	The POWA eligibility criteria were negotiated with the 
government of Quebec and are contained in the Canada/Quebec 
POWA framework agreement. Similar POWA eligibility criteria 
are contained in the other federal-provincial agreements.
<P>
	POWA criteria were developed to take into account the 
economic significance of the layoffs for the local community 
and to reflect the fact that older workers who are laid off in 
smaller communities have fewer re-employment opportunities 
than workers in the larger labour market.
<P>
	Under POWA 441 major layoffs have been designated in the 
province of Quebec. Annuities have been purchased for 3,842 
eligible older workers. The federal  and Quebec governments 
have spent $160 million to purchase these annuities.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 7.03 p.m. the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.03 p.m.)
