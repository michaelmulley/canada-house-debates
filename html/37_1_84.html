			 Laurier Day Act</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed from June 7, 2001 consideration of the
				motion that Bill S-14, an act respecting Sir
				John A. Macdonald Day and Sir Wilfrid Laurier Day, be read the
				second time and referred to a committee. </p>


	<A NAME="Int-50923"></A><a HREF="#Int-50925"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec,
					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak to the bill
					 respecting Sir John A. Macdonald Day and Sir Wilfrid Laurier Day. I find it
					 somewhat curious that a Liberal member tabled this bill in the House, yet their
					 Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is unable to provide his support to the
					 Bloc Quebecois to recognize the importance of the deportation of the
					 Acadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, in the Bloc Quebecois, are not afraid of calling
					 attention to this great historic mistake because we are not afraid of learning
					 from the past. Indeed, there are a host of reasons why it would be
					 inappropriate for us to support the bill tabled before us this morning. The
					 wording alone indicates that one of the reasons to celebrate the birth of
					 Wilfrid Laurier is because of the fact that he was an ardent supporter of
					 national unity. To which national unity does this refer?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us, Canadian unity, and all that has been done in
					 its name, represents the main obstacle to Quebec's development. In Quebec,
					 national unity, in the sense of preserving the current federal system, is not
					 the political objective that transcends all others. Rather, it is more of a
					 problem for Quebecers. For sovereignists like us, the answers are to be found
					 elsewhere.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above our constitutional opinion, however,
					 there are numerous reasons the federal parliament ought not to get involved in
					 historical commemoration. First of all, we must be forearmed against the
					 temptation of having an official and politically oriented history, by not
					 giving the Canadian government the opportunity to use history to political
					 ends. Who would be in charge of the celebrations, if not Canadian Heritage, a
					 department that ensures that everything it lays hands on sends out a message of
					 Canadian unity? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two nations in Canada; there are two national
					 histories. We should also add the aboriginal perspective of history. Each of
					 these versions places the emphasis on different aspects of historical events
					 and figures. For example, one side of the Ottawa River celebrates Victoria Day
					 while the other celebrates Dollard des Ormeaux.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the example of Confederation, which the
					 bill describes as “the major accomplishment of J.A. Macdonald”. Everyone knows
					 that Macdonald would have preferred a legislative union that would have made
					 Canada a unitary state, and that he made sure that Canadian federation would be
					 highly centralized.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact Macdonald championed the federal idea, and not
					 the confederal idea as people wanted to have it believed, in order to attract
					 the maritime provinces and to overcome the strong reservations expressed by
					 Quebec. Moreover, despite promises to the contrary, the British North America
					 Act was never voted on in a referendum. Even if the Quebecers supported
					 Macdonald's party in the November 1867 election, this must not lead us to
					 conclude that they backed his vision of Canada. Bending the truth, the
					 newspaper <i>La Minerve</i>, a propaganda tool—yes, propaganda is nothing
					 new—presented the partners of Confederation as sovereign states delegating part
					 of their rights and powers to a so-called “central” government. What an
					 appealing notion, a partnership between sovereign states. That is what the
					 people of Quebec thought they were embarking on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not everyone was taken in, however. Let us keep in mind
					 that there was the “Parti des rouges”—yes, the party to which Wilfrid Laurier
					 belonged—which opposed confederation. In May 1867, Laurier wrote as follows in
					 his newspaper <i>Le Défricheur</i>:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>We must return completely and
						  directly to the politics of Mr. Papineau, protest with all our might against
						  the new order that has been imposed on us and use whatever influence we have
						  left to demand and obtain a free and separate government.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, after 1867, Wilfrid Laurier ended up playing
					 the game and became a supporter of the Canadian system. He was Prime Minister
					 for 15 consecutive years and continued the work of Macdonald. Yet, is the
					 legacy of these two men unsullied? Talk to those Franco-Manitobans still left.
					 Manitoba might have become the model of a Canada where the two peoples,
					 anglophone and francophone, could live together side by side.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also the hanging of Louis Riel that Prime
					 Minister Macdonald could have prevented, and the elimination of educational
					 rights of the francophones that another Prime Minister, Wilfrid Laurier, did
					 not have the courage to stop. “It is unfortunate that the Prime Minister is a
					 French Canadian”, he said to his friend and former colleague, Henri Bourassa,
					 “because as a French Canadian I do things I would never do were I
					 English”.</p>


	<A NAME="T1105"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1105"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1105)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why in today's Canada 19 francophones out of 20
					 live in Quebec. This was what fate had in store for these two
					 peoples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should the Government of Canada stop at honouring
					 just these two Prime Ministers with a special day? However, the legacy of the
					 greatest Prime Ministers is just as controversial. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take Robert Borden and Mackenzie King, who
					 imposed conscription during the two world wars in the 20th century. There is
					 Louis Saint-Laurent, who oversaw the construction of the St. Lawrence seaway,
					 the first of a series of federal decisions that drained Montreal's prosperity
					 away toward Ontario. I refer to the auto pact and the Borden line, which put
					 Ontario at the heart of Canada's automobile and petrochemical
					 industries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we think about it, it is a good idea to recall
					 history. It reminds us more clearly why there is a sovereignist opposition in
					 Ottawa.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, we would have a lot of other great
					 individuals to commemorate. They include Samuel de Champlain, Garagonthié,
					 Marie Gérin-Lajoie, Henri Bourassa, Norman Bethune, Thérèse Casgrain, Gaston
					 Miron and many others. There would not be enough dates on the calendar to
					 celebrate all our great men and women. This is certainly true for the rest of
					 Canada, and we respect that. But it is not our history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons and despite the respect Quebecers
					 feel for past heroes of the Dominion of Canada, the Bloc Quebecois has decided
					 to oppose this bill.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, a few days ago, we witnessed the tragic
					 and horrible events that took place in the United States, and we were all
					 profoundly shocked. It was a painful nightmare for each one of us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not my intention to speak about the terrorists'
					 attacks and their repercussions. However, this recent terrible tragedy brought
					 home to us only too vividly that which we hold most dear: our country, our
					 freedoms, and our values as Canadians, our way of life. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moments of tragedy, the values we cherish shine the
					 brightest, and our desire to preserve those values and see them grow takes on a
					 new urgency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our pride in being Canadians that underlies the
					 bill before us today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-14 pays tribute to two of our great prime
					 ministers: Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier. This bill will enable
					 us to remain proud of our past and mindful of our heritage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some will perhaps wonder what we have to gain by
					 setting aside the birthdays of these two men as special days. The answer is a
					 simple one.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is one thing that we have learned from the
					 tragic events of recent days, it is that as Canadians we cannot and must not
					 take for granted everything that we have.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we pass Bill S-14, we will send a message to all, to
					 current and future generations of Canadians, that we keep in our collective
					 mind the memory of Canada's first Prime Minister and first French speaking
					 Prime Minister. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will thus show our commitment to celebrate their
					 contributions to Canada, as well as the values and principles on which these
					 contributions are based. We will also show that we are not prepared to take our
					 heritage for granted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a world that is increasingly based on global trade,
					 technology and communications, we are constantly at risk of losing sight of our
					 Canadian identity. And this risk will be even greater as we face the challenges
					 of the 21st century. In trying to meet these challenges, we can build on the
					 examples of Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who were men of
					 great value.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At times we may think that our problems are
					 insurmountable and we may also be tempted to lose faith in our ability as a
					 nation to overcome the obstacles before us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we could certainly put things in perspective by
					 pointing out the innumerable difficulties faced by John A. Macdonald, Wilfrid
					 Laurier and the other Fathers of Confederation when they were trying to turn a
					 beautiful dream into reality, that is to build a country, to build Canada.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important to remember some of the other
					 great achievements of John A. Macdonald, this great Canadian, including the
					 building of Canada's first national railway, the Intercolonial Railway.This
					 monumental project helped build the infrastructure required to settle the
					 western Canada, develop our economy and strengthen our national
					 identity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Wilfrid Laurier's contributions were different, but
					 just as important. His immigration policy helped create and define our current
					 society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A staunch protector of national unity, he believed that
					 both founding cultures could not only coexist, but also forge together a
					 stronger and more prosperous nation, a nation that would serve as a model to
					 the whole world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier had long
					 term vision and their leadership helped Canada grow, evolve and
					 prosper.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 134 years, we have been put to the test
					 many times. We have experienced wars and the great depression, and we have
					 witnessed major social and technological changes. In fact, we are being put to
					 the test now. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most potent forces that equips us to meet
					 the challenges of our time is the memory of what those who came before us have
					 contributed and accomplished. That is what lies behind this bill's
					 creation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I join with other hon. members in congratulating the
					 hon. colleague who introduced this bill. It was a most laudable initiative on
					 his part. In addition, he has given us an opportunity to perpetuate in memory
					 the accomplishments of these two great Canadians. We must seize that
					 opportunity. Let us not miss out on it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our role as parliamentarians has a number of different
					 dimensions. We pay attention to the interests of those whom we represent, and
					 we do our utmost to represent them well. We take part in this fundamental
					 activity of legislating, of fine tuning as it were, the rules that govern our
					 society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our responsibility as parliamentarians includes another
					 dimension as well. We set an example for other Canadians each time we rise to
					 speak in this House, each time that we vote, each time we take a position on
					 matters of importance that influence the daily lives of each and every
					 Canadian.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we have the opportunity to speak out on an
					 important issue. By voting in support of Bill S-14 , we will be reminding
					 Canadians of part of their heritage and of the strength we can derive from it
					 as we trace our path through this new century and this new millennium we are
					 just entering.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore invite all hon. members to reflect
					 seriously on the substance of this bill and to give it their support, for it
					 means not only paying tribute to two great man—Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir
					 Wilfrid Laurier—a noble goal in itself, but also forging more solid ties
					 between our past and our future.</p>

					 Fuca, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Canadian Alliance it is
					 an honour for me to speak to this issue about two great Canadians, a French
					 Canadian and an English Canadian. What better time than right now to talk about
					 this in the difficult times we are all faced with today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two men, Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid
					 Laurier, were unifiers and builders. They were individuals who saw Canada as a
					 whole, Canada as a nation, Canada as one nation indivisible, a country for all
					 people, embracing the diversity we have; they were individuals who embraced
					 this diversity not as a weakness but as a strength. That is what Sir John A.
					 Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier would have done then and that is what they
					 would have said today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two gentlemen would be rolling over in their
					 graves if they could see what has happened to the unification of our country,
					 if they could see how our federal-provincial relations have been weakened, if
					 they could see how the threads, actually steel, that bind us together have been
					 chopped up and put down in order to support smaller and more parochial
					 interests. These men would not tolerate this. They would say how, in this big
					 country, do we embrace what is strong in our country and how do we actually try
					 to improve and build bridges among all Canadians?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would abhor the fact that in our country language
					 has been used as a political tool rather than as a unifier. Language, an agent
					 of communication and unification, has been used as a political tool to turn one
					 Canadian against another. What a tragedy it is in a country like ours that is
					 fortunate enough to embrace two great languages, English and French, that these
					 languages have been used as a political tool to turn Canadian against Canadian.
					 Both these gentlemen would find this utterly abhorrent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would also find it sad to see that
					 federal-provincial relations have come to a stage when provinces are looking to
					 the federal government as to what they can take and individual responsibilities
					 have been blurred and marred so that Canadians are not getting the best bang
					 for their buck, so that political institutions cannot work as effectively as
					 they should.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Macdonald and Laurier would want to do, perhaps,
					 is ensure that the federal and provincial governments each do what they are
					 able to do best, that responsibilities are well delineated and that we are able
					 to ensure that Canadians are able to get the services they need when they need
					 them in the most effective way possible and that national standards are adhered
					 to. A Canadian who lives in British Columbia or a Canadian who lives in Quebec
					 or one who lives in Newfoundland should be able to receive pretty much the same
					 types of services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, with the balkanization of critical
					 services in health care and education we do not see that any more. We see
					 dramatic differences across the country. Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid
					 Laurier would both want to change that. They would both want to find ways to
					 get some equivalency across Canada today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would also see in the country we have today that
					 sometimes we focus on what Michael Ignatieff calls “the narcissism of the minor
					 differences”, where we tend to focus on the small things that divide us rather
					 than the great things that unify us. If the tragedy of September 11 has told us
					 one thing it is that we as a country are one nation regardless of where we
					 live, and that the problems we have within our own borders pale in comparison
					 to the international challenges we have. September 11 has shown us that we live
					 in a global environment with global challenges, where our economy is intimately
					 entwined with the economies of countries around the world, where our individual
					 security is intimately entwined with the security of our neighbours and our
					 allies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes it even more important that as a country we
					 broaden our horizons to see that we have to participate in the global economy
					 perhaps better than we have. Canada has to look to ways to improve our economic
					 competitiveness, not by looking within our own borders but by saying that we
					 will compete internationally. We need to break down the barriers to trade that
					 exist within our country and abroad. We need to lower our tax structure to make
					 us more competitive. We need to improve our education system because we know
					 that a child being educated in Canada today, perhaps in Ottawa, is competing
					 not only with the child in Toronto but with children who live in Tokyo,
					 Beijing, Delhi and Cape Town.</p>


	<A NAME="T1120"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1120)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As individuals here, we are competing on a global
					 playing field. The tragedy of September 11 also indicated that our individual
					 security was entwined with our allies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, over the last eight years our defence
					 forces have been gutted. Our ground and troop component is less than 55,000
					 people, when it was 90,000. From a navy perspective, we only have one frigate
					 that is functional.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, from the army perspective the minimum
					 requirement for an international endeavour, such as what we will be asked, is a
					 brigade. A brigade is made up of 5,000 men and women. We have not functioned
					 with 5,000 personnel in over nine years. How are we expected to function?
					 Furthermore, our defence department said that for us to transfer 5,000 people
					 it would take more than three months, and we could not sustain that number for
					 more than six months in the field.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our airlift capabilities are almost non-existent. As a
					 colonel in the military recently said, it is “a near catastrophe”. Therefore,
					 we cannot transport them without our voting to rent planes from our
					 allies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our CF-18 fighters, one of the most potent weapons we
					 have, is in dire straits right now because we have less than 24 of our 120 that
					 could put into the field. There are questions about whether or not those
					 fighters could actually integrate with the Americans fighters because some of
					 the systems on board are obsolete. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have superb men and women in our military, men and
					 women who are willing to work hard to ensure that our security will be
					 protected. Yet they have not been given the tools to do the job. They will
					 again be asked to go perhaps to a foreign land to lay their lives down to
					 protect our citizens as well as the citizens of our allies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war on terrorism will be an international war to
					 root out those individuals who would rather blow up the negotiating table than
					 sit at it. Unfortunately, negotiations for those individuals are over.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier would
					 have ensured that our military had the tools to do the job and that we would be
					 able to meet our commitments, commitments our country made in 1994. Our white
					 paper in 1994 made a whole series of commitments, almost none of which we can
					 meet at this point in time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, it took a catastrophe to draw our focus
					 toward this, but I am hopeful. We will offer the government constructive
					 suggestions to improve the security of our country, both domestically and
					 internationally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, the bill is a good bill. These two
					 gentlemen, our former prime ministers, French and English, are true Canadian
					 heroes. We do not do enough to uphold these individuals who were outstanding
					 individuals and Canadians, individuals who tried to build our
					 country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As legislators today, as we sit here with this great
					 responsibility, we can look back to the past and learn a number of things that
					 will allow us to do our jobs better and more effectively for all
					 Canadians.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure on behalf of
					 the most recent coalition in the House of Commons to pay tribute to two
					 distinguished Canadians whose career constituted the establishment of
					 coalitions in the House and in the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-14 is an act respecting Sir John A. Macdonald
					 day and Sir Wilfrid Laurier day. The bill, introduced by the leader of the
					 opposition in the other place, Senator John Lynch-Staunton, so far has received
					 in both Houses unqualified support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time when Canadians are thinking so seriously
					 about our future, our future as a comprehensive, cohesive and identifiable
					 national community in a world transformed by technology and our future as
					 individuals in a world where terrorists kill people simply for going to work,
					 it is useful for us to reflect on our past and on the extraordinary individuals
					 who faced down risk, faced down fear and faced down disappointment to define a
					 Canadian nation and identity. </p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me speak for a few moments about the origins of
					 this bill and what it seeks to do and what it does not do. It blends into one
					 two private members bills which died on the order paper with the call of the
					 last general election—one bill celebrating the birthday of Macdonald, the other
					 celebrating the birthday of Laurier. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill does not ask for the declaration of a national
					 holiday. This is not about a day off. The bill celebrates work. It calls on us
					 to remember two men whose extraordinarily hard work on behalf of Canada shaped
					 and sustained this nation.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By happenstance, the celebration of their lives and
					 their contributions to Canada will occur at opposite ends of the year: in
					 February for Sir John; in November for Sir Wilfrid. This will given Canadians,
					 especially those in our school history classes, at least two occasions to
					 reflect on the building of this great country and on those who contributed so
					 much.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who has had the honour of serving as prime
					 minister knows that the two standards against whom everyone else will always be
					 judged were Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier. They embodied the
					 young country as well as leading it. Each in his way symbolized how essential
					 it is in a large and diverse society to reach out to others, to embrace them
					 and to respect the differences which make them distinct. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Desmond Morton, then director of the McGill
					 Institute for the Study of Canada, testified in the other place. He
					 stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>They were political opponents with
						  all the differences that our adversarial system creates. Canada made them
						  surprisingly similar, too, when faced with the responsibilities of power
						  because the realities of this country do not change very easily even when
						  governments change...along with their steadfast vision of Canada and its
						  potential came a skill in compromise that history has shown to be indispensable
						  for any common future</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two men were able to lead and lead successfully
					 during challenging times. It was for Macdonald to link and draw the country
					 together and it was for Laurier to hold it together, linguistically and
					 culturally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the passage of the bill, we will give Canadians
					 an opportunity to reflect on how this country came to be, the values it
					 reflects and on how individuals citizens can shape and fashion the values and
					 the nature of this country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We Canadians do not spend enough time celebrating our
					 origins. Not enough Canadian history is taught in our schools. We do not know
					 enough of our past. The designation of these days will give all Canadians an
					 opportunity to pause and consider our beginnings as a country and the
					 difficulties faced in the early days of keeping it together. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Professor Morton has said, the careers of Macdonald
					 and Laurier overlapped. They engaged with each other. They were practical
					 politicians, both with overarching commitments to Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their time together is perhaps best symbolized by Sir
					 Wilfrid's comments made in the House of Commons on June 8, 1891. In the death
					 of Sir John A. Macdonald he stated:</p>

						  truth, his loss overwhelms me, and that it also overwhelms this parliament, as
						  if indeed one of the institutions of the land had given way.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurier himself had his own indelible contribution to

					 posed by World War I.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is in his commitment to a united Canada
					 that we remember him best, as he stated at the Club National in
					 Montreal:</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege for me to join in
					 support of this debate. It is particularly a privilege for me to follow the
					 last speaker. I greatly appreciated his eloquence and his particular place in
					 the evolution of this wonderful country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognizing and celebrating a nation's outstanding
					 persons, places and events are integral to the foundation of the land's
					 historical memory and for contributing to the sense of identity of its peoples.
					 Yet commemoration does not deal solely with the past. Who and what we choose to
					 commemorate as a country speaks volumes, not only about who we have been, but
					 also about who we are as a people and who we aspire to be in the future. Only
					 by understanding our history and learning about the lives and accomplishments
					 of the women and men who have built Canada can we fully appreciate what it
					 means to be Canadian.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are here today to review Bill S-14 which seeks to
					 honour two of our greatest prime ministers, Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir
					 Wilfrid Laurier. It would designate the birthdays of these outstanding
					 Canadians as special days, helping to commemorate their remarkable
					 contributions to the building of our nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent of the bill is clear. It represents an act
					 of respect and acknowledgement for these two towering figures of Canadian
					 history, one a Father of Confederation and the first prime minister of Canada,
					 the other, Canada's seventh prime minister and one of our nation's most
					 powerful and articulate advocates of national unity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Canadians know that Sir John A. Macdonald led the
					 effort to make Confederation a reality. They know the fact that he drafted the
					 British North America Act defining the federal system by which the original
					 four provinces were united as one country on July 1, 1867. They know the fact
					 that he became Canada's first prime minister and went on to help forge a strong
					 and vibrant new nation. However, perhaps fewer know that it was he who launched
					 the intercolonial railway which would eventually provide a key physical link
					 for Canada, from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast, linking the vast largely
					 unsettled land in between. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Wilfrid Laurier is recognized by many Canadians as
					 having been an eloquent and staunch promoter of national unity and as the first
					 Canadian of French origin to become prime minister. Fewer Canadians know that
					 he held the longest unbroken term of office as prime minister, from 1896 to
					 1911. This was a period during which his unshakable confidence in Canada
					 fostered unprecedented growth and prosperity for a still young country.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we care about preserving and celebrating the
					 achievements of these great Canadians, we must take the initiative to ensure
					 that their contributions to Canada are recognized.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time to take appropriate measures to honour these
					 exceptional men. Setting aside special days celebrating the achievement of
					 great Canadians is a well established and time honoured tradition in this
					 country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the bill recognizes, both Sir John A. Macdonald and
					 Sir Wilfrid Laurier were forward looking men who saw nation building and unity
					 as the road to Canada's future. Each made profound and lasting contributions to
					 the achievements of a strong and united Canada. The proposed legislation
					 represents one very tangible means of paying tribute to their legacies, and for
					 this reason alone, I believe the bill is worthy of support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that in very difficult times like the
					 ones we are facing, like the House is facing and like the free world is facing,
					 it is particularly important to give some thought to our roots and to our
					 history because that will give us the confidence we need to face the future
					 knowing that Canada was well founded and that she is still a very strong
					 country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a privilege for me to support this

					 (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore, NDP):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure, on behalf of
					 the New Democratic Party, to thank the hon. member for Don Valley West for
					 bringing this very relative bill, which originated in the Senate, before the
					 House of Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that we should set aside a day to
					 honour and support the builders of our country. This bill would put forward the
					 particular enactment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recommend that the member for Don Valley West convey
					 to the finance minister that one of the problems we have in Canada is the
					 history lessons taught in our classrooms. It is very important that the House
					 pass the bill as an enactment for the particular day, but it does absolutely
					 nothing if it does not reach down to our classrooms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a kid growing up and going through the school system
					 in Canada I learned more about American history than I did about Canadian
					 history. I always thought that was a flaw in the process. One of the problems
					 is that the provinces are responsible for the delivery of education.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I will give credit where credit is due. We have
					 an education minister in Nova Scotia by the name of Jane Purves who is pushing
					 that history be made a mandatory subject in our schools. I could not agree with
					 her more. I say this because she is a minister of education in our province who
					 has gone through some very rough times, most of it brought on by herself.
					 However in this circumstance I support her recommendation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What better time than now to teach students about the
					 first prime minister of the country and one of the longest serving prime
					 ministers of our country, two people from different political parties who even
					 today have a very strong influence on the way that the House runs, especially
					 in terms of bilingualism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Wilfrid Laurier was stressing that need being our
					 first prime minister of French origin. It is imperative that the House be able
					 to communicate in both official languages throughout the entire country. That
					 is the vision of those two men and it should be honoured by the particular
					 day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the hon. member for Don Valley West would
					 accept a friendly amendment, not that I am proposing one. However if he nods
					 his head I will let him propose the amendment that we not only make it Sir John
					 A. Macdonald Day and Sir Wilfrid Laurier Day, but also include J. S. Woodsworth
					 who was one of the finest democrats this country has ever seen. Maybe he would
					 like to include that name as part of the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to speak critically in any way of Mr.
					 Macdonald or Mr. Laurier, but at the time they were building the country an
					 awful lot of people were left behind in the vision of the future of Canada.
					 This is where J. S. Woodsworth was effective, along with M. J. Caldwell and the
					 late great Tommy Douglas. These were three democrats who helped build the
					 country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the member for Don Valley West wants to throw in the
					 name of J. S. Woodsworth he would have no argument from the New Democrats in
					 that regard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is imperative that we recognize the contribution
					 these two gentlemen made to Canadian history, but I impress upon the member to
					 advise the finance minister to ensure that the provinces have adequate funding
					 through the transfer programs to put money back into the classrooms so that
					 teachers have the resources by which to teach Canadian history. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would do more than just honour the commitment of
					 these two men. It would ensure the memory of these two men in terms of
					 educating our children, which I believe is imperative. If we do not know our
					 history we cannot know where we are going.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the hon. member on behalf of the New Democratic
					 Party for bringing forward the bill.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak to Bill
					 S-14. The bill would recognize Sir John A. Macdonald, who was born on January
					 11, 1815, and Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who was born on November 20, 1841. They
					 should be recognized; one English, our first prime minister, and one French,
					 our first French prime minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These leaders built far better than they knew. They
					 took a country of regions where there was a natural north-south pole and forged
					 it together into a very strong east-west unity. That was felt impossible at the
					 time. There are many today who still think it is very difficult to do. However
					 they forged together what has been recognized many times as the best country in
					 the world and the best place in which to live.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They built the railways against great financial odds
					 and tremendous geographic natural difficulties. Last spring I had the
					 opportunity to travel by rail through the mountains from Vancouver to Edmonton
					 along with many of my colleagues who were on the Canada-U.S. parliamentary
					 association. My American and Canadian colleagues talked a lot about the history
					 of the railroad. We could see by looking at the rails that were placed through
					 the mountains some hundred years ago the tremendous amount of difficulty that
					 must have been faced by the people to link the country from coast to
					 coast.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As leaders of the country they rose above the financial
					 and geographic obstacles which must have been both challenging and risky. These
					 leaders had a lot of inspiration and dedication to stick with it to get the job
					 done. These two prime ministers were very instrumental in the expansion of the
					 west as a result of the building of the railroad and much more .</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not surprised that the hon. member from the
					 Canadian Alliance who spoke earlier was trying to be a naysayer. We have an
					 opportunity to take a look at our history and build on it. This is not the time
					 to bring in current events.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our failings as Canadians is that we often look
					 at the negative. We are very fortunate to live in Canada. It has been
					 recognized as the best country in the world in which to live, but it is much
					 more than that. We live in a very tolerant multicultural society where we have
					 brought two great languages and many other cultures together to build this
					 great country. We have such a great foundation as a result of these
					 leaders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be using the debate today when talking about
					 Macdonald and Laurier to build on our past and to talk about how wonderful it
					 was. The hon. member for 
					 Sackville--Musquodoboit
						Valley--Eastern Shore talked about there not being enough history
					 taught in our schools. That is absolutely true. There is not enough history
					 taught in our schools. If we do not know our history, we will not know where we
					 come from and we will not know where we should be going. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also comment on the points raised by the Bloc that we
					 were naming two but that the rest of the heroes were not being
					 mentioned.</p>


	<A NAME="T1145"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1145"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1140"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1145)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many heroes in the country. It is important
					 to recognize these two men because they consolidated the inspiration to put the
					 country together, to tie it from coast to coast to coast, and to build on that
					 foundation, giving the opportunity to past leaders and current leaders to build
					 the kind of country that we have today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the Bloc's point of view in terms of the
					 tactics it uses of confusing history because it makes the cause for separatism
					 that much easier. However it is important to name these two leaders because it
					 allows us to build on our history, to recognize the great leaders of our past,
					 and to give high school and university students the opportunity to use these
					 days when they are named to further study these and other leaders from our past
					 and what they did to build the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People often look at the calendar, including myself and
					 I expect others in the House as well, and ask why that day is there. A study
					 was done to determine why the day should be recognized. As a result we have a
					 better knowledge and understanding of our history and of these two leaders in
					 Canada's past.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important for all members of the House to
					 support Bill S-14. As Canadians we have not given enough recognition to the
					 leaders of our past and we have not studied enough of our history. We have not
					 recognized the difficulty of building a nation, the inspiration of these two
					 leaders and the difficulties they experienced in forging the ties to build the
					 kind of country we have today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of Bill S-14 these two days would be
					 catalysts that Canadians could use to study our history, learn more and as a
					 result become better Canadians because of it.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, Prince Albert is somewhat relevant to the
					 debate today as it has been home to three prime ministers: John Diefenbaker,
					 Mackenzie King and Sir Wilfrid Laurier. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I understand correctly, John Diefenbaker was
					 inspired as a young boy to become prime minister upon meeting Sir Wilfrid
					 Laurier on the streets of Saskatoon at which time the prime minister actually
					 took the time to talk to him. In fact, if I am not wrong, Mr. Diefenbaker
					 always considered Sir Wilfrid Laurier to be our best prime minister. I have
					 often wondered why, if that was the case, he chose to pursue the Progressive
					 Conservative path rather than the Liberal path but that is another
					 story.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a great regard for Sir Wilfrid Laurier. He was
					 truly one of the real builders and visionaries in this country's past. Being
					 from Saskatchewan, when he became the prime minister of Canada, he was aware
					 that Saskatchewan and Alberta were largely unsettled. He appointed Clifford
					 Sifton as the minister of the interior and gave him a mandate to settle western
					 Canada based on its economic needs and so on. There was a very active
					 recruitment program in Europe, particularly in eastern Europe, to help bring
					 people through the prairies with its cold, long winters to cultivate and farm
					 the land. He was largely successful. It created a mosaic in western Canada of
					 many different cultures of people from many different ethnic backgrounds.
					 Saskatchewan and Alberta truly had a broad representation of many ethnic groups
					 as opposed to what central Canada was at that time, which was largely remnants
					 of the loyalist elements and our French heritage. It was the beginning of true
					 multiculturalism in the west.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also see Sir Wilfrid Laurier as a great visionary.
					 Sir John A. Macdonald built Canada based on the national plan, which was really
					 a nationalistic type of plan, and a very protectionist concept in many
					 respects. Sir Wilfrid Laurier saw that Canada's future needed to be much larger
					 than that. It needed to be very much tied to North America and our U.S.
					 neighbours to the south. In 1911 he ran an election campaign on something
					 called reciprocity with the United States. He lost that election in 1911. That
					 was probably his most ambitious plan during his time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, we have seen some strange things. In
					 1988, some 80 or so years later, it was a Conservative government that
					 abandoned Macdonald's national policy and moved toward Laurier's vision of
					 Canada, a Canada closely integrated and tied to our American neighbours to the
					 south. An interesting paradox is that it was the party across the way, the
					 party of Laurier, that fiercely opposed the free trade agreement of 1988. I
					 think it would be a fair comment to say that today it now agrees with Laurier's
					 vision some 90 years after the fact.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would reiterate that I see Sir Wilfrid Laurier as a
					 great builder of the foundation and the make-up of the provinces of
					 Saskatchewan and Alberta. I also see him as a great visionary
					 leader.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I at times wish the party opposite could find that type
					 of leadership again, a leader with great vision and commitment who would not be
					 so concerned about just holding his finger up to see which way the wind was
					 blowing. It needs to recommit itself to building and creating a real vision in
					 the country.</p>

					 to the Minister of International Trade, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join the debate on Bill
					 S-14. I congratulate my colleague, the hon. member for Don Valley West, for
					 what I think is a very good idea. There are no more important political leaders
					 in our history than Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we talk about the first English speaking prime
					 minister, I know Sir John would have wanted it pointed out that he was a
					 Scotsman as was his successor, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, the first Liberal prime
					 minister. We could see the ethnic nature of Canada right from the
					 start.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir John was of course the leading Father of
					 Confederation and did a masterful job of cobbling together the kind of
					 compromises that made the country necessary, and that was no mean feat trying
					 to get together peoples of different nationalities and religions, many of whom
					 had bitterly opposed each other on many fundamental points. As the ultimate
					 pragmatist in Canadian history, he was able to lead, along with many other
					 important Fathers of Confederation, and cobble together the compromise that
					 made Confederation a reality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada became a bilingual nation in 1867, not a
					 bicultural nation, as many people have said. That would be to sell short the
					 very culture from which our first prime ministers sprang, the Scottish culture.
					 If were to look at the coat of arms of Canada we would see the cultural symbols
					 of four nations: France, England, Ireland and Scotland. This country began in
					 1867 as a bilingual and multicultural nation. That is not some new fact or new
					 policy that some would have us believe. I have heard opponents of mine in
					 election campaigns castigating the Liberals for being the party that created
					 multiculturalism. This has been a multicultural nation from day one, even more
					 so now as nations from all around the world have come to join the original four
					 European nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Wilfrid Laurier was the first French Canadian prime
					 minister of Canada and one of the best intellects to ever occupy that office.
					 It is very interesting that we have just commemorated the death of former Prime
					 Minister Trudeau who was also one of the most brilliant men to ever be prime
					 minister of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of Wilfrid Laurier's famous phrases was “the sunny
					 ways of compromise”. He would apply that approach to Canadian politics because
					 he understood that we could not have a nation made up of as many diverse
					 peoples as does Canada unless we were willing to have give and take.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flag beside the Speaker's chair is very appropriate
					 because it is a compromise flag. It probably was nobody's first choice or
					 choice of a very few people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Macdonald was the ultimate pragmatist, then surely
					 Laurier was the ultimate compromiser in the best sense of the word. He sought
					 to build bridges and not fences. He employed the sunny ways of compromise. If
					 Macdonald was the original Father of Confederation and master crafter of the
					 nation, which he was, then Laurier oversaw its first major expansion. Laurier
					 oversaw the bringing in of the provinces of the west. He oversaw the so-called
					 people in sheepskin coats, the peoples from eastern Europe, many of whom helped
					 to populate western Canada. Canada also had a major influx of people from the
					 United States at that time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Wilfrid Laurier was a major player in our history
					 and took the country into the 20th century from the 19th century. It is no
					 secret that the current Prime Minister of Canada is very enamored of Sir
					 Wilfrid Laurier. I would think that it would be fair to say that Sir Wilfrid
					 Laurier is probably his political hero.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gave us on this side of the House great pleasure to
					 see our colleague and current Prime Minister take this nation from the 20th
					 century into the 21st century as Sir Wilfrid originally took the nation from
					 the 19th century into the 20th century.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably more than most prime ministers, Sir Wilfrid
					 Laurier understood the importance of minority rights, that democracy is about
					 majority rules but not a tyranny of the majority which ignores the rights of
					 the minority. Canada cannot work on that basis. Whenever we descend to that
					 level we run into national problems, which Macdonald and Laurier both
					 experienced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurier dealt with some very difficult issues in his
					 time such as the Boer War, the first international war in which Canada
					 participated. Although we were not fully independent at the time in world
					 events, it was the first international action in which we participated. Sir
					 Wilfrid oversaw that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of my colleagues have spoken about the
					 importance of Canadian history. As a teacher of Canadian history for some 21
					 years, I could not agree with that more. The ignorance of our own history is
					 absolutely appalling, dangerous and has to be addressed. I and my colleagues
					 who share that view call upon the federal government to do what we can. I know
					 the provinces protect education but we need a national education vision even if
					 it is a jurisdiction jealously guarded by the provinces. As Santayana put it so
					 well, those who do not learn the lessons of history are condemned to repeat
					 them.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The House will

					 says:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">

						  Act and to make related amendments to other acts--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, so good. However here is the problem. The
					 amendment adds:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--since the principle of the bill fails to specifically and

						  terrorist activities.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pages 639 and 640 of Marleau and Montpetit, our
					 procedural manual, deal with reasoned amendments. The manual makes it clear
					 that a reasoned amendment:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--must
						  be relevant and relate strictly to the bill being considered.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must relate not to what is not in the bill but to
					 the bill being considered. A reasoned amendment is not relevant, and I quote
					 directly from M and M:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--if
						  it relates to another bill; is intended to divide the bill; proposes that the
						  bill be withdrawn and replaced by another bill; relates to the parent Act
						  rather than to the amending bill; goes beyond the scope of the
						  bill.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last proposition is important in this case. Marleau
					 and Montpetit goes on to state that:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>It must not relate to particulars of
						  the bill, if what is sought may be accomplished by amendments in
						  committee.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment before us opposes the bill because it
					 asserts that the bill: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--fails to specifically and adequately address national security
						  at Canada's borders with respect to terrorist activities.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is clearly beyond the scope of the bill. If it
					 were an issue for customs it would also be wrong because it would relate to the
					 parent act, as I have just stated. I am glad the hon. member raised that as
					 justification.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wording of the amendment renders it out of order.
					 It asserts that the bill specifically omits the matter, a matter which
					 indicates the amendment is beyond the scope of the bill. The amendment defines
					 itself as being out of order.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, and in contradiction to the first
					 assertion, the amendment claims the bill fails to address the matter
					 adequately. If that were true the amendment would still be out of order on the
					 grounds that the question of adequacy would be dealt with by a specific clause
					 at a later stage, a case which I totally reject. In other words, if it were a
					 matter of adequacy it could be dealt with in committee later and would
					 therefore render the reasoned amendment out of order.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If security is specifically omitted from the bill, as
					 the amendment asserts, an amendment is irrelevant because it is beyond the
					 scope of the bill. If the amendment's second assertion is true, namely that
					 security in the bill is dealt with but not adequately, the amendment is still
					 out of order because it deals with details of the bill that may be corrected
					 later. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a matter of being fish or fowl. It is
					 neither fish nor fowl. On both these grounds I respectfully submit to the Chair
					 that the reasoned amendment is out of order and does not qualify.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of the

					 The debate deals with issues we cannot consider outside the scope of what
					 happened on September 11. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of all the people of Cariboo--Chilcotin I
					 offer our sincere and deep regret at the loss of so many people in the United
					 States. Our ties are so intermingled that it was true when the Prime Minister
					 spoke in terms of friends and family. Many of us have not only friends but
					 family in the United States. Many more of us have friends as a result of
					 commercial relationships that have grown deep and strong. However it is those

					 to whom I offer our deepest regrets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-23 seeks to amend the Customs Act and other acts
					 to allow for the preapproval of people, goods and low risk cross-border
					 travellers. It contains an amendment that points out the inadequacy of the bill
					 to which I am speaking now. I have been assured there has been much
					 consultation with industry stakeholders concerning the contents of the bill. We
					 are told the bill is a result of such consultation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill comes none too soon and perhaps much too late.
					 Bill S-23 focuses on risk management. It would implement automated electronic
					 reporting mechanisms such as Canpass Nexus and EPPS for preapproved, low risk
					 commercial and personal travellers so that greater resources could be applied
					 to so-called higher and unknown risk traffic. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landings under the new programs proposed in Bill S-23
					 would be subject to random stop checks and a regime of monetary sanctions that
					 match the frequency and severity of the infractions. </p>

	Why do we need the bill? There is a consensus among our
					 business community, consumers and tourists that as a free trading nation we
					 must maximize the efficiencies of moving people, products and capital across
					 our border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada and the United States have enjoyed the benefits
					 of sharing the largest and longest peaceful border in the world. We share a
					 border with the largest economy in the world. We need to ensure we take
					 advantage of the opportunities of being in close proximity to such a wealthy
					 neighbour. We must prevent any disruptions that would harm those
					 advantages.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995 we signed the Canada-United States accord on
					 our shared border. Its goal was to promote international trade, streamline
					 processes for legitimate travellers and commercial goods, provide enhanced
					 protection against drug smuggling and the illegal entrance of people, and
					 reduce costs for both governments. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone agrees we must do these things to ensure our
					 prosperity. In the past we have managed to increase Canada's trade under the
					 free trade agreement and NAFTA. Let us look at some of the facts and
					 figures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency handles over $500
					 billion in cross-border trade and processes more than 108 million travellers
					 each year. Over 87% of our trade is with the United States. The emergence of
					 so-called just in time manufacturing and e-commerce has shortened delivery
					 deadlines from a matter of days to a matter of hours.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these advancements have created an exponential
					 increase in cross-border volume. However, have we agreed with the United States
					 on reciprocal arrangements that would prevent the bill from becoming a
					 detriment to trade and thereby slowing the process by which our products go
					 into the United States? We should ask for assurances that the United States
					 will take the same measures to ensure a level playing field so that Canadian
					 goods can flow into the United States as easily as American goods and people
					 come into Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this summer I drafted a short questionnaire for
					 our international visitors. It came out of a number of complaints I have
					 received from our tourism operators that some of their clients and guests have
					 been harassed at the border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of a 70 some year old lady who was detained and
					 given a great deal of difficulty because she intended to come to Canada for
					 more than just a few weeks to care for a sick daughter. She understood the laws
					 and intended to obey them. However the problems she encountered were such that
					 other people who saw them turned back to the United States rather than continue
					 their holiday in Canada. This is only one of many instances of which I have
					 been advised.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Cariboo--Chilcotin we have many visitors travelling
					 from outside Canada to our beautiful part of the world. Because of the economic
					 situation of today these visitors are absolutely essential to our
					 economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the questionnaire I prepared I asked visitors to
					 tell me about their experiences at our border. I will use their responses to
					 advise the minister responsible for Canada customs about shortfalls and the
					 lack of good service at our borders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important exercise because we want tourists
					 to return with their vacation dollars. We want them to feel at ease and not
					 have a problem vacationing in Canada. I am happy to report to the House that
					 the results of the survey were mostly positive, though certainly not
					 all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time Canadians want assurances from the
					 government that from a national security perspective we can ensure that people,
					 products and capital entering Canada are not an economic, medical or criminal
					 risk. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the vicious attack on the United States
					 on September 11, our border security has become one of the chief concerns of
					 all Canadians. Apparently the protection of our borders, freedoms and way of
					 life is not the chief concern of the government. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's debate on Bill S-23 is late and it is a weak
					 effort under today's circumstances. The bill attempts to streamline border
					 procedures but it is only a start. It does not take into account difficulties
					 that we discussed in the House four, five and six years ago, difficulties that
					 our customs and immigration people are having with their computers in
					 communicating with the computers of other departments and other agencies, where
					 customs and police are not on the same page and where the lack of essential
					 information is not communicated and is not available.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only last spring that we were talking about
					 adapting CPIC, the police computer system, to monitor sex offenders and to
					 create a registry. The government turned that down. This in my view is an
					 essential component of the protection of our citizens. The government's refusal
					 to consider this is only another example of its lack of concern for the basic
					 security and welfare of our own citizens. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all trying to engage the government in a greater
					 debate on national security, in particular the integrity of our borders, ports,
					 coastlines and airlines. The government continues to turn a deaf ear and to
					 speak to us in the most rude manner. The Prime Minister is hesitating. There is
					 no apparent willingness to move from the comfortable past to meet the urgent,
					 threatening and dangerous challenges not of the future but of today.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians want to see more effective screening and
					 security at our borders and more effective tracking of refugee claimants and
					 permanent residents within Canada. We want the ability to deport suspected
					 terrorists to their countries of origin or the countries where the crimes were
					 committed. Let me say that again: We want immediate action to detain and deport
					 anyone in Canada illegally or failed refugee claimants linked to terrorist
					 organizations. We want an improved ability to detect these dangerous people. We
					 believe that our first priority should be the protection of Canadian people and
					 the safety of all our citizens. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all agree that the threat to our safety is real. Why
					 will the government not take it seriously? This legislation is late and half
					 baked. It does not meet the needs of today and that is why we cannot support
					 it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before last week's terrorist assault on the United
					 States, Canadians faced the threat of long waits at the border because the
					 United States was threatening to implement changes. It has drawn up section 110
					 of the U.S. illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act. These
					 changes would require more indepth interviews and examination of documents at
					 the border. This would cause considerable hardship to Canadians trying to do
					 business in the United States. That is the threat the United States has been
					 holding over the government's head. The government has dragged its feet when it
					 comes to protecting our borders so the United States is prepared to do
					 something about it. The U.S. has talked about doing the job for the Liberal
					 government by using section 110 of its immigration act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance has supported a move toward more
					 use of technology in terms of how we handle border crossings. We support that.
					 The idea of using the technology of retina scanners and handprint readers, the
					 so-called biometric pass system, is necessary in today's world. We have tried
					 to show the Liberals the work that must be done to protect our citizens and the
					 United States from the long reach of terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be clear: Canada's porous border is not a
					 reflection on hard working men and women who serve as our customs officers. It
					 is a result of policy decisions that shifted customs from a security mandate to
					 the Department of National Revenue with the prime mandate of recovering tax and
					 duty for the crown. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our customs and immigration officers should be more
					 than tax collectors, but that is what they have been relegated to. </p>


	<A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what the Liberals are most concerned about, it
					 seems: collecting taxes as well as collecting votes. When it comes to Canada's
					 immigration and refugee policies, the Liberals seem most concerned about
					 collecting these votes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has no definition of refugee. The government
					 simply takes those who present themselves at the border and declare themselves
					 to be refugees. Then it is our responsibility to determine the validity of
					 these claims. Why can Canada not use a UN convention definition of refugee and
					 predetermine which legitimate refugees should come to our country to be useful,
					 productive and happy citizens? We need a definition of refugee. Let us make use
					 of the UN definition and know who we are welcoming, know who is coming to our
					 borders and know that we can trust them. There are ways of avoiding those who
					 would come here to harm us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Harris, former CSIS chief of strategic planning,
					 declared it is guaranteed that the terrorists are coming. He also referred to
					 Canada as a big jihad aircraft carrier for launching strikes against the United
					 States. In January 1999 a special Senate committee on security and intelligence
					 stated very clearly that Canada is a venue of opportunity for terrorist
					 groups.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other former senior government staff members have
					 expressed concern. The government has not listened. It is still not listening.
					 The government must improve our border entry and our exit security. By not
					 responding to the pleas from the United States concerning the openness we have
					 enjoyed along the Canada-U.S. border, the government is jeopardizing billions
					 of trade dollars and tens of thousands of Canadian jobs. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government should be pursuing policies and laws
					 that protect the lives and livelihoods of all Canadians. We must weigh the
					 concerns about the safety of our citizens and the preservation of an open trade
					 relationship with the United States with our humanitarian responsibility to
					 receive genuine refugees. We can no longer have a policy of admit first, ask
					 questions later.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Liberal government is not willing to increase
					 our standard of national security, the United States will not be willing to
					 jeopardize the safety and security of the American people by continuing open
					 access across our long undefended border. If we do not respect and defend that
					 border from abuse by unscrupulous people, dangerous people, it will not remain
					 an undefended border. That would be a great shame. We must do everything for
					 the economic well-being of our citizens, the safety of our citizens and the
					 harmony of this precious relationship we have with the people of the United
					 States of America.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I have one comment and one question.
					 During this debate there has been some implication that the United States of
					 America is anti-immigrant and anti-refugee. Let us just examine that
					 implication.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 400 years ago that country was settled. As far as
					 I know the people who made that country grow and become a country that today
					 has 5% of the world's population and 35% of the world's GDP were immigrants
					 from all four corners of the world. There is no country in the world that is
					 more multicultural, built on immigration and refugees, than the United States
					 of America.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I see a hint of anti-Americanism behind the
					 reaction of some government members: that we cannot really work together with
					 the Americans with a common immigration and refugee policy because somehow they
					 are not in favour of immigration and refugee policies like we are. I just want
					 to set the record straight on that matter. The U.S. has probably been more
					 pro-immigrant and pro-refugee during its history than Canada has.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have another concern. I would like to draw this
					 question to the attention of my learned colleague for his comments. There has
					 been a suggestion on the government side that in the face of this terrorist
					 threat what the government will do is take a moderate, balanced approach in
					 dealing with this threat with bin Laden and the international terrorist groups
					 and the 40,000 people in Canada who have deportation orders and have not been
					 deported. We will take a liberal, moderate, balanced middle of the road
					 approach.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a student of history, I have a lot of problems with
					 that. If Roosevelt and Churchill in the face of Hitler had said that they would
					 take a moderate, middle of the road approach in dealing with Adolf Hitler and
					 nazis, where we would be? I do not think we are talking about domestic social
					 programs here or some other type of program in regard to which they like to use
					 this terminology and I would like my colleague to respond to whether he could
					 envision the Government of Canada fighting terrorism with a moderate, balanced,
					 middle of the road approach.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, is that not an interesting comment that my
					 colleague makes concerning a moderate, balanced approach?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For so long we have prided ourselves on being moderate
					 and balanced, even in immoderate and unbalanced times. We have this little
					 mantra that has been a bit spoiled lately because the United Nations did not
					 declare us to be the best nation in the world this year, but we are the best
					 country in the world, a little mantra with which the government has tried to
					 soothe our people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the history of Canada, it has not been
					 those moments of crisis we dealt with in a moderate, balanced way that have
					 made Canada the nation we can be proud of. I was in Quebec City some months ago
					 reviewing my history. It is interesting to note that there were times when we
					 could not even have a balanced and moderate approach with the citizens of the
					 United States. Fortunately since the war of 1812 that has not been something we
					 have been concerned about. However, I think of Canada and the effort it made in
					 World War I, the second world war and the Korean war and those citizens who
					 volunteered, as members of my family did, to defend the principles of democracy
					 and freedom from fascism, from naziism and from tyranny.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are faced with some of those same immoderate
					 forces. We have been told, not by foreign experts but by our own people who
					 care about these matters, that there is a serious threat, yet we are still
					 talking about moderation and balance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent many years in the ministry, years in which I
					 was proud to care for many people. It is something from which I get the most
					 satisfaction. However, there were instances where one would be with someone
					 diagnosed with a terminal illness. One would sit and listen to the moderate,
					 balanced approach of someone who perhaps had a week or a month to live as he
					 talked about what he would do in the next 10 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are times when we must look seriously at the
					 situation we are in and when we must act decisively. When I hear our foreign
					 affairs minister speak in those aggressive tones, I applaud him. I hope his
					 government is listening to him and I hope the Prime Minister is remembering
					 what he said as he sits with President Bush today. I truly hope that our Prime
					 Minister will not have the experience of visiting the woodshed at the White
					 House when he goes there today. He is in danger of that and he deserves it for
					 his moderate and balanced approach to so many issues and so many policies,
					 which has left our country lagging.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of our emergency response resources in British
					 Columbia that have been almost totally depleted as far as the government is
					 concerned. The military has been taken away. Unused ships sit tied up. The
					 military airports are practically vacant. The army is gone. We talk about
					 bringing the resources we might need in British Columbia in the event of a
					 civil emergency over the highways. What do we do when those mountainous
					 highways are closed and there is no way through them? We are talking through
					 our hats in moderate, balanced tones when we need decisive action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British Columbians are extremely concerned about this.
					 They are talking about it a lot. We need decisions that move us with decisive
					 actions, that will protect and care for our citizens, that will look after the
					 future of our children and see that they are safe.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men and women on the front line know what they

					 Secretary to the Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to
					 talk about the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency's action plan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wholeheartedly support Bill S-23 as presented by my
					 colleague, the Minister of National Revenue. I cannot stress enough the
					 importance of pushing the bill forward. Bill S-23 proposes to modernize the
					 management of our border, to further encourage trade and tourism, all this
					 without jeopardizing safety and the security of Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past five years the volume of trade and travel
					 has steadily increased. This surge of activity at the border has compelled the
					 CCRA to re-evaluate how it can best carry out its dual mandate of protection,
					 and trade and travel facilitation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe strongly that the customs action plan will
					 serve Canadians well. It will improve the flow of people and goods across the
					 border and will strengthen our country's ability to protect its
					 citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think hon. members will agree that following the
					 terrorist attacks on the United States it has become even more crucial that
					 this bill become a reality. We need to act now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-23 includes a range of enforcement initiatives
					 and services that support the protection of Canadians and the competitiveness
					 of business. It is important not to lose sight of the fact that the great
					 majority of travellers comply with our laws and regulations. However there are
					 those who cross our border illegally, some with the intent to undermine the
					 safety of Canadians. The amendments in Bill S-23 can help stop this
					 threat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the heart of the customs action plan are the
					 principles of pre-approval and advance information, all supported by
					 technology. Programs such as customs self-assessment and the administrative
					 monetary penalty system are key elements that form the risk management approach
					 detailed by my colleague, the Minister of National Revenue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-23 will also enable CCRA to better channel its
					 efforts and resources by concentrating its attention on high risk people or
					 goods trying to enter Canada. Bill S-23 will clarify current laws to allow the
					 CCRA to effectively administrate and enforce its mandate. For this reason the
					 purpose of the changes proposed in Bill S-23 will help Canada customs do a
					 better job of keeping undesirable people and illegal drugs out of this
					 country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore the proposed changes in Bill S-23 will give
					 Canada customs more authority in controlled areas of airports and other border
					 points. Those controlled areas not only support the business goals of the
					 Canadian air industry but they will also create seamless connection processes
					 for travellers in a secured and protected environment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that Canada customs will
					 continue to work closely with enforcement agencies and other government
					 departments to address illegal activities and the threats to health, safety and
					 the security at our borders.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The customs action plan is not a downsizing exercise.
					 To the contrary it is about a simplified process and improved efficiency so
					 that business can go on smoothly and efficiently. Nevertheless low risk traders
					 and travellers will still be subject to periodic spot checks when entering
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the responsibility to control imported
					 goods, the amendments in Bill S-23 also give customs inspectors the authority
					 to reinforce export laws. This is to ensure that exported goods do not pose a
					 threat to Canada or any other country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate that as a result of the
					 recent events, these are essential steps toward ensuring the safety and
					 security of Canadians. As indicated by the Minister of National Revenue, I
					 cannot stress enough the importance of Bill S-23 for the Government of Canada
					 to better protect Canadians and to continue to promote trade and investment in
					 Canada. It is essential that we support the customs action plan and the
					 amendments contained in Bill S-23. Let us not forget that the protection of
					 Canadians should always remain a top priority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge members today to say yes to the bill. By doing
					 so we will contribute to protecting the Canadian population from undue
					 harm.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, last week the president of Honda Motor
					 Company made it quite clear that because of the bottlenecks on the highway for
					 movement of goods from Canada to the U.S., they could not see themselves making
					 any further or future investments in this country. Magma International, the big
					 parts manufacturer in Ontario, exports a tremendous volume of parts to the
					 United States auto industry south of the border. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a high speed, one lane highway system. It is a
					 two lane highway but there is a high speed lane and a lane that is just about
					 completely blocked. There is nothing moving through that lane. The high speed
					 lane is the one the government is dealing with which is the flow of goods from
					 the U.S. to Canada. The lane that is more important to Canadians is the other
					 lane, the movement of our goods into the United States. The United States
					 ambassador has made it very clear that he has a fair number of concerns about
					 some of the things we have been doing in Canada in terms of security. The
					 answers we are getting in the House refer to a moderate, balanced approach, the
					 Canadian way of doing things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other people in the U.S. who are very
					 concerned about our internal policies. The auditor general referred to 40,000
					 residents of Canada who are not Canadians, people who are subjects of
					 deportation orders but have not been deported.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our country has security problems that the government
					 has not addressed and it shows at our borders. There was the millennium bomber
					 situation. I hope members watched the special on CBC last night. The French
					 were trying to get search warrants here to deal with the terror cell in
					 Montreal and it took six months before they were approved. The commentator just
					 shook his head at our lax policy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question for my colleague on the other side of the
					 House is, what are they going to do to open up the other lane?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the member about a

					 the world's pre-eminent terrorist targets and revealed that, with perhaps the
					 singular exception of the United States, there were more international
					 terrorist groups active here than in any other country in the world. Just how
					 accurate his words were became evident when a Montreal resident was arrested
					 trying to smuggle bomb making materials into the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-23 talks about streamlining legitimate
					 cross-border trade and travel. They have set up a process of electronic

					 that will be able to identify the risk individual entering Canada. This is our
					 aim.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the majority of people who come in are
					 law-abiding and without any risk. We are going to shift our focus more on the

					 approving the bill. We then will be able to address these concerns. </p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I was interested in the comments about the

					 how that will deal with this problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take the situation of the millennium bomber, my
					 understanding of the matter is that he was out of the country and managed to
					 get himself a new passport. The passport changed his name from Ressam to Benni
					 Norris. No matter what computer system was used, nothing showed up on a Benni
					 Norris. It was blank. There was no criminal record and nothing in the
					 background. If one had punched in Ressam, he or she would have found a lot of
					 stuff.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think just about everybody realizes that we have
					 holes in our system right across the board. Our passport system is obviously a
					 Mickey Mouse operation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can the government say about that particular
					 situation? Will its computer systems be able to deal with phoney passport
					 situations and so on or will it just let it go the way that it has been
					 going?</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, as this is the first time I have risen in
					 the House since the resumption of parliamentary business, I wish to greet my
					 fellow citizens of Joliette. It is because of their concerns that I intervene
					 in the debate on Bill S-23, an act to amend the Customs Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the aim of Bill S-23 is to modernize
					 customs administration. I think we should have another look at some of the
					 objectives the minister of revenue and officials noted as underlying the
					 amendment of the Customs Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first part is intended to modernize the customs
					 administration by providing for the expedited movement of persons and goods
					 into Canada. Second, it provides for streamlined clearance procedures for low
					 risk passengers by pre-arrival risk assessment of passenger
					 information.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also provides for monetary penalties in
					 respect of designated contraventions. There are a whole series of amendments to
					 the Customs Act and to other related acts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to take another look at the objectives
					 of the bill, because we must make sure that it meets the objectives set out by
					 the minister and the officials. These objectives are in response to the
					 government's commitment to modernize the management of borders, to reduce legal
					 activities and threats to public security and to raise confidence levels of
					 exporters and individuals travelling abroad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the bill meet these objectives? This is what we
					 would like to know. Obviously, as the Bloc Quebecois critic for international
					 trade, I am extremely sensitive to everything that affects the flow of trade.
					 Faster processing at the border clearly has a significant impact on our ability
					 to export to the United States and around the world. In addition, as concerns
					 imports, it is vital our companies be in a position to respond to customer
					 demand and to have the resources, be they natural resources, machinery,
					 technology or individual expertise, at the right time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, therefore, we do not oppose the bill, nor
					 are we opposed to the desire to modernize our customs system, since the volume
					 of transborder shipments now exceeds $500 billion and over 100 million
					 travellers enter or leave Canada annually.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned, we agree in principle with the bill's
					 objectives. The Bloc Quebecois will therefore be voting in favour of this bill
					 at second reading.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must emphasize that there are shortcomings
					 in the bill, which must be corrected before we will give our final approval,
					 before the Bloc Quebecois will vote in favour of this bill at third
					 reading.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four problems: the first has to do with
					 security; the second with fair treatment of individuals and companies; the
					 third with the resources earmarked for customs services generally; and the
					 fourth with mail searches.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was mentioned, the purpose of modernizing our
					 customs system is to expedite the movement of passengers. Another purpose is to
					 broaden accelerated licence programs, such as Canpass, so that companies
					 identified as being low risk can take advantage of reserved border crossing
					 lanes without having to undergo the usual questioning from customs
					 officers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two programs raise some very legitimate
					 concerns—and I think that after the events of September 11, we have a
					 responsibility to be concerned—about security. Furthermore, what regulations
					 will be introduced to provide a framework for putting these very laudable
					 principles into practice?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These regulations are extremely important. I know that
					 the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot raised this point on Friday;
					 unfortunately, the present Liberal government has a tendency to favour using
					 statutes as blank canvases for regulations, as the Minister of National Revenue
					 put it. The result is that parliamentarians are deprived of the full
					 information they need to make informed decisions.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This case is no exception, since the number of

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can see, the bill sets out a principle, but we
					 know absolutely nothing, at this point in time, about how this principle will
					 be applied. What means will be used, what methods and criteria will determine
					 those who stand to benefit from this privileged treatment? Will these
					 regulations guarantee a high level of safety without compromising the steady
					 flow of trade that we require? We do not know this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as we do not know this, we cannot comment on
					 the substance of the bill, despite the fact that we support the
					 principle.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same thing when it comes to fairness. We know
					 that these accelerated permit programs will give the businesses that have
					 access to these permits an advantage over their competitors. We would not like
					 this system and these programs to become a new way to help friends of the
					 government. We would not want people to benefit enormously from this privilege,
					 because it is just that, a privilege, and not a right. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, we need to know what criteria the
					 government will use to determine who will be eligible for these permits, and
					 who will not. As long as there are no regulations, we are unable to judge the
					 substance of the bill, again, even though we agree with the objectives being
					 pursued.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if we do not have the regulations, we will
					 not be able to vote for the bill at third reading. As I mentioned earlier, the
					 minister himself described the bill as a blank canvas. We do not want a blank
					 canvas, we want the whole picture before agreeing to support bill
					 S-23.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, we are not the only ones to wonder about,
					 have concerns about, this blank canvas Bill S-23 represents. For example, Bob
					 Armstrong of the Canadian importers and exporters association, said the
					 following before the committee: </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Although we are very supportive of
						  the concepts of the action plan, the association is not without its concerns
						  and reservations when it comes to the implementation of the programs, such as
						  the Administrative Monetary Penalty System, AMPS, and the Customs Self
						  Assessment initiative, CSA. There are inequities in the proposals that we have
						  seen so far and there is not yet an operating plan available to ascertain what
						  the actual impact of AMPS will be. There is much verbal discussion. Everything
						  is still in a draft format so we do not know entirely.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is exactly our impression today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also appearing before the committee was the president
					 of the Canadian Society of Customs Brokers, who said: </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>There is still work to be done. We
						  must see the proposed regulations. We must better understand the systems
						  changes that will be used to monitor infractions and performance. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, I think, summarizes very well what we are asking
					 of the minister and the government. We need regulations so that we may have a
					 debate that is not only calm, but also democratic. Having only half or
					 one-quarter of the information will not let us get a proper idea of the effects
					 of this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in order to have a clearer idea of the balance
					 between security and fluidity of exchanges, between equity and fluidity, we
					 want to see these regulations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a third element, which I had mentioned at the
					 start, in addition to security and equity: the government's commitment to
					 injecting the necessary resources. Regardless of what the minister and the
					 government may feel, reorganization of the system, using new technologies and
					 pertinent information must not put us in a position where we cannot take
					 advantage of savings in injecting new financial and human resources in order to

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, we are not the only ones to think so and I am

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel that these goals will be achieved in the long
					 term but, unfortunately, because of the lack of funding, this could take longer
					 than the agency thinks. This is our other message. We hope that in the future
					 the Government of Canada will provide adequate funding to its customs agency,
					 so that its productivity can be as high as possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should get a commitment from both the Minister of
					 Finance and the Minister of National Revenue that the necessary resources to
					 implement the act--which we hope will be improved on--will indeed be provided
					 to ensure the administration of this legislation and the safety of Canadians
					 and Quebecers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last thing I mentioned at the beginning, along with
					 safety, fairness and the providing of the necessary resources, is the opening
					 of mail. This is not something new. We cannot support this part of the bill.
					 Last spring, when it was learned that employees at the Canada Customs and
					 Revenue Agency were opening mail, it created an uproar in our democratic
					 society, and rightly so. At the time, the privacy commissioner even made the
					 following comment: </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was mentioning a final aspect of the bill, which we
					 cannot support, and that is the examination of mail. I pointed out that the
					 privacy commissioner had intervened, last spring, to criticize this. The
					 current law permits the opening of mailings of over 30 grams in weight. Thirty
					 grams represents a few sheets of paper. This situation, as I indicated, has
					 already been criticized.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of limiting the right of officials to conduct
					 such examinations, the bill intends to give customs officers greater
					 opportunities to open the mail of Canadians and Quebecers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment is found at clause 99.1 of the
					 bill:</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>(4) Subsection 99(1) of the Act is

<td><small>(c.1) at any time up to the time of exportation, examine

						  be opened any such mail that the officer suspects on reasonable grounds
						  contains any goods the exportation of which is prohibited, controlled or
						  regulated under any Act of Parliament, and take samples of anything contained
						  in such mail in reasonable amounts.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can see, this significantly broadens the
					 procedure that already exists under the current act. When she testified before
					 the Senate committee, which was looking at this specific clause, the president
					 of the Canadian Bar Association, Mrs. Dumont, said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>We are very concerned by the
						  provisions of Bill S-23 that seek to significantly broaden the powers of the
						  government regarding the opening and examination of mail. More specifically, we
						  are concerned about the erosion of the right of Canadians to privacy and of
						  solicitor-client privilege.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as I mentioned at the outset, we support in
					 principle the objectives of Bill S-23. However, we will not be able to support
					 it at third reading, unless a number of conditions are met, particularly as
					 regards the tabling of regulations that would allow us to get a better idea of
					 the balance between safety and the smooth movement of goods and people, so as
					 to be sure, upon looking at these regulations, that individuals and businesses
					 will be treated fairly and that we have a commitment on the part of the federal
					 government that adequate funding will be provided to the customs agency and,
					 finally, that the provisions allowing for the opening of mail will be
					 withdrawn. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, if these changes are not made, we will
					 have no choice but to vote against Bill S-23. However, I am convinced--and the
					 minister already seems to be receptive--that, by third reading, such
					 regulations will have been drafted and discussed, and the most problematic
					 aspects of the opening of mail will have been eliminated. </p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. I
					 have not had an opportunity to examine the Alliance's amendments in
					 detail.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear to us that we must work collectively to
					 find a balance between the security of Canadians and Quebecers crossing the
					 border and the necessary fluidity of commercial transactions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a context of free trade with the United States and
					 Mexico, if it were to take several hours or days to clear goods at the border,
					 we would lose the advantages these agreements were designed to
					 produce.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this perspective, there is no easy solution. It is
					 also clear that this cannot simply be left up to the Canada Customs and Revenue
					 Agency. There is a whole series of other conditions. The leader of the Bloc
					 Quebecois spoke about them during the special debate on the events of September
					 11. Canada in particular must assume its responsibilities with respect to world
					 peace and the development of underdeveloped, or developing, nations, and ensure
					 that the laws are actually respected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the use of technologies, the bill
					 proposes that the necessary resources be made available to ensure that these
					 laws are respected. I think that the comments we have heard from those
					 representing groups such as the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, or
					 exporters, indicate that, as we speak, we do not have the resources necessary
					 to enforce this law, even with all its shortcomings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A law using additional new technologies and information
					 will require resources. In this regard, we are waiting for the government to
					 make a firm commitment during this debate.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's response to the
					 content of the bill. I will address my next question to one of his concern
					 about the bill and not the Alliance amendment. The Alliance amendment basically
					 deals with security matters. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the member's comments he made reference to the
					 movement of manufactured goods between Canada and the United States. I have had
					 the opportunity, as have other members in the House, to examine how goods
					 actually move through the Canadian side to the American side of the border and
					 vice versa. The Americans have stepped forward with some very state of the art
					 detection equipment where they no longer need to tear everything apart inside a
					 container or a truck to see what is in it. They have a device that can x-ray
					 the truck to determine if it contains people, goods or other questionable
					 goods, such as drugs. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was last at the border it was with the member
					 for Wild Rose. We were very much aware that one in twenty trucks would be
					 checked at the border but when the line-up became too long some would not be
					 checked at all. They would just drive around checkpoints and away they would
					 go. There were times when the police would chase one or two of these units but
					 needless to say many got away without any check.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the situation as it is today, with border security
					 tightening up, it is not necessarily tightening up for manufactured goods going
					 back and forth but for the threat of the wrong kind of people coming through
					 the border points. They may slip south or they may slip north. If we do not
					 deal with the security side of the matter our manufacturing side may get hurt
					 too because of long line-ups and the demand from our friends to the south for
					 restricting that movement until everything is checked to their satisfaction.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should Canada do that would assist or augment what
					 exists presently in developing a better security arrangement to move
					 manufactured goods through that border point?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I believe we agree on the objectives of
					 this bill in this connection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, all shippers, all truckers, all manufacturers,
					 cannot be treated in the same way. Clearly, a number of them, because of their
					 past performance, their reputation, their credibility I would say, represent
					 less of a risk than others who are less well known, because they have been in
					 the business a shorter time or have had fewer contacts with Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, we cannot therefore be opposed in
					 principle to this idea of having a concentration of resources toward companies
					 or individuals which are considered to be a higher risk than others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the question is whether we are going to
					 differentiate between a high risk company, a medium risk company and a low risk
					 one. While I agree in principle, I must say that I do not know the answer for
					 the moment, since we do not have the regulations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that if the minister's approach is a
					 serious one, he must introduce the mechanisms by which the department will
					 indeed determine this and the method it will use to ensure that companies or
					 individuals deemed to be low risk are indeed that—even if there will always be
					 a minimum of checks to be carried out at the border itself—and will be
					 differentiated from those of medium and high risk as far as security is
					 concerned—and I share the hon. member's concerns—but also as a matter of
					 equity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company that benefits from this special
					 border-crossing right will have a competitive advantage over another company.
					 This can become a very easy way to encourage undesirable illegal traffic. The
					 very principle of a bill that is aimed at risk management at source, that is
					 with the shipper, the manufacturer or the passenger, is an interesting one.
					 That said, as long as we do not have the regulations, the principle remains one
					 on which we cannot form an opinion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I have already said that, without the
					 regulations, we will not be in a position to vote in favour of Bill S-23 at
					 third reading.</p>

					 an act to amend the Customs Act and to make related amendments to other acts,
					 which is presently before the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment, moved by the hon. member for
					 Edmonton--Strathcona, is in the form of a reasoned amendment. A reasoned
					 amendment, according to <i>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</i>, page
					 638, is one which “--allows a member to state the reasons why he or she opposes
					 second reading of a bill--”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning such an amendment, Marleau and Montpetit
					 states further, at page 639, “It must be relevant and relate strictly to the
					 bill being considered”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the summary of the bill, Bill S-23 seeks
					 in part to amend the Customs Act by “--providing for the expedited movement of
					 persons and goods into Canada--”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Edmonton--Strathcona objects to the
					 second reading of the bill because, and I quote, “...the principle of the bill
					 fails to specifically and adequately address national security at Canada's

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am extremely pleased to hear that the
					 amendment is in order. I certainly hope members of the government will pay
					 close attention to the reasoning behind that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to rise to speak to Bill S-23 today. In
					 essence, there are some good aspects to the bill. Who could argue with measures
					 that would allow for pre-approval of travellers and reduction at the border of
					 waiting times for Canadian bound trucks. At the time of the production of the
					 bill, not a lot of people could, but that was prior to 9.30 a.m., September
					 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of these tragic events, the principle of the
					 bill fails to specifically and adequately address the national security at
					 Canada's borders with respect to terrorist activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world as we know it has changed. The Liberal
					 government should be taking this time to revisit and review all its legislative
					 proposals. This has become the most important issue of our time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to take a moment to thank our frontline customs
					 officers, especially those who, in the aftermath of September 11, have been
					 working around the clock, checking thousands of travellers seeking entrance
					 into Canada. They have done a tremendous job with limited human, technological
					 and financial resources. We really need to take a close look at what is going
					 on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the pleasure of visiting a number of the ports of
					 entry across the western part of the country during the summer. The morale is
					 very low, and there are a lot of good reasons why it is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give an example of a letter I received from one
					 of our frontline customs officers. He said “In light of the recent terrifying
					 events in the United States, I feel it is time that we demand my employer,
					 Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, take the steps needed to equip me to do my
					 job. I am now more afraid than ever to do my job. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to explain the current law enforcement related
					 equipment that I have been issued. I have a pair of handcuffs and a bulletproof
					 vest. I need pepper spray, a baton, a sidearm to do my job properly and protect
					 the people of Canada and myself”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He goes on to say “At present should I come into
					 contact with a violent subject, including one who is threatening my life, I am
					 to allow him to enter Canada and I am to contact the RCMP to deal with him or
					 her”. This has to be the most ridiculous instruction that has ever been given
					 to any law enforcement officer in history. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter continues “If at my location I release the
					 subject, the RCMP would never find him. They are too far away and are so poorly
					 staffed here there is no way they could contact the person. Furthermore, what
					 would the taxpaying public think if they found out that a customs inspector
					 just allowed a dangerous individual to come right into Canada, offering
					 absolutely no resistance whatsoever.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the problem with customs is that we are a
					 law enforcement agency being managed by people with no law enforcement
					 background. They are more concerned with image and public and business
					 convenience than they are law enforcement. We here are the front and the first
					 line of defence for Canada. I for one would like the equipment to do my job
					 with more competence”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continues on to say “If you would like examples of
					 the image statement, let me inform you of the following:</p>


	<A NAME="T1325"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1325)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither our shoulder patch nor our badge say officer or
					 inspector, they simply say, Canada Customs. Our bullet-proof vests have a
					 reflective strip on the back that also reads the same.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at my U.S. counterparts this week during this
					 time of extra security and their vests read in bold print “Police U.S.
					 Immigration”. My silly lettering is a mere three quarters of an inch, a
					 stunning example of image”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to say: “Presently, our officers at large
					 ports have been issued pepper spray and batons, however, we at places where we
					 work alone have not been issued these tools. This is an example of the backward
					 thinking of the agency. They have issued the safety equipment to places where
					 there is always another officer available for assistance, however, where I work
					 alone, I am defenseless.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be happy to discuss this matter or any other
					 customs related matter with you at any time. Just a quick request though.
					 Please keep in mind that my agency is very heavily controlled by the Privacy
					 Act and we have been discouraged from speaking to members of parliament.
					 Please, in the interest of my career, could you please allow me my anonymity.
					 Unfortunately we work in an environment where speaking out is very strongly
					 discourage”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time of this tragic event, the fellows and women
					 who put their lives on the line at the borders are being controlled. They are
					 being told not to talk to members of parliament, especially if they are from
					 the opposition or they will be in serious trouble. The same thing happens in
					 the penitentiaries with prison guards and security officers. They are told not
					 to not talk to MPs. They discourage that, especially if they are members of the
					 opposition because they might talk about the very things that this officer is
					 talking about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk about low morale. He is fearful of losing his
					 career and being fired because he speaks out. These people who are on the front
					 line should be speaking out louder than ever. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall the visit the member for Calgary Northeast and
					 I had on a trip to Fort Erie on the border. We saw exactly what he was
					 referring to in terms of free flow of traffic. We remember him standing on the
					 edge of the bridge looking at the boats. We asked the officers what was in the
					 boats that kept coming to Canada. They did not know. However, they said that if
					 it looked a certain way it was probably cigarettes. If it looked another way it
					 was probably whiskey, or guns or it was smuggling people. They did not know
					 because they had no ability or resources to stop them and check to see what
					 they were bringing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Calgary Northeast and I saw with our own
					 eyes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who receives them when they land on the shores of this
					 great country? Nobody. When I went to certain border crossings and talked to
					 the customs officer, they said that. However, they said if I wanted to take a
					 trip with them, we could go 200 yards to the east or 200 yards to the west and
					 they could show me all kinds of trails of comings and goings because there were
					 no officers.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill must not be brought forward at this time
					 because, as our amendment says, it is totally obsolete. It does not address the
					 needs of our time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week the revenue and immigration minister
					 attempted to put a principled plan in place, but the <i>Globe and Mail</i>
					 published a confidential internal government bulletin issued to our border
					 guards regarding risk assessment. Instead of these ministers immediately
					 announcing an investigation was underway, they decided to waffle over the
					 political correctness of racial profiling, and the <i>Globe and Mail</i> was
					 busy defending its civil liberties. How can Canadians be confident that any
					 other confidential documents are not going to be leaked during this critical
					 time in our history?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should have been an investigation announced
					 immediately regarding this confidential crisis type information being leaked.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about law enforcement. Maybe it is time
					 to take a look at the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency bureaucracy and those
					 who work in it. They are not law enforcement officials. Perhaps this whole area
					 should be taken out of that portfolio and placed in the portfolio of the
					 solicitor general or justice department. They have the criteria and the
					 knowledge of law enforcement, whereas Customs Canada has no knowledge or
					 experience with it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is Revenue Canada now suddenly the body of people
					 who will look after the major security of our country and our borders? I am
					 afraid it does not make a lot of sense to me.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will speak about another decision the revenue
					 minister made this past week, which was a good one. The decision was made to
					 suspend the Canpass program for motorists, small planes and boats entering the
					 country. The program allowed prescreened motorists automatic border crossing
					 and the pilots of small planes to land at Canadian airports after reporting to
					 customs by telephone. The program was cancelled for security concerns. It will
					 not be long, though, before this program is back up and running. How can we
					 ever trust this honour system again?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private aircrafts with less than 15 passengers are free
					 to land at any airport, without customs inspections, merely by calling a
					 central phone number to report their arrival. To make matters worse, the
					 itineraries of these planes are considered confidential information by NAV CAN.
					 Therefore, customs truly is working blind.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it honestly make sense to the minister of customs
					 that we do not search all international flights? This mindset has to change.
					 The world as we know it has changed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me recount another story, with which I am sure most
					 members are familiar. It was a story in the Windsor <i>Star</i> of September
					 18. This is an example of how far we have to go. It states: </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a lot of ways, both the U.S. and Canada have been
					 living in a fool's paradise. I do not intend to be a scaremonger, but I truly
					 believe the legislation must be reviewed and strengthened. This is a
					 pre-September 11 piece of legislation. This is a post-September 11 world and
					 the legislation must be changed quickly. It must reflect the need for top
					 security at our borders. It must be a high priority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have witnessed and felt the hurt of what can happen
					 with a group or network of people who have no regard for human life and who do
					 not really care about rules and regulations. For us to sit, be cautious and say
					 we must have a balanced approach is foolish. When we introduce legislation, the
					 security of the country must be a major component. We must equip the people who
					 guard our borders with the tools necessary to the job and remember that they
					 are a law enforcement agency. They are necessary to protect the lives, property
					 and welfare of all Canadians and we must treat them as such.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day might come very soon when I will make some kind
					 a motion and recommend that the government pull this organization out of
					 Customs Canada and give it to a law enforcement agency that has some knowledge
					 of what we need to do. We need to stop treating them with kid gloves. We need
					 to stop looking for excuses and causes.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the member's words make me think of babies
					 and bath water. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about one of the most successful borders in
					 the world. It has been in that position for decades and decades. It has been a
					 remarkably successful border not because there is barbed wire, trenches,
					 machine guns and minefields all along it, but because in a sense it has been
					 open. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member spent all his time talking about arming the
					 police, meaning the customs officers, along the border. I do not want
					 undesirables coming into Canada and I do not want us to send undesirables to
					 the United States but to think of arming that wonderful productive border, it
					 has been productive in economic terms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of how the two economies have benefited from the
					 border as it was. Think of how it has been in cultural terms, the exchanges,
					 what the Americans have gained from us and what we have gained from the
					 Americans culturally. Think what it would mean to a number of families. I would
					 guess there would be some families in this room, including my own, who have
					 relatives on the two sides of it. With reasonable security, over the years
					 those families have been able to visit each other, to go back and forth for
					 each other's Thanksgiving and that kind of thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the member to think about this. These are very
					 difficult times. People in Canada and in the United States are facing very
					 difficult times. We are all upset. One of our jobs here is to show real
					 leadership, which brings me back to babies and bath water. Does the member
					 really want to throw the baby out with the bath water and make it a fortified
					 border, ruining commerce, and social and cultural exchanges, or does he want us
					 to proceed in some reasonable fashion? Let us by all means fill in the gaps,
					 the problems that exist, but let us hope that in the end it will stay the
					 largest unguarded frontier in the world.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, that does not surprise me at all coming
					 from that side of the House. The status quo seems to be satisfactory because it
					 has worked so well. I agree that before September 11 that was the case but
					 because of the events of September 11, it is now time to seriously look at what
					 we can do to secure our countries from terrorism. We need to keep up the flow
					 of trade and those things that have been so good for both countries for a long
					 time. My point is that this legislation will not do that. It is missing a very
					 important principle. It has not dealt with it at all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have crossed the border probably as often as if not
					 more than anybody. I lived 35 years in one country and then moved here. I am
					 glad that Canada is my home now. At the border I like to see things flowing
					 freely and with security. I would like to see the border as open as much as
					 possible. What does not make sense to me, and the member certainly did not
					 mention it, is what we will do in the meantime now that we know the
					 capabilities of terrorist organizations. They exist and they are a definite
					 threat to the innocent lives of thousands of people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the member suggesting that we do not tighten up
					 things, that we do not listen and that we do not put a better defensive system
					 at the border? The guards themselves are asking for a better system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the member probably does not know much about
					 law enforcement and he would not dare listen to someone who has done it for a
					 number of years. However, from his other comments it is easy to judge that he
					 must never have been confronted with having to enforce a law that is being
					 broken.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry but this is a time when we cannot play
					 Mickey Mouse and pussyfoot around with such an important issue. I would love to
					 see things flowing freely and openly at the border. However, we have to do a
					 better job of making sure that those who are coming into one country or the
					 other are not coming in for the purpose of destruction. We are not doing that
					 with the legislation that is before us today. Now is the day to do
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can guarantee that the border points going south into
					 America have quickly changed in structure and attitude as a result of the
					 events of September 11. We need to see what is happening. We need to understand
					 why it is being done. We must break the network of terrorism in this world and
					 we must do it collectively. We can do it as long as the attitude that I just
					 heard changes to some degree, and it will have to, like it or not. </p>

					 It concerns me that if we continue with this reasonable approach to crossing
					 the border which we have historically been able to maintain, we are in danger
					 of losing the contacts in the United States that we already enjoy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are serious. I look at the president of
					 the United States when he says that there is no room for negotiation and no
					 room for discussion on this issue. When the president says this is the way it
					 is going to be, I believe him. I believe he means what he says.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that we do have some choices. I do not
					 want an armed border either. I enjoy freely crossing into the United States and
					 back again. I have always had that pleasure at the border. I want it
					 maintained. I want my colleagues in the House to know that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me the choice is to be sure that nobody
					 goes into the United States who will harm the American people or they are going
					 to look after the job for us. It is going to be an armed border whether we like
					 it or not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems we have a choice for our ports and airports
					 and those who would come in from other destinations outside North America. If
					 we can assure that those who come to our country can go to the United States
					 safely, our relations with the United States will be much simpler.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having made those comments, I would like to ask the
					 member for Wild Rose for his comments about how he sees the necessity of
					 maintaining the security of Canada as well as the security of the United States

	Mr. Speaker, I took note of the frontline research that
					 the member for Wild Rose did as far as our customs and border systems are
					 concerned. Over the past 15 years anyone taking a masters of business
					 administration at any good school of management would get into total quality
					 management. It states that if quality is improved then results are improved. It
					 involves having a system which is continuously improved to get better
					 results.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system is improved by eliminating fear among the
					 frontline workers. Another way of getting continuous improvement is by getting
					 meaningful input from frontline workers. One thing that should not be done
					 under that theory is dictating or ordering results. Results have to be managed
					 and a team has to be in place to achieve that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I detected a great deal of fear among our frontline
					 workers in the customs department. The fear goes so far that they feel they
					 cannot speak to a member of parliament about the problems they are
					 experiencing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any modern management system in the private sector
					 would say that these are signs of a system that is not working. It is based on
					 fear and commanding results, and it does not work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want a quality system then we have to throw that
					 out and find a different way of doing things. This does not have the signs of a
					 quality system. Would the member for Wild Rose have any comments on that

					 but for the security of the country and its inhabitants. They are dedicated to
					 doing a job that they know has to be done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are simply asking to be listened to in terms of
					 how to do the best job they can. They are no longer interested in getting
					 guidelines and information sheets from bureaucracies that do not deal with
					 national security, law enforcement or those kinds of tools of the trade. It is
					 a revenue agency. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time to get some guidelines from those who work
					 in the field of law enforcement and national security. Let the guidelines come
					 from and work through them. They should be given the freedom to openly discuss
					 with members of parliament how they can best do their jobs and be allowed other
					 opportunities they may have.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is shameful and discouraging that so many of the
					 people working at the ground zero level in our protection, security and customs
					 services are instructed not to speak with MPs, especially members of the
					 opposition. That is a crime in itself.</p>

	 Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure to rise in the
					 House to commemorate the Home Children of Canada. The role of these special
					 children in building and shaping this great country of ours will never be
					 forgotten.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August 19 the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of
					 Canada dedicated a plaque commemorating Canada's Home Children to the Annie
					 Macpherson Home at 51 Avon Street in Stratford.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Home Children were sent to virtually every corner
					 of Canada, this Stratford home played a crucial role by receiving between 7,000
					 and 8,000 children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In late 19th century Britain, cyclical unemployment and
					 chronic poverty had a profound impact on the urban industrial working class.
					 Families were forced to surrender some or all of their children to orphanages
					 and rescue homes. Many of these orphans were sent to Canada as Home Children.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of these children has had a profound
					 impact in helping to change social policy in areas such as child welfare, child
					 labour and immigration. I am pleased to commemorate the Home Children of Canada
					 and acknowledge its national significance.</p>

					 Fuca, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is meeting with
					 President Bush today. Let us look at what Canada can offer under a Liberal
					 managed military. The minimum number of troops the Americans would require is
					 5,000. Our army has not practised at that level in over nine years. The
					 Department of National Defence said it would take at least three months to
					 deploy and we cannot even sustain these numbers for longer than six months in
					 the field.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our airlift capability deployment is quoted as a near
					 catastrophe by our own defence people. Nineteen of our thirty-two C-130
					 transports are 35 years old and in need of replacement. The navy has one
					 functional support ship that it can send out. Due to our losses of manpower
					 only seven can be sent out at any one time. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Sea King helicopters are 35 years old and falling
					 out of the sky. Most of our CF-18 fighters are obsolete and cannot integrate
					 with the American air force. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly 40 Canadians died in the tragedy in the United
					 States but our government has gutted the military and our ability to protect
					 ourselves here and abroad.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This discovery is important because it is difficult to

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week has passed and Canadians still do not have any

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has accused opposition parties of trying
					 to score political points but since when is asking questions unpatriotic? If
					 the government was willing, it could put an end to the questions and

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One major company has said it will build in the U.S.

					 Canada's total trade with the U.S., such delays are already causing plant
					 closings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve public safety and preserve Canadian jobs, it
					 is imperative that Canada, in co-operation with our U.S. neighbours,
					 immediately increase our border security resources in manpower and technology

					 be to have those persons tried under a system of justice that is trusted by the
					 nation which suffered the attacks. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countries harbouring terrorists may be reluctant to
					 release them to the United States. Did the Prime Minister propose today

					 by Scottish law in Holland.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time it must be pointed out that Mr. bin

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian citizens are vulnerable when it comes to

	I am now prepared to rule on the point of order raised
					 by the hon. member for Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough concerning the status in
					 the House of the Progressive Conservative/Democratic Representative
					 Coalition.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, though, l want to thank all hon. members for
					 their gracious co-operation with the Chair when the House met last week. This
					 co-operation made it possible to make appropriate interim arrangements without
					 prejudice to any decision on this matter, and facilitated the orderly conduct
					 of urgent business by postponing to an opportune time full consideration of
					 this point of order. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough
					 referred to a letter he had written to me concerning the establishment of the
					 20 member Progressive Conservative/Democratic Representative Coalition, its
					 membership and the appointment of its officers. Meant to function, as he says,
					 “within the machinery of the House of Commons”, the coalition seeks to be
					 recognized officially in the House for certain procedural purposes. It is
					 requesting “all of the privileges and rights” associated with recognition as
					 the “fourth largest political entity” in the House, namely with respect to
					 seating in the House, precedence and the allocation of time in all
					 deliberations.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the hon. member for
					 Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough for having raised the matter on behalf of the
					 Coalition. I would also like to thank the House leader of the official
					 opposition, the House leader for the Bloc Quebecois, the government House
					 leader, the House leader of the New Democratic Party and the hon. member for
					 Fraser Valley for their contributions to the discussion. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As various members and many pundits have pointed out,
					 the situation facing us is, in many ways, unprecedented, and I would ask for
					 the House’s indulgence as I try to untangle the skeins of argument that have
					 been presented. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal first with the suggestion that this is
					 perhaps a matter better decided by the House than by the Speaker. In this
					 regard, members have referred to the 1963 ruling by Mr. Speaker MacNaughton
					 concerning the fragmentation of the Social Credit Party and the resulting
					 claims of the Raillement des créditistes. That ruling is of some assistance and
					 I will return to it later in my remarks but, like so many other references, it
					 is not entirely on point. In the almost four decades since that ruling, our
					 practice has evolved and I do not believe that it is inappropriate for the
					 Chair in the present case to consider the matters that have been laid before
					 it. Indeed, I believe that to do otherwise would be to shirk the Chair's
					 undoubted responsibility to protect the rights of all minorities in the House.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I find it difficult to understand why, if it was
					 appropriate for the New Democratic Party to argue for recognition before the
					 Speaker in 1994, it is inappropriate for the coalition to put its case to the
					 Speaker today. In my view the Speaker must rule on these matters as he did in
					 1994.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I draw to members’ attention the words of Mr. Speaker
					 Fraser, as reported in the <i>Debates</i> of September 24, 1990, on page
					 13216:</p>

						  members.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we consider the arguments for and against the
					 case for recognition presented by the hon. member for
					 Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough, let us set aside the many points raised during
					 the discussion that may be of peripheral interest but that are not
					 relevant--let alone illuminating--to the question to be decided. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, there were several references made to the
					 definition and recognition of political parties in statutes, notably the Canada
					 Elections Act and the Parliament of Canada Act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course it is a long held principle that the Speaker
					 does not interpret matters of law. Nonetheless, political parties are a
					 fundamental part of our electoral process and detailed requirements concerning
					 their registration are set out in part 18 of the Canada Elections Act. The hon.
					 House leader for the New Democratic Party said: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>I do not think the House of Commons
						  can be completely isolated from what takes place outside it and from the status
						  people enjoy outside the House.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be sure there are political parties outside the
					 House and there are recognized parties and caucuses inside the House and these
					 may be closely linked. In matters relating to the status or designation of
					 individuals or groups in the House, the House makes its own decisions without
					 necessarily limiting itself to standards and definitions used outside the House
					 of Commons. Definitions used in the House of Commons are not drawn from
					 statute; they are drawn from the practice of the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a general election, the statutory focus shifts
					 from the Canada Elections Act to the Parliament of Canada Act which later act,
					 for example, stipulates the composition and role of the Board of Internal
					 Economy. The bylaws of the board in turn govern the execution of those
					 statutory responsibilities through the administration of the House of Commons.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arguments advanced by hon. members referring to
					 either of these statutes to the bylaws of the board of internal economy or to
					 the board's responsibility for matters of finance and administration do not
					 concern us here. The hon. member for Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough has
					 rightly explained that he intends to raise these issues with the board in due
					 course, so these statutory and resourcing matters need not detain
					 us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Winnipeg--Transcona implied in
					 argument that recognition by the House involved an application of the rules
					 surrounding a marriage ceremony. The hon. member is an expert in holy matrimony
					 with wide experience in performing marriages. His comments were of great
					 assistance to a Speaker untutored in these matters. However, I would remind him
					 that even common law relationships sometimes attract a sort of legal
					 recognition. Society may recognize certain things. The House is another
					 matter.</p>

	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us turn to the crux of the problem, that is,
					 whether House of Commons procedure will permit the recognition of what the hon.
					 member for Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough has described as “the fourth largest
					 political entity” in the House, the PC/DR Coalition. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be helpful to return to first principles here,
					 because so many extraneous elements have been invoked on this question in the
					 widespread speculation that this controversial, highly publicized situation has
					 provoked. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us return to the opening of a parliament and the
					 convening of a newly elected House. Once a general election has been held and
					 the writs of election issued, attention turns from external political realities
					 to the internal realities of a new parliament. The political focus shifts from
					 the electors and the election to the elected MPs sitting in the House of
					 Commons and its committees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliberations in the Chamber and in committee are
					 governed by the standing orders and by House procedure and practice. In these
					 procedural authorities the terms “party” or “recognized party” refer to a group
					 of members with a number of identifying features: first, there are at least 12
					 members in the group; second, they appoint a slate of House officers as their
					 official spokespersons; third, they work as a cohesive unit; and fourth, they
					 serve under the same banner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a newly constituted House for the duration of a
					 parliament, each individual for whom a writ of election has been received will
					 work as an MP usually within a party. The machinery of the party caucus, that
					 is, its officers, staff and research bureau, will serve to organize each
					 party's work in the House and in committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of a parliament we have seen members
					 change parties, members suspended from caucus and members expelled from caucus.
					 Each member was elected to the House. Each member elected to the House may live
					 out the vicissitudes of that parliament as he or she sees fit. Indeed, each
					 member may self-designate his or her affiliations or lack thereof.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, a basic question is how a member will
					 be identified. It is an accepted part of our practice that individual members
					 and groups are permitted to select the manner in which they will be designated
					 for parliamentary purposes. As Mr. Speaker Fraser stated in the <i>Debates</i>
					 of December 13, 1990, on page 16705:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case before us we have 12 members of the
					 recognized Progressive Conservative Party and eight independent members who
					 comprise the Democratic Representative caucus, in total a group of 20 MPs who
					 have identified themselves to the Speaker as members of the Progressive
					 Conservative/Democratic Representative, or PC/DR, Coalition. This is the title
					 of the caucus under which they will henceforth be known.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition composed of these 20 members has further
					 announced that it will function as a group for parliamentary purposes and has
					 informed the Chair of its slate of officers. Here again these are matters that
					 the House has always left entirely to the discretion of MPs. They identify
					 themselves as individuals and are free to identify themselves as a group. Their
					 spokespersons are theirs to select. Neither the Speaker nor other members has a
					 say in such matters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I have concluded that the officers named by
					 the PC/DR Coalition will be recognized as the coalition's spokespersons in the
					 usual operations of the House and its committees. They are: the right hon.
					 member for Calgary Centre as leader; the hon. member for Fraser Valley as
					 deputy leader; the hon. member for Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough as House
					 leader; the hon. member for Prince George--Peace River as whip; and the hon.
					 member for Edmonton North as caucus chair.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as I must conclude that the coalition's officers
					 must be recognized, I can find no procedural objection to the request that
					 members who share the PC/DR designation and the leadership of these officers
					 should be seated together in the configuration that their whip may determine.
					 In my view this is not a matter where the Chair has any grounds to object or to
					 intervene.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However what I have granted to this point is not all of
					 what is being sought. On the basis that it possesses more than the basic 12
					 members required for status as a recognized party in the House, the coalition
					 seeks additional recognition. Specifically it argues that by virtue of its 20
					 member composition, the PC/DR Coalition should have precedence over the 13
					 member New Democratic Party. In other words, the coalition seeks to be
					 recognized as the fourth party in the House, or seen another way, as the third
					 party in opposition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is here that the Chair encounters considerable
					 difficulty. Earlier I listed what can be extrapolated as the hallmarks of a
					 party or a recognized party under our procedure and practice, namely at least
					 12 members with a set of House officers working as a cohesive unit, serving
					 under the same banner. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My problem is simple. By its very name the coalition
					 acknowledges that it is a composite entity. An analysis of the arguments finds
					 it successfully passes the first two tests set by our practice for any
					 recognized party, and to the extent that a single set of House officers are its
					 spokespersons, it can be said that it meets the third criterion of working as a
					 cohesive unit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the coalition has declined to present itself as a
					 party in this place. It may speak as a party does, It may operate as a party
					 does, but until such time as its members present themselves as a party, the
					 recognition the coalition seeks with regard to precedence and allocation of
					 time must remain at best a matter for negotiation between the coalition and the
					 four recognized parties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In discussing the process of debate, Marleau and
					 Montpetit states at page 506:</p>

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the allocation of precedence and time
					 during debate, during question period and statements by members, in the
					 distribution of allotted days and the composition of committees, the Speaker
					 receives the advice of the House leaders and whips who negotiate agreements on
					 these matters based on party strength in the House. Agreements reached through
					 the negotiations of House officers greatly facilitate the work of all members
					 here in the House and in committee and are of immeasurable value to the Chair
					 in its presiding role.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such negotiations to be genuine, all officers
					 concerned must be given an equal opportunity to participate. I am sure that the
					 hon. House leader and the other officers of the PC/DR Coalition seek no more
					 than this and I know they will be afforded the usual courtesies by their
					 counterparts. Only under the most extreme circumstances where the fundamental
					 rights of members were threatened would the Speaker feel compelled to intervene
					 in such matters. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind the House of the words of Mr. Speaker
					 Macnaughton in the Journals of September 30, 1963, at page 387:</p>

						  been prejudiced. Nor should the Speaker be put in a position where he must
						  decide, to the advantage or to the disadvantage of any group or party, matters
						  affecting the character or existence of a party, for this surely would signify
						  that the Speaker had taken what was almost a political decision--</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary then, after careful scrutiny of all our
					 precedents and of various analogous situations in the United Kingdom and in the
					 Commonwealth, the Chair has concluded that our practice has uniformly dealt not
					 with the recognition of groups but with that of parties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chair acknowledges and recognizes the PC/DR
					 Coalition as the regrouping of, on the one hand, a recognized party, and on the
					 other, a group of dissident members, together operating as a single caucus. The
					 officers of the coalition will therefore be recognized as the official
					 spokespersons for the coalition and the members of the coalition will be
					 permitted to sit together in any arrangement they wish. Since the Progressive
					 Conservatives retain their status as a recognized party, the PC/DR Coalition
					 will continue to enjoy the precedence afforded to the Progressive
					 Conservatives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Chair is unable at this time to grant full
					 party recognition to the PC/DR Coalition since I cannot extend recognition as a
					 party to a group which disavows that title and which is clearly an amalgam of a
					 party and a group of independent MPs.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If circumstances change, the Chair will of course be

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank hon. members for the contributions they made on

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this bill,
					 especially as the elected representative of a riding that has experienced
					 remarkable industrial growth over the last few years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, we have seen an increase in trade in recent
					 years. In this context, a review of our customs policies has become necessary.
					 Changes are required so that both people and goods can move more freely and
					 more rapidly at our borders. I will come back to the situation in my riding,
					 which has some concerns with regard to Bill S-23.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec, its government and the Bloc Quebecois are in
					 favour of the freer movement of goods and services between countries. We
					 supported NAFTA and we support the FTAA, as long as individual and cultural
					 rights are respected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Bill S-23 confers regulatory powers that we
					 think leave too much room for ministerial discretion. In fact, it seems to be
					 this government's way of doing things. There is the act, and then there are
					 regulations that are added later on, which makes it impossible to have an
					 overall picture of the act and its impact. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As legislators, we do not like giving so much power to
					 a minister. This situation raises questions on a number of points relating to
					 security. Customs clearance measures will in fact be defined by the minister's
					 regulatory powers in future regulations. Accordingly, we cannot know exactly
					 what the law will provide in this regard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree with the government's intent to modernize
					 customs procedures to promote and more importantly to facilitate trade.
					 However, there must be some balance between procedures and security. In this
					 regard, the events of September 11 in the United States gave rise to a
					 tightening of border control measures. In some instances, transportation
					 industry workers spent more time waiting at the borders than doing their
					 delivery.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-51312"></A><a HREF="#Int-51318"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-51303"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b>

	Trade between the States and Canada represents
						approximately $2 billion a day—about 100 million people cross the border
						annually—hence the importance of keeping our borders open and operating. Canada
						should also consider sharing customs controls with the United States. But as it
						stands, Bill S-23 does not allow us to accurately assess the balance between
						security and the modernization of procedures, because it leaves too much to the
						discretion of the minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-23 also provides for the establishment of two
						programs that will enable travellers to clear customs more quickly. Automated
						points will appear in airports and will help “approved” travellers pass quickly
						through the formalities of customs and immigration. Those who regularly cross
						the border, under expanded streamlined clearance programs, will be given the
						pass we know today as the Canpass.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is happening at a time when, at airports and
						border crossings, authorities have decided to increase staff for the single
						purpose of tightening control and safety measures. Right now, every vehicle
						that crosses the border is inspected. The director of the Canada project at the
						Center for Strategic and International Studies, Christopher Sands, recently
						told a journalist: </p>

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sad comment. Is it also the minister's
						intention to invest financially to improve the situation?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, I mentioned that I wanted to talk about my
						riding, because the two go together. Currently, people in my riding are very
						concerned about this bill, which would change customs services provided in my
						constituency and which would probably adversely affect these
						services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin with a brief description of the area.
						Drummondville is located at the intersection of highways 20 and 55, which
						provide direct and quick access to Montreal and Quebec City, major U.S.
						highways, local and international airports, seaports and ports along the
						seaway. Drummondville is itself a central location for towns such as
						Victoriaville, Granby, Sherbrooke, Richmond, Saint-Hyacinthe, Sorel,
						Trois-Rivières, Thetford Mines, and so on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rail transportation is well structured and operates
						with intermodal. Over 20 transportation businesses have their terminal in
						Drummondville or in the area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local industries serve a growing number of consumers
						in a radius of 100 kilometres. They include a significant number of importers
						and exporters. For example, out of 653 importers who cleared customs in
						Drummondville last year, 173 are locally based. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrative region of Centre-du-Québec
						includes a majority of small and medium size businesses that are not inclined
						to use the CADEX system. This means that they depend on manual ways of doing
						things and on the proximity of points of service.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already in a letter dated February 19, 1996, Deputy
						Minister Pierre Gravelle explained why it was beneficial to move to
						Drummondville services that had until then been provided in Victoriaville, this
						after a thorough review of the situation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three customs inspectors work full time at the office
						located in Drummondville, the only town in the region of Centre-du-Québec that
						provides customs services.</p>


	<A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1530)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes regular and fast-tracked customs
						release; the clearance of highway and rail freight; customs clearance at six
						sufferance warehouses; a highway sufferance warehouse; customs clearance for
						air passengers at the Drummondville and Victoriaville airports; service to the
						public; small craft licensing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a letter he wrote to me last year, the Minister of
						Revenue indicated as follows “Canada Customs and Revenue Agency operates on a
						risk management basis and would like to reallocate its resources from low risk
						customs offices to higher risk offices”. This means, to all intents and
						purposes, that we could cease having any customs inspectors in Drummondville,
						on the pretext that the security risk there is low.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this statement could perhaps be at least somewhat
						supported last year, it is at the very least highly debatable at the present
						time, for three reasons: the increased cross-border trade; the intensification
						of organized crime activities; the acts of terrorism in the United States, of
						which we are all aware.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the increase in trade, as everyone no
						doubt is aware, the Drummondville area is in such a rate of economic expansion
						that it is now considered the driver of Quebec's economy. International trade
						is on the upturn, particularly with the U.S. That is why we have two customs
						brokers in our area: Affiliated Customs Brokers and Fritz Starber
						Inc.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, we have two private schools giving courses
						on international trade: Ellis Business College and Abrimex. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of commercial customs releases is evidence
						of this. From a level of 12,965 in 1997-98, and of 14,179 in 1998-99, it has
						been constantly on the increase, despite new technologies and simplified
						procedures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that the opening up of markets and the
						free trade are going to accelerate this phenomenon. We cannot see how an
						increase in goods being shipped and of persons crossing the border can reduce
						the security risk.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the increase in crime. Initially,
						the RCMP considered shutting down its Drummondville detachment, but given the
						notable rise in crime and the recommendations of an internal working group, it
						has decided rather to maintain its existing services and even got, nationally,
						an additional $59 million “specifically to fight organized crime, terrorism,
						drug trafficking, smuggling and people smuggling.”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly recognizing the increased risk, the solicitor
						general indicated at the same time that he wanted the RCMP to be better
						prepared to fight organized crime and transborder threats to the safety and
						security of the population.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, we are having trouble understanding how Canada
						customs could conclude that the risks were low when the RCMP believes they have
						increased and has acted accordingly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragic events that have recently affected the
						U.S. have made us realize that we are not as safe as we thought we were and
						have led the U.S. to reconsider the superiority of high technology over human
						action, which is why we might be asked to review our procedures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, given the recent tragedies, I feel that
						things have changed and that the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, which
						focuses on risk management, should take that into consideration and avoid any
						hasty conclusion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the minister to consult with the people
						in my riding before making any changes to the customs services, as he promised
						to do in his letter dated May 5.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder what will happen if Bill S-23 is passed
						without our being aware of all the regulations, if the minister closes customs
						offices in a riding like Drummond, where we need these resources and these
						services because of an increase in both imports and exports, if, because of the
						whole issue of security, staff is reduced and employees are laid off.
						</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumour has it that it is senior officials or “small
						bosses” from the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency who want to repatriate the
						powers in their areas, including Cowansville and Granby.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People from Drummond are at the mercy of those who
						want to repatriate services closer to them, saying that, thanks to new
						technologies, all problems will be solved. We are worried. If the minister
						chooses to proceed in this fashion, there will be a public outcry and he will
						never hear the end of it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If his vision is to close offices where we need these
						resources to install more sophisticated systems at the border, maybe he should
						think about the terrorist attacks in the United States. They may have had all
						the new technologies and all the most sophisticated instruments, but they
						forgot about the importance of human resources in the field. If we forget that,
						our security may not be as stable and effective as we would like. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the objectives of the programs mentioned in
						Bill S-23 are good, there is still no provision for the security problems I
						mentioned earlier. Either security or savings will require compromise. The
						minister will have to tell us which approach he intends to choose and
						especially clarify S-23 in order to gain our support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two programs mentioned earlier, one of which is
						known as Canpass, will be established through regulatory means. It is as if we
						are being asked to sign a blank cheque. The underlying idea is a good one, but
						when it comes to applying and implementing the bill and the security aspect of
						it, the government seems to be saying “Trust me”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officials will submit regulations, and we will have
						to sign the blank cheque. I do not think it works that way. We, the legislators
						who represent our ridings, do not much like being asked to let things like
						“Trust us” pass. We are here to make laws. We are entitled to and we have a
						right to know what we are voting on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current context, the public has the right to
						know and to debate such essential issues as customs clearance. I want to know
						how it will work at customs. The people want to know too, and they are
						concerned. We do not want to reach the end of the process to hear “We will be
						identifying you by your iris, and you will have this and that”.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also includes people's private or personal

						what we want to know. It is not mentioned in the bill, which only says “at the

						this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs employees also have a right to know when and

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am sorry but I really did not understand
					 the hon. member's comment. I am sorry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, I would like to remind her that, in my riding,
					 the concern stems from the fact that when we talk about technological measures
					 and changes, we must really include procedures. It goes without saying that
					 changes are necessary. We must try to greatly enhance movement at our borders.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying earlier, there are trucks right now
					 that are spending more time clearing customs than it delivering their goods.
					 So, some changes are definitely required. But we really have to know what will
					 happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a bill that seems to reflect good intentions,
					 but there are no regulations. Everything is at the minister's discretion. In an
					 area like mine, where, for the past four years, there have been rumors that
					 customs services in Drummondville will close, this does not make sense.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should that become reality, there will be public outcry
					 because the whole riding of Drummond, which is made up of 22 municipalities, is
					 against the closing of the customs office in Drummondville. That office serves
					 region 17 in Quebec. We need it. It is not a big office, with only three
					 customs officers at the moment. But why close this border crossing and move it
					 to a non-neighbouring area where the situation is totally different from
					 ours?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why make such a decision? Human resources are being
					 replaced by technology at a time when we need even more customs officers. We
					 need people to ensure our safety. Right now, most Quebecers and Canadians are
					 worried. Now is not to time to circulate rumours to the effect that our customs
					 offices will be closed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the member's question, I can say that
					 people in my riding are worried because Bill S-23 wants to take away human
					 resources that are very important in light of the recent terrorist attacks in
					 the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is a lesson to be learned from that. Now
					 is not the time to remove people from the field. Yes, we do need new
					 technologies, but we also need to keep our customs officers and even to double
					 their numbers, because these people who work in the field know their
					 job.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member's presentation
					 and found the issue of open borders and trade to be a compelling argument.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any community actively dealing with its trading
					 partners in the United States should be very concerned over the issue of
					 security. The rumours the member heard about customs officers being pulled from
					 the port of entry would certainly affect her riding. Whatever province in
					 Canada we come from, close to 90% of our goods and services are tied to the
					 American market and security should be examined closely.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will ask a question I have asked several times in the
					 House and one which I have not received much of a reply. On the one side the
					 Customs Act wants to streamline legitimate cross border trade and travel by
					 using new technology, electronic monitoring, self-assessment and advanced
					 information for approval. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the coin there is something that I
					 believe needs to be addressed. I know there is an answer but I have not yet
					 heard anything from the government side nor from the opposition side. I refer
					 to the statement by the director of CSIS, Ward Elcock. He called Canada one of
					 the world's pre-eminent terrorist targets. He further elaborated by saying
					 “With perhaps the singular exception of the United States, there are more
					 international terrorist groups active here than in any other country in the
					 world”. I can see why, given our proximity to the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that security issue looming before us now, how can
					 we streamline things on one side and also provide security on the
					 other?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I truly respect the opinion of the member
					 of the official opposition. I do not have the answer to that question
					 either.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I am concerned, this has nothing to do with
					 Bill S-23. I know that security at our borders needs to be tightened up. People
					 close to me who have worked at crossing points in Quebec have often told me
					 that it is very hard to control everything and to ensure public safety without
					 the appropriate human and financial resources and the technology
					 required.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, what happened is very troubling. Given the
					 tragedies that occurred in the U.S., Customs and Excise needs to reconsider
					 things. The government has no other choice but to review all the services it
					 provides at crossing points in order to ensure better protection and avoid as
					 much as possible unlawful entry of persons in Canada, like traffickers who come
					 and go between Canada and the U.S.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's borders have often be called open sieves. It
					 is not the first we hear such a thing. We know how easy it is to falsify
					 Canadian passports. It looks like it is also very easy to come here and then
					 travel to the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to be very careful and very serious about this
					 issue. As I said earlier, this is not the time to lay off the officers who
					 ensure our safety, who see to it that travellers are well served, just because
					 of the emergence of new technologies. Technology will never replace people in
					 the field.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to Bill S-23, an act to
					 amend the Customs Act and to make related amendments to other acts. I will
					 speak specifically to the amendment proposed by the hon. member for
					 Edmonton--Strathcona.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I think about the bill I must reflect on what has
					 happened since September 11. I recently read a detailed schedule of what the
					 Prime Minister did immediately after the attacks of September 11. I do not
					 remember his exact words but the first thing he said was that nothing would be
					 the same and that everything had changed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However that is not true. Bill S-23 is still the same.
					 Nothing in the bill has changed despite the events of September 11. The
					 government has taken no initiative to change the bill to address all aspects of
					 terrorism in the wake of the attacks on New York and Washington. The timing of
					 the bill is wrong because it ignores the events of September 11. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in my party therefore agree with the amendment. The
					 bill should be pulled back, tabled, reviewed and rewritten to consider all the
					 other approaches that will need to be taken to deal with the new world we live
					 in. I think we all acknowledge that it is a new world and nothing will ever be
					 the same. We have heard those words many times in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-23 was written some time last year in a
					 completely different set of circumstances. It was passed by the Senate in the
					 spring and does not reflect the situation we find ourselves in now. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is contradictory to many of the things we are
					 now discussing such as increasing security and security perimeters. Bill S-23
					 would do the reverse of that in many ways. It would lean more on technology
					 than on the ability of people to determine when there are contraventions of the
					 Customs Act, falsified passports and so on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in our party think the bill should go back and be
					 completely reviewed over a period of time. We support the amendment for that
					 reason.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all facing new challenges which we did not face
					 a few weeks ago. As I mentioned earlier, the United States is committed to a
					 secure perimeter. Canada will either be inside the perimeter or outside it. The
					 United States is not speculating on the perimeter; it is saying it will have
					 it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we adjust our customs regulations
					 and customs act to recognize this. It will make a fundamental difference as to
					 whether we are inside the perimeter or out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many technical aspects of our relationship with the
					 United States will need to change. The U.S. wants us to review our extradition
					 laws. I am sure that is one of the subjects the Prime Minister discussed today
					 with the president of the United States. The U.S. is concerned about the long
					 process illegal immigrants must go through when they find themselves in Canada.
					 When the Liberal government takes exception to their presence it takes a long
					 time to address the issue. That will need to be dealt with.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people say the government did not react properly
					 in the first seven days after the attacks. My theory is that it has not reacted
					 well in the last seven years. It has cut back spending to intelligence agencies
					 and the military. It has had seven years of neglect on both counts. The
					 government is depending more and more on technology. This has proven to be poor
					 policy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous speaker talked about the possible closure
					 of a customs office in her riding. Two customs offices in my riding have been
					 closed. They had been there for 100 years and are now gone. They are not there
					 any more to perform the valuable service they used to provide. The government
					 is focusing on technology instead of on people to do the job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However many things will need to be dealt with in
					 addition to customs and immigration. There are things like air traffic safety
					 and aircraft regulations. An issue was raised in question period today about
					 cutlery on aircraft. Locking cockpit doors is an issue that will need to be
					 addressed. There was an immediate knee jerk reaction to this issue, a reaction
					 with which I agree. However cockpits must be protected from
					 encroachment.</p>


	<A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1600)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of air marshals, if the United States
					 is to have air marshals on its aircraft does that mean Air Canada must have air
					 marshals on its aircraft when they fly in the U.S.? Transponders were shut off
					 in the four hijackings that took place recently in the United States. Will
					 those regulations be changed? Will those airplanes be changed?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many questions must be dealt with in addition to and
					 including customs, airport security, access to luggage, access to airplanes,
					 the people who groom the airplanes and the people who deal with the freight
					 that goes on them. How will these be changed and adjusted? What legislation
					 will we bring to the table to address this new world? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the incredible circumstances experienced in
					 the United States it is wrong to try to put through obsolete legislation which
					 was written last year. I agree with the Prime Minister. Everything has changed,
					 especially in terms of security, immigration and customs. It is important that
					 we treat things differently than we did before September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard the amendment is the right way to go. We
					 must stop the bill, go back and review it in light of all the other changes
					 that must be made. It must be dealt with as a comprehensive package. It cannot
					 be dealt with as a single issue. We must deal with extradition, immigration,
					 border crossings, customs funding, intelligence funding, military funding,
					 extradition laws and a legal process for illegal immigrants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is obsolete and it would be wrong to pass it
					 under current circumstances. Our goal is certainly freer trade with the United
					 States. However if we do not build our new environment with respect to the
					 Americans and what they are doing, we may find ourselves with tougher trade
					 instead of freer trade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that impressed me was the ability of the
					 enemy we are now dealing with to fool intelligence agencies around the world.
					 It took years to put the attack together. They did it through several
					 countries. Some of the hijackers and terrorists lived in Canada, at least for
					 some time, and we missed them. They lived in the U.S. and they missed them.
					 They lived in many countries in Europe. They gathered together all kinds of
					 explosive materials, information and training through these countries and no
					 one caught on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an intelligent group of terrorists. We must
					 deal with that. We must be prepared for it. We cannot assume we will succeed
					 because we have technology, spy satellites and all kinds of communications
					 experts. That does not work. It does not count. We missed the boat. Our
					 intelligence services completely failed to detect that this incredible
					 terrorist act would take place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy is well prepared. It can take advantage of
					 our rules if we are not careful. We must adjust our rules and amend our laws to
					 prevent terrorists from contravening our systems and getting away with it.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is most impressive that it took so long to put the
					 attack together. It involved people crossing our borders into the United States
					 and people entering Canada and the U.S. from other countries. No one caught
					 them. Customs officers, intelligence agencies and the military failed to catch
					 them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will wind up by saying that we in my party support
					 the amendment. Amendments should be tabled to the Customs Act until a
					 comprehensive approach to the whole new world situation can be
					 established.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the emphasis of the hon. member's
					 presentation was somewhat different than that of many others who made their
					 presentations today, not so much on this side but certainly on the Liberal side
					 and among Bloc members.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member expressed concern about terrorism, organized
					 criminal activity and the like. That will certainly be a focal point. If anyone
					 in the House believes there will be a streamlining in the movement of goods and
					 people south of the border which does not answer the security issue, their
					 heads are buried in the sand.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that these two things are playing out right now
					 before us, the movement of goods will affect the economy one way or the other.
					 If goods are held up at the border and customers are lost our economy will be
					 hurt substantially. We have seen this happen over the last few days with the
					 slowdown at border crossings. It is making its impact on our economy and will
					 certainly do so with the Americans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of security has still not been addressed in
					 its total form. How does the member think we can have a streamlining of goods
					 and people across the border and still meet all the needs of
					 security?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question.
					 My feeling on this is and always has been that we should not just be doing what
					 the United States tells us to. We should be establishing our own rules in
					 consultation and collaboration with the U.S.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an obligation. We could be the next victim. We
					 are in effect a victim now. Everything we do has changed. The hon. member
					 mentioned lineups at the border. How about the 9,000 or 10,000 people who
					 landed in Halifax unexpectedly? How about disruptions to our transportation
					 system and all the changes we have had to make in security?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrorist attacks did not happen in Canada but they
					 affected us in a tangible way. Maybe the next act will be in Canada. We must be
					 philosophical about deciding what to do. The secure perimeter that the United
					 States will establish could include us. This would protect our relationship
					 with our biggest trading partner and allow for continued safe and secure
					 transportation of goods back and forth. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we establish rules that do not reflect the concerns
					 of our partners in the United States, the U.S. may establish borders that
					 prevent Canadian goods and services from going back and forth without a great
					 deal of inspection and examination. This would effectively eliminate our most
					 favoured nation status.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our overall approach must be comprehensive. We cannot
					 say we will deal with the customs aspect this way and the aircraft aspect that
					 way. It must be a comprehensive approach.</p>

					 in Canada must establish our own rules but they must fit with what the United
					 States is doing. We cannot let the United States tell us to do things, but we
					 can come up with approaches to the issues which satisfy their concerns and
					 allow us to maintain our sovereignty, our culture and our control over the
					 issues. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hon. member said, the U.S. has established a
					 homeland defence division and appointed a special secretary who answers
					 directly to the president. That is the level of priority the U.S. is putting on
					 security. If the Americans get a head start on us and start establishing rules
					 without our input we will be left in the dust and unable to reflect our
					 concerns. We will be in a very difficult position when we deal with the United
					 States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be in on this now. We should have our team in
					 place and be in consultation with the Americans at this moment.</p>

					 Fuca, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on Bill
					 S-23, particularly in view of the events of September 11. Those events have
					 changed the whole complexion upon which this debate has taken place and will
					 take place. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All members of the House have had an opportunity to
					 focus on many of the issues, which have been neglected for a long time, and how
					 we can ensure the security of Canadians at home and abroad. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is a balancing act. Basically, it is about
					 ensuring that we have rapid and easy movement of goods, services and people
					 across our border to the United States. At the same, it is about preventing
					 individuals and elements which are of risk to Canadians from crossing the
					 border. That is the challenge. The bill manages to address that to some
					 extent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic exchange between Canada and the United States
					 is $500 billion a year and 108 million people cross the border every year,
					 which is massive. However, the our current situation is less than
					 ideal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go into that, I would be remiss if I did not
					 make some comments on the events of September 11 and how they relate to our own
					 internal security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Osama bin Ladens of this world did not materialize
					 out of thin air. They are the sharp and extreme edge of some very real problems
					 that, to some extent, have been neglected by the world. Foreign policy
					 challenges have been perceived to have been dealt with in a fair and
					 even-handed fashion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People like Osama bin Laden and the individuals who
					 follow him see the sword as their only recourse, and there is no room for
					 negotiation. They decided to blow up the negotiating table rather than sit at
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those individuals who are filled with hatred, as is
					 this man, who are able and willing to twist a beautiful religion like Islam
					 into something it does not represent, have made a very clear decision and have
					 sent a very clear message to other countries that they are not willing to
					 engage in peaceful negotiations. Therefore, a multifactorial response,
					 including military, international financial institutions and other levers will
					 be required to stop these individuals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we take Mr. bin Laden out, no doubt he will be
					 replaced by others of his ilk. I believe a lot of people who follow individuals
					 like Osama bin Laden would be able to change if our foreign policy took a bit
					 of a different tact, along with foreign policies of other countries being
					 changed somewhat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a couple of issues that I would like to
					 address. Western countries have to at least be perceived as fair-minded in
					 their dealings with international problems, be it the Palestinian-Israeli
					 question, or Saudi Arabia, or Iraq or others. It must be perceived that we are
					 dealing with these issues and problems in a fair and even-handed
					 fashion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People like Osama bin Laden or those individuals who
					 were celebrating the mass murder of innocent civilians in the United States, as
					 we saw on television, use this type of manipulation. Curiously enough, a lot of
					 the information they receive is through a very thick sieve or a thick prism
					 which warped. Therefore, the information they are fed often bears absolutely no
					 resemblance to reality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard outrageous allegations against the west,
					 the Israelis and other Arab states from individuals who support the likes of
					 Osama bin Laden. They are a complete and utter fabrication. If we were
					 subjected to only those fabricated messages of hate which try to stimulate a
					 group of people to suggest that another group will kill or threaten them,
					 perhaps other people would respond in a similar fashion. I would hope
					 not.</p>


	<A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1615)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It leads us to believe and leads us to show that
					 communication and how communication is used is essential for those individuals
					 who try to stimulate people with that kind of hatred. Therefore within that is
					 an opportunity for west to try to get the message out to the people in the
					 Middle East that the west has been a friend to Muslims. The west tried to
					 defend Muslims in the former Yugoslavia. The west tried to help the Kurds in
					 northern Iraq who were being massacred by Saddam Hussein. The west tried to be
					 fair minded with respect to the Palestinian-Israeli situation. Canada has
					 supported a policy of an independent Palestinian state and an independent
					 Israeli state living side by side in peace. Canada has not tried to take sides
					 and we have tried to be even-handed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this message does not get out to the
					 shantytowns of the West Bank nor does not it get out to the types of
					 individuals who Osama bin Laden and people like him who they try to curry
					 favour. It does not get through to some people in Afghanistan. Therein lies the
					 challenge for us in the west.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to improve communication, improve connection
					 and improve discourse. We have to have a greater number of meetings between
					 people of different philosophical backgrounds. That is the only way we will be
					 able to achieve a measure of peace. By doing so, we will be able to remove some
					 of the supporters of terrorists like Osama bin Laden. It will not remove all of
					 them. As I said before, individuals filled with that kind of hate, who are
					 willing to completely warp and misrepresent a faith like Islam and who are
					 willing to lie to their people are individuals beyond the pale and stage of
					 negotiation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to our border security and our ability to
					 deal with this problem, this will require a multifactorial approach. This will
					 not only include foreign policy initiatives with our allies and the Americans
					 to root out individuals such as Mr. bin Laden, to root out his support and to
					 root out individuals who think it is acceptable to hide and coddle him, but we
					 will also have to go after the money, which is essential in trying to cut the
					 support to these individuals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can do that through the international financial
					 institutions. The IFIs and their countries, or the international family which
					 includes all of us, have to develop a comprehensive plan of action to find out
					 the economic resources and sources of money that support these terrorist
					 groups. Once we find them, we have to apprehend those funds. Cutting off the
					 money supply is one of the most effective ways to weaken these terrorist
					 organizations. It is absolutely essential.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues have repeatedly, in very eloquent
					 statements, brought out what has happened to our defence forces. The Prime
					 Minister has gone to the United States to speak with Mr. Bush, presumably to
					 articulate some of the things that Canada can do in this initiative against
					 terrorists. The Prime Minister knows full well that for over eight years he and
					 his government have gutted our military to appalling degrees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1994 white paper an obligation was made by the
					 government. It said it could put in the theatre in short order a battalion plus
					 a brigade or 6,000 plus people. According to our defence forces, it would take
					 a minimum of three months to introduce a brigade into the field. Furthermore,
					 we could not sustain that brigade for six months. That is a terrible
					 indictment, not on the men and women of our military who put their lives on the
					 line and who are working under extraordinarily difficult circumstances, but on
					 this government's willingness to gut our military.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to our navy, at this point in time we are
					 able to put one frigate in the theatre, in part because we have had a massive
					 loss and attrition of skilled individuals able to man our frigates.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, our ability to promote their strength has
					 been severely hampered by the fact that we do not have functional Sea Kings.
					 </p>


	<A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1620)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Sea Kings are more than 30 years old. Some are
					 dropping out of the sky. We do not have faith in functioning of those
					 helicopters, which severely compromises the ability of our forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to our land forces, the hardware such as
					 tanks, et cetera necessary to back them up is severely lacking. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to air, according to the 1994 white paper,
					 Canada was supposed to put a minimum of 24 to 48 fighters into the theatre, if
					 called upon. Can we do this? No, we cannot. Furthermore, the CF-18s we have are
					 becoming incompatible with their American counterparts because of the high tech
					 hardware that each of those planes requires. That means our CF-18s cannot nor
					 will they be likely to function appropriately, other than in a token fashion,
					 in any kind of required air effort. I wonder if the public is aware of what is
					 going on. Our military men and women know about this because they have been
					 labouring under it for a very long time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to look at our internal security
					 mechanisms. CSIS is the agency we rely upon for internal security, yet over the
					 last seven years its budget has been cut by at least 30%. Furthermore, it has
					 had a 28% cut in manpower, which has severely compromised our internal security
					 forces to engage in surveillance and apprehend, along with the RCMP,
					 individuals who are a threat to our security and international
					 security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentleman who used to work as a very high level
					 intelligence officer made the comment that Canada had become an aircraft
					 carrier jihad for those groups that were willing to engage in terrorist
					 activities abroad. This did not happen overnight. This happened over years
					 because terrorist organizations knew they could easily gain access into Canada.
					 Our ability to engage in surveillance has been severely compromised.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand the economic restrictions that the
					 government is under and we support balanced cuts. However, we do not support
					 activities and actions that compromise the security of Canadians at home and
					 abroad. As a party, we are asking the government to put money back into the
					 security elements that we desperately required yesterday, not two years from
					 now. We will continually ask for and demand this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that hardworking individuals in our immigration
					 services have been frustrated for a long time. Over the last few years, my
					 colleagues have repeatedly put out constructive suggestions to strengthen our
					 immigration so that true refugees can come into Canada under what we feel are
					 our humanitarian obligations. We have also asked that those individuals who are
					 a security risk and those refugees coming here under false pretenses be
					 prevented from entering into Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and time again we have demonstrated that the
					 government has failed to initiate in the House an effective immigration bill
					 that would allow us to accomplish those objectives. We have also asked the
					 minister of immigration why there is not proper surveillance of individuals,
					 who claim refugee status, once they come to Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other models in the world work better than ours.
					 Although Australia has its own difficulties, we can learn from some of its
					 lessons which will enable us to streamline our immigration
					 procedures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My private member's bill would put the onus of
					 identification, barring any extenuating circumstances, directly on the
					 shoulders of persons claiming refugee status. They would be required to prove
					 their identification as opposed to coming in claiming they did not have
					 identification. Ninety per cent of individuals who are false refugees come
					 through our borders by way of our airports. I do not know why we have not
					 introduced that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague made a very impressive comment in her
					 statement by members today requesting that Canadians have a photo
					 identification card, a universal card, that would allow us to be identified
					 from other individuals. </p>


	<A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1625)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our social insurance and health card numbers were on
					 that card it would go a long way to removing fraud which costs the health care
					 system and HRDC a lot of money. My colleague's suggestion is very intelligent
					 and easily managed, and one that the government could do almost overnight. This
					 would save tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars and add a very important
					 element of security into our system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another purpose of the bill is to reduce the amount of
					 illegal drugs coming into Canada. I was in Costa Rico and in Colombia earlier
					 this year meeting with President Pastrana. What we have in front of us right
					 now is a grand opportunity to address the trade in illegal drugs. What we can
					 do is as follows. First, we have to recognize that the war on drugs that we
					 have today is a failure. If we think we can go to Colombia and burn all the
					 coca and poppy crops that are growing there and somehow believe this will solve
					 the problem, it will not. Those crops will spread to Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru,
					 Venezuela and Brazil, which is what is happening now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is one thing the Taliban has done correctly
					 over the last few months it has been to burn its poppy crops. We know the
					 smuggling of heroin is still a serious problem in those countries but how do we
					 deal with it? We must accept the fact that trying to address this problem at
					 the production source will not win the so-called war against drugs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator McCain of the United States made a very
					 interesting comment when I was there. He said that we need to decrease
					 consumption in North America. He could not be more right. If we want to address
					 the war on drugs we must deal with it in our own house in Canada and indeed in
					 North America. We need to decrease consumption.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Europe has some exciting models that would work very
					 well. It has some new treatment modalities which look at addicts, not in a
					 punitive or criminal fashion but from a medical perspective. Some of those
					 models have a 60% one year success rate for the worst of the worst heroin
					 addicts, which is extraordinary. It works very well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada can use another avenue which has widespread
					 support but it requires some leadership. It is the introduction of
					 import-export permits for the precursor chemicals used in the manufacture of
					 cocaine and heroin.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago Canada's knuckles were wrapped
					 publicly and internationally, along with Norway and some other European
					 countries. The reason was very interesting. We, as countries, were wilfully and
					 knowingly selling the precursor chemicals required to produce cocaine and
					 heroin. We know we are selling these chemicals to individuals who are using
					 them to produce drugs but we say that it is not our problem. It is our problem
					 and we can do something about it. We can do something through the introduction
					 of import-export permits. In other words, a company would need an export permit
					 for the bulk export of these precursor chemicals and the recipient would need
					 an import permit. This would enable us to track and identify the individuals
					 producing these drugs. Then we could stop it. If they do not have the chemicals
					 to produce the cocaine and the heroin they cannot produce those drugs. We would
					 cut it off at our side, which is doable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing we can do is implement something called
					 the RICO amendments, the racketeering, investigation and criminal organization
					 amendments, that they have in the United States. This would enable us to go
					 after the money. It would enable us to go after those organizations that are
					 engaging in criminal activities. It would choke off the money supply for
					 them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, a number of elements need to be added to
					 the bill in terms of strengthening our borders. We need to strengthen our
					 defence forces, CSIS and our immigration borders. We also need to ensure that
					 our customs officers have the ability to apprehend from a criminal perspective,
					 not just be individuals who are trying to collect money for Revenue
					 Canada.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise to respond with care to the
					 comments of the hon. member for Esquimalt--Juan de Fuca. In the context of this
					 debate on customs legislation, he made some interesting points about the impact
					 of the tragic terrorist attacks on September 11 and how they might affect this
					 legislation and Canada's response to it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking at that response, I suggest there are two
					 fundamental elements that we have to address. One is the issue of
					 accountability and the other is the issue of prevention. In terms of
					 accountability, it needs to be done within the framework of international
					 co-operation; to hold the perpetrators of these terrorist acts to account, as
					 well as their accomplices and those who harbour them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of prevention, there are two aspects.
					 One is more effective surveillance combined with other security measures to
					 enhance public safety. Certainly we have to look very seriously at that. The
					 second is attention to the social, political and economic conditions that
					 promote or are conducive to terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be very clear. I am not speaking in any
					 manner to suggest that this in any way defends acts of terrorism. It is
					 precisely the opposite. If we want to understand and prevent terrorist attacks,
					 as I heard the hon. member say, it is essential to look at what breeds the
					 desperation, hopelessness and despair that ultimately drives people to suicide
					 bombings or to this terrible terrorist act of September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to take issue with the hon. member's reading of
					 history. He referred to the question of why it is that the Muslim community,
					 for example, in many cases, hates the United States, its foreign policy and
					 western foreign policy. He said that they should not do that because the west
					 has been supportive of them in a number of respects. I think we must be
					 cautious and accurate in our review of history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the member talks about the west's support for the
					 Kurds in northern Iraq, what about the Kurds in Turkey? When he talks about the
					 tragic situation in the Middle East and the Palestinians, surely he has to
					 recognize that the United States has been supporting the Israeli policy of
					 illegal settlements and occupation for far too long.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the member not recognize that is the tragic
					 history and not what he has recounted, as well as the impact of sanctions on
					 the people of Iraq?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, my friend from the NDP made a number of
					 points. However I do take issue with him that poverty is the root cause of why
					 Mr. bin Laden and his group engage in what they do. Mr. bin Laden is worth $300
					 million. If Mr. bin Laden is worth $300 million, it refutes the idea of poverty
					 being the root cause. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is talking about poverty as a root cause of this,
					 then presumably they would have numerous terrorists coming out of the Congo,
					 Liberia or Sierra Leone but that is not the case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree to some extent with the hon. member when he
					 says that there has been a perception on the part of individuals in certain
					 parts of the Middle East of an unfair application of foreign policy. To some
					 extent that is a failure of communication and we have not been able to get our
					 message out to the individuals concerned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, he is right when he says that we have turned a
					 blind eye to the illegal introduction of settlements in Palestine, which we do
					 not support in any way, shape or form and believe we should take a much
					 stronger stance on. However, the issue is much more complicated than
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Osama bin Ladens of this world are the sharp edge
					 of some very rare problems and we cannot negotiate with those individuals. Even
					 if the issue of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict were to be resolved, it would
					 not be enough because Osama bin Laden hates western culture. He perceives the
					 west as being a threat to the tenets of Islam. That is a central issue for
					 people of his ilk.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of economics, the member should know that
					 the leaders of the Taliban are quite affluent. While the Afghani people have
					 been suffering beyond comprehension for years and live in grinding poverty,
					 members of the Taliban have been lining their pockets with money from illegal
					 trucking in the southern part of Afghanistan and through the sale of illegal
					 drugs. That is how they are actually living. They drive around in Mercedes
					 Benzes while their people are starving to death. I would ask the member to
					 consider those points.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, as the member knows, I am the critic for
					 customs at the border crossings, and I have visited a number of these crossings
					 in the last little while. Every time we get ideas or solutions from the
					 grassroots level at the crossings for what they feel needs immediate attention,
					 such as the situation they are now facing, they are looked upon by the
					 government as simplistic. It is not a long term solution but there are
					 definitely some immediate needs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest the problem exists because it is an
					 operation that is run by Revenue Canada, which has very little knowledge of law
					 enforcement and the apprehension of these type of criminals. I believe these
					 should be shifted to law enforcement bureaucracies, such as the solicitor
					 general and justice. I wonder if the hon. member would comment on
					 that.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I wish to state that the prayers and
					 concerns from the people of Okanagan--Shuswap with regard to the September 11
					 terrorist activities in the United States have been overwhelming. Support in my
					 office has also been overwhelming. In regard to Bill S-23 and more important

						  bill fails to specifically and adequately address national security at Canada's
						  borders with respect to terrorist activities.</small></td>

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want everyone to be assured that I do not think there
					 is anyone in the House who is against streamlining the border if we
					 could.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill was drafted before the September 11 tragedy,
					 and I believe that it is outdated. The government's first and foremost priority
					 in any country has to be to the safety and well-being of its law-abiding
					 citizens. We have not achieved that goal since my coming to the House in
					 1993.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countermeasures against terrorist and gang related
					 activities were mentioned in the form of bills over the course of the past two
					 years. However time and again the government refused to act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not nice to talk about this in hindsight. If we
					 had enacted legislation that was put before the House when the concerns were
					 first raised, maybe we would not be trying to get the government to act on
					 legislation that all of North America is in very dire straits to have. The 2000
					 CSIS report states:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin Collacott, a former Canadian ambassador to Asia
					 and the Middle East, said that Americans had genuine concerns about the ease
					 with which international terrorists entered and remained in Canada with the
					 intent of mounting attacks on the U.S. He also said that Canada gave a low
					 priority to identifying, tracking and removing suspected terrorists.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travel and commerce across the U.S.-Canada border is
					 important to both countries. There is no doubt about that. No one wants to
					 disrupt these flows, yet a crackdown on terrorists will be meaningless without
					 a serious push in Canada toward greater security regarding immigrants and
					 refugees.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada shares vulnerability to terrorist infiltration.
					 All open societies pay a price for tolerance and civil liberties. According to
					 John Thompson, director of the Toronto Mackenzie Institute specializing in
					 organized crime and political instability, the thing that makes Canada
					 different from the British, French and Americans is that we tend to be more
					 politically immature. We have a political culture that does not go to war. We
					 have had a view since the 1930s that we are in a fireproof house. We are
					 supposed to be the international boy scouts who are trusted by all other
					 countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to say that it has coloured Canadian
					 attitudes toward security. He noted that until this week the largest terrorist
					 strike was the downing of the Air India jet in 1985 where more than 330 people
					 were killed. He goes on to say that the fundamentalists who drove a truckful of
					 explosives over the Washington border in 1990 was one such arrival.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Ressam arrived in Canada and was caught with a fake
					 French passport. He claimed refugee status and then renounced his claim. He had
					 a history of associations with terrorists and yet the government did nothing
					 about deporting him.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Collacott said the Ressam case brought out the fact
					 that terrorist suspects could enter the country easily and that there were
					 problems that were still not removed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do our brothers in the states have concerns about what
					 is going on in Canada? After reading these CSIS reports they certainly do. Not
					 only the Americans have concerns but people in Canada have the same concerns.
					 They want to know what the government will do to address the problems. It has
					 done nothing. Instead it has decided to study the issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorists do not study the issue; they act. While we
					 are in the House I guarantee that they are already making plans. The British
					 foreign secretary said:</p>

						  Council Resolution, have to be held to account and cannot any longer have the
						  kind of easy ride they have had in the past.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not agree more. If any country allows terrorist
					 organizations to raise funds to be taken out or used within that country and
					 use funds to make bombs and killing devices, that country has to be held
					 accountable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have overwhelming evidence, not only from CSIS but

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see I am out of time, although I have a lot more

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the debate on Bill S-23 has certainly been
					 very revealing in one sense. I know a lot of it has focused on the amendment
					 before us which would include the issue of terrorism in the bill that would
					 streamline the movement of people and goods across the border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I sat and listened to the comments of various
					 members in the House it became very noticeable that they are all free traders.
					 They want to see the movement of goods and services north and south in this
					 country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NAFTA , struck by governments previous to one that
					 sits in the House today, has become so essential to our economy, to our
					 well-being, to who we are not only as Canadians but as people who share the
					 North American continent, that we do not want to see any hindrance to the flow
					 of goods and services within the North American continent. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is very important to note because with that there
					 will be a will to make sure that does not happen, that goods, services and
					 people will not be hindered in their movement north and south.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect I recall campaign promises in the past to
					 bury such things as NAFTA and any free trade rules or agreements. The reality
					 is that now we have such agreements which are so essential to our well-being
					 and we want to protect them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have certainly brought forward the one question that
					 has been asked not just by myself but by other members of the House. How can we
					 have streamlined, legitimate, cross-border trade and travel almost unhindered
					 and still deal with the issue that has been brought before us by the amendment
					 from this side of the House concerning the security of our combined
					 countries?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will repeat again the words of Director Ward Elcock
					 who in 1998 called Canada one of the world's pre-eminent terrorist targets. He
					 elaborated by saying that with perhaps the singular exception of the United
					 States there are more international terrorist groups active here than in any
					 other country in the world. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is quite a statement to make. Apart from the
					 United States, we have more terrorist groups and cells working here than in any
					 other country in the world. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he were the only one who said that, maybe we could
					 say the statement was taken out of context or that it was slightly exaggerated.
					 However he was not the only one who said it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999 after a special Senate committee on security
					 and intelligence reviewed the issue of terrorist groups, the CSIS chief of
					 strategic planning, David Harris, referred to Canada as a big jihad aircraft
					 carrier for launching strikes against the United States. We had two individuals
					 saying that very same thing in slightly different words.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can remember coming into the House for the first time
					 in 1994 and listening to the then solicitor general who now sits in the House
					 as Deputy Prime Minister. </p>


	<A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1655)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said at that time that serious concerns had been
					 passed on to him by CSIS about the instability which could result from groups
					 that were actively involved in this country, that if they were to rise up they
					 could destabilize the country. That is quite a broad statement to make, that
					 they could actually destabilize the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the issue which is before the government and
					 every member of the House. We want the movement of goods and services to flow
					 along so that our economies and our businesses do well. At the same time we
					 want to provide security that will please not only our neighbours, because they
					 are the ones that can take action against the movement of goods and services,
					 but we also have to consider and please the citizens of our country. That is
					 the issue at hand here on everything we say and do from this point forward. On
					 every piece of legislation, whether it is through Revenue Canada and customs,
					 whether it is through transport or even our security agencies, that is the
					 question that will have to be answered. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we do it? Some time ago, prior to the Reform
					 Party coming into parliament, a previous government tried to address that
					 issue. Just before that party was voted out of power, it did come forward with
					 a similar kind of concern and tried to address it as a government.
					 Unfortunately those efforts were all cast aside when the Liberal government
					 took over in 1993.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion there is only one way to address the
					 issue of having a security network set up that would please the citizens of
					 Canada and our American counterparts and also achieve the goal of almost
					 unhindered cross-border trade. Until that issue is addressed, I do not think we
					 will see unhindered movement of people and trade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must harmonize our policies with the United States
					 and consider it in the same way that the NATO alliance works, that a strike
					 against any one member of the alliance is a strike against all members; a
					 strike against any one is a strike against all. In other words we should have a
					 policy that is in harmony with our neighbours to the south. If they are
					 concerned about security in a certain way, we should be just as concerned about
					 it. We must harmonize our policies so that we have a security network. Two
					 years ago at a united alternative meeting I suggested that we have a security
					 network that falls under one ministry. A new ministry should be created that
					 will look after the security network. I can give ample reasons for us to do
					 that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I have discovered through the nine years I
					 have been in parliament and being part of the different committees that
					 examined the groups, agencies and enforcement areas is that they are all
					 working independently of one another. Often information is not being shared.
					 Their enforcement areas are all treated independently by the
					 government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some groups should be bolstered up and lifted and
					 resourced properly. Unfortunately the government takes the opposite point of
					 view and they fall flat and later are disbanded or quietly removed from the
					 scene. That is one area we should work on as a government, not only the
					 government side, but the opposition side as well.</p>

					 Hills—Grasslands, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, we are here today to address Bill S-23.
					 This is a bill to facilitate trade between the United States and Canada. I will
					 spend a few minutes talking about trade in agriculture since that is one of the
					 areas I have an interest in. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade in agriculture, exports and imports between the
					 United States and Canada, runs into the billions of dollars. For example, we
					 export billions of dollars per year in grain and oilseed foodstuffs alone. We
					 import almost $300 million in bulk grain alone from the United States. We
					 export $1.3 billion worth of livestock and import more than $150 million in
					 just live animals from the United States. We export more than $600 million
					 worth of pork products and import $100 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past we have had conflicts on our border
					 regarding agricultural issues and products. The cattle industry has been
					 affected a couple of times by R-CALF, an organization in the United States that
					 has come forward to try to challenge the import and export of animals to the
					 United States. Durum wheat has been challenged often by senators along the
					 border states, particularly along the border of North Dakota and Manitoba. We
					 see recurring problems with softwood lumber across Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of us who live on this side of the border, it
					 is necessary for the border to be open. Not only is it necessary for us but for
					 the people of the United States as well, because we are their biggest trading
					 partner taking a full 25% of their exports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The border serves several functions. My riding is
					 located right along the Montana border and it has always been an area of
					 interest to the locals. Many of the people who have settled in our area came
					 from Minnesota. They came from Scandinavian countries, moved through Minnesota,
					 came up through Montana and settled right along the border. The early pioneers
					 were used to going back and forth across that border. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grandfather talked about unloading a three wheel
					 tractor in Chinook, Montana and trying to bring it across the prairie. As they
					 drove it north they tipped it twice and had to go to one of their U.S.
					 neighbours to get a horse to pull the tractor back onto its wheels. Building
					 supplies were often shipped into small Montana towns such as Turner, Harlem,
					 Chinook and then the products were brought up to Canada. The border was also an
					 interesting place to be during the prohibition era. There were a lot of
					 products brought back and forth that often were not approved by customs.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have friends on both sides of the border. When I was
					 growing up I would travel to the United States regularly. The border was open.
					 Often it seemed that we had more connections north and south than we did east
					 and west. Lately traffic to the U.S. from our area has been curtailed since our
					 dollar has fallen to the level it has. Many of the people in our area have quit
					 spending as much money as they used to in the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have programs in our area such as Canpass. We
					 have been talking about setting up electronic crossings. Those programs I
					 understand are now under review.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to have trade with our biggest trading partner.
					 Because of terrorism and the brutal treatment of innocent people which has
					 taken place, the border has changed. It has changed the ability of people and
					 goods to move back and forth across the border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to spend a couple of minutes talking about the
					 type of border crossings. I ask members present, what would it be like to be a
					 customs agent at an isolated border crossing in the conditions that we have
					 now? What would it be like for a customs agent to be overseen by an agency that
					 has a lack of direction toward its employees? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure if members are aware, but it took two
					 days for the agency to let the local customs agents know that they were
					 supposed to fly the flags at half-mast, but they had already done it. They were
					 given directions to search all vehicles but were given no directions about what
					 they were searching for. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we heard earlier today, employees have also been
					 told that they should not be speaking to MPs, particularly opposition MPs. What
					 would it be like to be an employee in an isolated area and feel there is no
					 recourse to bring out concerns? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would it be like to work in an isolated area and
					 know there is a lack of protection? The RCMP in many of these areas are miles
					 and miles away. They can be from 15 to 70 miles away from a border crossing.
					 </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our area alone, the RCMP officers themselves have to
					 cover huge areas. There is one officer on duty and that is it for an area that
					 covers approximately 2,000 to 2,500 square miles. The officer's job is to cover
					 that area as well as the border crossings. I do not think it is realistic to
					 expect that person to do that job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have to ask what it would be like to be at an
					 isolated crossing with improper training and equipment. I understand at the
					 larger crossings agents are being trained in the use of batons and pepper spray
					 but that training will not be given to the agents at the smaller crossings.
					 Where else would it be needed? At the large crossings there are a dozen agents
					 on duty and there are people to back them up. At the small crossings this
					 protection is required.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question that also arises is whether or not agents
					 should have sidearms. We have heard today that we need to take this agency out
					 of the revenue collection business. It is not just a revenue collecting group.
					 This group is expected to provide law enforcement. These people need to have
					 protection. On the American side of the border there are agents with sidearms,
					 agents with fully automatic weapons, agents with bulletproof vests on the backs
					 of which the word “police” is spelled out in six-inch letters. On our side, the
					 agents finally do have bulletproof vests but there is nothing to indicate that
					 people should stop or respect them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have actually been accused of trying to make
					 political points on this, but it is important. For almost 10 years, first the
					 Reform Party and then the Alliance party tried to talk to the government about
					 the need for reform of Canada's criminal justice system, the immigration system
					 and the border crossing system. The government has chosen not to listen and in
					 some ways those chickens are now coming home to roost.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem is the lack of proper allocation of
					 funding. The government is only too willing to overtax people and to take 50%
					 of their income. It tries to restrict businesses through its taxation policies.
					 It is committed to regional economic development programs that often do nothing
					 but waste money. There are entrenched attitudes in the bureaucracy. There is an
					 improper allocation of resources and because of that people who are on the
					 ground cannot do an adequate job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the structure of a pyramid, it works far
					 better if the base of the pyramid is sitting on the ground. Looking at a
					 business model, businesses want to have most of their people on the ground
					 doing the work and fewer people involved in the decision making and those kinds
					 of things. The bureaucracy at Canada customs seems to be almost the opposite.
					 The people at the bottom are trying to do their jobs, to provide law
					 enforcement and collect revenue. They are being run by bureaucrats and are
					 given their instructions from above and the instructions often have very little
					 to do with their jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has a porous border and we need to do something
					 about it. Government needs to show leadership in this area. Canada has a poor
					 immigration set-up. We need to do something to get those people who
					 consistently break our laws and who think they can stay in Canada out of our
					 country so they are not a danger to our citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we need trade. It is obvious to all of
					 us that we need to have trade. We also need a reasonably secure border. The
					 time for playing around, studying and consulting is over. The government has
					 been in power long enough that it should be able to bring in policy that is
					 effective. We need to deal with the lack of direction, protection and proper
					 allocation. We have the time and the opportunity now. Let us not throw that
					 away.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I rise today to partake in this debate
					 on Bill S-23, an act to amend the Customs Act and to make related amendments to
					 other acts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill proposes to streamline legitimate cross border
					 trade and travel through electronic monitoring, self-assessment, advance
					 information and pre-approval.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As already pointed out today, the official opposition
					 hesitantly supports Bill S-23 but does so reluctantly given the government's
					 poor record in maintaining the integrity of our borders, particularly the long,
					 mostly unprotected border we share with our neighbours to the south.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is a trade dependent country and as such the
					 economic viability and stability of manufacturing companies operating within
					 Canada rely on the ease with which goods flow between Canada and the United
					 States. A threat to the openness we enjoy along the Canada-U.S. border is a
					 threat to the billions of dollars of trade and the tens of thousands of jobs we
					 appreciate and have here in Canada. Over 87% of our trade is done with our
					 neighbours to the south, the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This weekend the governor of the Bank of Canada warned
					 that the fallout from terrorist attacks on the United States may push our
					 weakened economy into a recession. David Dodge warned the government against
					 trying to bail out the economy with additional spending or being foolhardy and
					 going back to deficit financing, which Minister of Finance Paul Martin has
					 indicated he may have to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Dodge stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--economic growth in the third quarter will likely be close to
						  zero or slightly negative, and we will continue to feel the adverse effects
						  into the fourth quarter.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the governor of the Bank of Canada said
					 that it is certainly possible that the economy will slip into a recession,
					 which as we all know and has been discussed here lately is commonly defined as
					 two quarters of negative growth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week the Minister of Finance said that he will not
					 rule out a deficit if it protects Canada from terrorism. Claiming that the
					 number one priority for the government is to protect Canadians, the finance
					 minister says there will have to be additional spending in terms of our
					 national security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official opposition fully supports increased
					 spending for our security and for our intelligence agencies. We have pointed
					 out numerous times in the House, and not just in the wake of the horrific
					 events of September 11, that CSIS and the RCMP are underfunded and
					 underresourced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, we would counter that we do not need
					 to be plunged back into a deficit situation if the finance minister and his
					 government would simply prioritize spending, something that should have been
					 done years ago. It is time to put to an end the frivolous spending on such
					 things as fountains and golf courses and reallocate our scarce dollars to
					 support the front lines of defence, CSIS, the RCMP and national defence. These
					 three have been financially starved for far too long.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated earlier today, we cannot consider liberalized
					 border procedures without first considering how to best restore the integrity
					 of our borders. A company based right here in Ottawa is developing a passenger
					 screening system that it says could have foiled last week's terrorist attacks.
					 The system developed for the transport department by the Ottawa branch of a
					 United States based corporation, Intrinsix Corporation, combines video cameras,
					 reservation computers, metal detectors and x-ray machines to help identify
					 potential terrorists. The company says that its system, which works by
					 networking all of those elements together, would have triggered security alerts
					 when hijackers boarded four flights in the United States last week.</p>


	<A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1715)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In last week's Ottawa <i>Citizen</i>, Claude Clouthier,
					 manager of the Intrinsix Ottawa office, said that the strength of the airport
					 security data fusion system is that it displays all the information on one
					 computer screen. Mr. Clouthier reported to the Ottawa <i>Citizen</i> that
					 Transport Canada was funding development of the system through an agreement
					 with the United States to create new anti-terrorism technology but that the
					 project had apparently been stalled over cost concerns. “Cost is always the
					 issue, because it is a very complex problem”, said Mr. Clouthier. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would agree with Mr. Clouthier. When we deal with
					 national security or when we deal with CSIS and RCMP, funding and resourcing is
					 a problem with the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Intrinsix manager said that he
					 believes Transport Canada has a renewed interest in the project since the
					 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and at the Pentagon on September
					 11. Intrinsix received a $140,000 contract in February 1999 to develop a
					 working prototype of the system. The Intrinsix preliminary report on the system
					 recommends that Transport Canada install video surveillance cameras at check-in
					 counters and boarding gates. The report noted that the lack of integration of
					 security machines makes it difficult to track a passenger's bags through an
					 airport without sending a security guard to make a physical check.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolutely appalling that a system such as this
					 one developed by this Ottawa based company has not been used in Canadian
					 airports and that only now, after the attack on America, has our government
					 decided that perhaps it should bring forward some precautionary
					 measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government's failure to continue funding
					 for such systems is indicative of its relaxed attitude toward security in
					 Canada. Unfortunately we have a government that is reactive, not proactive,
					 regarding the security and the safety of our citizens. It is for this reason
					 that we are reluctant to support a liberalization of our border controls. We
					 are also reluctant to entertain loosening border controls due to the large
					 volume of illegal migrants currently crossing our border so freely, illegals
					 who may ultimately provide a stream of terrorists gaining entry into the United
					 States by circumventing Canadian and United States border controls since we
					 have no exit controls.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No exit controls, as I pointed out in April of this
					 year, mean that it is impossible to calculate how many people remain in Canada
					 illegally, how many have slipped into the United States or how many have
					 returned to their countries of origin or have gone elsewhere.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of October 23, 1998, there were 6,110 warrants for
					 removal issued against persons deemed to have abandoned or withdrawn their
					 refugee claims. Of these, 640 warrants were executed and the persons were
					 removed from Canada; 240 warrants were cancelled, that is, they were no longer
					 deemed refugees so they were cancelled; and there was no action taken on the
					 remaining 5,272.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six thousand, one hundred and ten applications and five
					 thousand, two hundred and seventy-two warrants still sit in a dusty, dingy
					 corner somewhere because we do not have the resourcing to deal with those
					 warrants, or the backbone. Quite obviously this is a very serious problem that
					 must immediately be rectified to restore our border integrity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than nine million commercial shipments enter
					 Canada each year, 75% at land border ports and the rest at international
					 airports, marine ports, postal facilities and bonded warehouses. Approximately
					 one million marine containers enter Canadian ports annually and another 200,000
					 enter by truck or rail after being off-loaded in United States marine
					 ports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that most illicit drugs
					 arrive in Canada by aircraft, marine container and truck. At least 100 tonnes
					 of hashish, 15 to 24 tonnes of cocaine and 4 tonnes of liquid hashish are
					 smuggled into Canada each year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need to point out that drugs are
					 synonymous with organized crime. Drugs and organized crime are very relevant
					 when we refer to the fundraising of terrorist organizations.</p>


	<A NAME="T1720"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1720)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Ottawa <i>Citizen</i> article dated March 3, 1999,
					 under the title “RCMP battles to halt flow of Colombian drugs”, states that
					 Canada is particularly vulnerable to drug trafficking, the principal source of
					 revenue for most crime groups. According to the drug analysis section of the
					 RCMP, smugglers are attracted to Canada because of the low risk of arrest due
					 to limited police resources that “have stymied investigations”: </p>

						  Canadian coastline, the low risk of arrest and the relatively light
						  penalties--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore reiterate that we support measures aimed at
					 liberalizing trade but we do so only as we ensure that all necessary measures
					 are in place to effectively control organizations and terrorists and those who
					 support them. </p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, on behalf of the citizens of Surrey
					 Central I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill S-23, an act to amend
					 the Customs Act and to make related amendments to other acts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Surrey Central live in very close
					 proximity to the U.S. border and they travel to the U.S. Many transport
					 merchandise in trucks while others go for pleasure. Bill S-23 has a direct
					 impact on their businesses as well as on their lifestyle.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 85% of our GDP comes from exports to the U.S. and
					 our bilateral trade is over one and a quarter billion dollars per day. More
					 than 108 million people cross the border between our two countries. Security is
					 of paramount importance due to the situation that unfolded on September 11.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a past member of the subcommittee on organized crime
					 I know the kind of stuff which is not only scary but also very challenging. At
					 one time only four RCMP officers patrolled the entire B.C. border with the U.S.
					 Bill S-23 becomes particularly important but nothing has changed in Bill S-23
					 since September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time members of the Canadian Alliance
					 pointed out the deficiencies in government policies. One would think that with
					 this momentous event the government would wake up. It only shows that the weak
					 Liberal government does not have the political will to be proactive and improve
					 the border security in the best interest of the people of Canada as well as of
					 America.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting a knee-jerk reaction. However the
					 overall approach of the government has been a culture of neglect. There has
					 been neglect on the budget, health care, defence, agriculture, foreign policy,
					 safety and security, anti-terrorism legislation, et cetera.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-23 does not take into account the events of
					 September 11 which have fundamentally changed the landscape of our customs
					 policy and border security. We need legislation that recognizes that fact.
					 Instead of recognizing that and amending the bill, the government pushes ahead
					 as if nothing happened. This approach will not do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Edmonton--Strathcona proposed an
					 amendment to the bill that would block second reading. Bill S-23 amends the
					 Customs Act and other acts to allow for preapproval of people and goods for low
					 risk Canada-U.S. travellers. The bill speeds up the flow of low risk traffic
					 across the border. It focuses the limited resources of the CCRA on traffic of
					 higher or unknown risk. How would the government make that
					 distinction?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem with the bill is that it focuses on
					 risk management. In the case of CSIS, risk management was just a code word for
					 making do with less, of policing on a shoestring budget, and thus risking the
					 lives of Canadians in the process. Let us call it what it is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more problems however. I express serious
					 doubts about the intent of the bill. It highlights the don't worry, be happy
					 approach of the government. Furthermore, if the government refuses to support
					 the amendment, it would be a blatant reminder of the arrogance of the
					 government.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We face a unique problem in Canada. If we fail our
					 brother and pass a bill flawed in its intent, we risk the economic benefits the
					 bill is supposed to protect. Bill S-23 as it stands now would result in a
					 backlash against Canada. Our exports could be affected with negative
					 repercussions that could jeopardize the goodwill between our two
					 nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambassador Cellucci of the United States has said that
					 Canada and the U.S. need to harmonize their immigration policies. Legislation
					 coming out of the House needs to reflect that intent. The U.S., in answer to
					 our reluctance to deal with the security issue, may apply the dreaded section
					 110 of its immigration laws, resulting in long lineups at the border and
					 further problems for Canadians, low risk or otherwise, trying to enter the U.S.
					 Section 110 would create chaos at the border if implemented.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security issue will be dealt with, if not on our
					 terms then on American terms. Either we deal with it here or the U.S. congress
					 will do it for us, and we should not blame it for that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free trade was supposed to bring the best of both
					 worlds by being free and fair. It was supposed to bring access to more goods
					 and services as well as increased economic integration with our friends to the
					 south, but it will be threatened if we fail to balance it against the safety of
					 Canadians and Americans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic benefits are vital but we must not lose sight
					 of our long term relations and security interests. We have an opportunity
					 before us today to turn the clock back in some small way to ensure that the
					 laws we implement deal with today's realities which have changed our world
					 dramatically. Any failure to do so would bring us blame for generations to
					 come.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief target for terrorist acts lives next door to
					 us. Canada could be a target one day. The Americans are our major trading
					 partners and the source of most foreign direct investment in Canada as well as
					 the biggest destination of investment by Canadians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weak and arrogant Liberal government that lacks
					 vision is clueless. This means that Canadians would pay a terrible price of job
					 losses, border delays, plant closures and forgone economic activity until
					 Ottawa cleans up its act. Now is the time to do that job.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill S-23 on
					 behalf of my constituents of Saanich--Gulf Islands. The bill is a very
					 important one considering the events of September 11. When the bill was first
					 introduced it was brought in so we could streamline legitimate people
					 travelling across our border between Canada and the United States and allow
					 pre-approval mechanisms for the transfer of goods between Canada and the United
					 States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today $500 billion of trade travels across our border
					 each year. It is important for the economies of both countries that this
					 continues to happen in a very timely manner. There is merit to the bill.
					 However, as we have witnessed in the last few weeks, it is also important to
					 ensure that the perimeter of our two countries is absolutely secure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is designed to help streamline this process so
					 that energies can be funnelled on the people of concern. We have an opportunity
					 to strengthen the bill. It should go back for more amendments so that the
					 technologies available to us today can have a much greater control of what is
					 actually moving across our border, both in people and commodities. This would
					 allow for the movement of legitimate travellers but with a much higher security
					 level. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be looking at strengthening our security
					 approaches. Immigration policies in this country must be generous but they must
					 be very stringent as well. When we screen people who are coming into our
					 country we should ensure the safety of all Canadians and all landed immigrants
					 who come before them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a serious problem not just in our country but
					 in many of our allied countries such as Great Britain, France and the United
					 States. They are not immune and neither are we. We have faced horrific events
					 in the last few weeks. I am sure every member in the House recognizes that
					 there are terrorists in Canada as well as our allied countries who want to
					 commit these horrific acts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time to look at a bill like this one that wants
					 to streamline the process and make it very rigorous so that the screening
					 process applies to all people going across the border. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That does not mean we have to slow it down. With
					 technologies and preapproved processors there are all kinds of opportunities.
					 However we want to make sure that we know who is going across our border in
					 both directions, that we can instantly track suspected people, people with
					 criminal records and a history of concern, people who have tried to come into
					 our country with any type of false passport or any type of irregularity. All
					 that information would flash up immediately.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thing would apply to people who move
					 commodities across our borders. If there were any irregularities or dealings
					 that were of concern they would be flashed immediately. The men and women of
					 the CCRA who are manning our borders should be given the proper tools to do
					 their job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue that the standards are not there and it
					 is time to change that now. I am not criticizing our own country but our allied
					 countries as well who are facing this very serious problem. On September 11
					 these people took control of four planes and there were others that tried to do
					 so as well. It is very clear that we should be investing in a North American
					 perimeter and that we make provisions against something this well organized
					 that can slip through the system so easily.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a bill which was brought before the Senate long
					 before September 11. Its intent was to streamline and make things go smoother,
					 to arguably pre-approve people and use the technologies available. However, we
					 have an opportunity now to send it back and say that we have a serious problem
					 in this country. We should be sitting down with our American friends discussing
					 how we combat this problem on a North American-wide system and how we bring in
					 systems where all the data is exchanged.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue that needs to be a priority. It is my
					 understanding that the government has not done this. I have some concerns with
					 that. We should be looking at that right now and bringing these screening
					 measures into place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a purely economic standpoint, there is the whole
					 question of security, which is paramount to the safety of our families, our
					 homes, our ridings and the safety of Canadians. That is absolutely reason
					 enough. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important, when we have trade of $500
					 billion a year between Canada and the United States or half a trillion dollars,
					 that we have systems in place to allow trade to move through. Obviously the

					 at our borders. There have to be systems in place to move these goods freely
					 but in a very safe manner ensuring that the information is there and there is

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an opportunity to revisit this and bring in

					 Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada,
					 Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to address the House on
					 third reading of Bill C-6, an act to amend the International Boundary Waters
					 Treaty Act. I would like to thank the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and
					 International Trade for the careful consideration given to Bill C-6.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past four decades every Canadian government,
					 whatever its political stripe, has declared opposition to bulk water removal
					 projects. This has responded to concerns expressed by Canadians that all levels
					 of government should take action to assure the long term security and integrity
					 of Canada's freshwater resources. However, there has never been any legislation
					 to back up that policy. Today we have an opportunity to correct that
					 situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to describe briefly the main features of
					 Bill C-6 and then address a few broad questions which have been raised during
					 committee stage of the bill. The amendments have three elements: a prohibition
					 provision; a licensing regime; and sanctions and penalties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prohibition provision imposes a prohibition on the
					 bulk removal of boundary waters out of their water basins. While the scope is
					 narrow because Canada's jurisdiction in this field is also narrow, the impact
					 is significant. The prohibition covers the Great Lakes, the largest system of
					 fresh surface water in the world. Many of the bulk water removal projects over
					 the past few decades, up to and including the Nova project of May 1998, have
					 included Great Lakes water.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During committee hearings, one witness urged members to
					 reject completely Bill C-6 because it would prohibit a project still on the
					 drawing board for redirecting freshwater in Northern Ontario to Lake Superior
					 and from there to other parts of Canada and the United States. Stopping this
					 type of project in boundary waters is exactly the objective of Bill
					 C-6.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By adopting this bill, the House will send a clear and
					 unequivocal signal to anyone thinking of developing these schemes; it is
					 prohibited under federal law. It will also send a strong and welcome signal to
					 Canadians that our water is not for sale.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A licensing regime will cover projects in Canada, such
					 as dams or other obstructions, in boundary and transboundary waters. Under
					 existing provisions of the treaty, these types of projects must have the
					 approval of the Government of Canada and the international joint commission,
					 the IJC.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 92 years there have been about 60 such
					 projects approved without any problems. In essence, this process is not
					 changing except that for the Government of Canada's approval it will be
					 formalized in a licence. I would also like to stress that the licensing regime
					 is entirely separate from the prohibition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question has been raised whether the licensing
					 regime permits the approval of bulk water removal projects outside of water
					 basins, in effect going around the prohibition. The answer is no.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language of Bill C-6 is absolutely clear on this
					 matter. Any proposal for diversion of boundary waters outside of the basin
					 would be captured by the prohibition provision, not covered by the licensing
					 regime. The prohibition in Bill C-6 excludes bulk removals out of water basins
					 from the licensing regime expressly and imposes a prohibition on such projects
					 binding on the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Bill C-6 provides for clear and strong
					 sanctions and penalties. This will give teeth to the prohibition and ensure
					 Canada is in a position to enforce it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to address three broad issues that have
					 been raised regarding Bill C-6 and Canada's strategy on bulk water
					 removal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, is the scope of Bill C-6. Second, is why not an
					 export ban on water? Third, is working with the U.S. to protect the Great
					 Lakes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the scope of Bill C-6, we have never
					 claimed that it is the single answer to cover all of Canada's waters. At the
					 outset, we recognized that to completely protect our freshwater resources from
					 bulk removals, all levels of government had to act within their jurisdictions.
					 This recognizes the important role that provinces must play as the owners of
					 natural resources.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999 the Minister of the Environment proposed action
					 by all levels of government in Canada to prohibit bulk water removal out of
					 major Canadian water basins. We have made significant progress. In May 1998
					 only two of fourteen federal, provincial and territorial jurisdictions in
					 Canada had legislation to prohibit bulk water removal. Today all fourteen have
					 put into place or are developing legislation and policies to prohibit bulk
					 water removal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the action of the provinces,
					 complemented by our action today, will set up a strong legislative framework to
					 protect Canada's freshwater resources. That is the goal we must all work
					 toward.</p>


	<A NAME="T1740"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1740)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have advocated federal unilateral action
					 through an export ban on water. Such an approach is wrong. It is unrealistic,
					 especially in the federal-provincial context. It would be ineffective. Worse,
					 it would actually undermine the goal we all share.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Canada's approach, which is focused on
					 comprehensive environmental objectives in a manner that is trade consistent, an
					 export ban does not address the environmental dimension. It also has possible
					 constitutional limitations, and may be vulnerable to trade challenge. An export
					 ban would only regulate the cross-border movement of water once it has become a
					 good and would therefore be subject to international trade agreements. It would
					 likely be contrary to Canada's international trade obligations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Canada's environmental approach, water is
					 protected and regulated in its natural state, before the issue of exporting
					 arises and before it becomes a commercial good or a saleable commodity. This
					 approach is consistent with Canada's international trade
					 obligations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian governments have full sovereignty over the
					 management of water in its natural state, and in exercising this sovereignty
					 are not constrained by trade agreements, including the NAFTA.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it is self-evident that we must work closely
					 with U.S. jurisdictions, both federal and state, to ensure that the regimes on
					 both sides of the border are as consistent and restrictive as
					 possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada and the U.S. agreed on a reference to the
					 International Joint Commission to investigate and make recommendations on
					 consumptive uses, diversions and removals in the Great Lakes. The IJC in its
					 February 2000 final report made recommendations which provide the basis for
					 developing a consistent approach to protecting the Great Lakes on both sides of
					 the border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight Great Lake states are opposed to large scale
					 removals out of the water basin. Also, each governor of the Great Lakes states
					 has a congressionally affirmed power to veto any new diversions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in the years ahead the boundary waters treaty
					 will remain a critical instrument in protecting Canada's rights, as it has for
					 more than 90 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By adopting Bill C-6, parliament will set down in law
					 an unambiguous prohibition on bulk water removal in waters under federal
					 jurisdiction, especially in the Great Lakes. This is a forward looking action
					 which places the highest priority on ensuring the security of Canada's
					 freshwater resources. It demonstrates leadership at the federal level. It
					 affirms an approach which is comprehensive, environmentally sound, respectful
					 of constitutional responsibilities and consistent with Canada's international
					 trade obligations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge all members to support Bill C-6.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to be able to join in
					 this debate today on a subject very dear to myself and certainly to most
					 Canadians because of recent events that have affected a great number of
					 Canadians, that is, the matter of water and the protection of our water
					 resources. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly the bill is supportable and our party intends
					 to support it, but it is really unfortunate that this is the best we could do.
					 The bill comes forward to amend a law in Canada that has been on the books
					 since 1909, I believe. It really does not address the real issues surrounding
					 water that Canadians are so concerned about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill comes forward as a result, I think, of a
					 dismal failure on the part of the Mulroney government of some years ago to
					 protect the sovereignty of Canadian water in the Canada-U.S. free trade
					 agreement. I remember that there was a lot of discussion at the time and a lot
					 of concerns were expressed by Canadians. In fact, a part of the negotiations
					 that was so important to Canada was the protection of water. There was a lot of
					 rhetoric flying back and forth as to whether or not water in fact was included
					 in the free trade agreement. It has certainly since been concluded that it is
					 not exempted from the free trade agreement and that in fact Canada has a real
					 problem with the protection of its sovereignty over water resources.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all remember very clearly, during the federal
					 election campaign of 1993, the current Prime Minister's pledge to open up the
					 free trade agreement with the U.S. to include water in one of the articles as
					 being exempted from the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement. Of course that did
					 not happen and I think most clear thinking Canadians knew it would not happen,
					 that it was not possible to make it happen without opening up the agreement and
					 addressing a number of issues that the U.S. government was willing to look at
					 and wanted included. I think probably one of those issues that is very dear to
					 Ontario and Quebec is the issue of supply managed industries that receive
					 protection under the free trade agreement. As a result we really did not get
					 any of the protection we were looking for. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1993, of course, there has been a lot of
					 attention paid to water and its protection, not only protection from export and
					 interbasin transfer but certainly protection from pollution, as well as the
					 safety of water for human consumption. More than ever Canadians and people all
					 around the world now are beginning to recognize the value of their water
					 resources. Water is a primary ingredient for life on this planet and while
					 years ago we did not give a lot of thought to it in Canada because we had such
					 an abundance of it and it was so pristine, we never gave a lot of thought to
					 the need for protection of our water supply. The events in Walkerton that
					 resulted in a number of people losing their lives and many more people being
					 very ill because of a pollutant in a water supply, and then again events this
					 last summer in North Battleford, have brought home in a real way how precious
					 our water resources are and how we Canadians must move to protect them in any
					 way possible.</p>


	<A NAME="T1750"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1750"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1750)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a youngster growing up in rural northern Alberta and
					 northern Ontario, I found that it was not uncommon when we were camping or
					 engaging in business in remote and wild parts of the country to simply access
					 without any treatment whatsoever the water supply available to us for drinking,
					 cooking and bathing. For thousands of years Canada's aboriginal people accessed
					 the water supply in Canada on just such a basis, never giving much thought to
					 whether that water was safe to drink or safe to cook with. That certainly is no
					 longer the case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not matter whether we are in the densely
					 populated regions of Ontario or in the wilds of the Canadian Arctic, it can no
					 longer be taken for granted that we can kneel down and drink the water that is
					 before us. That water could make us sick or perhaps even kill us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has come to the forefront of everyone's thinking
					 that we need to do something to protect our water. The bill, minimal as it is,
					 certainly is at least an attempt to do something to protect at least waters
					 under federal jurisdiction, the boundary waters over which we have shared
					 jurisdiction with the U.S. government. It is a small step in the right
					 direction but we need much more. We need to go much further. In essence we need
					 to protect the sovereignty of Canada's water. I do not mean simply banning
					 these grandiose schemes to export Canada's water to other countries or other
					 basins.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada we have a huge supply of fresh water. I
					 believe we have something like 9% of the world supply of fresh water. We should
					 have every right to use that water and those water resources for the benefit of
					 Canadians. I firmly believe that those water resources will become even more
					 valuable than the natural energy resources that Canada is currently and has for
					 a long time been developing. This freshwater resource has the potential to be
					 one of the most valuable resources in the world. I think we must have the right
					 as a country to manage those resources, firstly for the benefit of Canadians.
					 Under the free trade agreement with the United States, if we try to use those
					 water resources for the benefit of Canadians immediately we are open to legal
					 action for not allowing equal access to those water resources to
					 Americans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the failure of the past two governments to
					 address this issue, we already have hugely costly legal action filed against
					 Canada under the free trade agreement resulting from a scheme to move glacier
					 water from British Columbia to the United States. Those schemes will continue
					 to come forward. The bill only addresses any such schemes that would take place
					 within the boundary waters of shared jurisdiction, but there is a lot more
					 water out there than those boundary waters and it does need that
					 protection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summer I travelled through southern Alberta,
					 southern Saskatchewan and across the northwest regions of the United States,
					 all of which are suffering from a severe drought that has been happening in
					 those regions over the past year or two. It becomes more and more evident how
					 valuable that water resource is. Those parts of southern Alberta and
					 Saskatchewan and the northwestern United States simply are turning into
					 deserts. Very little is growing. These huge areas that once were such valuable
					 food producing regions are severely restricted because of the lack of water to
					 grow crops.</p>


	<A NAME="T1755"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1755)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly if one travels through those areas that have
					 access to irrigation supplies and can actually put water on the land the
					 difference is absolutely amazing. It is like an oasis in the middle of the
					 desert. Those areas are producing huge crops with great economic benefits for
					 the regions and the people involved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect this will continue to be the case or will
					 even get worse, to the point where the United States will look northward with
					 an eye to accessing our freshwater supplies to help produce the food the people
					 of their country need. Before that happens I believe that we as a country and a
					 government have a responsibility to be prepared and have in place regulations
					 and laws that will in fact allow Canadians, first and foremost, to benefit from
					 those water resources. Only afterward, if we as a country so decide, should we
					 benefit from the wealth that we might obtain by sharing that resource with
					 areas that need it to produce food.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That may not happen in my lifetime or for a long time,
					 but at some point, if water continues to become scarcer in northern California
					 and throughout the northwest and midwest U.S., it is inevitable that people
					 will realize the potential to be gained from the use of our water resources,
					 huge amounts of which flow every year into the Arctic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean,
					 Hudson's Bay or the Atlantic Ocean. At some point, I believe, we will look at
					 what benefit could be gained from the development of that flow of water and
					 from directing that water resource to areas of the world that desperately need
					 fresh water to feed their populations. Again, I certainly think we have to be
					 prepared to do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, as I said, the bill amends a treaty
					 signed between Canada and the United States back in 1909 and is simply a feeble
					 attempt to address the concerns of Canadians about water and the NAFTA
					 agreement and how it affects us. As long as we in Canada can prevent water from
					 being traded, either interprovincially or internationally, then the concern
					 over how it is treated under NAFTA is not an issue. However, the minute we
					 allow water to become a commodity it becomes part of the NAFTA agreement and we
					 then have no right under that agreement to restrict the use or the development
					 of that water to Canadians only. We will have to open it up, certainly to the
					 U.S. as well, but the provisions in the bill for licensing and the penalties
					 that would be imposed for breaches of this particular law should be adequate
					 and should do the job. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been in the House for some nine years now.
					 Again, like almost every bill that has come through the House, the bill vests
					 more authority in the governor in council, the Prime Minister and his cabinet
					 to govern and to change laws through regulation rather than bring the issues
					 back to the House to let Canada's parliament debate them and vote on the
					 amendments. That is the wrong way to go. I believe that for the sake of
					 spreading knowledge and gaining the support of Canadians these issues should be
					 dealt with by parliament. That is what our job is and that is what we should be
					 doing.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disappointed this is the best the government could

					 been done a long time ago. The government should be pressing much harder
					 through the international trade minister, the foreign affairs minister and the
					 natural resources minister to address issues not addressed in the bill such as
					 water other than boundary water. However we in the Canadian Alliance will
					 support the bill when it comes time for the vote. I move:</p>

	Madam Speaker, I am particularly pleased to speak to
					 Bill C-6, an act to amend the International Boundary Waters Treaty
					 Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not be telling those listening anything new if I
					 say that water, like air, is a vital and essential element which we should in
					 no way compromise. Water is such an essential element that having too little is
					 as bad as having too much. When there is none, things dry up, and when there is
					 too much, things drown. A balance must therefore be maintained, both in
					 quantity and in quality. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to back up a bit and talk about when I was
					 a municipal councillor in Sherbrooke for 12 years. During that time, I had the
					 pleasure of chairing the CHARMES management corporation. This was a corporation
					 that looked after the Saint-François and Magog rivers in Sherbrooke. I was
					 therefore quite quickly introduced to the concept of a water basin involving a
					 good many people. Everything that comes from upstream and everything we send
					 downstream has repercussions everywhere. I quickly understood that we were
					 responsible for the quality of the water that flowed past us downstream, just
					 as we had rights with respect to the water that flowed to us from upstream.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when I was about ten years old swimming in
					 the Saint-François river under the supervision of the recreation committee and
					 the water was of impeccable quality. When I began working with the CHARMES
					 management corporation, we could not really swim in the Magog river. It was
					 necessary to take specific action to improve the quality of that river's
					 water.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 12 years, therefore, the importance of water in
					 terms of both quantity and quality was brought home to me. In Sherbrooke, I was
					 also responsible for water and water treatment services. To all intents and
					 purposes, the municipality of Sherbrooke supplied water to approximately
					 130,000 people—even though the city had only 78,000 inhabitants. The amount of
					 water we drew from a reservoir, Lake Memphrémagog, 27 kilometres from
					 Sherbrooke, was considerable: approximately 60,000 cubic metres daily, or 21.9
					 million cubic metres a year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that this water is used by industry, by
					 institutions and by municipalities, either for domestic or for sanitary
					 services. When it comes to the importance of water, what is surprising is that
					 life—we all know that the human body is almost 92% water—</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Except if one weighs 300
					 pounds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Serge Cardin: </b>No, it is not important, it is
					 relative. If one weighs 300 pounds, it is 92%; if one weighs 100 pounds, this
					 should be about the same, unless the person is drying up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the water that we use directly, that we
					 drink, this would represent, according to analyses, less than 1% of the water
					 required for domestic and hygienic uses. We see then that the water we use,
					 whether in the industrial or the institutional sector, and for all the other
					 domestic uses, including washing clothes and dishes, cooking, using the toilet,
					 showering, bathing, there is less than 1% left for drinking. There are also
					 exterior uses, that is, for watering the grass and the garden, washing the car
					 and cleaning the yard. It is often in domestic uses that people are being asked
					 to be careful about the amount of water they use.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it is always people who are being asked to make
					 some efforts, but it is rarely industries, institutions, and probably even less
					 people who would think about selling water. We know this could be quite a
					 lucrative business. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, concerning water treatment, we get water
					 for free. Of course, infrastructures have been built; 27 kilometres of pipes
					 represent major infrastructures. There is no value to add at this stage, but
					 there is a treatment cost of about 30 cents per cubic meter. So I figure that
					 some people would be tempted to sell bulk water.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still in my introduction, I would also just like to
					 inform members of the House about a small example of an environmental disaster,
					 of a troubling situation in the Aral Sea, and I quote:</p>

</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Not
						  long ago, governments were still boasting about the new irrigated lands
						  recovered from the desert and the steppes, forgetting that the water used had
						  come from the Aral Sea and its two sources. Today, the entire area around the
						  Aral Sea has been affected by this ecological disaster. Between 1911 and 1962,
						  the depth of the Aral Sea was 53.4 metres. The water volume was 1,064 cubic
						  kilometres and the sea's surface 66,000 square kilometres. At that time, the
						  sea played a central role for transportation, industry and fishing, and also
						  regulated the climate.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 1994, the water depth dropped to the 32.5 metre
					 level, from 53.4 to 32.5. Its volume was less than 400 cubic kilometres—as
					 opposed to 1,064 it had dropped to 400—while the surface had been reduced to
					 32,500 square kilometres—a drop from 66,000 to 32,500. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a true ecological disaster. Judging by the
					 great thirst some in North America have for the water of Quebec, the water of
					 Canada, the water of the Great Lakes, there is a potential risk of ecological
					 disaster here as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know—despite the rain outside at the present
					 time—we tend to think of the water levels in lakes and rivers staying the same.
					 This is absolutely wrong. The levels of the seas are rising, constantly, while
					 the levels of lakes and rivers is dropping, and rapidly at that. This is not
					 even taking into account all the analyses that could be done on water tables
					 and the impacts of industry and agriculture, and particularly of high
					 population densities in a given area, requiring heavy demands for water to be
					 met. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is runoff water. When a drop takes I do not know
					 how long to reach a river after falling on earth, it is purified, contributes
					 to the water table and goes down the river. It could take a fairly long time.
					 Now, a drop falls on the sidewalk, on the ashphalt and reaches the river in a
					 few minutes or hours.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sort of introduction, to describe my
					 involvement in matters involving water.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us move on now to setting the context of this whole
					 issue of water and the treaties on boundary waters.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, water is a limited resource, despite
					 what we might think. For example, the report prepared by the International
					 Joint Commission in 1999 provided that:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Although the total volume in the
						  lakes is vast, on average less than 1 percent of the waters of the Great Lakes
						  is renewed annually by precipitation, surface water runoff, and inflow from
						  groundwater sources. Under the circumstances, we must recognize that, while the
						  Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River system represents one fifth of the earth's
						  fresh water, this resource is not unlimited.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Furthermore, in recent years,
						  discoveries and research on the greenhouse effect and the potential risks of
						  increased temperatures have made underscored the great fragility of the
						  resource and the pressure it is under. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of climactic risks, increased desertification
					 worldwide, limited supplies of drinking water around the world and energy
					 development based on this resource, the idea of exporting large quantities of
					 water on tanker ships or of diverting rivers has emerged as a serious option in
					 the past ten years or so in Quebec and Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to environmental threats to water supplies is added
					 a new and significant threat of bulk water exports and large scale diversion of
					 our lakes and rivers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that bulk water exports offer
					 significant economic possibilities. It is because of this potential that some
					 provinces have examined the possibility of issuing to companies permits
					 allowing them to consider bulk water exports. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early eighties, following a drought in
					 California, British Columbia delivered such permits to five Canadian and one
					 American companies. However, over the years, the province changed its position
					 and, concerned about the possible impact of such trade on B.C.'s natural
					 resources, it decided to prohibit bulk water exports through provincial
					 legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the possibility of issuing similar permits
					 was examined by other provinces. The case of Newfoundland recently made
					 headlines. The province quickly gave up the idea, but the possibility remains.
					 This, combined with the recent lawsuit by the California-based company Sun Belt
					 Water against the government of British Columbia, raises concerns and brings
					 back the issue of trade risks associated with exporting this
					 resource.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the federal government has been
					 promising to legislate for the past year. But what about the federal strategy
					 so far?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government announced in early 2000 that it
					 intended to act more directly in the matter of water export and introduced a
					 three pronged strategy. That strategy follows from a motion on water protection
					 passed by the House of Commons on February 9, 1999. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three parts to the strategy: first, changes
					 to the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act in order to give the federal
					 government regulatory power over the bulk removal of boundary waters; second, a
					 joint reference, with the United States and the IJC, to investigate the effects
					 of consumption, diversion and removal of water, including for export purposes,
					 in boundary waters; and third, a proposal to develop, in co-operation with the
					 provinces and territories, a Canada-wide accord on bulk water removal so as to
					 protect Canadian water basins.</p>


	<A NAME="T1820"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1820"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1820)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 10, 1999, Canada and the United States
					 appointed the IJC. After noting a growing number of proposals to export water
					 from the Great Lakes and other areas of the United States and Canada, the two
					 countries agreed to ask the commission to study the issue and make
					 recommendations within the next year. A preliminary report was tabled on August
					 18, 1999 and the final report of the IJC was tabled on February 22,
					 2000.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its preliminary report, the International Joint
					 Commission recommended that during the next six months it would need to
					 complete its study, the federal, provincial and state governments prohibit bulk
					 removal or sale of water. It emphasized a number of points worth mentioning
					 here. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it indicates that there is no surplus in the
					 Great Lakes system and that bulk removal of water could reduce the system's
					 resiliency, or resistance to stress. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, information on removal of underground water is
					 definitely inadequate. There is a problem here, because underground water can
					 have a major impact on the integrity and quality of ecosystems. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report also points out that it is impossible to
					 forecast the demand for water. Moreover, the possibility of climate change and,
					 more recently, all sorts of natural factors make it impossible to evaluate with
					 any degree of certainty the level and rate of flow of the Great Lakes over the
					 next few years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its final report entitled “Protection of Waters of
					 the Great Lakes” of February 2000, the IJC concluded that the Great Lakes
					 needed to be protected, especially in view of cumulative uncertainties,
					 pressures and repercussions of removals, of consumption and of demographic and
					 economic growth, as well as of climate change.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report includes the following conclusions: first,
					 the water of the Great Lakes is a critical resource. On an average annual
					 basis, less than 1% of the water in the Great Lakes system is
					 renewed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, if all interests in the basin are considered,
					 there is never a surplus of water in the Great Lakes system; every drop of
					 water has several potential uses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, International trade law obligations, including
					 the provisions of the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, WTO
					 agreements, and the GATT, do not prevent Canada and the United States from
					 taking measures to protect their water resources and preserve the integrity of
					 the Great Lakes Basin ecosystem, to the extent that decision makers do not
					 discriminate against individuals from other countries in implementing these
					 measures. Canada and the United States cannot be forced by trade laws to
					 jeopardize the waters of the Great Lakes' ecosystem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us have a look at Bill C-6 and examine the context
					 briefly. This bill is the direct result of the strategy the federal government
					 made public in February 1999. It concerns its will to regulate the removal of
					 water in boundary waters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government says that the intent of this
					 bill is to facilitate the implementation of the boundary waters treaty, a
					 treaty that also deals with other issues arising along the border between
					 Canada and the United States. Thus, the amendments prohibit water removal and
					 the transfer of boundary waters out of their watershed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, under the proposed amendments, activities
					 affecting the flow and the natural level of water on the American side of the
					 border would depend on the delivery of a license by the foreign affairs
					 department.</p>


	<A NAME="T1825"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1825"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1825)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the federal government suggests adding sections 10
					 through 26 to the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 11 and 12 deal with the licences required when
					 boundary waters are used, obstructed or diverted in a manner that affects the
					 natural level or flow of the waters. These two sections specify that such
					 licences do not apply in respect of the ordinary use of waters for domestic or
					 sanitary purposes. The licensing allocation plan would not apply either to the
					 traditional uses, like the removal for agricultural or industrial uses within
					 the basin. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, no person could, except in accordance
					 with a licence issued under section 16, construct or maintain any remedial or
					 protective work or any dam or other obstruction in waters flowing from boundary
					 waters, or in downstream waters of rivers flowing across the international
					 boundary, the effect of which is or is likely to raise in any way the natural
					 level of waters on the other side of the international boundary. This provision
					 would not apply in respect of the exceptions specified in the
					 regulations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 13 prohibits any bulk removal of boundary
					 waters from the water basins. The general provisions of this bill specify that
					 sections 11 to 13 do not apply to projects undertaken before the coming into
					 force of these sections, unless the effects are still perceived after their
					 coming into force. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 16 through 20 set out the minister's powers and
					 provide an overview of his ability to issue and revoke permits and to charge
					 penalties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 states that the minister may, with the
					 approval of the governor in council, enter into an agreement or arrangement
					 with the government of one or more provinces respecting the activities referred
					 to in sections 11 to 13, although not specifying what such an agreement would
					 be. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 addresses the regulations under the act which
					 would guide the minister's decisions. Among other things, it states that the
					 minister could, with the approval of the governor in council, make regulations
					 defining water basins, specifying exceptions, and unlike the old bill C-15, the
					 government can identify exceptions from clause 13(1), which is the heart of the
					 bill, prescribe classes of licences and determine persons eligible to hold such
					 licences, and the form such applications and licences must take. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the issues involved in Bill C-6?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the entire population acknowledges that water
					 resources need to be protected, it is far from obvious that Bill C-6 will
					 actually protect them any better. In fact, one would be justified to wonder
					 whether the Liberal government is not taking advantage of the panic situation
					 about protecting our waters to grab powers that are outside its
					 jurisdiction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three major problems that must be raised in
					 connection with the bill we are looking at today. The first relates to the
					 definition of water basin. The second concerns the number of powers assigned to
					 the federal minister in connection with exceptions and with licensing
					 activities. The third relates to the pointlessness of the bill we are looking
					 at.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these three, Bill C-6 goes beyond federal
					 areas of jurisdiction and encroaches on provincial jurisdictions, including
					 those of Quebec, of course.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much time do I have remaining, Madam
					 Speaker?</p>

					 bill under study.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In revealing these three well defined points, it will

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am rising today in the House to ask
					 the Minister of Transport about the serious state of highway 7 which extends
					 southwest from Ottawa and cuts through my riding of Lanark--Carleton.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highway 7 is the most direct route between Ottawa and
					 Toronto. As such it is an important commuting, trucking and bus route. It has
					 the potential to be used more than it currently is although the highway is
					 quite overloaded.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ottawa area has experienced an economic boom in
					 recent years. Businesses and commuters have started to spread beyond Kanata and
					 into the towns of Carleton Place and Perth. This movement of people and capital
					 has served to increase traffic and trucking volume on highway 7 which is
					 becoming an increasingly important artery.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor of Carleton Place, Brian Costello, has been
					 very vocal in calling for a widening of the roadway into a four lane divided
					 highway. MPP Norm Sterling, who is my counterpart at Queen's Park, has
					 signalled that the highway is a top priority for the provincial government.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of all the residents in my riding I thank
					 both those gentlemen for their hard work. However the people of
					 Lanark--Carleton need to see results. There have yet to be any funds allocated
					 or a completion date set.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I last stood in the House and spoke to the issue on two
					 occasions in April and May of this year. I asked for a serious federal
					 commitment to infrastructure spending so that long overdue projects like the
					 widening of highway 7 could go forth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I addressed the issue in April I spoke of safety
					 as a primary concern. I said at the time that highway 7 had seen 11 fatal
					 accidents in Lanark--Carleton in the past few years. Since I made those remarks
					 the same stretch of highway has seen three additional deaths over the summer as
					 well as a series of serious injuries related to traffic accidents. This is not
					 just a question of commuting and commerce. It is a question of life and
					 death.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The province of Ontario has earmarked $70 million for
					 infrastructure improvements in the Ottawa area. What has the federal government
					 done?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. federal government collects $25 billion in gas
					 tax revenues and spends $21 billion of it on roads and highways. Eighty-four
					 per cent of the revenue is dedicated to road and highway improvement. What
					 about Canada?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian federal gasoline taxes have increased by more
					 than 500% between 1985 and the present, from 1.5 cents per litre to 10 cents
					 per litre. The tax was originally intended to be a direct source of revenue for
					 highway improvements. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over $4.7 billion was collected in federal taxes last
					 year. Yet only 4% of the funds were returned to the provinces by way of
					 provincial transfers for road and highway development. The dollar figure was in
					 the area of a mere $190 million. As though that were not bad enough, 96% of
					 this pittance was spent east of the Ontario-Quebec border. That means that
					 Ontario, by far the largest source of highway improvement taxes, is getting
					 virtually nothing for its highway needs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal transfers for highways continue to drop in
					 dollar value while gas tax revenues, ostensibly highway improvement revenues,
					 go up by hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully realize that the federal government has many
					 competing demands on the treasury. However this is an issue of fundamental
					 importance to economic expansion, prosperity and human safety. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister of Transport tell us what is
					 happening to the $4.7 billion in highway improvement taxes? How many more
					 people must die before the federal government uses the money for the purpose
					 for which it is being raised: to expand and improve the safety of our

					 Secretary to the Minister of Transport, Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, allow me to pay tribute to the member,
					 who is interested in improving the highway system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I wish to point out to him that, when it
					 comes time to decide which projects to fund, the responsibility of provincial
					 governments is definitely a key element in defining priorities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that highway 7 is a major highway
					 in the Province of Ontario, but it is unfortunately not part of the national
					 highway system. National highways are defined as those which promote
					 interprovincial economic development. This responsibility therefore falls to
					 provincial governments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any future funding, Transport Canada will obviously
					 give priority to highways which are part of the national highway
					 system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Province of Ontario has itself decided that
					 highways 416 and 401 would form the segment of the national highway system
					 between Ottawa and Toronto. The program to improve the national highway system,
					 which was announced a few months ago, will obviously encourage development of
					 the regional highway system, including Highway 7, with respect to tourism and
					 economic development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By announcing its $600 million Strategic Highway
					 Infrastructure Program, Transport Canada will certainly be able to help improve
					 the main national highway system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ontario will receive $160 million. It must be
					 understood that it is not Transport Canada's responsibility to define the
					 provinces' priorities. Transport Canada will have to accept the priorities
					 already identified by the provincial governments. I think that everyone will
					 agree that these priorities must be respected by the federal government.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Official negotiations will soon begin and I hope that
					 we will have an opportunity to help improve the national highway system which,
					 in turn, will have an impact on regional highways.</p>
