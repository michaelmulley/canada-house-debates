    </p><a name="Para750208"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow is an important landmark for women in Canadian politics. It does indeed mark the date in 1918 that women were finally recognized as persons under the law. This meant that Canada had turned a corner and women could finally begin to take their rightful place in the political life of our nation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new law laid the groundwork for the 1921 election when a woman was finally elected to this House and it eventually led to the 1930 appointment of a woman to the Senate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750210"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women have come a long way since 1918, but we have not come far enough. Sadly, in this Parliament only 21.4% of the elected representatives are women. That is not enough representation for 51% of our population.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750211"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public policy impacts men and women differently. Equality therefore demands equal representation in decision making and public affairs. We need to ensure that women's voices are heard more consistently in this--</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four weeks ago the world gathered in Montreal to tackle ozone-depleting substances. We built on the Montreal protocol, which was first negotiated in 1987 by the then prime minister, Brian Mulroney. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750449"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were able to accelerate by 10 years the phase-out of these ozone-depleting substances, the worst being HCFC, which is a major and potent greenhouse gas.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government is not talking about taking action on the environment; we are delivering the goods.</div>

    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para750481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our nation is built on our founding values: freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Throughout our history, Canadians have fought and died defending these values and we believe they should be the birthright of all human beings.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para750482"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stand with those who protect our values, and especially with those who are denied those values. Unfortunately, there are many countries in which citizens are denied these fundamental rights and freedoms.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para750483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, few have faced such brutal repression as the long-suffering people of Burma. For nearly two decades, they have endured the unrelenting tyranny of an unelected military dictatorship.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para750484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few weeks, the latest peaceful demonstrations have been violently put down by the despots who now control Burma.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para750485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tens of thousands of Burmese took their noble cause to the streets. Thousands were arrested and imprisoned and there have been countless reports of beatings, torture and summary executions.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para750486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians were horrified and scandalized by these events.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para750487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been public protests in support of the Burmese people in cities across our country, including on Parliament Hill last week. All Canadians know that what is happening in Burma is an attack on the values we hold dear, indeed an attack on the values of civilization itself. They want us to act and we must.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para750488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this month, we demanded a special session of the United Nations Human Rights Council on the situation in Burma. Together with the international community, we condemned the regime's brutality.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para750489"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protesters in Burma, here in Canada and around the world are rallying behind Aung San Suu Kyi. A Nobel Peace Prize winner, she is the living embodiment of the long struggle for freedom and democracy in her country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750490"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her National League for Democracy won a landslide election but was not allowed to form a government. In fact, she has been a political prisoner for most of the last 18 years. More than anyone else, she has focused international attention on the plight of her people.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para750491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why, today, we are conferring honorary Canadian citizenship on Aung San Suu Kyi.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para750492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To acknowledge and support her long, courageous battle for freedom and democracy in Burma, I urge and thank all parliamentarians for supporting this motion. I hope it will be adopted unanimously in both chambers of this Parliament so that it can be clear as always that Canada stands for universal values that are under siege today in Burma, and once again, to also send to Aung San Suu Kyi the important message that Canadians and indeed all civilized people of the world stand behind her in her quest for democracy and freedom in that country.</div>

    </p><a name="Para750495"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are especially pleased that this occurs at this particular time of crisis and great need for the people of Burma. The Liberal opposition has long supported the bestowing of the title “Honorary Canadian Citizen” on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, so that the people of Canada may demonstrate their friendship and solidarity through her to the people of Burma.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750496"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our sincerest honour and privilege to see that this symbol of unity of our two peoples has finally come to pass. We hope it will be followed by many more actions of support for the Burmese people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750497"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aung San Suu Kyi's courage is the courage to sacrifice her life in order to give life to an entire nation. She continues to inspire people throughout the world and to strive to attain democracy, human rights and ethnic unity through peaceful means and for this she won the Nobel Peace Prize.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750498"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are unspeakable human rights abuses by totalitarian governments in many countries of today's world. For the freedom fighters in these struggles, Aung San Suu Kyi is an international symbol of heroic and peaceful resistance in the face of oppression.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750499"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To quote the chairman of the Nobel Peace Prize committee, “She is an outstanding example of the power of the powerless”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750500"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of the incredible personal sacrifices Aung San Suu Kyi has made to lead the peaceful struggle of her people. She lived through the assassination of Burma's martyred independence leader, General Aung San, her father. She escaped an assassination attempt on May 30, 2003 by thugs of the USDA supported by the regime who beat 100 of her supporters to death in the failed assassination attempt.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine what government in the world would arrest a Nobel Peace Prize winner. She has now spent over 4,000 days under house arrest. She is isolated and allowed no visitors. Her phone line has been cut and her mail is intercepted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Aung San Suu Kyi herself says “The only real prison is fear”. When her husband was dying of cancer, the military junta dictatorship would not let him pay one last visit to his wife, even after a request by the Pope and the Secretary General of the UN.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750503"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1988, the brutal military dictatorship murdered 3,000 peaceful students and human rights protestors. Imagine soldiers going into Burmese houses, forcing the young children into labour, raping wives and torturing and murdering Burmese citizens who disagreed or objected, except for the hundreds of thousands who have fled to refugee camps across the border.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of government anywhere in the world would murder and torture peaceful monks? It is this outrageous regime that the peaceful human rights protestors and the rest of the world under UN responsibility to protect are up against.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this, the Burmese people need a leader to lead them to freedom. They have one, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who will soon be a Canadian citizen.</div>

As the head of the National League for Democracy, she led Burma to its first democratic election. Elected President, she was removed by the military junta, which quashed the election results and placed her under house arrest. In 1991, Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burma lives under the rule of dictatorship and military terror. Rights and freedoms are repressed. The recent peaceful protest by monks shows how entrenched the military junta is in its refusal to accept change. Repression continues and the international community is protesting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the House that this Parliament supported a report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development which forcefully denounced the systematic and repeated violations of human rights by the junta, especially with regard to minorities. This report urged the authorities of Burma to immediately free all political prisoners, particularly Aung San Suu Kyi . It called on this government to provide tangible support for the legitimate authorities, the government in exile in particular. The report recommended that a number of economic sanctions be placed on Burma. It asked Canada to exert pressure on the UN Secretary General to establish a framework for finally getting the military junta to negotiate a peaceful transition to democracy in cooperation with the National League for Democracy and representatives of ethnic minorities, as proclaimed since 1994 in all UN resolutions in respect of Burma.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois fully supports the decision by the Parliament of Canada to bestow honorary Canadian citizenship on Aung San Suu Kyi . Having appeased our conscience, however, we would not want to stop there. Efforts to liberate Burma must continue. The manifest desire of its citizens to achieve democracy must be supported. The Parliament of Canada must stand by their side. </div>

    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para750512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of us are indifferent to the images we have seen the past few weeks from Burma. In one of the world's most brutal dictatorships, Burmese monks had the courage to defy the authorities. They led the ordinary people of Burma, in peaceful demonstrations, to demand that generals step aside and allow the democratically elected leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, to take her rightful place. The brutal military junta responded by arresting and killing those brave, heroic monks and their followers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout almost two decades, Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy have been denied their election victory. This outright affront to democracy should have been dealt with long ago. The world has been too silent on the flagrant violations of human rights suffered by the Burmese people. We have shied away from tough action that can make the difference in a country like Burma. Forced labour, torture, arbitrary arrests and imprisonment, denial of freedom of expression and association are a daily reality for the people of Burma.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aung San Suu Kyi is the rightful leader of the democratically led government of Burma, a democratically led government yet to be recognized by the military junta. She has often called on the international community to “use your liberty to promote ours”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we have a chance to do just that. To truly honour Aung San Suu Kyi we must support her efforts in bringing democracy to Burma. She called upon the international community to put pressure on the junta by withdrawing western investment from her country. She has argued that the presence of western investment in Burma provides both financial and moral support for the junta. As she said, “Western companies give the regime a chance to say: “Look: even companies from Western democracies support us”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a press conference on October 3, I declared that Canadian companies and public pension funds investing in Burma had been complicit in propping up the military regime and that the Canadian government must do more to stop this complicity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750517"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Democrats fully expect Canadian companies operating throughout the world to hold themselves to the highest standards of corporate social responsibility. The Canadian government cannot speak out for human rights in places like Burma and then allow Canadian companies to undermine these efforts by cooperating and legitimizing the regimes responsible for violating human rights in the first place. That is why we have heeded the call from Aung San Suu Kyi and demanded a carefully targeted divestment campaign to increase the pressure on the junta.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind the House of another person who had the honour of Canadian citizenship bestowed upon him, Nelson Mandela. When Mr. Mandela was in prison, Canada took leadership by ensuring all Canadian companies divested from the brutal apartheid regime of South Africa. That was the beginning of the end of apartheid. To truly honour Aung San Suu Kyi's fight for democracy and human rights we need the same leadership today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750519"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, the NDP caucus supports this motion. Her words echo in this chamber today, “use your liberty to promote ours”. Let us heed her call.</div>

    </p><a name="Para750522"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said: Mr. Speaker, one of the greatest responsibilities any government has is its duty to help those who are most underprivileged in our society. Homelessness, lower education levels and poor health outcomes saps hope and destroys futures. Within Canada there is a group of the poor that has to labour underneath that. Within that group are nearly one million children who labour under poverty. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750523"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that it is my honour to introduce in the House a private member's bill that would introduce the Canadian low income supplement. This supplement would put $2,000 in the hands of every family that earns under $20,000 a year, declining to zero for those families that earn less than $40,000. It puts real money in the hands of those who are most underprivileged in our society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750524"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is enjoying a $14 billion surplus. Conservatives failed to introduce any credible poverty reduction plan in the Speech from the Throne and, quite frankly, have increased taxes on the poor. This is remarkable and unconscionable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750525"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I ask the government to support and quickly pass this private member's bill, pass the Canadian low income supplement, put real money in the hands of those Canadians who are underprivileged and ensure that they have the hope and the future to which all Canadians aspire.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the more positive aspects of the Speech from the Throne. It is encouraging to see that the government intends to expand the scope of the Action Plan for Official Languages, which linguistic minorities are in the bad habit of calling the Dion plan. We hope the government will keep this promise and table a robust plan that it will not have to call the Dion plan II.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750552"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why stop there? Why not revive the court challenges program that has done so much to protect minority rights? And why not reinstate the bilingual requirement for officers of the Canadian Forces?</div>
    </p><a name="Para750553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are pleased to see that the government has finally decided to offer an official apology to the victims of the Indian residential schools. This does not in any way discharge the government of its obligation to right the terrible wrongs caused by its rejection of the Kelowna Accord, which delayed urgently needed measures in education, health and infrastructure, and by its refusal to sign the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also pleased with the government's interest in Canada's North and we support its intention to set up a world-class research station there. However, we would like to know the location of the site, the budget and the deadlines for achieving this plan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was high time for the government to keep its promise of mapping the Arctic seabed. It made that promise 18 months ago. We would like to know how the government intends to respect the crucial 2013 deadline to show that the continental shelf falls within Canadian territory, which our country is required to do since it ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government also talked about expanding aerial surveillance in the North, but then why not deploy fixed-wing search and rescue aircraft, as the previous Liberal government planned to do? </div>
    </p><a name="Para750557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One may also ask why the government makes no mention of the building of small craft harbours in the Arctic, when such a measure could create jobs and increase trade and tourism in northern Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And why not take a collaborative diplomatic approach to assert our interests with the Arctic Council, the only international organization of circumpolar countries, which can deal with major Arctic issues, and within which Canada must still play a leadership role? </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to conclude on the North, how can one talk about the North without talking about enhancing the quality of life of its inhabitants, the quality of life of the Inuit people and services that are provided to them, particularly at a time when global warming has such a profound effect on their way of life?</div>
    </p><a name="Para750560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another positive point in the Speech from the Throne, we were pleased to learn that the government was committed to supporting our veterans. However, the throne speech does not contain any provision to enhance the quality of life of active members of our armed forces and their families, particularly to help them overcome the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder that often follow their deployment overseas. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We take note of the government's intention to modernize the Canadian armed forces. However, we have some concerns about the way that it wants to do so. Will the government continue with its troubling reliance on contracting without tender? Contracts of $30 billion have already been awarded in this manner. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750562"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good to learn that the government has decided to make a commitment toward Haiti, but it remains vague on the exact nature of this commitment. Is it financial aid for basic health care? Is it funds for reforestation? We still do not know. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn my attention to the more problematic sections of the speech, starting with the absurd expression that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> keeps repeating. Let me tell the Prime Minister that when he argues that “Canada is back” he diminishes the fine tradition of Canadian peacekeeping and international leadership that long preceded the Conservative government's election to office.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for that, Canadians must wonder where the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> was back when Canada obtained an international treaty banning landmines; when Canada was a main architect of the International Criminal Court; when Canadian armed forces airplanes were the only ones operating an airlift in and out of Kigali during the Rwanda genocide; when our soldiers fought to protect Bosnia's civilian population; or when Canada hosted the world in Montreal and rallied it around the Kyoto protocol.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's continued ambiguity on the mission in Afghanistan is also disconcerting. The government is being deliberately ambiguous about the length of the mission in Kandahar. In fact, it does not want to mention the word Kandahar. Nor does it mention the words “combat mission”. It refuses to call the Canadian mission in Kandahar what it is: a counter-insurgency combat mission in which our troops are required to proactively seek out and engage the Taliban.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750567"></a><p>

It is not. If the government wants to transform it into a training mission after February 2009, that could be an acceptable option, one that we have advocated for since last February and one that the blue ribbon panel on Afghanistan has been instructed to consider.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750568"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, the government should immediately notify NATO and the government of Afghanistan that our combat mission in Kandahar will end in February 2009. By refusing to do so, the government makes it more difficult to replace our troops and to prepare a new Canadian mission.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750569"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another question on Afghanistan. Why has the government asked the Manley panel to look at four options while the throne speech already chooses one of the four options: accelerated training of the Afghan army and police? Perhaps the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> should inform the panel that its work is done.</div>

    </p><a name="Para750572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne speech states that “the constitutional jurisdiction of each order of government should be respected”, but the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> should start by respecting premiers.

    </p><a name="Para750579"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada federal spending power has been instrumental in building the Canada-wide social programs that all Canadians value, such as medicare.

    </p><a name="Para750580"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social union framework agreement, SUFA, recently helped to successfully negotiate the early learning and child care agreements with the provinces and territories.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, I mentioned our health care plan, which is the result of a wise use of the federal spending power. In the throne speech, the government congratulates itself—not really honestly, I might add—for the progress it made in shortening wait times. Unfortunately, we do not see any such progress. In fact, according to a recent report by the Fraser Institute, the average wait time for surgery in Canada now stands at 18.3 weeks, the longest it has ever been.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I come to the economy. The Conservative government inherited an unprecedented economic dynamism thanks to the efforts of Canadians and to a decade of sound financial management by the previous Liberal government. The economy has not been in such good shape since Confederation. This is the longest growth period in decades. We have the highest growth rate of all G-8 countries with major job creation, balanced budgets, a trade surplus and a reduction of our national debt. Our country is the only one to have succeeded in putting its pension plan on a solid footing for the long term. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 19 months, the Conservative government has been content with just riding on this strong economy without having any plans or convincing scheme to enhance our economy's potential. That is what I call being near-sighted. Let us not delude ourselves into thinking that there will be no end to the current growth. The fact is that this government has done more harm than good in terms of Canada's international competitiveness. It is about to allocate $12 billion per year to cut the GST by two points, a measure that will not allow Canadians to bring more money home, does nothing to combat poverty and does not make our economy more competitive in any way.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives' interest deductibility proposal is a frontal attack on the competitiveness of Canadian companies and has been denounced as the worst tax policy in 35 years.

The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> has not listened to common sense, but it is not too late for him to do so.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the time to make such mistakes. The parity of our currency with the U.S. dollar, the uncertainty of the U.S. market, the high cost of energy, and the new powerhouses of India and China are all putting pressure on our economy and on the exporters and manufacturers that generate the jobs upon which we depend to maintain our high standard of living. Nearly 80,000 workers have lost their jobs in the manufacturing sector this year alone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To maintain these jobs, and to enhance this standard of living well into the future, we must find ways to improve the innovation, competiveness and productivity of our businesses and workers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne speech mentions infrastructure. It mentions post-secondary education. It mentions science and technology. It mentions the manufacturing, forestry, fisheries, mining, resources, tourism and agriculture sectors. But a mention is no substitute for a plan. We hope that the fall economic and fiscal update will provide clarity on how the government will improve Canada's competitiveness.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne speech promises tax cuts, but the government actually raised income tax rates in the lowest bracket from 15% to 15.5%. This decision costs Canadians over a billion dollars every year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On international trade, the government did not explain why it closed consulates in key markets such as St. Petersburg, Osaka and Milan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government went to lengths to hide the flawed softwood lumber agreement, an agreement that cost the Canadian industry at least $1 billion, which is being put in the hands of those now using the money to sue our companies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of criminal justice and security for Canadians, the government laments that much of its legislation did not pass. What the government always fails to mention is that for months it systematically refused Liberal offers to fast track the majority of its legislation. Of the six bills the government wants to reintroduce as part of the tackling violent crime bill, we already support five.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the government that obstructed the passage of these bills, causing them to die on the order paper at prorogation, and it did so to the detriment of the security of Canadians. Hopefully the government will be more cooperative in the coming session. We urge the government to stop playing politics with the Criminal Code and to stop putting partisan politics ahead of the safety of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, with respect to the tackling violent crime bill, we obviously want to see exactly what the legislation will say. We could support it if includes measures that would make Canadians safer. We Liberals are tough on crime and we are tough on the causes of crime.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives will only bring forward the minor parts of the clean air and climate change act, the ones they allow their members to support. As a result, the regulatory framework to cut and bring down gas emissions is gone. The regulatory framework to improve air quality is gone. The autonomous emissions standards are gone.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we left with? We are left with a government plan that has been panned by all credible experts in Canada and abroad, a climate change plan that has been panned by all the experts, like the new Nobel Prize winner, Al Gore, who called the Prime Minister's plan “a complete and total fraud, designed to mislead the Canadian people”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750623"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pembina Institute, that once rated Project Green, the Liberal plan killed by the Conservatives, would have delivered almost seven times more reduction than the government's current approach. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deutsche Bank said, “We think that the Canadian government has materially overstated the cost of complying with Kyoto. Under current policies, we would expect Canada's industrial gas emissions to continue rising over 2006-2020".</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne speech states that national regulations to reduce emissions will be implemented this year. We do not know what the government is talking about, since its own regulations will not see the light before 2010 at the earliest.

    </p><a name="Para750632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians can count on the official opposition to press the government to take action and be accountable. The government must understand that any deadline set for meeting our targets for the first phase of implementation of the Kyoto protocol, which ends in 2012, can be corrected during the second phase, after 2012. But to do that, we have to start today. That is why the government has to significantly toughen its measures to fight climate change. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official opposition will cooperate fully with the government to help it reach real targets. Canada must remain a party to the Kyoto protocol, the only international accord to fight what is a global threat.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians can count on the official opposition to do everything it can to make this Parliament work.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments we are putting forward would enable us to support the throne speech.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As another leader of the official opposition said some years ago, “I believe it's not in the national interest to have an election now.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot find anything in his remarks that contradicts what I said in my speech. No one restricted the federal spending power more than we did in 1996 and through the framework agreement on social union. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750667"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the wording used by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister </A> in the Speech from the Throne does not go as far. Why? First, because it deals strictly with shared costs programs, and these programs have almost all disappeared. By contrast, the framework agreement on social union includes all forms of transfers to the provinces. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750668"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the agreement clearly specifies that the support of a majority of provinces is required to implement a Canada-wide program that relates to a social provincial jurisdiction. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750669"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the federal government cannot set up programs. It can agree on objectives with the provinces, but it is the provinces that establish their own programs. If they have achieved, partially or totally, their objectives, then they can invest in a related area.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750670"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how the Government of Canada and the Quebec government negotiated the daycare agreement. The Quebec government felt that it had enough daycare spaces—I do not know whether Quebeckers shared that view, but that was the Quebec government's point of view. In the social union framework agreement, the Government of Canada agreed that the Quebec government could invest in other areas relating to children and families. There was an agreement involving hundreds of millions of dollars. What happened? The same thing that happened to the negotiations on the Kyoto protocol: the Conservatives took office and cancelled these programs. Shame on them!</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006 Canadians went to the polls and voted for change. Our government ran on a clear platform. We received a clear mandate and we are delivering what we promised.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, a mere 21 months later, I believe we can say with pride that the government is clean, the economy is strong, and the country is united.</div>

    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para750688"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the world, Canada is back. This change, after years of scandal, inaction and threats to national unity, brings home to us the strength of Canada’s foundational values. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para750689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a love of freedom, a commitment to democracy, a reverence for human rights, and an adherence to the rule of law. Notwithstanding our imperfections, we have built a society that genuinely aspires to the highest ideals of civilization.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para750690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We balance the rewards of individual initiative with a collective commitment to help those in need. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para750691"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We value people for who they are and what they contribute, and not for who they know or where they come from. We leave the conflicts of older worlds behind to live together here in harmony and we reach beyond our shores to help resolve those conflicts. </div>

    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para750692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generations that came before us set our country on this noble path: the Aboriginal people who established Canada’s first settlements, long before the arrival of Europeans; the French adventurers who laid the foundations of the Canadian state on the shores of the St-Lawrence nearly 400 years ago. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para750693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British settlers brought their democratic ideals and institutions that we have modelled into our own and of course the immigrants from every corner of the earth have enriched our society with their traditions and ambitions.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is their legacy to us. Enriching this heritage for future generations is our duty to them. Every day millions of Canadians are doing just that. They are setting the nation's moral compass by teaching their children right from wrong. They are building our economy with their hard work and they are making our communities better by giving more than they take.</div>

    </p><a name="Para750697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that we have turned a new leaf, it is time to fix our sights on Canada's longer term horizons, on where we want to go into the 21st century and how we will get there. That is why, for the second session of the 39th Parliament, our throne speech is titled “Strong Leadership. A Better Canada”. Strong leadership delivers more than it promises rather than promising more than it can deliver. We promise Canadians simply this: a better Canada for all of us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We take inspiration from the great explorers of our true north Radisson and Des Groseilliers, Hudson and Franklin, Bernier, Amundsen and the rest. Just as they were guided by the North Star, we will be guided by a five point agenda for Canada. Our plan is principled and focused. We will strengthen the Canada of tomorrow while delivering real benefits to Canadians today.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this session of Parliament, our government has five core priorities for a better Canada.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas in the past Canada participated in the world through its membership in the French and British empires, today we are a fully sovereign country.

    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para750714"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our most important potential sovereignty challenge today is on our Arctic doorstep where retreating polar ice, rising global demand for resources and the prospect of year round shipping are creating new challenges and exciting opportunities for the north. As Stan Rogers once sang, Franklin's dream of tracing “one warm line through a land so wild and savage” to “make a Northwest Passage to the sea”, seems about to be realized. However, it must be on our terms. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750715"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure this we cannot just point at a map and say it is ours. Protecting and inserting our sovereignty in the Arctic and elsewhere requires real effort, expense and sacrifice. We cannot go 10 years without sending a single ship to the passage as our predecessors did. We have to use the north or we risk losing it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conservative governments going all the way back to Confederation have understood the importance of Canada’s true North. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750717"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John A. Macdonald, who oversaw Canada’s acquisition of our vast lands to the north and west, was the first to apply the “use it or lose it” principle of sovereignty.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para750718"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macdonald said, “were we so faint-hearted as not to take possession of it, the Americans would be only too glad of the opportunity and would hoist the American flag”. And so he assured our possession over the Arctic claims of Britain, just as he had created the Northwest Mounted Police to assure our sovereignty in western Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750719"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half a century ago, Prime Minister John Diefenbaker extolled his northern vision. He foresaw that Canada's future development and prosperity would depend on efficient transportation networks linking northern resources to southern markets. “Roads to resources” he called them. Therefore, he built, among others, our northern most road, the 700 kilometre Dempster Highway from Yukon to the Mackenzie River delta.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750720"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition of the day has always dismissed such initiatives as unnecessary, fanciful and even wasteful, and history has always proven it wrong.</div>

    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para750721"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why our government established a strategy for the North, and why we have already taken a number of steps to affirm our presence and sovereignty in the Canadian Arctic. </div>

    </p><a name="Para750727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will proceed with the first ever comprehensive mapping of Canada's Arctic seabed as well as the establishment of a world-class research station to be located in the Arctic itself. It will become the hub of our scientific activities in the north, gathering knowledge that will support our sovereignty and assist with resource development and environmental protection. The other Arctic nations of this planet already have most or all of these capabilities. Under our watch, Canada will not be left behind when it comes to the Arctic.</div>

They cannot contribute any more. Let me assure you, Mr. Speaker, we will reduce taxes for all businesses as well as for all individuals and families in this country. Because in this country, there is only one party which, over the long sweep of our history, has been consistently committed to low taxes, direct benefits for families, fiscal discipline, and a free and fair market powered by the energy and creativity of the private sector, and that is the Conservative Party.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the intangibles that has recently been working to the advantage of all Canadians and to the advantage of our economy has been the clear improvement in national unity since our government took office. I know the Bloc is not happy but that is the idea.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750768"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the important steps along this road was the recognition that the Québécois form a nation within a united Canada, a measure widely supported in this House last year. That was a controversial act and some predicted, and I know they genuinely believed, that it would lead this country in the wrong direction. I have spoken in various parts of our country and outside our country in French and English, not just Quebec. I have urged, and I continue to urge, all Canadians to look at the beneficial effect that this historic recognition has had on the national unity of this country. Canada is more united today than it has been at any time since our centennial 40 years ago.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para750769"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the results of the last election and reaction to the action taken since then—action on UNESCO, the nation, fiscal balance—are sending a very important message to us all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians, and Quebecois in particular, want to move forward. They have had enough of the old quarrels. They are fed up with the bickering between centralists and separatists, between those who would keep all the power in Ottawa, and those that would give all the power to an independent Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George-Étienne Cartier, MacDonald and their colleagues created a federation that, although not perfect, has served Canadians well for 140 years. In fact, the federation of 1867 created one of the most solid political institutions in the world, unbroken by tyranny or conquest, unbroken by social disorder or economic chaos.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750772"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we mustn’t forget that Canada—a country born in French, a country with two languages and a multitude of cultures, which will soon be celebrating the 400th anniversary of the founding of its first capital, Québec—is one of the biggest success stories in history. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I do not argue that Canada is perfect, and so we are committed to reforming it for the better. Our government has worked hard to respect the federal division of powers, to strengthen long-neglected federal jurisdictions, and to work cooperatively with the provinces.</div>

    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para750774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next session, in accordance with our government practice, we will be introducing legislation to place formal limits on the use of federal spending power with respect to new programs in areas of provincial jurisdiction without provincial consent and to provide for opting out with compensation. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para750775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a historic measure, one that has already been welcomed by the government of Quebec. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750776"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105459,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105459&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Leader of the Opposition</A> talked about why this would be a bad thing. One of the reasons he stated for how this would be a bad thing is that this might prevent him from trying to take the child care allowance from Canadian families and instead give it back to lobbyists, to researchers, to advocates and to other politicians. We are going to make sure we get that money directly to Canadian families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750777"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also act within the federal jurisdiction to strengthen Canada's economic union, which is a fundamental responsibility for the national government, one that it must take in the interests of all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750778"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say that Canada is not perfect, I think most Canadians recognize immediately that the Senate, as presently constituted, is one of its obvious imperfections.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750779"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must admit to being rather disappointed that the Senate chose not to adopt the tenure bill, even after an excellent report on the subject prepared by the former Speaker of the Senate, Dan Hays. The government will reintroduce in the House, in a slightly amended form, the bill to shorten senators' tenure from a maximum of 45 years to eight years. I am tempted to say that such a reform should be a no-brainer, but I have been surprised before.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750780"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the government, while still supportive of allowing for the direct consultation of voters in the selection of senators, does recognize that this is a complex and controversial measure for some members. As such, the government will, upon reintroducing this bill, ask that it be sent to committee before second reading in order to get as wide-ranging a parliamentary input as possible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just say that I remain convinced the country deserves a reformed Senate, and an elected Senate for that matter, but the country needs the Senate to change, and if the Senate cannot be reformed, I think most Canadians will eventually conclude that it should be abolished.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of reform, let us also hope that the opposition will see fit to stop delaying the adoption of the former Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590516,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590516&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A>.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted with great interest, of course, the leader of the Liberal Party talking about compassion and help for the less well off, but I do have to point out that ours is the government that signed the residential schools settlement and that is now implementing it and preparing the apology; that has cut the right of landing fee to people who have come to this country; that has increased funding for official languages communities across this country; that has redressed finally, after so many years, the Chinese head tax; that has established the Air-India inquiry which was so demanded; and that has concluded a settlement with the sufferers of hepatitis C. These are our proudest moments and they show the difference between talking and acting.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, I would like to draw attention to the fifth part of our government’s long-term agenda for a better Canada, a point that affects many Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750785"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have always been proud of their safe streets and communities—something that long distinguished us from our friends across the border. Today, however, crime is erasing the promise of our Constitution, the promise of peace, order and good government. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para750786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians want their safe streets and communities back. They want leadership that is tough on crime and reliable on national security and that is exactly what they are going to get from this government. Under our government, the protection of law-abiding citizens and their property is once again becoming the top priority of our criminal justice system and this will be the agenda we will pursue if Parliament adopts this throne speech. In short, the opposition cannot allow it to pass and then obstruct our core priorities.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para750787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to our first piece of legislation. Last year, our first bill was our historic anti-corruption law, the Accountability Act. This year, our first bill will be our comprehensive justice reform bill, the Tackling Violent Crime Act.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para750788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">accountability act</A> cleaned up corruption in government, the tackling violent crime act will be a first step in cleaning up crime in our streets and communities. And it will be a matter of confidence, because the time for talk has passed and the time for action has long since arrived. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750789"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are fed up with a criminal justice system that puts the rights of criminals ahead of the rights of law-abiding citizens, fed up with a revolving door bail system and soft sentences for serious offenders, and fed up with feeling unsafe in their homes and public places.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para750790"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first session of Parliament, our government introduced 13 justice bills. Seven have been passed into law, but six, which included several key policy measures, were held up by the opposition. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para750791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we accommodated many opposition amendments, the bills were held up in opposition-controlled House committees or by the Liberal majority in the Senate for a grand total of 976 days. That is simply not acceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadians are losing patience, so Bill C-2, our tackling violent crime act, to be spearheaded by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A>, will reintroduce the key elements of those bills. It will, for example, take action on sentencing for gun crimes. Too often, people convicted of violent crimes involving firearms do little or no time. That is unacceptable. Under our law, serious gun crime will mean serious mandatory prison time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750793"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in too many cases bail has been granted to people charged with serious weapons offences, and while on bail some of them have committed appalling new crimes. That is also unacceptable. Our bill will make it tougher for accused gun criminals to get bail.</div>

    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para750794"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tackling Violent Crime Act will also crack down on sexual predators. For far too long now, these predators have gone after our children. That too is unacceptable. This legislation will protect our children by raising the age of protection. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para750795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our legislation will also crack down on drug- and alcohol-impaired driving. Too many innocent people have died at the hands of drunk or stoned drivers. Again, that is unacceptable. The tackling violent crime bill will give police and prosecutors more tools to get impaired drivers off our roads and keep them off.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750796"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally and perhaps most importantly, too many of the most violent, repeat and dangerous offenders in this country wind up back on our streets where they can offend again, again and again. Each time they do, Canadians look at their records, their rap sheets, and ask, “Why on earth was this person ever let out of prison?” There is nothing more unacceptable than that.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para750797"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, let us be clear. We are talking about a few dozen of the most violent, dangerous individuals in this country. Our bill will make sure they stay behind bars, where they belong. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para750798"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that some people will say we are being too aggressive. From high up in their academic ivory towers or from the boardrooms of their law firms, they will look down on the streets they never set foot on and say things like, “Criminals are really just victims of injustice, oppression and social exclusion”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750799"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try telling that to their real victims. Tell it to women who do not feel safe walking in their neighbourhoods at night or having their children in those neighbourhoods during the day. Tell it to the innocent teenager killed in a gang shootout on the streets of Toronto. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no good reason for the official opposition to oppose or to delay Bill C-2.

That is why we are making the tackling violent crime act a matter of confidence. We will be seeking timely passage of this legislation and, as is the case with confidence measures, the government will not accept amendments to the substance of these initiatives.</div>

That is why the government was elected.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have had cooperation on a wide range of these initiatives from the New Democratic Party. We have had cooperation on some of these initiatives from the Bloc Québécois. What we have had from the Liberal Party is it saying that it agrees then shoving them to committee or the Senate where it can delay them or make them go away as quickly as they possibly can.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750818"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to be shining the spotlight on that and if the Liberal Party genuinely supports these initiatives, which have been thoroughly debated in the House and in committee, it will get these through both chambers in a matter of days.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question that the deputy leader asked on Afghanistan, let me just repeat what we have said. First, when we announced the panel last week, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Leader of the Opposition</A> said that just because we had announced the panel did not mean the government did not have to state its own preference. Now that we have stated our own preference he is saying that we are trying to somehow sabotage the panel.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Manley obviously takes Canada's international responsibilities very seriously. He is a Liberal. He is not a supporter of my party. Mr. Manley and his colleagues, and certainly Mr. Manley was aware of the government's position in the throne speech.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750821"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just say what we want to do. We have been very clear that this mission today has a wide range of elements. Over the past year we have been shifting the emphasis in Afghanistan toward the training of Afghan forces. That is going successfully but our honest assessment today is that we will not be in a position to complete that and to ensure that the Afghan forces can take care of their own security in Kandahar by February 2009.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we are obliged not to leave that province, for which we have taken international responsibility in front of the whole international community, in chaos. Our preferences to continue that track and we believe it should be completed by 2011. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750823"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Manley will examine that option and his colleagues will examine a number of other options and he will bring those to the government. The government will then present those options to Parliament for a debate and a vote before we proceed further.</div>

    </p><a name="Para750837"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the government of another historic event. When Canada was formed, there was a contract between the two founding peoples. That contract provided that, in the only province where it was in the majority—Quebec—the francophone people had sovereignty over areas such as health, education and social services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750838"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That contract was violated by the central government in Ottawa by virtue of spending authority that it gave itself unilaterally. No Government of Quebec has ever recognized that authority. This is a critical issue for Quebec, and we have made it a priority.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750839"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also remember that, at this very moment, Quebeckers are in Afghanistan, fighting in one of the most dangerous parts of the world. We owe them our unswerving support. On behalf of the Bloc Québécois, I want to tell them that we admire their courage and that they can count on our support.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750840"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Bloc Québécois certainly will not support a militaristic policy and agree to have Canada's combat mission extended beyond February 2009.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750841"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois has long been the staunchest defender of the Kyoto accord in the House of Commons, and today I want to reiterate our determination to fight climate change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750842"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue is a crucial one for Quebec, because implementing the Kyoto protocol would provide it with a unique opportunity to accelerate its economic growth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750843"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Quebec nation, agriculture is more than a mere economic sector. Agriculture is also inextricably linked to the development of our land and to Quebeckers settling on it. As the song says, “our great-great-grandfathers cleared the land”. Let us also not forget that it is the supply management system that allows a large number of our agricultural producers to remain active, to develop and to use our national land.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750844"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I urge the government to remember that Quebec without its regions is no longer Quebec. And those regions are currently experiencing an unprecedented forestry crisis. Forestry workers, and their families and neighbours, are suffering from this crisis, and I want to tell them that we will not let them down.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750845"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elimination of the federal spending power, the withdrawal of our troops from Afghanistan in February 2009, the implementation of the Kyoto protocol, fully maintaining the supply management system and supporting those regions affected by a major forestry crisis are the five main priorities of the Quebec nation. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its Speech from the Throne, the government has clearly shown that it rejects Quebeckers' priorities. Consequently, the Bloc Québécois rejects this throne speech.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this new throne speech, the Conservative government promises to limit federal spending power in new programs.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the government continues to want to impose conditions on Quebec, which is unacceptable because we are talking about exclusive areas of jurisdiction. By taking this stand, it is going against the Quebec National Assembly and the Government of Quebec which affirmed, yesterday again, through its Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, that Quebec does not recognize this so-called federal spending power.

On March 26, 2003, when talking about Iraq, he said: “We should be there with our allies”. He was in this House, seated on this side, a few seats away from me. That is what he said. It was very clear; just check. Lucky for us he was not Prime Minister of a majority government at the time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750863"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the government's five priorities is to strengthen Canada's place in the world.

The Conservative government is losing all credibility in the world by wanting to withdraw Canada from the Kyoto protocol and join a group of countries led by George Bush, who rejects this international agreement. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750867"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By acting this way, Canada is going back on its word. By acting this way, it is going against the unanimous view of the National Assembly and Quebec's environment minister. Even the leader of the ADQ is disappointed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750868"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By refusing to adopt the territorial approach, it is showing that its openness to Quebec is nothing more than a farce. The government talks about mandatory targets, but we know that it is firm in its position and that it is talking about intensity targets, which means more pollution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750869"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government announced that it will set up a carbon exchange. This exchange should be located in Montreal, which already has a carbon exchange, and not in Toronto or Winnipeg.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750870"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing the government has to do is set up a regulatory framework with absolute targets. In this Speech from the Throne, the government simply showed its true priority and that is the well being of the oil industry, which it is carefully protecting.</div>

    </p><a name="Para750872"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government promised to support supply management. We will give the government the benefit of the doubt even though it has not told us what it intends to do. However, we know that some ministers would like to do away with it. I am warning the government that we will not cut it any slack on this issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750873"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fifth priority is support for regions undergoing crises in the forestry and manufacturing industries.

These people find themselves having to dip into their life savings to maintain their dignity. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By expressing his desire to use the federal trade and commerce power to impose free trade between the provinces, a federal securities commission, he is using threats and once again breaking his promise to practice open federalism.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government promises to invest in the Windsor-Detroit corridor and the Pacific gateway, but nothing is planned for the Montreal-New York corridor. This is proof of the powerlessness, and even insignificance, of Quebec ministers on this issue, since nothing was said about the St. Lawrence, the natural gateway to the Atlantic. It is also proof of their powerlessness when it comes to seasonal workers, since no employment insurance reforms were mentioned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750883"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government led an attack against groups defending women's rights, and we might have hoped for a change in direction. All we see is the government's complete insensitivity towards and disregard for women. These groups are not mentioned anywhere in the throne speech. The Bloc Québécois will continue to defend women's rights. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only possible conclusion we can reach on this throne speech is that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>'s Conservative government has run out of steam in its efforts to fool Quebec. This speech shows that the Prime Minister is not sincere in his openness to Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750885"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, on the federal spending power issue, the Conservative government is proposing the same kind of domineering and paternalistic federalism put forward by Jean Chrétien, which was rejected by the National Assembly. It comes in conflict with the will expressed by Quebec's National Assembly on issues such as securities, Kyoto, the forestry crisis, young offenders, the gun registry and the Senate. This is a lengthy list.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750886"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few months after recognizing Quebec as a nation, the Conservative government is reneging on just about every one of its initial promises. Day in and day out, the Quebec caucus of the Conservative Party of Canada demonstrates its inability to stand up for Quebec's interests and values. By refusing to address Quebec priorities in its throne speech, the Conservative government has shown that its discourse about open federalism toward Quebec was really hot air. The Conservatives' so-called openness is nothing but a political marketing strategy which is looking more and more like a sting operation against the Quebec nation. As things currently stand, no Quebec representative worthy of the name could support this Speech from the Throne.</div>

The Bloc had announced that it would vote against the Speech from the Throne. It said loud and clear that it wanted to defeat our government. It defeated the previous government, saying that Liberals are centralizers who still deny that there is fiscal imbalance. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750893"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since it came into office, the Conservative government has offered open federalism. Let us think, among other things, about the seat that Quebec got at UNESCO; let us think about the recognition of the Quebec nation; let us think about the settlement of the fiscal imbalance; let us think about the historic measure that was announced yesterday, that is, restricting federal spending power. This is on top of other measures that were taken, including strong support for supply management. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750894"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cannot be more clear. It is clearly written. Yet, the Bloc continues to make a big scene.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750895"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec has 75 members of Parliament out of a total of 308. What does this mean? It means that Bloc members will never make their promises a reality. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Quebec is getting stronger with a Conservative government. Why? Because we are able to make our promises a reality. We keep our word and we keep our commitments. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would the Bloc defeat a government that helps Quebec make progress? I cannot understand this. Is it really in Quebec's interests to content itself with trying to defeat a government that keeps its word, at last, and that respects its commitments toward Quebec and Canada? That is the question. </div>

    </p><a name="Para750899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, it is said that Quebec stands proud at UNESCO. I understand, because it has no seat; it has no choice but to stand. This seems self-evident to me.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec is told that it can be part of the Canadian delegation, but that it can speak only when it agrees with the federal representative. If Quebec does not agree, it will be told what it was told in Nairobi: “When you do not agree, go and talk in the hallway”. That is the message for Quebec at UNESCO.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, who talked so often about Belgium, should follow that country's example. When the two communities do not agree, Belgium abstains at UNESCO. In this way, Quebec would really have a place, just as it does at the summit of la Francophonie, where it has the right to speak.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the member talks about the recognition of Quebec as a nation. I said then that that had consequences. When the government recognizes the Quebec nation, it must also recognize the language of that nation, French. However, under the Canada Labour Code, the federal statute that governs relations in banks, airports, ports, telecommunications, communications and interprovincial transportation companies, Bill 101 does not apply in those areas. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet under subsection 178(1) of the Canada Labour Code, the federal government recognizes that the minimum wage in effect is the wage set by each province and that the federal minimum wage must be adapted to the minimum wage in each province.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750904"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government can do that with the minimum wage, could it not also do so with the language, which I believe is just as important as the minimum wage?</div>
    </p><a name="Para750905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we propose an amendment to the Canada Labour Code, we will see whether the member who is saying that his party delivers on its commitments will rise to say that the language of work in Quebec should be French in banks, airports, ports and telecommunications and at Radio-Canada. Currently, this is not the case.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the summer I travelled to communities across the country and I listened to countless stories from hardworking folks who are having real trouble making ends meet. Today, when more wealth is being created in our country than at any other time in its history, families are working longer just to make those ends meet. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750932"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, average Canadians today are squeezing 200 more hours of work out of each year than they did just nine years ago just to keep up. And yet, the income gap between those at the top and the rest is at a 30 year high. Something is fundamentally wrong with this picture and Canadians know it. </div>

    </p><a name="Para750934"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is what the NDP has been calling the prosperity gap and it is growing in our country. It is putting working families and the middle class further and further behind. It is creating more homelessness and poverty. We now have two million seniors living in poverty in this country after they helped to build the basics that gave us the wealth that we have today.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a few people at the top are enjoying the benefits of the current economy, everyone else is not. Sure we have seen the windfall salaries and extraordinary bonuses of CEOs, but wages for everyone else are essentially stagnant and falling for an awful lot of families. As a result of the government's agenda, the middle class in Canada is falling behind.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last summer, people told me that they were expecting action from the government to help their families make ends meet, to make the necessities of life more affordable and to ensure them greater financial security.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750937"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government could have chosen to reduce the gap between the rich and the rest of us. Reducing that gap could and should have been a priority for the present session. Instead, the Conservatives chose to do nothing. They just do not care.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years vague promises for action have not alleviated the crisis in Canada's manufacturing and resource sectors. What is needed is real leadership in these key sectors of the economy, but the Conservative agenda fails to give hope to the families and the communities which are suffering massive job losses as a result of the government's devastating policies. It is also failing to provide leadership for families when it comes to health care.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750939"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Millions of families cannot find a doctor. Wait times are still far too high for too many and the cost of prescription drugs continues to skyrocket to points where people simply cannot pay for the medications they need. When I spoke to the Canadian Pharmacists Association, I told the story of how some people go to that counter with a prescription their doctor says they need and once it is provided and the cost is known, they have to walk away from that medication because they cannot afford it. The two women pharmacists I explained this to said, “This happens each and every day with all of our pharmacist members in the country”. This is a tragedy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750940"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs is now more than 70% higher than it was in 1992. Canadian households are spending $3 billion a year on prescription drugs. By ignoring these fundamental issues the Conservative agenda, as it was laid out in the throne speech, has turned its back on improving health care for today's families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750941"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the Conservative indifference to all this, the NDP is going to redouble its efforts in its campaign for universal drug coverage, so that the hardworking families of this country can get the drugs they need based on their doctor's advice and not on their accountant's advice.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we face an unprecedented global crisis, this is not the time to use past failures, as the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> is wont to do, as an excuse for future inaction. We have to work even harder to honour our international obligations to stop climate change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why this is the time once and for all to take real action, not water down the clean air act and the climate change act as stated in the throne speech. That is not the path to follow for Canada to respond to the crisis. It is a course involving fundamentally inaction and indifference on climate change. This has a profound impact in every corner of this country and no more important than in Canada's north. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike some other leaders, I successfully completed a visit to Canada's Arctic this summer. I had the opportunity to visit the north last year as well. I saw firsthand the huge impact that climate change is having on our Arctic. It is truly horrifying to see the rate of change: the rapidity of the retreating glaciers that the elders told me about, which only a few years before had come right down to bodies of water and have now disappeared back beyond the mountains; the melting permafrost; new vegetation appearing in areas where there had never been vegetation before, particularly around the national park near Pangnirtung; the all but disappeared caribou; the collapse of the multi-million dollar commercial ice fishery because of rising ocean temperatures in that region.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke with the elders who are bearing witness to the greatest deterioration of their environment and therefore to their way of life that they have ever witnessed. Time is running out. I saw countless examples of the social and economic impacts of years of neglect. </div>
    </p><a name="Para750950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we mark this day, the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, the way to offer real opportunity and hope for the north is to begin to invest in the social and economic infrastructure, not just the military infrastructure, in the north. Only after we tackle illiteracy, disease, homelessness and provide hope to the peoples of Canada's north will we be truly exercising Arctic sovereignty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750951"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the government has moved in the right direction to address past wrongs to the aboriginal people, as I mentioned earlier, with the apology concerning residential schools, the government took a sad step back when it voted against the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Once again in the Conservative agenda aboriginal people were treated as second-class citizens in this country. It is not right.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my travels this summer I also heard folks tell me that the combat mission in Afghanistan is not the right mission for Canada. It is not the role that Canadians want to see their country play on the world stage.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP has been a consistent voice for peace, reconstruction and aid. We speak on behalf of millions of everyday Canadians who want the government to change direction in Afghanistan, who want to help bring in real security and a peace process, a peace that is lasting. Only the NDP has always been clear and consistent on this issue. It is the wrong mission for Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative Party successfully extended the mission in Afghanistan until 2009 with the support of the Liberal Party. The Conservatives and the Liberals want to participate in the war of aggression until at least 2009 and we know that the Bloc Québécois agrees with that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para750955"></a><p>

It talked about how support from the insurgency grew as the aggressive fighting continued. One thing is for sure, increased aerial bombing of villages, which is driving up the death rate for civilians, is in fact increasing support for the insurgency.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When President Karzai was in Canada last, he spoke to me about the importance of a negotiated solution and said that no military end was in sight. I was disappointed in the Speech from the Throne for its lack of recognition of the importance of ultimately a negotiation taking place. Even the Bush administration has acknowledged that at some point this will happen. I did not think I would have to make the accusation that our <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> had fallen behind George Bush, but I am afraid I will have to do that in this instance.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What saddened me about the speech was there was no reference that I could find to peace, to seeking out a ceasefire, so our brave troops could at least begin to see some light at the end of the tunnel. Instead it was the notion of prolonged warfare. That is not where Canadians want to go.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said: Mr. Speaker, I am speaking again today and, this time, it is in the name of groups and associations who stand up for the rights of the unemployed, as well as in the name of everyone who does not qualify for employment insurance benefits as the insurance program stands, since it does not fit anymore the reality of workers in Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751011"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para751012"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is not much time remaining, it is not too late for the government to finally grand the royal recommendation to this bill, which—I believe I should recall—is supported by all parties represented in the House, except the Conservative Party.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751013"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill aims particularly at reducing nationally each qualifying period by 70 hours. It also aims at increasing the benefit period from 45 to 50 weeks. This would end the “black hole” effect, where unemployed workers find themselves in distress for periods of up to 10 weeks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751014"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill would increase weekly benefits from the current 55% of insurable earnings to 60%—unstable jobs are generally the least well paid, and these changes would provide claimants with the bare minimum. </div>
    </p><a name="Para751015"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill would also eliminate the waiting period between the time when people lose their jobs and apply for benefits and the time when they receive their first cheques—workers should not be penalized for losing their jobs, and they still have financial obligations even if the money is a long time coming. </div>
    </p><a name="Para751016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would also eliminate the presumption that persons related to each other do not deal with each other at arm's length. It is not up to workers to prove their good faith when they lose their jobs; it is up to the system to investigate if there is any doubt. </div>
    </p><a name="Para751017"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill would also increase the maximum yearly insurable earnings from $39,000 to $41,500 and introduce an indexing formula. The current contribution formula is actually a regressive tax that affects low-income earners the most. It is worth noting that the maximum was once $43,000. </div>
    </p><a name="Para751018"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill would calculate benefits based on the 12 best weeks so as not to penalize seasonal workers who sometimes work small weeks. </div>
    </p><a name="Para751019"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government has treated the unemployed with contempt and it did so again in yesterday's Throne Speech. The Bloc Québécois was looking for special measures to help workers in areas affected by the forestry crisis. What was the government's response? It had none. There was no plan and not even a hint of an assistance program for older workers.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using these three objectives, I want therefore to shed light on the perception of the Conservatives towards the unemployed workers and the employment insurance program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751034"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Conservatives say that this is an insurance program to which workers subscribe to receive guaranteed coverage. But in fact, the coverage is far from being guaranteed since, in the latest Employment Insurance Monitoring and Assessment Report, the beneficiaries/unemployed ratio was 44.8%. If more than half of the unemployed workers do not have access to this employment insurance program, how can the Conservatives talk about guaranteed coverage? While all workers subscribe to this insurance, only four out of ten qualify for benefits, and the situation is even more disastrous for women, since only three out of ten qualify.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751035"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second objective, according to the Conservatives, is to promote active participation in the labour market by avoiding the creation of a culture of dependency on employment insurance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751036"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement contradicts the first one by saying that employment insurance is to be used to work. While we are in favour of people returning to the labour market as quickly as possible, the program is quite hardly accessible as it stands. It provides only 55% of insured earnings, which is quite insufficient in creating a culture of dependency. You and I will agree that nobody wishes to be unemployed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751037"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Conservatives, there are workers who prefer to be unemployed even under favourable labour market conditions. I would like the Conservatives to come and say this to the people in my riding, especially these days. The whole northern part of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78575,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78575&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Laurentides—Labelle</A> riding is being hit hard by the crisis in the forest industry, and the Conservatives are certainly not doing anything to help these people.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am talking about 35,000 people who live in the Antoine-Labelle RCM, a one-industry municipality where more than 80% of the local economy depends on the forestry industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751039"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, more than 80% of the plants and sawmills are closed—either indefinitely or permanently—and the ones that are still open have considerably reduced their operations, for an indefinite time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751040"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2004, the most significant job losses in Quebec in the forestry industry occurred in the north of my riding. The people in my riding want to work, but the Conservatives have done nothing to help relaunch the forestry industry and they are doing nothing to give the people at home a decent income to weather this crisis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a system that better suits the needs of Quebec workers would not encourage the unemployed to live on the public purse; it would simply give back a bit of dignity to the workers. That is what Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073177,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073177&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-269</A> is all about. </div>
    </p><a name="Para751042"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third objective expressed by the Conservatives is simply scandalous.

    </p><a name="Para751043"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the mid 1990s, the fund has generated over $50 billion in surplus. Last year alone, $2 billion of it went toward the debt, while over half the unemployed were denied access to insurance and had to turn to social assistance.

    </p><a name="Para751044"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of these three principles expressed by the Conservatives, they must support Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073177,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073177&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-269</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751045"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am putting the Conservatives on notice. If they do not give the workers in Quebec the employment insurance they deserve, the Conservatives will pay for it in the next election. I will make it my duty to remind the electors of Laurentides—Labelle of how their Conservative government took care of the morale of Quebec's unemployed during its mandate.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also find it awful to hear the hon. member say that the bill, with the changes that we want to bring to the current system, would tend to discourage people from rejoining the labour force.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefit period has now ended and people no longer have any option other than welfare.

It is like asking a family that has worked for 30 years in the forestry industry to now do without all its belongings and rely on society, on welfare. Despite the measures taken by the Conservative government, out of the 1,500 workers who have been laid off since January 2007, only two were able to get training to return to work.</div>

    </p><a name="Para751061"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I followed the remarks of previous speakers, I have to say that I found it a little surprising to hear the Bloc asking us to support the bill. The evidence just does not support such a broadly expanded program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751062"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What evidence shows is that the EI system is currently meeting the demands of the vast majority of Canadians. Eighty-three per cent of unemployed Canadians who have paid into the program qualify for benefits and this rises to more than 90% in areas of high unemployment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751063"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence also shows that even claimants in high unemployment regions rarely use more than 70% of the benefits. Where exactly is the evidence to suggest that the changes in the bill are warranted? It is not just that the bill is not supported by the evidence. We see the opposition asking for support of flawed bills with routine frequency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751064"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is so surprising is that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are asking for support on a bill that the sponsor's own party and all opposition parties cared so little about that they refused to do their due diligence. They brought forth no accurate costing estimates, had no public hearings, had no consultation with major stakeholders and had no study on the bill's ramifications to Canadians or to the long term viability of the EI program itself.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751065"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians sent this Conservative government to Ottawa to clean things up, to provide accountability, sound management and good public policy. The bill provides none of this but our government does.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751066"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot support any bill that has been given so little oversight and so little consideration by Parliament, let alone a bill that proposes such drastic and costly changes to a program as important as this, especially when the changes are not backed by a shred of evidence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751067"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Routine motions and decisions about what to have for lunch are given more serious analysis and debate than the one hour and fifteen minutes Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2162674,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2162674&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-269</A> was given by the opposition at committee stage. It is even more puzzling to be asked to support the bill when the Bloc and the opposition parties have been heaping one EI related bill after another onto the order paper asking for implementation of all but prioritizing on none.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751068"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of this bill would cost $3.7 billion, $1.1 billion for Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169678,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169678&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-278</A> and $1.4 billion for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2153906,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2153906&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-265</A>. There are 16 more EI bills to come, 9 of which are too complicated to cost but it is fair to say that they will not be free. It would cost $4.7 billion for the remaining seven bills. The cost of these bills is astronomical and the opposition has supported them all without giving them any careful study.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751069"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bills represent more than $11 billion in new annual spending for the EI account. This would put the program into a deficit within a year and bankrupt the program. Canadians are looking to the government to act responsibly and carefully. They want a government that will ensure the long term viability of the EI system and protect it from a patchwork of proposals made by the opposition, and that is exactly what we are doing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751070"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians expect that if the opposition is proposing to spend billions, it might also spend more than five minutes figuring out whether that much money is needed and where it will come from.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751071"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to the public who are affected by these types of changes in policy seems so basic and yet Canadians have not been consulted. Employers who pay into the fund are concerned. Workers who see deductions on their paycheques are concerned and small business owners are concerned but the opposition did not want to hear from any of these groups.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1905"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1905"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1910"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1900"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1905">(1905)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para751072"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers are left to wonder if Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2162674,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2162674&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-269</A> is better than the measures that this government introduced to extend compassionate care benefits. Is it better than our pilot projects extending benefits for best weeks and seasonal workers, which Canadians were looking for and this government provided?</div>
    </p><a name="Para751073"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member talked about the forestry industry. We do care and that is why we improved and implemented targeted initiatives for older workers to help the vulnerable workers in certain industries that have been affected by layoff, such as the forestry industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751074"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of those initiatives have been implemented since the previous Parliament, which was when the Bloc last proposed this bill and the Liberals last opposed it. Does the Bloc want to scrap all these initiatives in exchange for its bill?</div>
    </p><a name="Para751075"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians appreciate that their new government is getting things done for them in a measured but meaningful way and they expect the same from all the parties in House. However, they are getting the same old, same old from the Bloc Québécois because the same old, same old is all it ever has to offer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751076"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One does not have to look further than the recent byelection results in Quebec to know what Quebeckers think about the Bloc's proposals for this country. Canadians are shocked to see the Bloc propose the same types of changes it has been proposing for more than a decade. It is becoming increasingly clear to the people in Quebec that the Bloc has simply run out of things to say.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751077"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know what Canadians have to say about the Liberal practice of spending public money with little or no oversight. One can imagine the reaction of all Canadians to find that the Bloc now wants to travel down that same road.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751078"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all tired of seeing public funds disappear into black holes, only to be explained as a mistake or worse, as the Auditor General described, “a rule-breaking sponsorship program, a scandal of major proportions”. Canadians want better oversight when it comes to their money and they want better long term planning. This bill goes against all of those principles.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751079"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all watched the cost of the Liberal programs balloon to billions of dollars. We must be very leery of the Bloc's untested assertion that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2162674,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2162674&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-269</A> will cost just over $1 billion to implement when all outside estimates put the real cost at triple or even quadruple that amount.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751080"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is right in their figures? Is the sponsor of the bill correct when she says that it will cost $1.7 billion or is the Conseil du patronat du Québec and others right in pegging it at $3.7 billion? This would have been a prime question for the committee to have considered but unfortunately they did not bother seeking the input of witnesses like the Conseil du patronat, hard-working Canadians or even the Department of Human Resources and Social Development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751081"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Canadians have confidence in this bill when they were completely cut out of the process by the opposition? A true and meaningful inquiry into Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2162674,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2162674&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-269</A> and the many unanswered questions around the bill would have gone a long way toward giving Canadians and this government confidence in a bill like this. Unfortunately, the opposition did not care enough to do its due diligence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751082"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Canadian public went to the polls to choose a new government, they elected a Conservative government because they knew that we understood accountability. We know that accountability does not just mean explaining money that was spent last year. It means being able to plan expenditures before they go out of control.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751083"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are asking the questions Canadians want asked because we know that the answers are important. However, without those answers and without the confidence of Canadians we cannot support this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751084"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government's record of measured improvements to the EI program proves that we have made EI a priority by our approach. However, our approach will not be piecemeal. We will look at the entirety of the EI program and not just one small aspect of it. Canadians expect more from this minister than that. They want him to properly manage a program that benefits the whole country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751085"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night's Speech from the Throne outlined this government's priorities and reconfirmed our commitment to make the EI system responsive to Canadians' needs. We will continue to take measures to improve the governance and management of the employment insurance account and we will ensure that these changes are measured and responsible. I look forward to the minister's next steps in improving the EI program, which I am sure will be presented in the House in due course.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that last May the entire Liberal caucus stood in the House to vote in support of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073177,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073177&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-269</A> at report stage.

    </p><a name="Para751088"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During that period we worked cooperatively with other opposition parties on amendments that we thought would improve the main elements of this bill. We negotiated not only with colleagues in this House, but also with organizations and unions that have long sought changes to the employment insurance system.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had hoped that the bill would go to third and final reading and then to the Senate for deliberations there, but unfortunately that was blocked when the government refused to give royal recommendation. It does not want to give any more money to improve employment insurance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751091"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of us wonder why the government would reject outright the effort of all opposition parties to make improvements when there is a $14 billion surplus in Canada. If last night's throne speech is any indication, we should be concerned. In the throne speech, one sentence referenced employment insurance where it said:</div>
    </p><a name="Para751092"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Our Government will also take measures to improve the governance and management of the Employment Insurance Account. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para751093"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh-oh, that is not good news. The knees we see shaking are those of Canadian workers, because most Canadians know that when Conservatives mention that they are looking to “improve” a social program such as EI, it is usually the opposite. In many cases the Conservatives tend to slash the program because of their ideological distaste to help those who need help the most.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751094"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they said in the Speech from the Throne was a vague statement that is worrisome. It is certainly worrisome in my province of Nova Scotia and in New Brunswick, throughout rural Canada and Quebec and large parts of this nation where employment insurance has become a very important part of our social infrastructure. I would not be surprised to see this be the thin edge of the wedge, so to speak: maternity benefits, sick benefits and using EI as a tool to send more Canadians, Atlantic Canadians, out west.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know of the significant elements in the Conservative caucus who do not believe that the social programs we have built up are worthwhile. There are a lot of other examples of legislation brought forth by members who want to improve the lives of Canadians but which have been rejected by the government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para751096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary who just spoke said that this bill was not based on a foundation, that it was not costed and not well thought out. This bill has a lot of merit, but let me talk about another bill on EI brought forward by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78815,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78815&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sydney—Victoria</A>.</div>

    </p><a name="Para751104"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original proposal was to lower the qualifying period to 360 hours of work across the board. It was adjusted to a flat 70 hour reduction. For us, we also made a proposal to eliminate the distinction between new entrants and re-entrants. It was amended. We believe there should be some disincentive for people to enter the employment insurance system the first time. If they need it, they should have it, but if it is made too easy, people become dependent upon that system, so that distinction was eliminated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other proposed changes in the bill would eliminate the two week waiting period. People need employment insurance because they need it, not because they want it. Why aggravate the situation? Why insult people by saying they have to wait two weeks to get employment insurance?</div>
    </p><a name="Para751106"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five week black hole at the end was also eliminated as part of the bill. I think that makes sense. I wrote down what the parliamentary secretary just said in referring to how people are tired of money disappearing down black holes. Is employment insurance a black hole? Are people who are out of work through no fault of their own a black hole in Canada? Or are they part of the social infrastructure that we are proud to have built up in this nation? I think it is the latter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751107"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been a number of private members' bills on EI. Since the 1990s, EI has been put on a solid footing. There were many years in the 1970s and 1980s when income going to the EI fund was in fact less than was paid out. In other words, there was a deficit. </div>
    </p><a name="Para751108"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, deficit or surplus, it all goes into the consolidated revenue fund, but for many years we were paying out a lot more than we were paying in because of the economy. The Liberal government of the 1990s fixed the economy so more money was being paid in than paid out. </div>

You guys just picked the flowers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751110"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr. Michael Savage: </B> We now have some amount of money every year that is considered surplus. It does not get carried from year to year. It comes out of the consolidated revenue fund. In my view it is time to look at that system and say, “Now that we have made the system sustainable, we should be doing more to help the people who need help”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751111"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004 we started some pilot projects so that we extended benefits to people who actually needed them. Over the 10 years between mid-1990 and mid-2000, we drastically reduced premiums for those who pay premiums. The system is actuarially evaluated every year, but we still have a surplus. I think we should look at that surplus. It is an insurance system. To me, what we put in and what we pay out should balance. </div>
    </p><a name="Para751112"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an opportunity for us to do something. The bill is part of that. It is not the only thing. Part time workers, low income workers, and persons who are self-employed, including many in our artistic and cultural community, do not and cannot apply for employment insurance. We should look at doing more to increase the productivity of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751113"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the bill. It is not the only thing we should do, but in my view it is one of the things we should do to fully recognize that people who are receiving employment insurance are doing so not because they want to but because they have to.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751114"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada we have built up a social infrastructure that makes us unique in some ways. I am proud of that social infrastructure. Large parts of Canada need that social infrastructure. In fact, at a time when the economy is doing well, having been turned around in the 1990s, it is now the time to reinvest in a lot of programs. We should be doing more on poverty and we should be doing more to help people get educated, but we should also be doing more to ensure that people who need help because they have been thrown out of work through no fault of their own have access to the money in the EI system.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fairly difficult to remain seated when listening to all that was said. However, that is part of our responsibilities.

My only problem is that they were the ones, between 1993 and 2006 and especially in 1996, who made cuts. These draconian cuts to employment insurance led us to where we are today. Yet they had an opportunity to make changes. It was not until they were in opposition that they saw the light at the end of the tunnel. It is unfortunate that they did not see it when they were in power. In view of the $54 billion surplus, it is quite unreasonable.</div>

    </p><a name="Para751121"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe they have forgotten the definition of employment insurance. It is not public money, but money that belongs to workers and employers. Unfortunately, employers have had to lay off workers, and people have lost their jobs. Employment insurance is special insurance that helps men and women who have lost their jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751122"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I hear the government say that people are dependent on employment insurance or are abusing the system and I see that the government took $54 billion from the employment insurance fund to pay the debt and wipe out the deficit, I wonder just who is dependent on employment insurance. Who is dependent on it? Who is suffering as a result?</div>
    </p><a name="Para751123"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the government has nothing to be proud of.

    </p><a name="Para751124"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073177,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073177&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-269</A> call for? I would have liked something better. I would have liked people to qualify for employment insurance after 350 or 360 hours. The three opposition parties agreed that each stage could be reduced by 70 hours. People who qualified for employment insurance after 420 hours could qualify after 350 hours, people who qualified after 910 hours could qualify after 840 and people who qualified after 700 could qualify after 630.

    </p><a name="Para751127"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I introduced a bill in the House of Commons with 14 proposed changes to the employment insurance system, the Liberals and the Conservatives voted against it. I tried again with bills that would have cost a mere $350 million. Again they voted against them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751128"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speech from the Throne scares me. Canada's Conservative government is telling us that it will take steps to improve the governance and management of the employment insurance fund. I am afraid because I think that the Conservatives will make yet more changes to employment insurance that will take even more away from families in need.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751129"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen that the government is perfectly capable of depriving a family of two weeks' salary. The waiting period after losing a job is two weeks. How can they deprive people who work seasonally, who work in fishing, forestry, tourism and other industries, of two weeks' pay? How can they deprive these families of benefits that will help them pay for groceries or things their children need for school? How can the government say that it represents Canadians and workers and that it is acting in workers' best interest?</div>
    </p><a name="Para751130"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been told that 83% of workers can or do qualify for employment insurance. That is not true. We have checked. Only 38% of men in Canada qualify for employment insurance. Only 32% of women qualify.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751131"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073177,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073177&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-269</A> would also increase the benefit period by five weeks. What would the government rather do? It does not want people in Atlantic Canada, in Quebec or in northern Ontario who have seasonal jobs to qualify for employment insurance. It wants them to go work in Alberta where there are jobs for them. It is heartless. It makes families miserable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751132"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have to leave their family. A man who goes to Alberta gets a call from his wife who tells him if he does not come home, they are getting a divorce. He is forced to leave his job and return to his family. Even though the law is clear on the fact that one can leave employment for family reasons, the federal government turns around and cuts employment insurance. Is that the kind of system it wants? This is unacceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751133"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073177,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073177&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-269</A> is a reasonable bill. It does not use public funds. These are funds that belong to the workers and not to the general funds the Conservative government uses to pay down the debt. Absolutely not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751134"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would eliminate the presumption that persons related to each other do not deal with each other at arm's length. How many times have we seen the example of a person who works for their brother-in-law, sister-in-law, sister or brother. When people apply for employment insurance, they are asked the following discriminatory question, among others: are you related to your employer? An investigation is automatically launched. People have to wait 40 or 50 days to find out whether they are entitled to employment insurance or not. This is totally discriminatory.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751135"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I am sure there is someone listening to me who lost their employment and received severance pay. Even if he gets employment insurance benefits, the government is still there to take away the severance pay. This causes the claimant more problems, instead of helping him find a new job or start a small business. Not once has the federal government, neither the Conservatives nor the Liberals, ever helped workers.</div>

In my opinion, she represents all workers in Quebec, but particularly those from her riding, for whom she does an extraordinary job. I think that her speech today was very representative of the work she does in her riding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751140"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to congratulate and honour all the advocacy groups for the unemployed in Quebec and the other provinces, which are doing incredible work to defend people who are experiencing difficulties and who must deal with this infamous program that has been damaged by two successive governments. They are doing extraordinary work. In Quebec, I am thinking in particular of everyone working for the Sans-Chemise coalition, the labour federations, the groups of unemployed workers, the Conseil national des chômeurs and MASSE. I must say that the reason we have made it to third reading with this bill—and this is the first time this has happened—is because of their efforts and because of our work with the two other opposition parties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751141"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing honourable about the route the Liberals took with the Employment Insurance Act. However, we must recognize that efforts are now being made. Sometimes, with an election defeat comes wisdom and a greater understanding of the least advantaged in our society. I think that is where the Liberal Party is at right now. This needs to be acknowledged. The NDP has always been consistent and in agreement with us when it comes to defending the unemployed.</div>

At the same time, it is important to remember one thing: as the two main parties in the House acknowledged today, the economy is booming. It has been a long time since the economy was this dynamic, and we have lost sight of the fact that hundreds and thousands of people are losing their jobs. I do not have to go far for examples. In the past four or five years, 125,000 jobs have been lost in the manufacturing sector. In the forestry sector, 25,000 jobs have been lost, and just recently, a large number of manufacturing jobs have been lost. </div>
    </p><a name="Para751143"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every region is affected, including regions represented by members who are currently in power. In Quebec, in the riding of Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles, shoe manufacturers have been laying people off for two years. In Saint-Émile, for instance, several hundred workers have lost their jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the member done for them? What did he do to make sure the throne speech contained some minimal measures to remedy the situation? The Conservatives are in power. Nothing. Nyet.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is the same in the Mégantic—L'Érable riding. The hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78413,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78413&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Mégantic—L'Érable</A> is also the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105844,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105844&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Secretary of State (Agriculture)</A>. It is an important position. But what has he done for the people who just lost their jobs at the Bell mine in Thetford Mines? He knew about it for a month, but the Speech from the Throne makes no mention of it. Yet, the Conservatives are in power. They say they must be elected, because they will do something for these people. They are in power, yet they do nothing. They say we do nothing here, but we are not the ones in power.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least we have the ability to indicate to the other parties where the problems lie and how to correct them. They, on the other hand, were elected to properly administer and to ease the suffering of our workers, yet they are not doing so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751147"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was completely dismayed to see there was nothing for these people in the throne speech. In <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78609,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78609&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Jonquière—Alma</A>, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78744,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78744&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Labour</A>'s riding, hundreds of people have been laid off over the past two years. Nevertheless, there is nothing for the POWA program or to correct employment insurance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751148"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even worse, they are about to vote against the bill. That goes against the interests of the people they represent. Then they strut about in other ridings, saying that the Bloc and the NDP do nothing, that they are the ones in power and that we should trust them. That is fine. When they have the chance to put their money where their mouth is, as it were, they fail to do so. It is shameful.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751149"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then they ask us to elect them? Something is wrong with this picture. Someone, somewhere, is deceiving someone, and it is not us.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. I listened to the leaders of the two main parties speak about it. What an opportunity and what a wonderful coincidence. Today we are speaking about a bill to enact measures to alleviate poverty. Poverty is not an act of divine providence, but rather the result of human action, of whether or not we have appropriate measures in place. </div>
    </p><a name="Para751151"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have the opportunity to signal our intention to vote for a tangible measure to alleviate poverty, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2162674,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2162674&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-269</A>.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my NDP colleague just mentioned, less than 45% of all workers who pay into employment insurance can hope to receive benefits should they have the misfortune of losing their jobs. When a person who pays into the employment insurance fund loses their job and is not eligible for benefits because the eligibility requirements have been tightened so much, they are not the only one who is plunged into poverty. Their family is also affected. The region is also prevented from receiving an influx of money that belongs to these workers and that would improve the local economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751153"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers and employers pay into the fund, but the money is kept in Ottawa. In the regions, the cuts to this program represent an annual loss of roughly $30 million per riding. Ultimately, it is the provinces that have to bear the burden of supporting these people financially through welfare or other programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751154"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is injustice right down the line. With Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2162674,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2162674&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-269</A>, we have the opportunity to correct this situation in part. Earlier, the parliamentary secretary talked about costs. I will tone down the rhetoric here; this is demagoguery. When the government adds up the costs of measures in various bills that are actually included in a single bill, Bill C-269, and gets $11 billion, it is deliberately trying to mislead people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751155"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that there has been no meaningful inquiry. I have here a document from Malcolm Brown, Assistant Deputy Minister of Human Resources and Social Development, dated December 7, 2005, that details all the costs. If Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2162674,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2162674&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-269 </A>is adopted as is, it will cost $1.9 billion. In the past 10 years, the employment insurance fund has always generated an annual surplus of over $3 billion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para751156"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where will the money come from? It will come from the fund that belongs to the workers and employers. That is where it will come from.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative Party must grant the royal recommendation. Then we will believe it is sincere. In fact, it can do so. There is a precedent concerning an employment insurance bill. If it refuses to do so, it will again be acting against the interests of workers and families.</div>
