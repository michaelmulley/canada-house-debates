	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House today to 
announce that I intend to refer to the Supreme Court of Canada 
certain specific questions of great importance to all Canadians.
<P>
	Let me begin by reaffirming our deep conviction that our great 
country will remain strong and united both into and beyond the 
next century.
<P>
	On two occasions in the recent past the majority of Quebecers 
have voted for a united Canada. Notwithstanding those democratic 
expressions of the popular will, the current government of the 
province of Quebec seems determined to bring the issue to a third 
vote at some future time. Moreover, it claims to be entitled to make 
a unilateral declaration of independence to create a separate state of 
Quebec.
<P>
	In our view that position is contrary to Canadian law, is 
unsupported by international law and is deeply threatening to the 
orderly governance of our nation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If another referendum is to be held, we are convinced that the 
population of Quebec will note in favour of a united Canada a third 
time, and that they will do so because a united Canada is the better 
option, for themselves and for their children.
<P>
	And just as Quebecers have chosen to stay within Canada in the 
past when they were asked to make a choice, Canadians 
everywhere know that Quebec's inclusion is essential to preserving 
the country that we cherish.
<P>
	As a Canadian who makes his home in Toronto, I can speak very 
personally in saying that, without Quebec, the magnificent dream 
and the shining ideal that is Canada would simply not exist.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	However, we cannot avoid the serious difficulties created by the 
Quebec government's assertion that there is a right to secede from 
Canada through a unilateral declaration of independence.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec has expressly stated that the 
Constitution and the courts have no role to play in determining the 
correctness of its position. As we have argued in court and as I have 
asserted here in this House, we believe its position to be profoundly 
wrong.
<P>
	To leave this issue unresolved would pose a serious threat to 
orderly government in Quebec and in the rest of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1005 )</B>
<P>
	The Government of Canada does not argue against the 
legitimacy of a consultative referendum. A referendum is an 
opportunity for a government to consult with the people. But 
however important that consultation may be, the result of a 
referendum does not in and of itself effect legal change.
<P>
	It is terribly important to remember that in the Canadian context 
there is no political justification to argue for a unilateral 
declaration of independence by the Quebec National Assembly.
<P>
	In most countries the very idea of secession would be rejected. 
But that has not been so in Canada. There have been two referenda 
in Quebec. The leading political figures of all the provinces and 
indeed the Canadian public have long agreed that this country will 
not be held together against the will of Quebecers clearly 
expressed. And this government agrees with that statement.
<P>
	This position arises partly out of our traditions of tolerance and 
mutual respect but also because we know instinctively that the 
quality and the functioning of our democracy requires the broad 
consent of all Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4708"> 4708 </A></B>
<P>
	Regrettably, the view of the current Quebec government on the 
nature and the role of a referendum is quite different. We have 
therefore concluded that the responsible and the effective thing 
to do is submit this issue for determination by the Supreme Court 
of Canada.
<P>
	Let me be very clear. This issue is of enormous significance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A unilateral declaration of independence would undermine 
political stability, interrupt the prevailing order and cast into doubt 
the interests and rights of Quebecers and all Canadians.
<P>
	A unilateral declaration of independence would create the most 
serious difficulties for ordinary Quebecers. There would be 
widespread uncertainty within Quebec about which legal regime 
was effectively in control.
<P>
	For the average citizen, business or institution in Quebec, there 
would be the greatest confusion. Individual Quebecers would be 
uncertain what laws applied, what courts and law officiers to 
respect, to whom to pay their taxes.
<P>
	In such an environment, it is certain that Quebec society would 
be deeply divided over the course the provincial government would 
have adopted.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Moreover, such a unilateral declaration of independence would 
have been made in the absence of an agreement with the rest of 
Canada on such fundamental issues as recognition for Quebec 
internationally, trade and economic arrangements, the rights of 
citizens to move within the country, the sharing of public debt and 
assets, the use of currency and scores of other issues.
<P>
	Quebec would likely find itself, after a UDI, with no recognition 
by all or most of the international community, unable to manage its 
relations with sovereign states. Quebec would be unable to issue 
recognized passports for its citizens or to represent their interests 
abroad. Its unilateral act would make it virtually impossible to 
issue public debt on international markets. In other words, the idea 
of a unilateral declaration of independence makes no sense no 
matter how it is considered.
<P>
	The issue is not just a mere legal nicety. It is also of enormous 
practical significance. Any government that suggests it would 
throw Quebec and all of Canada into the confusion of a unilateral 
declaration of independence is being profoundly irresponsible. It is 
a formula for chaos.
<P>
	I firmly believe we shall never reach the point of having to deal 
with the reality of Quebec's separation. This nation shall endure.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	Should such a day ever come, there is no doubt that it could only 
be achieved through negotiation and through agreement. The 
<P>
Government of Canada believes that both our Constitution and 
international law protects us against the irresponsibility of a 
unilateral declaration of independence, and that is the very issue we 
shall be taking for determination to the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I have stressed, our nation is built on shared values of 
tolerance, accommodation and mutual respect. Canadians are 
admired throughout the world because of our understanding of the 
need to accommodate one another to achieve our larger common 
purposes.
<P>
	In this respect, we share a commitment to using negociation and 
orderly processes to work out differences-something that 
Canadian individuals and businesses do every day. This 
commitment is what the international community has come to 
expect of Canada and to admire.
<P>
	Canadians' shared values have guided us in the past and will 
continue to do so in the future. All Canadians, including 
Quebecers, can take pride in the civility and tolerence we have 
shown one another in dealing with this fundamental issue. There is 
every reason to believe that civility will continue.
<P>
	Our insistence on resolving questions raised by the prospect of 
Quebec secession through an orderly process and within the 
framework of law is simply consistent with those values.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	However remote the possibility that a future referendum would 
reject Canada, it is essential that the legal framework that has 
enabled us to resolve our differences as Canadians peacefully and 
co-operatively be clearly established now, in advance of a 
referendum.
<P>
	That is the reason we became involved in the Bertrand litigation 
before the Quebec superior court last May. It was only after the 
attorney general of Quebec brought a motion last spring to dismiss 
that litigation that we decided to involve ourselves, and then only 
because of the grounds relied upon by the attorney general of 
Quebec in bringing his motion.
<P>
	The attorney general of Quebec based his motion on the 
argument that neither the courts nor the Constitution of this country 
have any relevance to the process that the Quebec government 
intends to follow in advocating separation, but that international 
law alone applies.
<P>
	It was my obligation as the Attorney General of Canada, as the 
custodian of the Constitution of our country, to respond in the 
courtroom. There we argued that the Constitution is not only 
relevant but governing, that the courts have jurisdiction to deal 
with these issues.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4709"> 4709 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition, we argued that the Quebec government would have 
no right either under international law or otherwise to make a 
unilateral declaration of independence.
<P>
	We submitted that while there are some limited circumstances in 
which international law provides a people with the right to secede 
unilaterally from an existing country, none of those circumstances 
exist in the case of Quebec within Canada. I may point out that our 
conclusions in that regard were largely consistent with the opinions 
expressed by five experts in international law, retained in 1991 by 
the commission dealing with the issues relating to Quebec 
sovereignty, established by the Government of Quebec itself.
<P>
	When I welcomed the decision of Mr. Justice Pidgeon of the 
Quebec superior court on August 30 last, I noted in particular that 
by deciding that the court had jurisdiction to deal with the 
questions before it, Mr. Justice Pidgeon had confirmed the primacy 
of the rule of law.
<P>
	What is this rule of law? What is its practical meaning, its social 
value? Is it simply a technicality used to overrule democratic 
decisions that the federal government does not agree with?
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	First and foremost, the rule of law, as it has developed in Canada 
and in other democratic nations around the world, is not simply a 
legal abstraction or a technical precept. It is a living principle that 
is fundamental to our democratic way of life. In substance, it 
means that everyone in our society, including ministers of 
government, premiers, the rich and powerful and the ordinary 
citizen alike is governed by the same law of the land. We are all 
bound by the Constitution, by the Criminal Code, by acts of 
Parliament and the legislatures. In cases of dispute regarding the 
application or interpretation of law, the courts are the ultimate 
arbiter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The great value of the Rule of Law is that it is democratic. Its 
substance is derived from our democratic institutions. It applies to 
everyone without qualification. It also permits democracy to 
flourish because it establishes a stable framework within which the 
democratic process can work.
<P>
	The separatist leaders argue that the Rule of Law is simply a ruse 
by which the Canadian Government intends to defeat an expression 
of democratic will by Quebecers-a trick to deny the results of a 
lost referendum. They argue that to require an orderly process 
within the legal framework would place Quebec in a straightjacket, 
defeating the democratic result of a future referendum.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Such arguments are made for political effect. They are based on 
the misunderstanding that the rule of law and democratic action are 
<P>
somehow mutually exclusive. That is quite wrong. In fact, they 
coexist in harmony. The safety of both depends upon the integrity 
of each. The failure to observe either endangers the two at once.
<P>
	Simply to insist upon an orderly process is not to foreclose the 
acceptance of change. Let us be vigilant to ensure that the true issue 
of the day is kept before us. The issue is not whether a democracy 
such as Canada can keep a population against its will. Of course, it 
cannot. The issue arises from the false claim by the Government of 
Quebec that it alone, in a unilateral fashion that changes according 
to its short term political interests, can decide the process that may 
lead to secession.
<P>
	Quebecers as well as their fellow citizens across Canada would 
be dramatically affected by the break-up of our country. Everyone 
has the right to be certain that the process is lawful, mutually 
acceptable and fair to all.
<P>
	That brings me to our decision to take steps intended to clarify 
the legal issues that have arisen between the Government of 
Canada and the Government of Quebec. It is my intention to refer 
to the Supreme Court of Canada three specific questions for a 
decision by that court on the fundamental issues that have arisen.
<P>
	Here are the questions we will be asking the court:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Under the Constitution of Canada, can the National Assembly, 
legislature of Government of Quebec effect the secession of 
Quebec from Canada unilaterally?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Second, does international law give the National Assembly, the 
legislature or the Government of Quebec the right to effect the 
secession of Quebec from Canada unilaterally? In this regard, is 
there a right to self-determination under international law that 
would give the National Assembly, the legislature or the 
Government of Quebec the right to effect the secession of Quebec 
from Canada unilaterally?
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Third, in the event of a conflict between domestic and 
international law on the right of the National Assembly, legislature 
or Government of Quebec to effect the secession of Quebec from 
Canada unilaterally, which would take precedence in Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It will be evident that these questions build upon the 
fundamental issues identified by the hon. Mr. Justice Pidgeon in his 
judgment rendered last August 30 in the Bertrand litigation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4710"> 4710 </A></B>
<P>
	While it would have been possible for the Government of 
Canada to continue in the Bertrand litigation and to argue these 
points at trial, we have, on such fundamental issues a duty as a 
national government to ensure that they are brought to the courts 
directly with a view to an early and definitive judgment. We have 
therefore decided to go to the highest court in the land and to ask 
it to address these questions as soon as conveniently possible.
<P>
	I also wish to emphasize that the very questions we are putting 
before the court and those that arose from the judgment of Mr. 
Justice Pidgeon in Bertrand resulted directly from the position 
taken by the attorney general of Quebec in the Bertrand litigation. I 
have therefore referred to the Supreme Court of Canada in concise 
form the fundamental matters put at issue by the Government of 
Quebec itself in moving to dismiss Mr. Bertrand's lawsuit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have written to the Attorney General of Quebec urging him to 
participate in the proceedings before the Supreme Court of Canada. 
It is obvious that there are profound differences in our respective 
views about these crucial legal matters. 
<P>
	In keeping with our long tradition in this country, consistent with 
our values of civility and respect for democratic institutions, I call 
upon the Attorney General of Quebec to join me in a full, frank and 
open discussion of the very issues he has raised in the place where 
they are best resolved: in the highest court of the land.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me emphasize something that this government has tried to 
make clear from the outset. The rule of law is not an obstacle to 
change. It permits change to take place in an orderly way. It allows 
Canadians to alter and to adjust to their institutions in a fashion that 
reflects our values of consensus, of dialogue and of 
accommodation. I have every confidence that the courts will 
endorse and accept the position that I have put forward. 
Nonetheless, it is for the courts to make that determination and we 
will of course respect and abide by the results.
<P>
	There is every reason for Canadians across this great land to be 
optimistic about the future of our country. We must continue to 
work to avoid ever having to deal with an attempt at secession. The 
world would never understand the failure of a country like Canada 
which embodies in so many ways that which is best in the human 
spirit. Indeed, Canadians would never forgive themselves.
<P>
	Our common objective must be to continue to work together to 
improve our government, to make the case for Canada in Quebec 
and to celebrate the great distinctiveness of Quebec as a 
fundamental characteristic of our country.
<P>
	The Canadian government is committed to doing all of that in 
partnership with all of the provincial and  territorial governments 
of this country. Whatever happens, we must continue to deal with 
one another with respect, with tolerance, through accommodation 
and within the law. That is democracy.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Saint-Hubert.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
told that the federal government intends to seek the Supreme 
Court's opinion on the legality of Quebec's eventual accession to 
sovereignty.
<P>
	Unlike what the Minister of Justice said at the beginning of his 
speech, I am convinced, and so are my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois, that the people of Quebec will vote in favour of a 
sovereign Quebec in the next referendum.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Sixty per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> They will do so because it is the best option for 
them and for future generations.
<P>
	The close results of the last referendum are probably behind the 
federal government's decision to seek the opinion of the Supreme 
Court on the legality of Quebec's sovereignty.
<P>
	This reference to the Supreme Court of Canada is in line with the 
federal strategy that subordinates the legitimate right of the people 
of Quebec to accede democratically to sovereignty to the rule of 
law.
<P>
	Both the Bloc Quebecois and the Quebec government have 
always said that accession to sovereignty is above all a political 
matter and not one that should be decided by the courts.
<P>
	Oddly enough, in August 1995, shortly before the last 
referendum held in Quebec, the Minister of Justice said in a public 
statement that it was important to respect the democratic vote of 
Quebecers on the matter of sovereignty. To him it was a political, 
not a legal question.
<P>
	I think it is also surprising that last spring, the Minister of Justice 
said that the federal government's participation in the Bertrand 
case was basically motivated by the involvement of the provincial 
government.
<P>
	Since the Quebec government has withdrawn from this case, 
why has he now decided not only to withdraw from the Bertrand 
case but to pursue the matter alone before the Supreme Court?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is because of the close results of the last referendum that the 
federal government is now asking the Supreme  Court for its 
opinion on the legality of Quebec sovereignty. Resorting to the 
Supreme Court is part of the federal government's plan B strategy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4711"> 4711 </A></B>
<P>
which involves making the legitimacy of Quebecers' democratic 
accession to sovereignty subordinate to the rule of law.
<P>
	Now that it is afraid of losing, the federal government is trying to 
throw doubt on the entire Quebec referendum process and to 
impose its own referendum laws. The feds have lost the political 
battle and are turning to the courts in order to save face.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The federal government's justification for its reference to the 
Supreme Court is based essentially on the concept of the rule of 
law.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	However, when referendums were called in 1980 and 1995, this 
did not meet with legal objections from the federal government, 
which was, in fact, a major participant.
<P>
	We saw this as a political acknowledgment of the process 
initiated by Quebec for its accession to sovereignty. In fact, it also 
acknowledged the legitimacy of the exercise initiated by the 
Government of Quebec.
<P>
	The federal government must realize that the rule of law should 
always be justified by a respect for the democratic values and 
principles that prevail in our society. The rule of law should never 
take precedence over the will and the legitimate right of the people 
of Quebec to accede democratically to sovereignty.
<P>
	We have said many times, and I say it again today, that the 
exercise initiated by the province of Quebec needs no definition by 
the courts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
begin today by indicating that the Reform Party is in support of the 
reference of these questions to the Supreme Court of Canada. 
Clearly the vagueness and unpreparedness of the country on this 
profound question of the rule of law cannot be allowed to continue.
<P>
	We offer this support in spite of the fact that we have profound 
differences with the Liberal government about the nature of Canada 
and the way this issue should be handled in other regards. 
Reformers do not believe in its vision of a centralized and 
unreformed Canadian Confederation. We also do not agree with its 
approach on matters such as language policy, the approach it has 
taken on national unity and we are still concerned about the 
vagueness it has on many of the issues that relate not only to 
keeping the country together but to contingencies in the event the 
country should have to face the problem of Quebec secession.
<P>
	I would also like to express to the minister, before I continue, not 
just my agreement of his actions but that I appreciate his 
co-operation in discussing these matters with us and in fully 
informing us of the actions the government is prepared to take.
<P>
	I also think it would be appropriate on behalf of all Canadians to 
acknowledge the role of Mr. Bertrand in bringing this matter to the 
attention of the courts in the first place.
<P>
	Let me make a couple of comments about the specifics of the 
government's reference. Generally the government has referred the 
correct questions to the Supreme Court. I am concerned, however, 
about some of the wording relating to international law, as the court 
may be reluctant to express an opinion on that matter.
<P>
	Also, the reference does not address the critical question of by 
what means Quebec secession or the secession of any province 
could occur under the Constitution and whether the Constitution 
can be used to address that question. I do not see those in the 
questions that the minister has asked the court and there is 
somewhat of a deficiency in that regard.
<P>
	We view this as only a first step. To the extent that the 
government is increasingly prepared to look at plan B options, it 
must be prepared to table a legislative framework for such a 
contingency and also to take greater efforts to inform the Quebec 
population of not just the possible cost but the consequences and 
possible conditions of their secession.
<P>
<B>(1035 )</B>
<P>
	I would point out that our position is not new and is not the result 
of the referendum campaign. Indeed, we made our position on 
these issues clear a very long time ago.
<P>
	As early as October 1994, after the election of the current 
separatist government, I raised questions in the House about the 
legality and constitutionality of the Quebec secession question. I 
point out that ministers and parliamentary secretaries refused to 
answer. They said that the Constitution did not address these issues 
and that the position was strictly hypothetical.
<P>
	I would also point out that they went farther and I think to the 
detriment of federalism in the last referendum campaign. They 
denied the importance of these realities. The Prime Minister 
indicated that a majority vote in favour of secession would not 
necessarily lead to the separation of Quebec. This, in our view, was 
a very dangerous factor in convincing the population of Quebec 
that the yes option was not a risky one.
<P>
	On referendum night we became aware that not only was the 
Government of Quebec serious about its unilateral plans for 
separation but in fact had made extensive arrangements and 
preparations for a unilateral declaration of independence. Clearly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4712"> 4712 </A></B>
<P>
this was not a hypothetical question from their point of view and 
given  the result of the referendum it cannot be treated 
hypothetically now.
<P>
	The minister is unclear or sending mixed messages when he says 
that he views a possible yes vote in a future referendum as remote 
or unlikely. We have to face the fact that we are dealing with this 
question precisely because of the results of the last referendum. We 
have to take the expression of the people of Quebec seriously and 
tell them that when they vote yes it has consequences and those 
consequences may some day be separation. We cannot just dismiss 
the results of the last referendum. We must admit they are 
responsible for the heightened awareness of the danger of this 
problem throughout Canada.
<P>
	I would also point out that not only have we supported this 
position for some time, and we did discuss freely the implications 
of unilateral separation in the last referendum, but we also, 
immediately after the referendum, published our formal position 
on these issues. We have published a document called ``the 20-20'' 
which includes not only our 20 proposals for the reform and 
decentralization of Canadian federation, but also our 20 proposals 
for contingencies for the rest of the country in the event that 
Quebec should vote to secede. These are based on three very 
fundamental principles which the government is finally expressing. 
These are respect for democratic consent of the people, respect for 
the rule of law and the primacy of the protection of the interests of 
all loyal Canadians.
<P>
	I realize that in making this decision, the Government of Canada 
will face fairly serious criticism, indeed fairly serious political 
challenges from its so-called federalist friends in Quebec. In 
particular, I want to point to the leader of the federal Progressive 
Conservative Party and the leader of the Quebec Liberal Party.
<P>
	Members will recall that in the dying days of the last referendum 
campaign, it is my view that these two individuals ambushed the 
rest of Canada with their demands for special status. I believe 
ultimately, although I do not imagine my colleagues will admit it, 
they ambushed the Prime Minister also. They have maintained that 
there is a necessity for a plan A that is extremely generous to 
virtually any demand that comes from the Government of Quebec, 
but they are not prepared to contemplate any aspect of a plan B.
<P>
	This is, in our view, a tremendous contradiction: that the threat 
of Quebec's separation is great enough that the country should be 
prepared to make not just concessions but virtually any concession 
to deal with it. However, it is not to be viewed as serious enough 
that we should in any way plan any contingency to defend the 
interests of the rest of the country.
<P>
	These people are tremendous at flag waving and great PR events 
when they want to get up and say to the rest of the country that they 
oppose Quebec sovereignty. Today they are finally being asked to 
show that they are  prepared to support Canadian sovereignty. What 
this issue is about and the reference of this case to the Supreme 
<P>
Court, in our view, is precisely the opposite of what the premier of 
Quebec has said. Canada is a real country. Quebec is a province of 
that country, and that is nothing to be ashamed of.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to speak of the position of the Bloc Quebecois. I 
must point out that, over the years, the position of the Bloc and of 
the sovereignist movement has changed. As one example, Mr. 
Lévesque himself proposed a referendum solely as a public 
consultation, admitting that he ought to negotiate Quebec's final 
change of status with the rest of Canada.
<P>
	It is also difficult for us in the rest of Canada to understand Mr. 
Bouchard's position, when he says that he supports not only 
sovereignty but also sovereignty-partnership with the rest of 
Canada. To have a partnership, there must be partners. In this 
world, partnerships need to be negotiated. This is impossible, and 
evidence of the lack of maturity of the sovereignist movement, in 
thinking that it can have a partnership that is unilateral. Not only is 
this a misconception of human nature, it is also untrue to the nature 
of relations between sovereign states.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that the Bloc Quebecois is opposed 
to this idea because, in its eyes, it supports the voice of democracy. 
I must point out too that, on two occasions, the voice of democracy 
has rejected Quebec sovereignty. I think I am in agreement with the 
members of the government as well, in saying that it is time for the 
government of Quebec to start respecting these expressions of the 
voice of democracy.

<P>
	I will conclude by addressing the questions and the fears we all 
have as Canadians in the shadow of the last referendum. There are 
those who continue to insist for whatever reason that the possibility 
of Quebec's separation should not be taken seriously. There may be 
votes, there may be upheavals, there may be dislocation, but 
Quebec will never separate.
<P>
	I have never taken this position. My understanding of Quebec is 
that as profoundly as I disagree with the position of the separatists, 
it is a position that is honestly held by many. While I think it is 
unfortunate and historically was avoidable, there are good 
explanations for the existence of this movement.
<P>
	Will Quebec leave? I do not believe it will but it is possible. 
However, it would be profoundly unfortunate should that occur.
<P>
	We believe that the struggle occurring in the province of Quebec 
today is a struggle that is going on in many parts of the world as we 
emerge from the cold war. That  struggle is one of whether we will 
evolve toward greater forms of co-operation among all nations and 
all peoples of the world, whether we will move toward structures 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4713"> 4713 </A></B>
<P>
and toward arrangements that address and support the idea of the 
brotherhood and the sisterhood of humanity or whether we will 
once again descend into the narrowness and the narrow view of 
ethnic nationalism.
<P>
	In my view, the choice of Quebec's separation is a choice for 
ethnic nationalism and would be a choice to embrace the darkness 
rather than to accept the light. This is a problem for Canada but it 
does not mean the end of Canada. I profoundly disagree with those 
who say that as tragic as Quebec's separation would be, it would 
mean the end of this country. In my view that devalues this country. 
This country has a strong history and remains strong to those who 
support it not just in Quebec but elsewhere in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	A country does not live or die by its Constitution or its legal 
arrangements. These are important for the management of its day 
to day affairs and ultimately, as the minister has said, important for 
the management of any profound change in those relationships. 
However, countries live or countries die in the hearts of the people 
who belong to them, particularly democratic countries.
<P>
	Canada remains strong in the hearts of Canadians and, according 
to two referendums, in the hearts of the majority of Quebecers. The 
fact that it has died in the hearts of some or may die in the hearts of 
others is no reason for us to ever give up on this country.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-327, an act to amend the Access to Information 
Act (disclosure of results of public opinion polls).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this private member's bill was previously 
Bill C-346 in the last Parliament and was originally tabled by the 
then hon. member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Mr. Patrick Boyer, 
and I want to give him credit for it.
<P>
	I am pleased to introduce this bill, targeting the disclosure of 
results of public opinion polls commissioned by the government. 
This bill would amend the Access to Information Act and force the 
government to disclose within a set time period the results of all 
public opinion polls which the government itself commissions. 
This bill would compel the designated minister to disclose the 
issues dealt with in the poll, the questions and responses, the time 
period during which the poll was conducted, the name of the person 
or firm who conducted the poll and the costs of the poll to Canadian 
taxpayers.
<P>
	This bill will promote transparency of the government's actions 
and specifically its relation to pollsters. I would point out that had 
this bill been law the present Minister of Agriculture and

	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am still shocked by the arguments used

my opinion, smacked of demagogy and cynicism, belittled the 
people of Quebec and denied their democratic rights.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I hesitate to interrupt the

issue raised by the Hon. Minister of Justice, to which both

<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	However, I must ask the hon. member to co-operate and stick to 
his motion so the debate remains relevant. With all due respect, 
despite its importance, the other issue should not be dealt with on 
this opposition day but wait for another opportunity here in this 
democratic House.
<P>
	So I simply ask you to please co-operate and keep to today's 
motion put forward by the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize. I sometimes have 
trouble controlling my emotions, especially when deeply hurt by 
the comments made by some of our colleagues.
<P>
	I am happy to rise today to speak to a matter I care deeply about, 
namely the scandal condemned by the auditor general on May 7, 
whereby a rich Canadian family managed, in December 1991, to 
transfer a $2 billion family trust fund to the U.S. without paying a 
penny in tax on the capital gains from these assets.
<P>
	This rich family was able to transfer its assets tax free because of 
a so-called advance ruling by Revenue Canada. It is important to 
understand what an advance ruling is. Wealthy taxpayers-and it is 
essentially they who are involved financial operations of this 
nature and this magnitude-can ask Revenue Canada for an 
advance ruling on an interpretation of the Income Tax Act in order 
to protect secure a financial transaction or their own interpretation 
of the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	This advance ruling, which was made on December 23, 1991, 
when everyone was busy partying, was based on a distorted 
analysis out of touch with the realities of tax laws by senior 
officials from the revenue and finance departments.
<P>
	Several unusual facts relating to this issue lead us to believe that 
the government has some things to hide, that it does not want to 
shed light on this episode. Indeed, even though the decision was 
made under the previous Conservative government, it may be that 
friends of the Liberal Party of Canada, major contributors to the 
Liberals' election fund, very rich and influential people who 
gravitate around the centres of power, such as the offices of the 
Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, have had some 
influence, with the result that, today, the government wants to hide 
things.
<P>
	The first unusual fact is that senior officials from the revenue 
and finance departments had several meetings before issuing this 
ruling. During those meetings, they leaned on one side or the other. 
First, they said that the family could not transfer to the United 
States these assets of $2 billion tax free. However, in the end, on 
December 23, after numerous representations had been made by 
the tax experts representing the rich family involved, Revenue 
Canada issued an advance ruling allowing this scandal to take 
place.
<P>
	Oddly enough, there are no minutes of these meetings, no report, 
no written account of the arguments put forth by the two sides 
before such a distorted interpretation of the tax provisions was 
made.
<P>
	The second unusual fact is that, to this day, the ruling, which 
may have cost hundreds of millions of dollars to Quebec and 
Canadian taxpayers, is not supported by any technical analysis. 
There is no technical document.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	When it wants $50 from middle and low income taxpayers, 
Revenue Canada does not beat around the bush. It issues a notice 
and sends a long letter explaining that an amount of $50 is due and 
payable. However, when hundreds of millions of dollars are at 
stake, no technical document is to be found.
<P>
	The third unusual fact is that, for almost a week, meetings took 
place from morning until evening. On December 23, during the 
holiday season, while everyone was at home relaxing and 
celebrating Christmas and the New Year, some public servants 
were at work. The result was that, on that day, Canadian taxpayers' 
goose was cooked. Quebec and Canadian taxpayers are the ones 
who, through their taxes, must pay the hundreds of millions that 
were not paid by the family that transferred $2 billion to the United 
States.
<P>
	Two days before Christmas, a family in Canada had additional 
reasons to celebrate, following Revenue Canada's ruling. However, 
all the other Canadian families would, had they known about 
this-because the government kept it a secret-have been 
saddened by the shameless attitude of senior public servants, who 
probably acted with the complicity of those in office at the time.
<P>
	Another strange thing: while all advance rulings by Revenue 
Canada are normally made public, available to everyone, it took 
until last March 21, five whole years, for this advance ruling 
delivered in December 1991 to be made public and for the auditor 
general, on the basis of this very information, to bring to the 
public's attention this two billion dollar scandal. Five years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4716"> 4716 </A></B>
<P>
	Do you know what this means? It means that Revenue Canada 
had things to hide, because it is truly incredible that all these 
advance rulings were made public over the last five years with 
one exception. Oddly enough, it was the most important one. 
Oddly enough, it was the one that is costing Canadian taxpayers 
hundreds of millions of dollars. It is definitely rather strange.
<P>
	This implies as well that for five years a small group of people 
knew, but that the bulk of the public did not. What is the word for 
this? In the United States, they would be described as insiders, 
people who were able to profit from their knowledge of the 
existence of the December 1991 advance ruling, of the existence of 
an erroneous interpretation, but one given by Revenue Canada 
regarding certain tax provisions from which others in their limited 
little group could have profited.
<P>
	It means that the tax experts representing the very rich Canadian 
family that transferred its two billion dollars to the United States 
had a secret, a golden piece of information that they could sell all 
over the place to other rich Canadian families, because let us not 
forget that this 1991 ruling served as a precedent.
<P>
	It means that, for five years, other rich families in Canada were 
able to profit from this advance ruling, in order to do exactly the 
same thing as in the case that concerns us, which is to not pay a cent 
of tax, and have the rest of Canadian taxpayers compensate for the 
fact that they were able to transfer billions out of the country.
<P>
	Another strange thing in all this is the attitude of government 
representatives. When the auditor general made this case public 
last May, he did so in connection with the work of the House of 
Commons public accounts committee.
<P>
	The public accounts committee is the committee that looks at all 
the recommendations, as it will today with the auditor general's 
new recommendations, and the public accounts committee 
examines all the chapters in the auditor general's report, analyzes 
each of the recommendations, and calls witnesses, as well as 
looking into the various scandals uncovered by the auditor general, 
involving spending or the numerous examples of waste in the 
departments, for instance, or situations such as those that concern 
us today-a misinterpretation of the tax act. This is the mandate of 
the auditor general.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	As for the information made public by the auditor general, you 
have seen the performance before the public accounts committee 
by the Liberal representatives, including the hon. member for 
Brome-Missisquoi. You have seen them tearing out their hair in 
front of the cameras, sending out press releases about how they 
were going to get to the bottom of the circumstances surrounding 
this advance ruling, the circumstances which made it possible to 
avoid taxes because of a loophole in the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	Two days later, the hon. member was nowhere to be found. The 
story was that he had been called back to his riding on a very urgent 
matter, and could not get back until the next week. Finally, he was 
absent for two weeks. He could not be reached. And why? Because 
he had received an order from higher up. He had been given orders 
from higher up to button his lip, because some people linked to the 
Liberal Party, perhaps even to the PMO or the office of the finance 
minister, had, or might have, profited directly or indirectly from 
this ruling. So he was told to keep quiet.
<P>
	After that, everything went haywire. The Minister of Finance 
announced he was transferring the case of the two billion dollar 
trust to the finance committee, so that such an ambiguous 
situation-as he referred to it- would not be repeated in future. He 
called it an ambiguity in the tax law, whereas it is not; it is clear 
that government employees were not entitled to make the 
interpretation they did.
<P>
	By transferring the matter to the finance committee, the Minister 
of Finance was merely clouding the issue. And why? Because the 
finance committee is not mandated to cast light on a specific case, 
whereas the mandate of the public accounts committee is to carry 
out a thorough investigation, to virtually convert itself into a royal 
commission of inquiry. As for the finance committee, it is not 
concerned with the day to day administration of tax policy, as the 
public accounts committee is. Nor does it investigate cases raised 
by the auditor general. Its focus is on the changes in taxation 
policy.
<P>
	By transferring the case to the finance committee, the finance 
minister certainly was aware-having been an MP and the Minister 
of Finance long enough-that it would not examine the specific 
case from 1991, but would make recommendations on future 
changes to policy.
<P>
	When it did get to the finance committee, the Liberals' attitude 
was really scandalous. First, the chairman of the finance 
committee. When the auditor general appeared before the 
committee, for more than an hour and a half he scolded the auditor 
general, was derisive and tried to undermine his credibility by 
taking the floor. This is unheard of in a committee of the House of 
Commons: a chairman who decides to take the floor for an hour 
and a half and tell off the auditor general.
<P>
	The auditor general, and it is important for taxpayers to realize 
this, is one of the most venerable institutions of this Parliament. 
The auditor general is the watchdog of the public purse. He is 
accountable to Parliament, not to the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	He judges the performance of managers, their good and, 
especially, their bad decisions, and reports to Parliament. In other 
words, he is accountable to the people. He monitors public finances 
and the interpretation of tax laws in the best interests of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4717"> 4717 </A></B>
<P>
taxpayers of this country. And the only thing the  government side 
did was undermine the credibility of the auditor general.
<P>
	Recently, this happened again. The report of the Liberal majority 
on the finance committee, the very report ordered by the Minister 
of Finance, said, more or less: ``The auditor general had no 
mandate to do what he did''. However, he did have a mandate to do 
what he did and he had done so many times. He has examined the 
interpretation of tax laws at least seven times in ten years.
<P>
	When the Liberals were in the opposition, they used the cases of 
erroneous interpretation of the Income Tax Act by senior officials 
that were raised by the auditor general. Today, they condemn him. 
They say the auditor general has no mandate.
<P>
	Second, they said he had no credibility. That is a serious charge. 
The auditor general watches over the interests of all taxpayers. He 
is accountable to Parliament and makes departments, ministers and 
senior officials give an account of themselves, but they say his 
analysis is not credible. What is their basis for saying so? They rely 
on the opinion of six experts who appeared this summer before the 
finance committee. I was there, and six out of eight experts spoke 
out against the auditor general.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	Do you know why? Because the six of them, all of them, were 
tax experts representing wealthy canadian families and helping 
those families to take millions if not billions of dollars out of 
Canada in order to avoid paying a cent of income tax on these 
amounts. Now, has anyone ever seen people who are judge and jury 
shoot themselves in the foot? Of course not, it would make no 
sense. But the Liberals, pursuing their saga and their objective, 
which is to hide the inside information in this matter, relied on 
these experts.
<P>
	There is more. Instead of closing the gates and saying that this 
sort of wrong interpretation would no longer be tolerated, they said 
that this distorted, wrong and cynical interpretation made by 
Revenue Canada would become the rule. The borders will be 
opened. Once the government accepts the report of the Liberal 
majority, wealthy Canadian families will be able to do as they 
please. They will be able to transfer millions and billions of dollars 
without being bothered in any way by Revenue Canada. Mr. 
Speaker, just try to take $ 2,000 out of Canada and open an account 
in a foreign country to see if Revenue Canada will allow you to do 
it. Just try.
<P>
	The attitude of the Liberals in this matter is bewildering but 
suggests that the government probably has many things to hide.
<P>
	As I said earlier this week in this House, if we scratch the blue of 
the decision taken by the Conservatives in 1991, we will soon find 
some red underneath. In other words, some influential people in the 
Liberal Party benefited from this decision. Furthermore, the fact 
that  the standing committee on public accounts cannot go into this 
matter as thoroughly as it would like to and call witnesses, namely 
senior officials and even politicians who were involved in this 
decision in 1991, and even tax experts who were around at the time, 
suggests that the government is trying to cloud the issue and hide 
things.
<P>
	The government has something to hide. There might be people in 
the Prime Minister's office or in the finance minister's office who 
do not want this thing to become public knowledge, but it is the 
Canadian taxpayer who is paying for it, and probably for other 
cases since, as I mentioned before, and this is very significant, the 
1991 case has set a precedent for others. As soon as this kind of 
advance ruling is handed down, and insiders get wind of it, and we 
are dealing with insiders here and, by the way, insider trading is an 
indictable offence in the United States, they may use it to other 
people's advantage. They might have used it to benefit their clients 
if they worked for tax consultants, for example.
<P>
	As a result of this ruling, astronomical sums of money are being 
transferred abroad without any interference from Revenue Canada. 
In this case as in others that might have occurred, the government 
must come to its senses and protect the interests of all taxpayers, 
not only those who are millionaires or billionaires.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to announce to the House 
that the official opposition is currently working to create a vast 
coalition coast to coast. This coalition will be constituted of unions, 
elderly people organizations, student organizations, groups devoted 
to the well-being of underprivileged people, and Canadian citizens 
who are fed up with the attitude of the federal government on this 
issue. We hope this vast coalition will bring some sense to the 
government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the meantime, let us hope that it will see the light, it is in the 
best interest of all Quebecers and Canadians. It is outrageous for 
the government to attempt to cover up this scandal, hiding behind 
false arguments, instead of getting to the bottom of it.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	It is kicking a big fuss, trying all kinds of tricks in the public 
accounts committee or the finance committee to make sure that the 
truth will never be known.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate, on behalf of 
Quebecers and Canadians, our trust in the institution of the auditor 
general and the work Mr. Desautels did on this issue and many 
others.
<P>
	If there is an auditor who deserves the highest respect for his 
work and his integrity, and who has in fact been supported by a 
former auditor general, Mr. Kenneth Dye, it is Mr. Desautels,

whom, I believe deserves to be applauded for his work instead of 
having his reputation systematically tarnished by an unscrupulous 
government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to make 
a brief comment at this time. We have just heard the opening 
speech on this daylong debate.
<P>
	I want to make it known to Canadians that during this debate 
they will hear more than the speculations and the fearmongering 
that we have just heard. I hope they understand that this is an 
extremely complex area of tax law.
<P>
	An open public hearing was made at which time unfortunately 
no evidence was put forward by the members opposite to prove any 
of their speculations. So what we have today is a debate on the one 
side where people are looking to find a problem that they could not 
find when the hearings transpired. We have a tabled report and 
what we are doing is open to debate today.
<P>
	I ask Canadians to listen to members from all sides of this House 
who will give their opinions. I believe the government, acting 
responsibly and in a balanced manner, will be able to shed some 
reality in this discussion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, when they talk about reason, when 
they say that the government behaved reasonably, I must say it is 
certainly not the case in this instance. Since the very beginning, it 
is remarkable how many steps, how many measures the 
government has taken to cover up, to conceal the situation.
<P>
	Even in the public accounts committee, of which my colleague is 
a member, they used every trick in the book; motions were 
submitted, even a motion saying that light would be shed on this 
issue in the fall was defeated by the Liberals. It takes some nerve to 
do that. Every time my colleague, the member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans and Chairman of the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts, tried to raise the issue, he was 
turned down. They used the finance committee's analysis as an 
excuse to say: ``Finance is working on it. Once they have done their 
job, we will see''.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Public Accounts has the authority to 
act almost as a royal commission of inquiry. Until now, I have not 
sensed a willingness, on the part of the Liberals, to get to the 
bottom of this issue. On the contrary; the finance committee report, 
a Liberal majority report, and even the statements made over the 
last two weeks by the Prime Minister and the finance minister, 
show clearly that they want to cover up, and not shed light on the 
issue.
<P>
	Not only will they not shed any light, but they announced, in the 
Liberal majority report which has now  been recognized as the 
government's position on the issue, that what was done in 1991, 
that misinterpretation of the tax legislation, will now become the 
general rule. From now on, this is how Revenue Canada will 
officially interpret the tax provisions.
<P>
	I want to ask Canadians to consider the so-called reasonable 
attitude of the government. It is not a reasonable but a outrageous 
attitude. These people practice patronage. I hope that Canadians 
will see it some day. I hope that those Canadians that are now 
Liberal supporters will raise the question in their ridings and ask 
their members of Parliament for an explanation.
<P>
	Sometimes I look at Liberal members and I wonder if they read 
the reports of the committees and of their government. Sometimes 
I hear things and wonder if I have not landed on another planet. I 
feel they know nothing about the government's positions and their 
implications. They just go along with everything.
<P>
	They go along, they applaud, they smile and say: ``My my, we 
are good''. They are in fact shooting themselves in the foot.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	They are here to represent their constituents but instead, they 
applaud the government's positions when in fact that government is 
only protecting a handful of rich friends of the party. That is not 
normal. I hope they will wake up eventually because this is no way 
to behave in politics. It is certainly not our way. And it is most 
unfortunate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member leads off debate on this important issue 
today and he suggests that we have a scandal. The auditor general 
has reviewed the issue. The Standing Committee on Finance has 
reviewed the issue. The hon. member has spent 20 minutes or so 
introducing us to the issue in the House. He suggests that it is a 
scandal but all that he has done has asked questions.
<P>
	It is a little too late in his remarks to do it but perhaps a 
subsequent member will address this. However, I wish that 
someone would please outline what element of the issue constitutes 
a scandal. I put this to him and I ask for his reaction.
<P>
	The advance ruling procedure that was used does not create any 
new law or any new rights. It is simply a decision by the 
department on what the tax law was at the time.
<P>
	If this particular trust had simply changed its domicile without 
seeking an advance ruling, I put it to him: Would not the 
department have come to the same conclusion in doing an 
assessment or making the decision not to do an assessment after the 
change in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4719"> 4719 </A></B>
<P>
domicile had taken place? It would have come to the same 
conclusion that the tax law permitted the change in domicile 
without the deemed dispositions that would otherwise have taken 
place.
<P>
	Where is the scandal? If there is a problem it may be in the 
existing tax law. Unless the member can point to a problem, I 
suggest to him that an advance ruling would have had the same 
effect as an assessment would have had after the change in 
domicile of this trust had taken place.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what I was saying. 
The hon. member, my Liberal colleague, did not read the 
proceedings of the finance committee, did not read the testimony of 
the people who appeared before the committee, most of all did not 
read the auditor general's report and did not read the report of the 
Liberal majority in the finance committee.
<P>
	There is a scandal because the economy of the legislation 
concerning taxable Canadian property-it sounds technical, but 
that is the objective-the economy of the legislation said this 
concept, which allowed the transfer of some public corporation 
assets elsewhere in the world, free of tax, was to be applied only to 
foreign residents, not to Canadian residents.
<P>
	The concept of TCA, of taxable Canadian assets, was applied to 
a Canadian family that transferred $2 billion outside the country 
and did not pay a cent in taxes. When you talk about the 
proceedings and the experts who were consulted, as I was 
mentioning earlier, the six experts your friends claim to be are 
people who represent rich Canadian families and who allow them 
to export capital.
<P>
	I will confront you with 15 experts who have no links with rich 
Canadian families, academic tax experts, people who know their 
business, and they will tell you quite the opposite. The auditor 
general did his job, his interpretation of tax legislation is correct, 
and it is Revenue Canada's interpretation that is wrong.
<P>
	The proof of the matter is that Revenue Canada issued a notice in 
1985 that said that, in a case such as this one, the TCA, transfers of 
capital outside the country free of tax, could not apply to Canadian 
residents. And what is rather strange, in 1991, within a week, 
during the Christmas holidays, while everyone was celebrating, 
Revenue Canada's decision was changed following discussions 
with representatives of rich Canadian families. That is a scandal.
<P>
	The other scandal is the attitude of the government, of Liberal 
representatives who, instead of shedding light on this and closing 
the borders to this flight of rich families' capital, open them wide 
to favour their friends.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the hon. member from the opposition and 
I am still trying to figure out exactly what he is talking about. 
Today he has certainly presented perhaps the weakest case that he 
has ever presented in the House of Commons.
<P>
	The auditor general raised important policy questions in an area 
that Parliament had not really reviewed in over 25 years which 
related to this issue. The committee as I understand it in turn 
produced a report and submitted thoughtful recommendations 
which the government is reviewing carefully.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	I want this to be very clear for those Canadians who are watching 
the House of Commons proceedings. There is no evidence of large 
scale capital flight that is depriving this government of tax revenue 
owed to it. Canada already has tough tax rules for people who leave 
the country and these tax rules are much stricter than the ones in 
almost every other country including the United States, the United 
Kingdom, France and Germany. They certainly are tougher than the 
ones in Japan.
<P>
	Does the hon. member think that by repeating the words ``family 
trust'' and ``scandal'' that somehow he is going to score political 
points? Canadians are intelligent and clearly they will find that 
what the hon. member is simply advocating is cheap politics.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a scandal, namely the 
tax-free transfer of $2 billion abroad, when this kind of thing 
should not have been done. There have been other such transfers 
since then, and do you know why? Because the Deputy Minister of 
National Revenue said so when he appeared before the finance 
committee. He said that the decision on the first $2 billion may 
have led to other transfers.
<P>
	The other point is, you are saying we want to score political 
points, you will see that the points scored will not be not political. 
The coalition we are setting up includes organizations from across 
Canada that are very interested in letting the government know 
they disagree with this. As you will see, this coalition is apolitical 
and the Liberals in each of their ridings will feel the heat.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In conclusion, I wish to 
thank the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot for his 
understanding and co-operation, which I accept. As he pointed out 
to the House, the circumstances were difficult.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that 
the hon. member has brought forward this motion. I must admit in 
listening to him for the last half hour I was not sure whether I was 
listening to ``This Hour Has 22 Minutes'' or that maybe I was on 
another planet.
<P>
	This does give the House an opportunity to see in black and 
white just what the hon. member and his  colleagues have been 
shouting about for the past several days. As is so often the case, this 
motion makes it clear that the hon. member is rather confused on 
more than a few points.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4720"> 4720 </A></B>
<P>
	The motion asks the House to condemn the government for 
failing to shed light on various transactions. I will have more to say 
in a few moments about what those transactions were and how the 
motion mischaracterizes them, but first I would like to take a look 
at the suggestion that the government has somehow been 
concealing things.
<P>
	The auditor general issued his report on May 7 of this year. The 
Minister of Finance immediately asked the House of Commons 
finance committee to look at the important issues raised by the 
auditor general.
<P>
	The Minister of National Revenue announced an immediate 
moratorium on the kind of advance rulings that had concerned the 
auditor general. That certainly does not strike me, and I am sure it 
does not strike Canadians, as the action of a government that 
wanted to conceal something.
<P>
	The finance committee was given an extremely broad mandate 
and held several days of open public hearings. The committee 
heard from the auditor general and members of the auditor 
general's staff, a total of eight private sector professional and 
academic experts, and senior officials from the Departments of 
National Revenue, Finance and Justice.
<P>
	The committee invited opposition members, including the hon. 
member who brought forward this motion, and the auditor general 
to suggest witnesses. During those hearings all committee 
members, including the hon. member, were free to ask any and all 
questions and to discuss any issue they saw fit. These hearings 
were also open to the public. Is there any possible process that 
could be more transparent than that?
<P>
	In addition, the committee has tabled its report complete with 
partially dissenting opinions from the opposition members. The 
report is over 60 pages long and deals with every one of the issues 
identified by the auditor general. Again, I fail to see how this 
indicates a desire to conceal something.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	In response to the committee report, the Minister of Finance said 
that the government would look seriously at the recommendations 
contained in both the majority report and the minority reports and 
would take action once there had been adequate opportunity for 
consultation. In the meantime Revenue Canada's rulings 
moratorium would continue.
<P>
	How does all of this show any reluctance to shed light on an 
issue? The fact is the government has acted quickly, transparently 
and appropriately in response to the concerns raised by the auditor 
general.
<P>
	If anyone is afraid to shed light on these matters, it is the hon. 
member and his colleagues. With their unsubstantiated claims of 
scandals and billions of dollars worth of capital fleeing the country, 
they are leaving Canadians entirely in the dark about what are the 
real issues.
<P>
	This brings me to the next part of the hon. member's motion. The 
motion talks about a flight of capital; $2 billion in total that left 
Canada free of tax. It suggests that even more money, billions even, 
is sure to leave the country as a result of some unspecified thing the 
government has done or the government has not done.
<P>
	The hon. member is a colourful speaker and this is a colourful 
motion. It has a vision of convoys of Brinks trucks lined up at the 
U.S. border waiting to go south. Colourful as that image is, 
Canadians deserve better than this. Canadians know that there is no 
restriction or tax on moving money out of Canada. Apart from a 
handful of countries with exchange controls, this is the way the last 
half of the 20th century world is. Money moves freely and we are 
all the better for it.
<P>
	Having confused the issue, the hon. member will now back up 
and say that what concerns him is not movements of money per se, 
but movements of untaxed capital gains. Somehow he says $2 
billion in assets left the country with no tax being imposed. Here 
again the truth is considerably less exciting and a whole lot more 
complicated.
<P>
	The fact is Canada does tax people leaving Canada on any capital 
gains their property has accumulated. We are one of only a few 
countries that do this. Our rules in Canada are tougher than the 
rules in the United States. Our rules are tougher than the rules in the 
United Kingdom. Our rules are tougher than the rules in France. 
Our rules are tougher than the rules in Germany. Our rules are 
tougher than the rules in Japan. Our rules are tougher than the rules 
in Switzerland and they are tougher than those in almost any other 
country anywhere else.
<P>
	We do not tax people who leave with gains on Canadian 
property. That is because we will tax the gains on Canadian 
property when they are actually realized or if a tax treaty applies, 
the person's new country will tax those gains. This is not a 
loophole. It is not something of which only rich people or only 
trusts can take advantage. It is a basic part of our tax system and it 
has been there since 1972. It makes good policy sense. Do not tax 
on realized gains unless you have to tax. It is not the only policy we 
could have and the committee has suggested that it be 
reconsidered. But it hardly deserves the kind of scorn the hon. 
member is heaping on it.
<P>
	The issue that Revenue Canada had to rule on in 1985 and again 
in 1991 under the previous Tory government was whether certain 
shares were the kind of property which is known as taxable 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4721"> 4721 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian property. The issue is a complex, technical one. There 
was no immediate clear answer. At the end of the day Revenue 
Canada said the property was taxable Canadian property.
<P>
	Last May the auditor general indicated that he was concerned 
that this might not have been the correct answer in a technical 
sense. As soon as the minister became aware of the auditor 
general's concerns, he asked the all-party finance committee to 
look at the issue with the help of experts. He did not hide from the 
issue. He faced the issue squarely. He did not put it in an expert's 
hand. He did not do any of those things. He put it in the hands of an 
all-party finance committee and asked its members to consult the 
experts, suggest witnesses and come back.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	The committee invited the opposition to suggest those experts 
who might participate and the expert opinion was overwhelmingly 
that Revenue Canada was correct. There was no tax free flight of 
capital. Let me repeat, there was no tax free flight of capital.
<P>
	The particular taxpayers concerned did not pay any tax, true. 
That was because they did not owe any tax. I am sure that not even 
the hon. member who proposed this motion really wants Revenue 
Canada to collect tax it is not owed.
<P>
	The motion goes on talk about other capital leaving the country, 
as though the government had opened some secret door to let 
people escape tax. That is absurd.
<P>
	The committee found that in 1985 and 1991 the rulings did not 
open any new avoidance opportunities. With the Minister of 
National Revenue's continuing moratorium even in the unlikely 
event that there was some yet undiscovered, secret way to exploit 
the current rules, taxpayers could not be certain their avoidance 
techniques would work because the Minister of National Revenue 
has put a moratorium on advance rulings.
<P>
	It is true that there is a flight of capital under way right now. That 
flight of capital is into Canada. Business people and investors 
around the world realize Canada is such a good place to invest their 
money, to do business, and there is a flight of capital into Canada 
these days.
<P>
	Regrettably the separatist government in Quebec makes it hard 
for that province to attract its share of this new investment. It is 
understandable that the hon. member tries to distract attention from 
what are the real issues. Those real issues are that the separatist 
government in Quebec is not attracting the amount of money into 
Quebec that could have attracted if there was another government.
<P>
	The simple fact is that this issue, important as it is, does not 
involve any flight of capital. The issue of tax is not a flight of 
capital. People come into and leave Canada all the time. Some of 
them are rich people, and some of them are poor people. Some of 
them do not owe any tax but that does not mean that our system is 
grossly deficient, much less that there is some government 
conspiracy to let people off their legal obligations.
<P>
	The motion also talks about the government attacking the 
credibility of the auditor general. The hon. member said that the 
committee denounced the auditor general. That is simply not the 
case. That is pure unadulterated rhetoric.
<P>
	The hon. member is well aware that the report of the finance 
committee is just that, it is a report of the finance committee. The 
committee is composed of members of Parliament from all 
officially recognized parties in the House. The role of a 
parliamentary committee is a vital one to our democratic process. 
The work of the committee is the work of its members. Its work 
does not represent government policy, it represents the work of its 
members.
<P>
	The government would not have it any other way. We value the 
work of the committees of this House. Even the hon. member who 
put forward this motion would not want to have a system whereby 
the work of committees was not independent.
<P>
	By ignoring this distinction I can only conclude the hon. member 
does not wish to deal with the difficult policy choices that the 
report implies, not when there is an easy headline, not by repeating 
irrelevant accusations, not by simply defending the auditor general 
against non-existent attacks. Those are the tactics of the opposition 
members and they are certainly irrelevant.
<P>
	In summary, this motion is an excellent written summary of 
everything that is wrong with the official opposition's approach to 
so many complex matters. It ignores the real question. It repeats 
unprovable accusations. It denounces the government for acting 
irresponsibly. It simplifies to a point of incoherence some very 
difficult public policy issues. All of these are untrue. All of these 
are ridiculous. The motion will be rejected by anyone who believes 
in parliamentary democracy and believes in the rule of law.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to the opposition motion today. As I see it, there 
are two major issues that flow from the motion and from this whole 
issue.
<P>
	First is the government's attempt to redirect criticism for the 
handling of the affair by blaming the auditor general. That is the 
first big issue. The second is how confusing Canada's taxation 
system is, and the failure of the government to provide crystal clear 
tax policy that prevents disputes of the type we are talking about 
today. Those are the two big issues.
<P>
	I want to say a couple of words about this specific incident. What 
we have here is a curious set of events that led up to the tax ruling 
in 1991 and a curious set of events that get us to this point in the 
debate in 1996.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4722"> 4722 </A></B>
<P>
	A tax ruling was made that was not made public which had a 
curious lack of documentation surrounding it. We know that this 
ruling allowed $2 billion to leave the country in a circumstance 
where, ordinarily, it may have been taxed. The final point I make 
with respect to all this is that the auditor general looked at all this 
and found that there was no wrongdoing.
<P>
	While there are many unanswered questions, the government has 
done a very poor job of making tax policy clear. It is very wrong 
and irresponsible when its members turn around and criticize the 
auditor general.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has gone way beyond the pale in suggesting 
that there is some kind of great scandal here, that Canadians are 
going to rise up. That is just a little hyperbole on its part.
<P>
	However, the opposition motion gives us the chance to talk a 
little more about these two issues, the government using the auditor 
general to escape accepting responsibility for the lack of clear tax 
policy and really how confusing our taxation system is.
<P>
	What I regard perhaps as the most serious of the two issues is the 
efforts of the government to blame the auditor general and to try to 
redirect criticism to him so that it does not have to take the heat for 
not being clear about tax policy.
<P>
	This has become a theme, really, for the government. I point to 
the recent responses to questioning by the Prime Minister with 
respect to the Somalia inquiry. He is blaming the inquiry, in this 
case, for some of the problems he is having. He is blaming it for 
taking too long and for being too tough on witnesses.
<P>
	I see a theme developing where the government is trying to 
blame other people. In the case we are talking about, its members 
are blaming the auditor general, an officer of the House and not 
accepting responsibility themselves. This will catch up with the 
government so that its members cannot continue to blame other 
people, particularly independent agencies, when things go wrong.
<P>
	There is no shortage of incidents where things have gone wrong 
for the government and I want to talk about a few of those for a 
moment if I might.
<P>
	I hate to continue to raise this, but I feel duty bound to do so 
because it is one of the things people have been talking about the 
most over the last little while. It is something that Canadians are 
very concerned about.
<P>
	I go back to the whole issue of the broken promise on the GST. 
We had a situation where the government was blaming the media 
when it came to its broken GST promise: ``Oh no, we didn't 
promise to scrap the GST. Look at our red book''. Of course, they 
were on national television doing exactly that. Again, they were 
trying to shift the blame. They did it on the GST on reading.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister wrote the don't tax reading coalition and 
said he would remove the GST on reading materials. We have had 
policy conventions since then, in 1992 and in 1994, where the 
government said that it would remove the GST on reading. Now the 
government is trying to say: ``You must have misunderstood. That 
is not really what we meant at all''. This is despite the fact that it is 
in <I>Hansard</I> and in all kinds of public documents. Again, the 
government seems to have a problem accepting any responsibility, 
just like in this debate over the auditor general and his criticism of 
taxation policy.
<P>
	We have a situation where the government promised to provide 
150,000 day care spaces but it will not accept responsibility for 
making that promise. I do not support the government when it 
comes to providing these day care spaces. We believe that it should 
take a different tact. However, that is not the issue. The government 
made a promise in the red book and it is now trying to weasel out of 
it.
<P>
	During the recent debate over cuts to the CBC, there is a pledge 
in the red book which states that the government will provide stable 
funding for the CBC. The heritage minister has been one of the 
most vociferous defenders of funding the CBC over the years. On 
numerous occasions the minister has said that we must protect the 
CBC. I do not agree with protecting funding for CBC Television, 
not at all, but that is not the issue. The government is trying to 
weasel out of its promise. It is trying to get out of accepting 
responsibility for the promises that it made in the past. Again, that 
is what it was trying to do with the auditor general.
<P>
	The auditor general should not be investigating those policy 
areas, the government is saying, he should not even be looking at 
all those kinds of things because it makes it look bad. That is too 
bad. It is the government and it has to start accepting some 
responsibility.
<P>
	Another issue where the government is trying to get out of a 
previous promise and shift responsibility away is on the Canadian 
Wheat Board. I remember very well during the election campaign 
when we had the Prime Minister and the current minister of 
agriculture saying they wanted a plebiscite on the wheat board 
issue. However, there has been no plebiscite.
<P>
	We also know that since then they have brought down a panel 
that was going to review the whole issue of the wheat board, what it 
should be involved in and should there be options for farmers other 
than the wheat board. The minister hand picked these people and 
said he was going to listen to their recommendations. Again he is 
trying to get out of that responsibility. He and the Prime Minister is 
now preparing Canadians for the fact that they will not meet their 
promise. We again have the government trying to slide out of a 
responsibility, a promise it has made.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4723"> 4723 </A></B>
<P>
	It does not end there. I want to talk about the big kahuna of 
promises, the big promise that the government made during the 
last election campaign. It was jobs, jobs, jobs. I just want to talk 
about that in detail for a moment.
<P>
	The Liberals won the election in part because of a promise to 
create jobs, jobs, jobs. The issue we are talking about they have 
again tried to redirect criticism from the public, from opposition 
parties and from other interested people over the issue of family 
trusts. They have tried to pin it on the auditor general. However, I 
fail to see how the auditor general or the Somalia inquiry or any of 
those other groups are responsible for the complete and utter 
failure of the government to fulfil its promise to provide jobs for 
Canadians.
<P>
	We still have, as we did in 1993, 1.5 million unemployed 
Canadians in this country. That is a scandal. That is what the Bloc 
Quebecois should be calling a scandal because that truly is. It is not 
just the unemployed Canadians, it is the underemployed 
Canadians: 25 per cent of Canadians underemployed. Half of all 
Canadians are worried about keeping the jobs they currently have. 
There is scarcely a person in this country who does not know 
somebody who is unemployed or very afraid of not being able to 
get a job when they get of school. There is 15 per cent youth 
unemployment in this country. There are people with Ph.Ds 
working at minimum wage in jobs that certainly are well below 
their qualifications. We need the government to start accepting 
some responsibility for all these broken promises.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	Members across the way will say that on average unemployment 
is going down. That is like saying, as the member for Calgary 
Southwest says from time to time, that the guy with his feet in a 
bucket of ice water and his hair on fire on average feels pretty 
good.
<P>
	When we talk about unemployment we cannot look at averages. 
Unemployment in Newfoundland is up around 20 per cent, 25 per 
cent, 50 per cent, 70 per cent in some communities. That is an 
absolute human tragedy of monumental proportions. 
Improvements in the job picture in Alberta do not help the people 
in Newfoundland one bit. And so we must insist that the 
government start to accept some responsibility for all the promises 
it has made.
<P>
	People in Atlantic Canada, people in Quebec are desperate to 
find jobs. The government cannot continue, as it has done in the 
finance committee report, to push the blame on to somebody else. 
The government of the land is in charge of the levers of power. It 
makes the decisions. It rode to power on the promise that it would 
provide jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	Canadians have a right to know what the government is doing to 
fulfil that promise, and if it does not fulfil that  promise they expect 
the government to take responsibility, not to shift the blame to 
somebody else. It is time the government started accepting 
responsibility.
<P>
	When a six-year old child does not accept responsibility it is bad. 
But when adult men and women, capable people, people who are 
supposedly the cream of the crop, people who make up the caucus 
and the cabinet of the country, refuse to accept responsibility for 
promises that are on paper, which they campaigned on, it is 
scandalous. It is ridiculous.
<P>
	This government will pay a price. I personally am going to 
ensure it does. When people make promises like the government 
has made and refuse to accept responsibility when they do not fulfil 
them, then they only contribute to the tremendous cynicism we see 
across the country today when it comes to people's respect for 
politicians. Is it any wonder people are so disrespectful of 
politicians today? Hardly.
<P>
	The government made another promise which it has tried to slide 
out of, to weasel out of. The red book it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Liberal government will appoint an independent ethics counsellor to advise 
both public officials and lobbyists in the day to day application of the code of 
conduct for public officials. The ethics counsellor will be appointed after 
consultation with the leaders of all parties in the House of Commons and will report 
directly to Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Three years have gone by since this government took power. Do 
we have an ethics counsellor who reports directly to Parliament? 
Hardly. We have someone the Prime Minister knows who reports 
directly to him. The Prime Minister allegedly speaks to the ethics 
counsellor when a scandal arises. Then the Prime Minister comes 
back and tells us what was allegedly said. But this person is not an 
independent officer of the House of Commons, not at all.
<P>
	We have had situations like when the former heritage minister 
met clients of his department for a fundraising dinner. We asked 
that these situations be referred to an independent ethics 
commissioner. What happened? Nothing, despite the fact that the 
Prime Minister and the government promised in writing to do that. 
Another promise in writing, another promise broken. And again the 
government shifted responsibility and said: ``Perhaps we were 
misunderstood. We really do not mean the words that are on this 
paper''.
<P>
	I do not buy that and Canadians do not buy it either. It is an 
absolutely ridiculous package of-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Use the right words now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> I have to find the right words-misleading words, 
which Canadians are simply not going to buy. Canadians are tired 
of being misled on a whole variety of issues and they are not going 
to accept it any more.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4724"> 4724 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	I have talked for a few minutes about one of the two issues that I 
have identified as being ones that are important and which flow 
from this whole debate over family trusts and the finance 
committee's criticizing the auditor general. I have talked about the 
attempt by the government to shift responsibility over to, in this 
case, an independent officer of the House, the auditor general. In 
other cases the government has tried to shift responsibility to 
whomever it thinks it can.
<P>
	The second issue I wanted to raise is the whole issue of the 
confusing taxation system. The government has been in power for 
three years. Why has it not clarified this particular fine point of 
taxation law which is so much in discussion and part of the 
controversy we are talking about today? The fact of the matter is 
until this issue was raised nobody did anything about it, despite the 
fact that the government has been in power for three years.
<P>
	It is fairly clear that Canadians are concerned about how 
confusing the taxation system is. As the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot pointed out a few minutes ago, when it is 
$50 that the average guys owes the government goes after them 
hammer and claw. It is no secret that the government has actually 
cranked up its revenue department to go after anybody at all who 
looks like they have missed including a penny on their taxation 
forms. There is no question-and I am sure hon. members will 
attribute to this-that there are more and more people who are 
complaining to MPs about how vigorous the taxation department 
has become in scraping every cent out of its pocketbooks so that it 
can continue to bring more revenue into the government. That is 
another issue which I will touch on in a moment.
<P>
	The taxation system is extremely confusing. The Income Tax 
Act is 2,000 pages thick. There are currently 10,000 cases before 
the courts on the issue of taxation law. There are all kinds of people 
who have very serious concerns about the complexity of the tax 
system.
<P>
	One of the promises which our party has made is that we would 
look at the complexity of the taxation system. People have a basic 
right to understand how the taxation system works. When the 
government is taking half of a person's money in taxes, it is a basic 
right for people to be able to understand why the government is 
taking the money and what it proposes to do with it.
<P>
	Since this government came to power we have seen 33 tax 
increases. I have a feeling that people would be a lot more 
sympathetic to the taxation system in general if overall taxes were 
not so high. Right now somewhere in the range of 50 cents on every 
dollar earned goes to pay taxes. That is scandalous. The Bloc 
Quebecois was talking about a scandal. That is scandalous.
<P>
	Perhaps people do not realize that since 1983, since the Tories 
came to power and then the Liberals after them, we have seen 
<P>
federal personal taxes increase  $4,000 a year per individual 
taxpayer. That is absolutely ridiculous. Then there are excise taxes, 
which have increased another $1,100 a year.
<P>
	The finance minister has talked about how he has not raised 
personal taxes. That simply is not the case. He has raised personal 
taxes. He has done all kinds of things to do that. There have been 33 
tax increases of various kinds since the government came to power. 
People have felt it in their pocketbooks.
<P>
	Somebody suggested to me the other day that what should 
happen for people to really appreciate how much governments are 
taxing them is for them to write out a cheque every month to send 
into Revenue Canada for their taxes, as opposed to having those 
taxes come directly off their paycheques. Then people would come 
to appreciate just how heavily they are being taxed. Many people 
understand that.
<P>
	The average family of four in Canada makes an income of 
somewhere around $54,000. Roughly half of that, $27,000, goes to 
pay taxes of all kinds. If someone had to write a cheque to Revenue 
Canada every month for taxes, it would be well over $2,000 a 
month. A mortgage payment of $1,000 is a pretty big payment 
every month. But stop and consider for a moment that people 
would have to cut a cheque for over $2,000 a month to pay the taxes 
in this country. It is absolutely outrageous.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	We talk about people who are fearful for their jobs. We talk 
about people who are afraid to start a business, afraid to risk any 
money they have saved. And how can they save very much when 
taxes are this high? We wonder why we have an unemployment 
problem in this country. To me it is not a very complicated 
problem. When we are paying that much in taxes, how is it possible 
to save the kind of money that is needed to start businesses? It is 
virtually impossible.
<P>
	I will give another example of how the government is working 
against the ability of people to save money and start businesses and 
create jobs. This is a perfect example of how the government has 
proceeded with its tax increases.
<P>
	On April 22 there was a change in the tax rules affecting the 
notional input tax credit. When I try to explain it, it becomes very 
complicated and people just throw up their hands and their eyes 
glaze over. The net effect of it is that it removes about a billion 
dollars from the bottom line of small businesses. According to 
some estimates it amounts to a billion dollars a year. That means 
those small businesses have to find that billion dollars somewhere 
else.
<P>
	Where do they find it? They either find it by charging higher 
prices to consumers and therefore that tax increase is passed on, or 
they let people go or perhaps close down their business. Again 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4725"> 4725 </A></B>
<P>
people become unemployed. The government has done this over 
and over and over again.
<P>
	When we are talking about the taxation system and the point I 
was trying to make a few minutes ago, I think people would be a lot 
more willing to suffer with a complicated taxation system if they 
knew that the government was not using the fact that the system 
was so complicated and so mystifying to people to raise taxes in a 
surreptitious way as it has done time and time again.
<P>
	Another good example is the move to limit how much a person 
can contribute to RRSPs. That is not a direct tax on personal 
incomes but the effect is exactly the same as if the government put 
a tax on personal incomes. What happens is that people end up 
having to pay more income taxes because they cannot save the 
money they have traditionally saved through RRSPs for their 
retirement. On the other hand the Canada pension plan is really in 
trouble and the government's response to that is to limit the amount 
that can be put into RRSPs so that people can provide for 
themselves in their retirement.
<P>
	Why not give people the dignity of being able to save for their 
retirement? But the government continuously works in 
surreptitious ways against the interests of people who are trying to 
provide for themselves, trying to create jobs by starting small 
businesses, people who simply want to have a few dollars put away 
so that perhaps they can take a vacation when they get older, put 
their kids through university and have the things that back in the 
1960s and early 1970s people just took for granted.
<P>
	I do not think Canadians are demanding a lot. They do not want 
some utopia in the future. They want the same kind of country we 
used to have. They want a country where there are balanced 
budgets, where governments live within their means, where there 
are small governments which are not in their faces at every turn and 
every step they take.
<P>
	Canadians want some reasonable division of responsibilities 
between different levels of government. Do we really need to have 
different levels of government involved in every aspect of our 
lives? Do we have to have three levels of government looking after 
the environment? Do we have to have two levels of government 
involved in mining, tourism and agriculture? People want smaller 
government. They want a balanced budget. They want a taxation 
system they can understand. I do not think it is being unreasonable.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	Canadians want taxes that are high enough I suppose, in that they 
are willing to pay taxes to look after some basic social programs. 
They want health care and some kind of a pension plan. But they do 
not want taxes going into all these wacky social engineering 
programs that we have seen in the past. They do not want tax 
dollars going into job training programs that bear no fruit as we 
have seen over and over again. They say let people who know how 
to do it do it.
<P>
	Canadians do not want to see tax dollars going into regional 
development programs where we fund all kinds businesses which 
in turn use those dollars to compete against the people who are the 
ones who contributed the tax dollars in the first place. That is crazy. 
We end up putting prosperous businesses out of work or putting 
them under by subsidizing businesses that have been unprofitable 
to that point. That is crazy yet the government somehow cannot get 
the message.
<P>
	I am grateful the Bloc has raised this issue today. I do think there 
are two big issues that have come from it and I will just touch on 
them briefly as I sum up.
<P>
	The issue of the auditor general reporting on the apparent 
irregularity in tax law points to a couple of different major issues. 
One of them is the fact that the government has tried to shift the 
responsibility away from itself on to the auditor general, someone 
who has saved us billions of dollars in the past. We only wish that 
everybody in the government would be so vigilant in finding waste.
<P>
	The other big issue is our confusing tax system. Our member for 
Calgary Centre has spent hours and hours speaking to people across 
Canada about the need to reform our taxation system. We hope that 
this issue will help bring home the need for government to do that.
<P>
	I want to conclude by saying a word about the auditor general. It 
is very important when we have these independent officers of the 
House that the government think long and hard before criticizing 
these people. It is no secret that the auditor general and successive 
auditors general have saved the House billions of dollars over the 
years.
<P>
	The one final request I would make is for the government to 
learn a lesson from the auditor general and to apply the same 
powers to an ethics commissioner. Then as part of the opposition 
we would not be talking about all the scandals we have to talk 
about.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a brief 
comment and then to ask the hon. member a question.
<P>
	My comment stems from the fact that I have listened to a 
rambling dissertation. At times I had a problem finding the 
relevance to today's motion. Nevertheless the hon. member said 
something that interested me and which I think is very reflective of 
his party's position on many different topics.
<P>
	He talked about Canadians wanting the government and country 
they used to have. I find this a major problem. They are always 
looking backward. Unfortunately the real responsibility of a 
government is to look forward. This Liberal government is dealing 
in  business, in tax and in every issue. It is not looking backward 
but looking forward to the future, forward for a better situation for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4726"> 4726 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians. That includes very deliberate, well thought out, 
practical management of a tax system, a system that is very 
complex.
<P>
	We in Canada are getting more and more of our jobs from 
international trade. When the Liberals took office one in five jobs 
in this country depended upon international trade. It is now much 
closer to one in three jobs in Canada depending on international 
trade. One of the things that has enabled us to do this, among many 
others because Canadians are very productive people, is the fact 
that we have a very sophisticated, advanced and by definition 
therefore complex tax treatment. I know that simple is the way the 
Reform Party likes things but some things are complex. Part of the 
complexity of our tax treatment is the fact that we have to deal 
internationally.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	Many corporations today are international corporations. They do 
not just do business in one country, they are multinational. This 
applies also to the people in Canada. Our Canadians are gathered 
from around the world. We get income and enhancement to our 
economy from investment from outside of this country. People are 
also leaving at different stages of their lives. Many people come to 
this country, work for many years and then retire and leave it. They 
do not want to dispose of all their property and pay tax at that point 
in time. Some of them may want to keep property here and have the 
income flowing from that property. There are very serious 
complications to the broad range of the Canadian public on these 
issues.
<P>
	International tax agreements modify Canadian tax law. That is at 
the basic concept of what happened here in the report of the finance 
committee. It was a 60-page document. It dealt with process, it 
dealt with policy, but at the heart of the document what we have is 
an understanding that Canada has over 60 bilateral trade 
agreements. That helps Canadians to do international transactions. 
In fact, the Canadian tax act is modified by law by the international 
tax agreements. For instance, with the United States we have 10 
years after the migration to collect the tax.
<P>
	My question for the hon. member is: Does the member of the 
Reform Party believe in honouring our international tax 
agreements for the benefit of Canadian citizens?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, of course we believe in honouring 
our tax treaties but I simply must respond to some of the things the 
hon. member said.
<P>
	She spoke with some conviction about how wonderful it was to 
be involved in international trade, how it was providing jobs and 
that kind of thing. I agree. It is a very important aspect of what we 
do in Canada.
<P>
	I am just curious to know why the hon. member and her 
colleagues fought so hard against international agreements like 
NAFTA and actually broke their promise to renegotiate it. Again I 
find it fairly strange. I was talking about broken promises. I thank 
the hon. member for reminding me of a major one that the Liberals 
broke which was that they were going to renegotiate the NAFTA 
agreement. Of course they completely and utterly failed to do that. 
I do not know who they are going to blame that one on. They 
cannot blame the auditor general for that one. I guess they will have 
to accept some responsibility for that one themselves.
<P>
	With respect to the complexity of the taxation system, we are not 
suggesting that we can reduce thousands and thousands of pages of 
tax rulings down to a single page. Hardly. We are suggesting that 
after three years in government the government should have done 
something to clarify that particular piece of tax legislation. The 
government employs batteries of lawyers and accountants. By this 
point in the government's mandate it is important that it look at all 
its taxation policies and ensure that there are not big loopholes or at 
least there are not issues that are up for dispute which would allow 
people potentially to ship $2 billion out of the country without it 
being taxed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Mississauga South 
has one minute and then the member has one minute to reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the 
tax issue, the Reform Party has long advocated a flat tax system 
which allows for a basic exemption, no deductions, very simple. 
Reformers have also advocated replacing established pension plans 
with RRSPs. I see the member is nodding his head and he 
acknowledges that these are two things Reform has talked about.
<P>
	The fact is that a flat tax approach basically shifts the tax burden 
from high income earners to middle income earners. How does the 
member square that system which does not allow deductions, 
including deductions for RRSPs, with Reform's other position that 
we should have more RRSPs to deal with pension entitlements?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is more than one version of a 
flat tax.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Centre has presented a version 
which would include RRSPs and would be a modified version of 
the present system. It would be far simpler, far less complicated, 
and people would be able to understand it a lot more. He is just 
being reasonable. He is saying: ``Let's not throw out everything 
that we have done up until now. Let's remember that the current tax 
system is what undergirds different parts of the economy''.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	If we yank it out in one big sweeping movement, there will be all 
kinds of implications throughout the economy.  He has presented a 
very reasonable way of simplifying the system, still allowing 
people to save for their own retirement, especially at a time when 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4727"> 4727 </A></B>
<P>
the government has failed to do anything to preserve the Canada 
pension plan, thus imperilling the future of many Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we all 
know, for nearly two weeks now, the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of National Revenue have either evaded the official 
opposition's questions about this scandal concerning family trusts 
or attempted to trivialize the fact that $2 billion were transferred to 
the U.S totally tax-free.
<P>
	There is indeed a political scandal when, for three years, a 
government prevented the auditor general from getting to the 
bottom of this issue and, after the auditor general finally succeeded 
in alerting the Canadian public to this financial scandal, the Liberal 
majority on the finance committee found nothing better to do than 
to attack this senior official who is accountable only to Parliament.
<P>
	Instead of shedding light on this issue that reeks of political 
opportunism and patronage, the Minister of National Revenue has 
the gall to say that the Bloc Quebecois is misleading the public on 
this issue. To inform the public is to mislead the public, is that it? 
The government's approach is really quite amazing.
<P>
	I would rather take the word of the auditor general, the real 
ombudsman of those who pay taxes in this country, over that of the 
Liberal revenue minister. According to the Canadian press, the 
minister believes that the problem is not family trusts, but rather 
the rules governing the transfer of funds abroad. What we know for 
a fact is that $2 billion were transferred outside of Canada without 
a penny being paid in taxes and that these funds came from family 
trusts.
<P>
	The Liberals are out to destroy the credibility of one of the most 
important institutions of our parliamentary system: the Office of 
the Auditor General of Canada. In their report, they arrive at a 
distorted interpretation of the Income Tax Act in order to justify the 
inconsistency of the revenue and finance departments, relying 
blindly on the testimony of six experts from the private sector, who 
are clearly in a conflict of interest position.
<P>
	In its report, the Liberal majority on the finance committee 
launched into an unprecedented attack against the Office of the 
Auditor General of Canada, one of the most respected institutions 
of our democratic system. Already, during the hearings of the 
finance committee, we witnessed disgraceful scenes where, for 
nearly two hours, the chairman himself outrageously and 
arrogantly attacked the credibility of the auditor general.
<P>
	Analyzing the auditor general's role and mandate, one 
immediately sees the limits that the Liberal majority wishes to 
impose. The Office of the Auditor General plays a key role in 
making an independent evaluation of the information provided to 
Parliament by the government. A Revenue Canada ruling, which 
seems to contravene the spirit of the Income Tax Act, was made in 
great haste, without any notes or minutes, one December 23, and 
could cost Canadian taxpayers hundreds of millions, according to 
the auditor general.
<P>
	Should this issue be debated in the House of Commons? To ask 
the question is to answer it.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	The act setting out the auditor general's mandate is clear. 
Nevertheless, the Liberal majority attacks it, attempting to 
discredit his role for purely partisan reasons.
<P>
	In his 1984, 1985, 1987, 1990, 1992, and even 1993 reports, the 
auditor general analyzed the application of the Income Tax Act, 
without anyone at the time questioning his mandate, his expertise, 
or even the appropriateness of his intervention. Quite the contrary, 
the Liberals, who were then in the opposition, did not hesitate to 
use the reports to attack the Conservative government. How is it 
today that the Liberal majority is systematically attacking a pillar 
of our system of parliamentary accountability?
<P>
	The analysis of all the events which followed the tabling of the 
report underscores the overt partisanship of the Liberal 
government, which is attempting to hush the whole thing up.
<P>
	Following the revelations of <I>The Globe and Mail</I>, the 
government gagged the Standing Committee on Public Accounts 
by referring the issue of family trusts to the Standing Committee on 
Finance whose chairman is, of course, not a member of the 
opposition.
<P>
	For the Bloc québécois, it is obvious that this change of attitude 
shows the bad faith of the Liberals, who are trying, through stalling 
tactics, to hush up the scandal and, through unwarranted attacks, to 
undermine the credibility of the auditor general himself.
<P>
	During the two years I was the chair of the Standing Committee 
on Public Accounts, I remember how much respect all the 
members, even Liberal members, had for the auditor general. Why 
this sudden change of attitude? Why have the Liberal members 
who were sitting or are still sitting today on the public accounts 
committee suddenly been silenced? This about-face by the Liberals 
brings us back to the issue of influence exerted by partisan interests 
and probably by friends of the Liberal Party and contributors to the 
Liberals' campaign fund.
<P>
	The conclusion to be drawn from this less than edifying saga for 
the members opposite is that the government is trying to protect 
people close to the top who benefited from the generosity of 
Revenue Canada, or even to hide a possible conflict of interest.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4728"> 4728 </A></B>
<P>
	With the tabling of its report, the Liberal majority has shown 
how little respect it has for parliamentary institutions and has 
succeeded roundly in fuelling people's cynical view of politicians 
who are more committed to party interests than to good 
government.
<P>
	Let us look at how this truly amazing story has unfolded. The 
auditor general reviewed two advance rulings on the transfer to the 
United States of assets worth at least $2 billion formerly held in 
Canadian family trusts, despite what the revenue minister had to 
say.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Finance was then asked by the 
Minister of Finance himself to examine the ambiguous provisions 
of the Income Tax Act pointed out in the auditor general's report. 
Meanwhile, in order to analyze and interpret the law correctly, the 
finance committee called several tax experts as witnesses. Now, in 
its report, contrary to all expectations, the finance committee has 
endorsed without reservation Revenue Canada's interpretation, and 
based its findings only on the evidence given by six out of eight 
experts called earlier this summer to give evidence before the 
committee without even ruling on the appropriateness of the 
evidence heard.
<P>
	The Liberal majority accepted only those comments made by the 
tax experts who were in a position to devise such a tax planning 
scheme for their customers. However, the Liberals never saw fit to 
include in the report the comments made by a disinterested 
authority, like the distinguished Professor Brooks of the faculty of 
law in Toronto.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	The matter the Standing Committee on Finance had to settle was 
whether what Parliament intended was clear. Can Canadian 
residents have taxable Canadian property or not? That was the issue 
at stake.
<P>
	As the Liberal majority put it in the report, the crucial issue on 
which the decisions were ultimately to be based was whether such 
property could be taxable Canadian property belonging to a 
Canadian resident.
<P>
	If the answer is yes, then it is possible for a Canadian resident to 
transfer property abroad and to avoid paying taxes in Canada 
immediately. In such a case, the taxes will be collected by the 
American government instead of the Canadian government, if the 
property transferred is sold more than 10 years after the transfer. 
However, if the answer is no, as we believe it to be, it means that 
the concept of taxable Canadian property cannot apply to a 
Canadian resident and that the capital gain is deemed to be taxable 
as soon as the property leaves the country.
<P>
	Up until the advance ruling-because it was an advance ruling 
Revenue Canada made in 1991-taxable Canadian property 
applied only to non-residents. In all likelihood, Parliament 
intended to control the taxation of capital gains earned by 
non-residents. However, section  85(1)(<I>i</I>) of the Act stipulates that 
capital stock of public corporations is taxable Canadian property 
when it is received as consideration for capital stock of private 
corporations.
<P>
	That is what the trust argued in its request for an advance ruling. 
However, according to the spirit of the law, this provision only 
applies when capital stock of public corporations is bought by 
non-residents. In the Act, when the application of the concept of 
taxable Canadian property becomes relevant for a resident, it is 
usually made very clear, as the following examples will show.
<P>
	Section 48(1)(<I>a</I>) indicates, and I quote: ``any property that would 
be taxable Canadian property if at no time in the year he had been 
resident in Canada''.
<P>
	Section 107(5) also stipulates, and I quote: ``property that is or 
would, if at no time in the taxation year of the trust in which it was 
so distributed the trust had been resident in Canada''.
<P>
	In its ruling, Revenue Canada mentioned that residents can have 
taxable Canadian property, which in itself sets a very dangerous 
precedent based only on section 97(2) of the Act. The Liberal 
majority report never questioned the use of a single paragraph of 
section 97 concerning precisely the taxation of partnerships to 
determine Parliament's intentions on such an important issue.
<P>
	Rather, the Liberal majority was satisfied with the analysis by 
six of the eight experts called who, as you will all remember, work 
for firms involved in such transactions for the benefit of private 
customers.
<P>
	The proposal by the Bloc Quebecois could not be clearer: even 
though the issue is essentially one of the holding by residents of a 
taxable Canadian property, that matter was never examined by the 
majority report. Section 97(2) to the effect that Canadian residents 
can hold taxable Canadian property was never questioned.
<P>
	Yet, in our opinion, invoking this section to determine the 
taxation of family trust property transferred outside of Canada is 
contrary to Parliament's intentions in the case of taxable Canadian 
property. Only non-residents should be able to use this taxable 
Canadian property concept, and that is well covered in the Act.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Therefore, section 97(2)<I>c</I>) of the Act should be revoked, thus 
eliminating this type of tax planning, which the Auditor General of 
Canada so rightly condemned.
<P>
	Our position is also shared by Professor Neil Brooks, a 
consultant whose impartiality is absolutely beyond doubt. He said, 
and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``My position is that the ruling the taxpayer received in this case 
is wrong in law and policy and common sense''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4729"> 4729 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This could not be any clearer, as was emphasized by Professor 
Brooks:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Wrong in law and policy and common sense''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Not one of the other expert witnesses challenged this argument 
by Professor Brooks. Parliament's intentions are crystal clear. 
Moreover, the auditor general argued that the Act-specifically 
sections 197(5), 115(1), 128(1) and 85(1)-shows rather clearly 
that Parliament did not want Canadian residents to possess 
``taxable Canadian property''.
<P>
	Consequently, in view of the auditor general's findings and the 
experts' testimony before the Standing Committee on Finance, we 
are compelled now to put forward three recommendations-and, in 
this regard, I fully support the three recommendations of the Bloc 
Quebecois minority report as well as the motion on family trusts 
tabled today by the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.
<P>
	Section 97(2)<I>c</I>) must be revoked to eliminate the lack of clarity 
pointed out by the auditor general in his report.
<P>
	The definition of ``taxable Canadian property'' must also be 
changed as soon as practicable so that residents cannot own 
``taxable Canadian property''. This is the simplest and surest way 
to eliminate any tax avoidance by transferring property outside 
Canada.
<P>
	Finally, the 1991 ruling must be cancelled so that no one can 
ever again refer to it to avoid paying taxes due to all Canadian 
taxpayers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it is necessary to 
comment again on some of the matters that have been raised in the 
hon. member's speech.
<P>
	First, the finance committee's report as tabled in the House, a 
public document, found that there was no loophole or tax evasion 
involved here. Revenue Canada applied the law correctly.
<P>
	Second, I must restate that Canada has one of the tightest 
systems for taxing people who move abroad. The fact that Canada 
does not tax some gains until they are actually realized is not a 
loophole. Nor is it a loophole that our tax treaties give us the right 
to tax some gains and our treaty partners have the right to tax other 
gains. That is the important main element, the migration of people 
outside the country. This is what we are talking about here, the tax 
treatment of these people when they leave the country. There are 
very definite rules in the Income Tax act.
<P>
	As a lawyer I have never been told that one subsection has a 
priority over another subsection unless it states that explicitly. So 
to say that there is just a little subsection here, so do not bother with 
it, is ridiculous. The experts backed that up in a very public, open 
round table meeting that went on for over six hours last spring, and 
members of the opposition were there.
<P>
	Again we have a minority report from the opposition members 
who have brought this motion today which is just politics. It does 
not state reality. Reality of the Canadian tax law today in Canada is 
a very complex situation. What any government should do is 
constantly improve.
<P>
	The report came up with very definite recommendations for the 
finance minister to consider. The report has been tabled. Those 
recommendations are on the table and they will be considered in 
due course. Canadians deserve the best tax law that we can come up 
with, but it has to be fair. The process has to be open. We have 
certainly had an open process.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I find it unbelievable that he thinks a policy decision concerning 
tax should not be debated in the finance committee. He may not 
even be aware that after tabling his report, the auditor general 
himself sent a letter off to the chair of the finance committee which 
stated that these sections of his report were under the purview of 
the finance committee and that it might want to look at them. That 
is the reality.
<P>
	What we have here is politics. I understand that the opposition's 
job is to play politics. Unfortunately for it, the job of government is 
to govern and when we govern we govern with the real facts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary is telling 
us that it is a public document and that the opposition's objections 
are of a political nature. I would like to respond to the 
parliamentary secretary by submitting to him the three following 
elements.
<P>
	First, I would like to inform him that the only ones who support 
the government are six experts out of the eight who appeared 
before the finance committee. And, as everyone knows, these six 
experts have very close and direct connections with rich Canadian 
families. Professor Brooks, whom I mentioned earlier in my 
speech, did not agree at all with their position.
<P>
	I would also like to point out to the parliamentary secretary that 
the group Cho!ces, a newly formed group which agrees with the 
auditor general's recommendation, intends to challenge Revenue 
Canada's ruling in the courts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4730"> 4730 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to add that even if the legality of Revenue Canada's 
ruling is questionable, I believe that we must also consider the 
fairness of the ruling for all Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	I would now like to point out the third element. As my colleague, 
the member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, said this morning, this 
decision was taken on the sly 24 hours before Christmas. We know 
that the notice had been rejected by junior officials for a few 
months in 1991.
<P>
	Suddenly, 24 hours before Christmas, as the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot said, when the turkey was on the table 
everywhere in Canada, senior officials from Revenue Canada and 
Finance Canada examined the case and, at a few hours notice, 
allowed the $2 billion out of the country. This is really outrageous.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Cariboo-Chilcotin 
has about a minute to make a question or comment. Then we will 
move on to debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to begin by thanking the hon. member and the Bloc for 
bringing this motion to the House today.
<P>
	I want to know if the members of the Bloc will be pointing to the 
ongoing thrust of the government for more and more-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the member finished his question? If 
not, could he please put his question now.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> I want to ask how members of the Bloc would 
have the legislation changed to prevent the government from doing 
this.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with what the Reform member 
is implying. We should immediately change the Canadian 
legislation, the Income Tax Act, to prevent, from now on, amounts 
of money as huge as those transferred in 1991 being moved out of 
the country a few hours before the end of the fiscal year.
<P>
	I think that instead of trying to put the auditor general on the spot 
and to prevent him from carrying out his mandate, from acting like 
a real ombudsman for Canadian taxpayers, the finance committee 
should immediately review this aspect of the act and prevent, in 
future, anyone from transferring out of Canada and tax free such 
amounts of money.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the auditor 
general reported a short while ago to Parliament on some prior tax 
rulings given by Revenue Canada, one in 1985 and another in 1991. 
This report comes six years after the last ruling was given. The 
essence of his report  was: ``The rulings may have circumvented 
the intent of the law''.
<P>
	The auditor general was good enough to send me in a letter a 
copy of his report to Parliament. As chairman of the finance 
committee I took this very seriously, just as the government took 
this issue very seriously. Here we had one of the most respected 
and important institutions and individuals in the parliamentary 
process saying there might have been a misinterpretation or 
misapplication of the law as it existed. This is a very serious 
charge.
<P>
	Very quickly members of the finance committee called before us 
the auditor general and his officials and asked him to explain 
further what had happened. That was not the end of our 
discussions. We called as well public servants from the office of the 
Departments of Revenue Canada, Justice and Finance to assist us in 
dealing with this issue.
<P>
	In listening to the auditor general here is basically what he said: 
``We have absolutely no evidence of impropriety on behalf of 
Canada's officials. We have absolutely no evidence of political 
interference, but we still think they misapplied the law''. This is an 
extremely complex area of the law and as the auditor general said, 
it is an area of the law which is very ambiguous.
<P>
	There are provisions in the Income Tax Act which pointed in one 
direction and there were other provisions which pointed in an 
opposite direction. I wish it were not so, but our Income Tax Act is 
very thick and there is not one practitioner in Canada today who 
can in all honesty say they understand all aspects of that code. The 
profession has had to break itself down into people who are experts 
on particular areas of the Income Tax Act. To further complicate 
the issue, it is not just the Income Tax Act, but on top of that was 
the overlay of the Canada-U.S. tax treaty which involved a further 
set of complications.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	What did we do as a committee? We decided that since the 
auditor general and his officials had charged that there may have 
been a misapplication of the law, and since we are not the experts, 
or could ever hope to be the final arbiters of a dispute of this nature 
we asked a group of tax experts, not just tax experts in general but 
international tax experts to come before the committee. The auditor 
general suggested certain experts. Professor Neil Brooks from 
Osgoode Hall appeared before us at the request of the auditor 
general. All opposition parties had an opportunity to suggest who 
those experts should be.
<P>
	We asked those experts if the prior ruling given by Revenue 
Canada officials was a misapplication of the law? Out of the eight 
experts there, one said it may have been. Professor Brooks said it 
definitely was. The six others said in no way was this a 
misapplication of the law. That is what we reported to Parliament.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4731"> 4731 </A></B>
<P>
	Overlaying this question of whether this difficult judgment 
taken by Revenue Canada officials was correct or not was that 
when the facts were released saying that the prior tax ruling 
involved some $2 billion having been transferred out of Canada 
by family trusts to the United States, almost immediately on 
release of that report, speculation occurred regarding the precise 
identity of the taxpayer. This raised tremendous concerns 
throughout Canada's tax community. The essence of our voluntary 
system of tax compliance and reporting is that the confidentiality 
of the taxpayer must always be respected. It is a criminal offence 
to breach taxpayer confidentiality.
<P>
	Obviously, the auditor general was concerned about this. He 
presented to us an opinion saying that what he had released had not 
been a breach of the law. That was never a concern on the 
committee. The concern expressed to us by Canada's tax 
community was that, if you cannot go for a prior ruling without fear 
of having your name disclosed in the press, then why go for a tax 
ruling? If someone can contest publicly a tax ruling with the 
possibility that the taxpayer's name can be revealed, what will this 
do to the ruling process?
<P>
	The auditor general, in his report to Parliament a couple of years 
ago, said: ``It is so critical where there are complex and ambiguous 
laws, the taxpayers need the certainty of prior rulings''. We 
certainly agree with him.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	Something we commented on in our report was that it is critical 
that any of us as members of Parliament, members of the finance 
committee, members of the government, members of the public 
departments, be it revenue, justice or finance or be it the auditor 
general, that we respect the confidentiality of taxpayers. It behoves 
us in our actions in the House of Commons and elsewhere to make 
sure that we respect that confidentiality in order to preserve the 
integrity of a system of income taxation based on voluntary 
compliance.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc Quebecois have tried to make a great deal 
out of this particular issue. They said that this breach of 
confidentiality was not because of the release of all of this detailed 
information to the public by the auditor general but that it was 
``because of a source inside the federal government itself that the 
names were divulged''. Never once did the Bloc Quebecois call 
that person before us or say who it was. They are alleging that an 
official in the government breached this confidentiality.
<P>
	This is casting an aspersion on the entire revenue and finance 
departments. If they are going to make this charge, then they have 
the obligation to bring the name of that individual forward other 
than to dwell on issues of allegation.
<P>
	Bloc members have said as well that the government muzzled 
the public accounts committee by transferring  the family trust 
issue to the finance committee. The critic for the Bloc Quebecois 
approached me and said: ``We want to make sure that the finance 
committee deals with this issue''. Why would he change his mind? 
After all it was dealing with provisions of the Income Tax Act. Are 
they not the purview of the finance committee? Had not the auditor 
general asked us to look at it? Had not the government asked us to 
look at it? These are the things that we are supposed to do.
<P>
	Let us not pretend that we in the finance committee have been 
trying to block discussion of this issue. We made the offer to all 
opposition parties to hold any other sessions, to call any other 
witnesses they wanted. They said that they had heard enough.
<P>
	What did we do in the finance committee as a result of these 
hearings? We reported what the vast majority of Canada's tax 
experts, some of the leading names in the country, such as Davies, 
Ward &amp; Beck, Goodman &amp; Carr, Ernst &amp; Young, Coopers &amp; 
Lybrand, the people who deal with these issues on a specialized 
basis, Davies, Warden &amp; Beck, Stikeman Elliott, people who deal 
with these issues on a daily basis, told us. They told us that the 
ruling given by revenue was not wrong.
<P>
	What did we also find out in our hearings? We found out that 
before revenue ruled in this particular case it did a couple of things. 
It called on justice for an interpretation of this complex and 
ambiguous area in the Income Tax Act. Justice serves as the lawyer 
to the Revenue Canada officials. Justice said: ``We believe that the 
way the Income Tax Act reads, taxable Canadian property can be 
owned by a resident of Canada''. That was the technical issue 
involved. However, Revenue Canada did not stop with the opinion 
of the lawyer of the justice department. It went to the finance 
officials. It asked: ``What do you think is the intent of the law? Can 
residents of Canada own taxable Canadian property?'' The finance 
officials said, yes.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	I ask members in the House to consider this situation. You are 
working in the Department of National Revenue and are asked to 
give a ruling. You realize that it is complex. There are ambiguities. 
You consult the department's lawyers. Not only that, you go further 
and find out from finance what it thinks the law was intended to do. 
Should there be a higher duty imposed on you as a public servant 
than to consult your lawyers and finance? Should it be the 
obligation of anybody in any department of this government who 
has doubts about anything to go and consult the auditor general in 
advance?
<P>
	What standard of care are we attempting to impose on our public 
officials who are not here in Ottawa to get rich? We know they 
cannot. Public servants have had a freeze on their salaries for five 
years. If someone wants to get rich he or she goes into the private 
sector. What standard of care are we as politicians attempting to 
impose on them? I submit that no higher standard of care  could 
have been exercised by revenue officials when they consulted their 
lawyers and finance, knowing that the law was not certain.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4732"> 4732 </A></B>
<P>
	What did we recommend as a finance committee? We said: 
``Auditor general, in spite of the fact that we have some misgivings 
about the way your disclosures resulted in speculation in the name 
of the taxpayer and despite the fact that the experts we called 
before us do not agree with your interpretation of the law, i.e. that it 
should not have been ruled on such except for Professor Neil 
Brooks who is a frequent witness before our committee, always at 
the behest of the Bloc but this time at the behest of the auditor 
general, while we do not agree that this ruling may have 
misinterpreted the intent of the law, nevertheless, we think the 
point you have made before us is critical. We think you have 
discovered a loophole in the law. We think you have discovered an 
area where we must act to change the law''.
<P>
	That is why in our report we have suggested many changes in the 
law, changes which go far beyond those proposed in the minority 
report of the Bloc. Our suggestions for plugging the loopholes and 
for tightening up the Canadian tax net go far beyond what the 
opposition parties have suggested they would do. Therefore, before 
they criticize us let them look to their own decisions and maybe 
reconsider them.
<P>
	Let us be very clear. Apart from having a very complex and 
ambiguous tax law in this area, the testimony before us indicated 
that Canada already has probably the tightest tax net when it comes 
to taxpayers leaving our country, perhaps along with Australia and 
Denmark. In spite of that, we recommended that the government 
act quickly to make that tax net even tighter.
<P>
	We said that we should look at deemed realizations for all 
property when a taxpayer leaves this country. We might not collect 
it immediately because that would be stupid. Sometimes people 
leave this country and take up residence elsewhere but have shares 
in a small business which is ongoing or they may own an apartment 
building or a house. Is it right to charge them the tax the moment 
they leave the country as opposed to when they actually sell that 
property?
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	We are not prepared to be stupid. We have to recognize that in 
our tax systems different individuals and different circumstances 
have different needs.
<P>
	We came down fully and squarely against the type of thing that 
happened, in terms of trusts being able to take large sums out of 
this country. We have recommended that in the future that type of 
provision not be allowed.
<P>
	We have recommended that there be increased reporting 
requirements for Canadians leaving the country so that in 
circumstances where the tax system might not otherwise pick up 
what those assets may be that are subject to future disposition and 
which we may not be  able to track in a coherent way, Revenue 
Canada has a way of doing that. These recommendations were not 
pulled out of the blue, they were based on expert testimony we 
heard.
<P>
	In conclusion, the majority report thanks the auditor general for 
having brought these matters to our attention. The greatest 
compliment, apart from thanking him, we could have paid to him 
was that we said: ``We do not like the result. We are, therefore, 
henceforth going to recommend to Parliament that the law be 
changed''. We, as well as the auditor general I am sure, hope that in 
the future there will be continuing access to the ruling process and 
the speculation as to the identity of the taxpayer, the breach in 
confidentiality, will not have a chilling impact on the need to have 
these rulings.
<P>
	I am pleased to report that the auditor general vindicated the 
integrity of the process and the bona fides of our officials. I believe 
we have all benefited from having this matter brought to light.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, basically, I have four points to make. I think that with time 
and with the wearing effect of politics, the hon. member for 
Willowdale, who is chairman of the finance committee, became a 
misinformation expert.
<P>
	He said that they took the issue seriously and that the auditor 
general is one of the most respected institutions, but he does not 
believe his own words. I say that because when the auditor general 
appeared before the committee, the member for Willowdale, with 
the complicity of senior civil servants who took part in the 1991 
advanced ruling allowing the transfer of $2 billion outside of 
Canada tax free, tried for an hour and a half to give him hell, catch 
him off guard and undermine his credibility.
<P>
	That continued when the liberal majority report produced under 
the direction of the chairman of the finance committee was made 
public. What do we find in that report? Two things. A major part of 
it continued the attack on the reputation of the auditor general. He 
was accused of violating confidentiality rules when the leak, 
mentioned in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> a few days after the auditor 
general made the scandal public, was traced back to Revenue 
Canada. Maybe there are civil servants who have had enough of the 
establishment and the complicity between the decision-makers 
responsible for those advanced rulings and the wealthy Canadian 
families. I think that is the truth of the matter. The report 
denigrated the auditor general.
<P>
	One other example of misinformation is the statement by the 
chairman of the finance committee, the hon. member for 
Willowdale, that the Liberal proposals go farther than those of the 
Bloc. Sure they go farther in the sense that they open wide the 
doors to massive capital transfers for Canadian millionaires and 
billionaires. They certainly do go farther.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4733"> 4733 </A></B>
<P>
	We are saying that this loophole must be closed. We must put 
an end to twisted interpretations, such as the ones we got from 
the senior officials who made this shameful decision in 1991 
without doing a technical analysis of the Income Tax Act and 
without taking the time to write the minutes of the numerous 
meetings they had for one week until December 23, 1991.
<P>
	As for the experts, here is another thing that goes against the 
credibility of the chairman of the finance committee. He is the one 
who invited these experts. Six of the experts that were at that table 
were invited by him.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	These experts have no credibility whatsoever, as far as I am 
concerned. Do you know why? Because they come from the very 
tax consulting firms which help rich Canadian families transfer 
their money out of the country. On the word of these six experts 
chosen by the chairman, chosen by the establishment of the Liberal 
Party of Canada, the Liberal majority report says there is no 
problem, there are no capital transfers.
<P>
	Finally, when the member for Willowdale and chairman of the 
finance committee says that the financial community is worried, I 
can understand why because, for the first time in a very long time, 
the auditor general and the official opposition have uncovered a 
scandal, a conspiracy that has been going on for decades between 
the deputy ministers, the assistant deputy ministers and the senior 
officials responsible for advance rulings and the rich Canadian 
families who want to take money out of the country. That was the 
concern of the financial community.
<P>
	I will never forget a certain Mr. Goodman, a tax expert invited by 
the Liberal Party of Canada, by the chairman of the finance 
committee, who said: ``The auditor general should have never 
informed Canadians of these kinds of things. They are far too 
complex''.
<P>
	What that expert was saying really is that, when dealing with 
complex issues, it is better that the public be kept in the dark. When 
these kinds of scandals occur, they have to be hidden. Even the 
auditor general, who is accountable to Parliament, to the people, 
and who is the watchdog of our public finances, should have kept 
his mouth shut because it was outside his mandate. That is the 
reality of the situation.
<P>
	It bothers me when I hear remarks like the ones made by the 
chairman of the finance committee, which I think are misleading 
and are the reason why this man is losing even more credibility not 
only with his own committee members, but also with Canadians. 
The picture painted by the chairman of the finance committee is 
totally contrary to the facts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are a number of points which 
have been brought up by the hon. member.
<P>
	First, he said we are saying there was no flight of capital, that 
through the committee process we were involved in a flight of 
capital. What took place was under a former government. The 
majority side on the committee said there was a flight of capital but 
we must stop it. We are the ones who are saying this is not right and 
we have recommended the changes to the law.
<P>
	I find it passing strange that the hon. member, the chief financial 
critic for the Bloc, would say the experts who were called before 
our committee have no credibility whatsoever. In the same breath 
he said the Liberal majority attacked the message bearer, the 
auditor general.
<P>
	Let me be very clear. It was not an attack. It was a mild rebuke. 
We criticized the way the auditor general released the information 
which led to speculation as to who the taxpayer was and according 
to the experts before us could put a chill on the entire ruling 
process.
<P>
	We accepted the rulings. All the experts said that the ruling given 
by Revenue Canada had been proper in the circumstances. A 
fundamental aspect of our report was that we accepted his criticism 
of a system that allowed that money to escape and we 
recommended the loopholes be plugged.
<P>
	I find it passing strange that his only attack on our report was 
that we attacked the auditor general. We said exactly what I have 
just said.
<P>
	The member, as did all members, had the opportunity to bring 
other experts before our committee to deal with the precise 
complex and ambiguous tax provisions in question. Why does he 
attack them? If he did not like them he could have brought others. 
He had that opportunity. So for him to say we were attacking the 
messenger is fundamentally how he is attacking our report. He said 
he did not like the message and that these experts who came before 
us were not able to give us proper advice.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	To say that, he is attacking the basis on which some of the 
biggest and finest auditing companies and legal firms in this 
country act. Their opinions have to be right. Their opinions are 
relied upon by shareholders, taxpayers, by others, by the people 
who buy shares in public companies. Their integrity and their 
wisdom are critical to this process.
<P>
	For him to attack the messengers the way he said we were, which 
is a total mistake, a misinterpretation of the situation, is to me 
totally inconsistent. I wish he would stick to the issues and I wish 
he would join us in urging the government to plug these loopholes 
as quickly as possible.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, our 
Liberal colleague, the chairman of the Standing Committee on 
Finance, continues to insist that  the present government is not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4734"> 4734 </A></B>
<P>
touched by the December 1991 ruling, because the ruling was made 
under the former government.
<P>
	If that is true, why is the present government refusing to shed 
light on everything that preceded this meeting? Why does it 
approve of the fact that there were no minutes? Are we to 
understand that this shows better than anything that they could say 
that Canadian Conservatives and Liberals are as alike as peas in a 
pod, that they owe their existence to the same slush fund, that they 
are both in cahoots with financial circles, as was clear one evening 
when I took part-as I will tell you shortly-in the farce at which 
leading Canadian lights that advise wealthy families came to tell 
elected representatives and the public that they should mind their 
own business, that we were attacking the integrity of the Canadian 
tax regime?
<P>
	I would like our honourable colleague, whose arrogance 
occasionally creeps through, to comment on this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is alleging that we 
were trying to cover things up. The official opposition, the Bloc 
Quebecois, was asked whether it had any witnesses to bring 
forward. We said we will deal with any of these issues. We wanted 
it fully dealt with in the finance committee, just as the Bloc had 
asked us to deal with it fully in the finance committee. We 
contacted it a number of times and it said ``no, we have no more 
witnesses''.
<P>
	How could we be the ones who are trying to cover up things 
when we opened it up to discussion of any sort? We called the 
witnesses asked for by the Bloc, the Reform and the auditor 
general. We asked them: ``Do you want to have any more hearings 
or can we get to the report stage on this issue?'' That is not a 
cover-up. Would they please quit making innuendoes and 
allegations which have no foundation whatsoever.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before addressing the motion before us today, I 
would like to begin by informing you that, henceforth, the Bloc 
Mps will be dividing their time into two periods of ten minutes, and 
that my colleague from Trois-Rivières will be speaking 
immediately after me.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	When the matter of the family trusts resurfaced to become a 
source of concern to all Canadians and all Quebecers, thanks to the 
efforts of the members of the Bloc Quebecois-I shall come back 
to this point-and when the official opposition suggested that this 
opposition day be devoted to the matter of family trusts, I made it 
known to my colleague from Ste-Hyacinthe-Bagot that I wanted 
to intervene in this  debate. I am far from claiming to be a tax 
expert, which is why I will let others explain the matter in 
detail-as my colleague for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot has already 
done on several occasions, moreover-but I would like to draw the 
attention of this House to the context surrounding this whole affair.
<P>
	This matter of family trusts is one that has been of concern to the 
Bloc Quebecois almost since its inception. In the last campaign, the 
Bloc raised the issue on numerous occasions. After the Bloc 
obtained 54 seats and gained recognition as the official opposition 
in this House, the Leader of the Opposition at that time, Mr. 
Bouchard, raised the question of family trusts on a number of 
occasions during his interventions in this House.
<P>
	The auditor general's report fully justifies our concerns, proving 
that we were right to raise the issue in recent years, while the 
Liberals on the other side of this House have clearly sought to stifle 
this shameful scandal by every means possible.
<P>
	I just heard the hon. member for Willowdale. I suggest that he 
audition for the festival ``Juste pour rire'' next year in Montreal, or 
``Just for laughs'' if he prefers, since there is an English version, 
because his comments outside this House, in committee and here in 
the House today should be good for laughs. We cannot afford to 
take them seriously.
<P>
	The auditor general put his finger on a major problem in the tax 
system. The government may argue that the loophole pointed out 
by the auditor general goes back to the previous government. As 
the hon. member for Trois-Rivières just said, if the Conservative 
government was responsible, why is this government reluctant to 
shed every possible light on the problem?
<P>
	It is pretty obvious, and this has been said time and time again, 
that there is only one reason why the government does not want to 
shed light on the matter. It wants to protect its own interests and the 
interests of those who support it. It is a big joke to hear the hon. 
member for Willowdale describe these experts as people whose 
credibility is undisputed, although it is public knowledge that they 
belong to companies that finance the Liberal Party and the 
Conservative Party. That is public knowledge. It is not gossip or 
libel. It is a fact that representatives of these companies finance the 
Liberal Party.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	For the government to invite experts like these, competent 
though they may be, is like inviting some foxes and asking them for 
tips on protecting the chicken coop. That is what happened. They 
invited experts who consistently provide funding for the Liberal 
Party and told them: ``Could you tell us whether it is right to take 
money out of Canada and invest it elsewhere, to avoid  paying 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4735"> 4735 </A></B>
<P>
income tax?'' It would have been astonishing indeed if the experts 
had not answered the way they did.
<P>
	Take the Minister of Finance. A week ago on Radio-Canada, a 
journalist asked him whether he had a family trust. He answer is on 
the record-and I took the trouble of listening to the news bulletin 
again to be sure I did not misquote him-and it was as follows, and 
I will quote him verbatim: ``There are many family trusts. When 
you have young children, you do that. In case I die, I would want 
someone to take care of my children''. But that has no connection 
with income tax.
<P>
	When he said this, the Minister of Finance admitted that he 
himself had a family trust, and that the reason was to protect his 
children. But who in this House will protect the children of the 
unemployed, victims of cuts that have been made for the past two 
or three years? The same finance minister says, admits in each 
budget he brings down that, with the unemployment insurance 
fund, he makes $5 billion in profits every year at the expense of the 
unemployed and of single mothers who do not have even enough to 
support their children. Who is the Minister of Finance trying to 
protect? The answer is obvious. Now who will protect these 
families living on unemployment insurance which, contrary to 
what the Minister of National Revenue said, cannot escape the 
Income Tax Act because they cannot afford to have family trusts?
<P>
	It takes some nerve to state, as the Minister of National Revenue 
did in this House, that anyone can have a family trust. It may be 
true of seniors who decide to move to Florida. What seniors in 
Canada and Quebec can afford a family trust when their pensions 
are being cut back? Who, among the unemployed, I repeat, can 
afford a family trust?
<P>
	They are mocking people. Mocking people and undermining the 
credibility of our institutions. And because of that, the people have 
lost faith not only in our tax system, but also in governments and 
their elected officers.
<P>
	I will conclude by reminding the House that the Bloc Quebecois 
has given itself a mandate to promote sovereignty, and we will keep 
promoting sovereignty. We have also given ourselves a mandate to 
represent the interests of Quebec in this House. Our work on the 
family trust issue is a perfect example of the kind of work we have 
done here over the past three years. And the auditor general agrees 
with the Bloc Quebecois. His message is that someone in this 
House has to be free to stand up and condemn these unacceptable 
actions on the part of this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, of course, I 
listened carefully. It was difficult not to hear the passionate 
comments made by the hon. member who spoke before me about 
an issue that undoubtedly affects him and which he feels 
passionately about.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	But I think it is rather interesting that this same member, pointed 
first at the government benches instead of using the opportunity to 
talk with his seven colleagues who were in the Tory government in 
the last Parliament.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It seems to me to be rather inconsistent for this member to be 
pointing a finger at this side of the House when he has not taken the 
first step, a logical step, a rational step, to ask members of his own 
caucus who were part and parcel of that problem in the early 1990s 
when several of those members, including the former leader of his 
party, were at the front bench of the government that made that 
decision.
<P>
	When will the hon. member start to talk to some of his 
Conservative cronies in his own party and maybe ask them where 
this process began, why they are not here asking the same questions 
he is now asking rather hypocritically?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
again, we will have another representative at the Just for Laughs 
Festival. I cannot believe the comments made by the hon. member 
from Ontario, who, usually, takes positions that show he is capable 
of thinking and also of being critical.
<P>
	I understand that, when we are dealing with money, finances or 
election funds, money talks. So, like all his colleagues, the hon. 
member from Ontario must rise in this House to defend the foxes 
lurking around the henhouse.
<P>
	In response to the hon. member, who asked me why I do not look 
at my colleagues and ask them what they are doing about family 
trusts, I can tell him that I am quite happy to turn to my colleagues, 
especially the former leader of the Bloc Quebecois who is now the 
premier of Quebec. He himself raised this matter in this House 
several times during the 1993 election campaign-we could show 
you the many speeches he gave on this and the questions that were 
asked about family trusts. No, I am not ashamed to turn to my 
colleagues who used to be in the Conservative Party, because they 
have done an extraordinary job as Bloc representatives in this 
House. Those who are still among us continue to do so.
<P>
	I wish I could say the same about our Liberal colleagues. Again, 
I hope they will change their minds and shift directions. The 
credibility of our institutions is at stake. Your credibility and that of 
the finance and revenue departments is at stake.
<P>
	When we ask people to pay taxes and to do their share to correct 
the current situation, everyone must pull his or her weight, 
including the rich.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4736"> 4736 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this very important debate.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead just 
pointed out, the Bloc Quebecois has long been concerned with this 
issue. Our founding president, Lucien Bouchard, now the premier 
of Quebec, had made it one of his primary concerns, as has our 
finance critic-this is part of Canadian Parliamentary tradition. 
Given the rule of secrecy and the lack of transparency, the Bloc 
Quebecois lacked a source. Therefore, we must congratulate and 
thank the auditor general for having had the courage to tell 
parliamentarians and Canadians about this scandal, back in May.
<P>
	We are not among those who seek to discredit, to condemn and 
to attack institutions because we are not pleased with them, as did 
former Liberal Prime Minister Trudeau-the Liberal party has a 
long tradition in this regard-when he lambasted the auditor 
general of the time for questioning the transaction whereby 
Petrofina was to become Petro-Canada.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	The auditor general had to go to the Supreme Court to find out 
what his real powers were, given Mr. Trudeau's arrogant and 
contemptuous attitude. The chairman of the finance committee, 
who used strong arm tactics with the auditor general as an 
institution and as an individual, also displayed a similar attitude.
<P>
	We will not get into this; we leave it to others in this House. We 
feel that, by raising the issue of transfer, otherwise known as tax 
evasion and the flight of capital, the auditor general should be 
highly commended for bringing the public debate back on the issue 
of family trusts. This is the point I want to focus on.
<P>
	Family trusts promote a concentration of wealth in the hands of 
some very rich Canadian families. Given the solid arguments made 
against family trusts by ordinary people, it is time we led the debate 
and the fight against secret investments. After all, our tax system is 
supposedly based on a fundamental rule of fairness, whereby 
everyone must pay his due to the taxman. Since the month of May, 
this has given us an opportunity to learn a bit, not much mind you, 
but a bit about family trusts and their very existence.
<P>
	We learned from the public accounts committee and the finance 
committee that, according to the revenue minister, and contrary to 
what a deputy minister seems to have said in committee, family 
trusts exist for those who want to be sure they can pay for a 
retirement in some southern clime.
<P>
	The finance minister sees them as a way of protecting his 
children. Very original. As for the deputy minister, he said a 
number of months ago that he did not understand  the Bloc 
Quebecois' obsession with family trusts, because they exist to 
protect families with handicapped children.
<P>
	We therefore learned, since the revelations of the auditor general 
who asked the deputy minister of revenue how many family trusts 
there were in Canada, that there were 100,000. A few weeks later, 
at a meeting of the finance committee, this 100,000 became 
140,000. When we know that two of them represent one billion 
each and that their transfer to the United States has apparently 
deprived the tax man of $400 to $600 million, we are not talking 
peanuts. These are large amounts of money.
<P>
	On the topic of family trusts of one billion dollars each, we asked 
a deputy minister how many there were of $500 million and up. He 
replied that he could not say, that he did not have that kind of 
information. It is a scandal. It is a scandal because, according to the 
spirit of the Income Tax Act, there is a fundamental rule, which is 
perhaps tacit, that everyone must contribute according to their 
means.
<P>
	When they come up with strategies like these, with the backing 
of the financial advisers whom we know, who advise wealthy 
families in order to help them move their money out of Canada and 
Quebec and to protect them even when they keep it inside the 
country, that is what is going on right now, it is in order to help 
people who have the means not to contribute their share. And 
everyone else must therefore contribute that much more.
<P>
	In the times we live in, as my colleague was saying earlier, with 
public finances in the state they are in, the most rudimentary sense 
of morality would require that everyone contribute according to 
their means and that, in so far as possible, this type of strategy be 
prohibited.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	We know about the cuts now being made throughout Canada in 
the fields of health, education, social assistance, unemployment 
insurance, culture, and public housing. We know about the cuts 
being made to community groups that provide assistance to the 
most disadvantaged. We know about the alarming increase in the 
number of food banks across Canada. We know about the increase 
in unemployment. We are aware of the whole ideological trend to 
dismantling the state, to limiting the role of government, one of 
whose main roles is precisely to better distribute the wealth, but 
this is contradicted by the discourse, attitude and language of the 
chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance, who criticizes 
one of the taxation ombudsmen who exists in our system, which 
works reasonably well when the rules are followed, furthermore, 
which makes Canada a developed country, a great democracy. 
When you make the claims that are made here, in this country, you 
must be consistent all the way.
<P>
	In these times when money is lacking-for what Canada has is 
not a problem of spending but a problem of revenue-that problem 
is highlighted in a most  extraordinary way by the question raised 
by the family trusts and the way they are reducing tax revenues. It 
is therefore necessary to have a precise idea of family trusts, to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4737"> 4737 </A></B>
<P>
know exactly how many have been set up following their creation 
under the Trudeau government in 1972. The figures will have to be 
broken down into categories, because not all family trusts may be 
billion dollar ones. We would have to know how many involved 
$100,000 or more, how many between $100,000 and $250,000, 
how many between $250,000 and $500,000, and so on. How many 
between $1 million and $5 million, how many between $5 million 
and $100 million, how many $500 million and up, as well as details 
on all the billion dollar ones. We would have to have precise 
information on their impact on the Canadian tax system and on 
each of the provinces of origin. It seems likely, for instance, that 
there would be some such family trusts in the Maritimes, New 
Brunswick, in particular. Without naming names, one might well 
think that the government of New Brunswick may have been 
deprived of some very considerable tax revenue by this sort of 
subterfuge.
<P>
	Ontario and Quebec, which have prominent families, also come 
to mind. We are entitled at least to exact figures on the effort 
required of other taxpayers, who have no choice about, for they 
cannot afford to hire the top tax guns, those same people invited by 
the chairman of the finance committee, who, despite all of their 
unarguable qualifications, are clearly in conflict of interest.
<P>
	We must know exactly what the situation is. We must know, for 
each province, what the impact is of a measure that was introduced 
by Pierre Eliott Trudeau, the man of the just society. We see the 
dishonesty of these people who are prepared to sign documents, as 
they did, to protect and reinforce the government's position.
<P>
	I am nearing the end of my speech. Instead of trying to confuse 
the issue, the government must examine not only the Revenue 
Canada ruling of December 23, 1991, but the whole issue of the 
existence of family trusts and their impact on the tax system, and 
this in order to really protect the credibility and integrity of our tax 
system, which, as I said earlier, was a big issue with one of the 
experts. As a member of Parliament I attended this incredible 
evening, this masquerade, when one of the Bay Street experts told 
the chairman that he was shocked by the attitude and behaviour of 
the auditor general, who should never have revealed to the public 
and the Canadian people that such practices existed because it 
would undermine the integrity of our Canadian tax system.
<P>
	This means that they go along with it. There are mechanisms to 
ensure that those who can pay their taxes, who should pay their 
taxes, who have the means to pay taxes-We know that in Canada 
today, there are people who do not have sufficient income to pay 
their taxes.  Those who do, those who are lucky and those who have 
worked for their money, but must realize that others are not that 
lucky and that we live in a civilized society. Wealth must be spread 
around, and this has to happen through the government, because we 
live in a society, and the government apparatus is a symbol of the 
well-organized, civilized and developed society we have. It means 
we have elections, elected representatives and mechanisms to 
redistribute wealth. We must protect those institutions, but the 
government's present attitude is very disturbing. We should not be 
<P>
surprised when citizens become increasingly cynical and critical of 
institutions like ours, when these institutions no longer appear to be 
doing their job.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest as the member of the Bloc argued this point 
about the tax ruling and the situation surrounding it. I am quite 
puzzled.
<P>
	This is a highly complex area of tax law, despite the best 
intentions of the members of the Bloc and members like me. As the 
member for Willowdale pointed out, members of the Bloc had the 
opportunity to bring in their own experts but instead chose not to.
<P>
	When the members of the Bloc stand up in this House it is 
usually to criticize members on our side for not answering their 
questions, but they have not really dealt with the question of why 
they did not bring in their own experts.
<P>
	If they are saying the experts who were there were in the hands 
of the members of this party, that is a serious affront to the integrity 
of those professionals who did appear and it does not deal with the 
question of why they did not bring in their own experts.
<P>
	When the members of the Bloc get up in the House it is really not 
to debate public policy. That has been my experience 
notwithstanding my short period in this House. When they get up it 
is to argue a parochial interest of the province of Quebec.
<P>
	I wonder if their interest in this issue is not driven by fiduciary 
policy or interests of the Government of Canada and the people of 
Canada. Rather, they may be concerned about the flight of capital 
from Quebec not necessarily to the United States but perhaps to 
Ontario. It is known that this is happening which I think is tragic.
<P>
	Perhaps the Bloc is positioning itself on this issue in terms of 
flight of capital. I cannot understand why it would have any other 
interest in this topic.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, on the subject of 
experts, I would like to reassure my hon. colleague from Etobicoke 
North by telling him that, if ever the government stops covering 
things up, as it just managed  to do in the finance committee and is 
trying to do in the public accounts committee, if the government 
will take its responsibility and accept to shed light on the matter, 
you will see that experts can be found, perhaps mainly in Quebec 
but also in Canada, whose hands are not tied. They are not legion, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4738"> 4738 </A></B>
<P>
but they are distinguished. The Bloc had identified a few; we found 
some and I am told that they will testify.
<P>
	But we must realize, and I have on good authority, that the 
auditor general is having huge problems with high finance 
officials, high finance advisors, because these people are not at all 
pleased with the auditor general passing this kind of judgment on 
their work, which goes against public opinion.
<P>
	Perhaps my hon. colleague from Etobicoke North should bear in 
mind that the auditor general is having a very hard time because 
free-thinking advisors are hard to find. They are all related parties 
because this is their livelihood.
<P>
	As for the Quebec fact, I hope that my hon. colleague simply 
misheard. When we talk about the Canadian tax system, about the 
flight of $2 billion from Canada, about $400 or $500 million in 
uncollected taxes, I do not think that we are talking only for 
Quebec. I think that we are doing our job as the Canadian official 
opposition, representing the interests of small taxpayers and 
middle-class taxpayers, who are being bled dry and are paying for 
those who should be paying more.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the 
motion brought forward today by the official opposition. This 
motion asks the House to denounce the government for refusing to 
shed light on certain transactions. However, I would like to suggest 
that it is actually the opposition members themselves who are 
refusing to see the light in this matter.
<P>
	The motion also contends that the government has attacked the 
credibility of the auditor general while allowing millions of dollars 
to leave the country.
<P>
	It would appear once again that the opposition is more content 
with promoting unfounded allegations and wild accusations than it 
is with a substantive review of the real issue and the true facts.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	The issues to which the motion vaguely refers were first raised 
by the auditor general in his May 7 report that focused on 
legislative policies and advance ruling procedures governing 
taxable Canadian property, not family trusts.
<P>
	Members will recall that immediately following the release of 
the auditor general's report, the government acted quickly by 
referring the issues raised in the report to the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on  Finance for review. That is where tax 
policy is made and then followed up by the decisions of 
government through its cabinet.
<P>
	That review has now been completed and the finance committee 
on September 18 issued a report and it is now tabled in the House. 
It is a public document. The finance committee's report represents 
a well documented and very thorough review of the important 
issues identified by the auditor general. We thank him for pointing 
out those policy areas. Its findings and recommendations directly 
contradict the exaggerations and confused contents of the motion 
before us today. However, it is a Bloc official opposition motion 
today and we are obliged to debate the motion put before us.
<P>
	The finance committee began its review on May 28. In the 
course of the examination it heard from the auditor general and 
members of his staff. It heard from senior officials of Revenue 
Canada, the Department of Justice and the Department of Finance. 
The committee also consulted eight of Canada's leading private 
sector and academic tax experts whose views, the committee noted 
in its report, greatly facilitated the committee's understanding of 
some of the technicalities of the tax law in the area.
<P>
	The finance committee is to be commended for acting quickly, 
consulting broadly and producing a thorough and, I must say, long 
report, including recommendations on so complex a topic in such a 
short time. We realize this is an important issue to be dealt with. 
Not surprisingly perhaps the committee determined that the law 
regarding taxable Canadian property is complex. It noted that the 
government has not reviewed the policy on taxpayer migration in 
any substantial way for at least 25 years. Now we have done this.
<P>
	However, rather than make cheap political points by trying to 
confuse the issue even further, like today from the opposition 
member, the committee has sought to clarify the issues by 
recommending changes to the law. The report's five 
recommendations for changes in the law aim at clarifying policy 
regarding Canada's taxation of individuals who become or cease to 
be residents of Canada. The report provides substantive advice to 
the government on strengthening tax law.
<P>
	While the policy and legislative recommendations are welcomed 
and will be closely examined by the Ministers of Finance and 
National Revenue, I want to focus my remarks today to the report's 
procedural findings and recommendations.
<P>
	I am very pleased to say that based on its expert assisted, 
independent review of the facts, the finance committee has found 
that Revenue Canada applied the law correctly and was justified in 
issuing its 1985 and 1991 advance tax rulings. The committee's 
report firmly supports the department's decisions in those cases.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4739"> 4739 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe the findings of the committee clearly confirm the 
fairness and the integrity of the Canadian tax system and the 
department's decisions in the cases and the administration by 
Revenue Canada. I am especially pleased to note that the 
independent experts consulted by the committee were almost 
unanimous in stating that the rulings then correctly applied 
existing law without evidence of any revenue loss resulting from 
the rulings.
<P>
	Of the eight prominent tax experts, six testified that Revenue 
Canada's interpretation was a correct reading of the law. The report 
quotes Mr. Wolfe Goodman, an expert in the field of international 
tax law, as an example of the majority opinion. Mr. Goodman 
states: ``The auditor general considers that this ruling circumvented 
the intent of the law and, with respect, Mr. Chairman and members, 
I think the ruling properly applied the policy of the legislation''.
<P>
	Based on this and similar testimony, the finance committee saw 
no reason to prefer the auditor general's view on this question to 
the views of both its government tax experts and a strong majority 
of tax professionals from the private sector. Also, contrary to the 
auditor general's suggestion in his May 7 report, the committee 
concluded that under its existing policies, Revenue Canada had no 
basis for refusing to issue the 1985 and 1991 rulings and was 
justified in doing so.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	It is evident that in these cases the process worked as it should 
have. Any other decision or action would have circumvented the 
law and infringed on the legitimate rights of the taxpayer involved 
to fair and equitable treatment under our laws.
<P>
	Further, the committee found no indication of political or other 
interference with respect to the rulings. I must underline this. 
While it should be noted that the auditor general never questioned 
the integrity and professionalism of Revenue Canada officials, the 
report confirmed there was no impropriety on the part of any 
official. On this point the Minister of National Revenue has already 
stated that she has met with the auditor general and asked him 
directly if he thought there had been any political interference in 
this file and he assured her there was none.
<P>
	The finance committee heard a range of witnesses from all 
departments concerned on this issue and they found no evidence of 
impropriety. Therefore, we must be satisfied that there was no 
impropriety involved here.
<P>
	Also, importantly, the report concluded that the rulings did not 
or are not likely to cost Canada any significant tax revenue. The 
committee noted that the auditor general and his officials were 
unable to identify any significant new tax avoidance opportunity 
created for other taxpayers by these rulings. That is what the 
auditor general tells us.
<P>
	The issues raised by the auditor general have to be kept in 
perspective. The auditor general said that Revenue Canada's 1991 
ruling may have cost significant tax revenue, not that it did, but that 
it might have. This was obviously a concern. The finance 
committee looked at it carefully and concluded that there was no 
evidence that the ruling cost Canada anything. Nor was there 
evidence-and we are talking evidence, not speculation-that the 
ruling opened up any new avoidance opportunities. There has been 
no flight of capital, as opposition members seem to think. This 
should not be surprising. Canada's tax rules for people who leave 
the country are stricter than the rules of almost every other country 
in the world.
<P>
	In addition to this, the Minister of National Revenue placed a 
moratorium on any further rulings on taxable Canadian property 
while the finance committee was doing its very important review of 
this area of the Income Tax Act. The minister has extended this 
moratorium until the Minister of Finance has the opportunity to 
consider the policy recommendations of the committee and to 
make decisions concerning appropriate changes if they are 
necessary. We heard earlier today that many people think we can 
make improvements and I would agree with that. Is this not 
assurance enough for the opposition that the door is not wide open 
to the transfer of capital without paying appropriate taxes?
<P>
	With respect to the question of the decision making process, the 
finance committee observed in its findings that immediately on 
publication of the auditor general's report the minister directed 
Revenue Canada to take immediate steps to improve 
documentation of its tax policy interpretations. In this context, the 
department has revised its procedures to ensure that a proper record 
is prepared of the considerations that play an important part of the 
decision making process to issue an advanced income tax ruling or 
an opinion.
<P>
	When Revenue Canada issues a written request to the 
departments of finance or justice it will continue to provide a level 
of background information, explanation and analysis appropriate to 
conveying a full appreciation of the issue and its potential impact. 
Revenue Canada will also retain in the permanent advanced rulings 
file the complete documentation and analysis required in support of 
any interpretations.
<P>
	It is evidence that through these steps the Minister of National 
Revenue has acted quickly to improve the openness and the 
transparency of the process. The finance committee also expressed 
its full support for the decision of the minister to publicize all 
advanced tax rulings as of January 1996 with appropriate editing to 
ensure taxpayer confidentiality. I wish to point out once again that 
decision was made even before this documentation, this report of 
the auditor general, came out.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="4740"> 4740 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Revenue Canada electronically publishes and distributes all 
advance tax rulings to various tax publishing houses in Canada and 
provides them to the public at Revenue Canada's tax services 
offices within 90 days of their issuance.
<P>
	As for the report's second administrative recommendation, 
Revenue Canada has already taken steps to ensure consistency 
between its rulings and opinions dealing with similar areas of the 
law. Since the 1985 ruling, the department has implemented an 
electronic research database. This provides easy access to all 
previous opinions and rulings for research and comparison 
purposes. I think that is an important improvement.
<P>
	I would like to emphasize that Revenue Canada is a world class 
organization that enjoys an enviable international reputation and 
record of success. It has worked very hard to establish this record 
through its successful administration of over 185 acts and 
regulations, incentives, credits and international agreements and 
treaties.
<P>
	The department employees over 40,000 professional and 
dedicated public servants. In order to support their dealings with 
their millions of clients, each employee requires the confidence 
and deserves the respect of Canadians to do their job well. Fairness, 
equity and integrity are the basic principles on which they must 
earn the confidence and respect of Canadians.
<P>
	The credibility of the department depends on its adherence to 
these principles in everything it does and in every decision it 
makes. That is why concerns raised in the auditor general's May 7 
report have been fully addressed by the finance committee in order 
to prevent any undermining of public confidence that is so crucial 
to the successful operation of any tax system.
<P>
	Since this system relies heavily on self-assessment and 
voluntary compliance for its efficient operation, anything that 
erodes confidence in the revenue administration weakens the 
system as a whole. Therefore it is important to everyone in Canada 
and to the day to day working of the department that there is both 
actual and perceived fairness and integrity in the administration of 
the Canadian tax system.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to state that in my view Canadians 
have been well served by the finance committee report on taxable 
Canadian property. We have five practical recommendations for 
change and improvement. We will be waiting to see the new policy 
that those recommendations come up with.

	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure 
that you and many members of this House will remember the 
popular 1950s radio broadcasts of W.O. Mitchell's award winning 
short stories ``Jake and the Kid''. The stories chronicled the 
adventures of the Kid, 11-year old Ben Osborne, in the fictitious 
prairie town of Crocus, Saskatchewan.
<P>
	The story has been brought to life again in a 13-week television 
series filmed in my constituency of Wetaskiwin. Now in its second 
season, ``Jake and the Kid'' is wholesome family entertainment and 
a tribute to Alberta's growing film industry.
<P>
	Albertans figure prominently in the cast, crew and writers. In 
fact, 90 per cent of the cast and all the extras are Albertans, 
including Ben's best friend and mentor, the hired hand Jake, played 
by hometown boy Shaun Johnston.
<P>
	Sets depicting the Osborne family farm and mainstreet Crocus 
have been constructed on 160 acres of land in the district of

	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Liberal government never tires of telling the Canadian 
public that it has been working to get the economic fundamentals 
right.
<P>
	Low inflation and drastic cutbacks to social spending were 
supposed to have set the stage for future jobs. We have had very 
low inflation for years and the government is ahead of schedule on 
deficit reduction.
<P>
	But Canadians are facing the highest rate of unemployment 
during an economic recovery since the  last depression. Where are 
the jobs? When can we expect that bountiful harvest of jobs that the 
Liberals have promised?
<P>
	I commend the distinguished economist Pierre Fortin for so 
convincingly showing Canadians in the past few days that the 
harvest of jobs will never occur under the Liberal policies because 
they have their fundamentals wrong.
<P>
	While the American policy makers have tolerated 3 per cent 
inflation in order to achieve near full employment, the Liberals 
have inflicted the strait-jacket of 1 per cent inflation and high real 
interest rates which have killed, according to Fortin, 850,000 jobs.
<P>
	The Liberals cannot expect Canadians to believe the talk of jobs 
when their actions of inflation are calculated to kill jobs.

Mr. Speaker, small and medium size businesses in my riding and

<P>
	A recent Industry Canada report noted that Canada's vibrant

teenagers. It is extremely rare for adults over 20 to begin smoking.
<P>
	According to the information we discussed, it takes only four 
cigarettes, smoked in a row, for a young person to become addicted 
to nicotine. Many people believe that tobacco is addictive. We must 
all be vigilant where tobacco products are sold and advertised and 
we must look at treatment programs aimed to help our kids quit.

the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs described the contract to 
sell electricity from Churchill Falls as unfair. He almost went so far 
as to advise Newfoundland to go back on its agreement, as that 
province did once before, with Meech.
<P>
	There are three facts regarding this contract that must be 
remembered. Only Hydro-Québec was willing to invest in a dam in 
Newfoundland in the mid sixties. In  1984 and 1988, the Supreme 
Court of Canada upheld the validity of the contract for the sale of 
electricity. Hydro-Québec's profits from the signing of this 
contract are comparable to the profits made by the other dams built 
during this period.
<P>
	If he is looking for unjust causes, the minister has only to recall 
how Newfoundland got its hands on Labrador. In 1927, his Liberal 
predecessors ceded Labrador to Newfoundland, without Quebec's 
permission.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a sure thing that Canadian taxpayers will be paying 
the Pearson airport piper  because of this Liberal government's 
pathetic performance.
<P>
	All indications point to a federal settlement where Canadians 
will be expected to fork over in excess of $60 million for a contract 
cancellation that this government guaranteed would not cost a 
penny more than $35 million.
<P>
	We can probably expect that Canadian travellers will be stuck 
with a new tax in the future and will all pay it at the airport.
<P>
	Three years of lost opportunity, multimillion dollar 
compensation payments and a new airport tax, that is what the 
people of Canada got from the Prime Minister's irresponsible 
decision during the 1993 election.
<P>
	They won the election but once again Canadians lose. It is the 
Canadian taxpayer who will pay for the Liberal screw-up on the 
Pearson airport deal.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="REFERENDUMS">REFERENDUMS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today the Minister of Justice has decided to call upon the 
Supreme Court on the referendum question, stating as his reason, 
and I quote: ``To leave this issue unresolved would pose a serious 
threat to orderly government in Quebec and in the rest of Canada''.
<P>
	Could the minister explain to us why order and good government 
would be threatened today, when this was not the case in 1980, nor 
in the last referendum in 1995? If the government is going before 
the Supreme Court today, is the real reason not that it has nothing to 
offer Quebec and is afraid of losing the next referendum?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the questions being asked in the 
referral to the Supreme Court of Canada are entirely based on the 
position taken by the attorney general of Quebec himself in the 
Bertrand case.
<P>
	Everyone believed that the primacy of the rule of law here in 
Canada was obvious, and the unilateral declaration of 
independence by Quebec was illegal and irresponsible, yet the 
attorney general of Quebec stated for the first time a few months 
ago that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4745"> 4745 </A></B>
<P>
the courts and  the Constitution have nothing to do with the process 
by which Quebec is proceeding toward sovereignty.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	It is, therefore, the responsibility of this government to clarify 
and determine these basic questions. We have asked the questions 
in this referral in order to clarify and precisely determine the 
primacy of the rule of law in Canada and the fact that a unilateral 
declaration of independence is illegal and irresponsible in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister also stated today, and again I quote: ``Any 
government that suggests it would throw Quebec and all of Canada 
into the confusion of a unilateral declaration of independence is 
being profoundly irresponsible. It is a formula for chaos''.
<P>
	But who are the ones being irresponsible? The Government of 
Quebec for proposing, after obtaining a democratic mandate from 
the people of Quebec to negotiate on an equal basis for the first 
time in its life, or this government for wishing to impose the same 
legal framework as was in place for Meech Lake, where a single 
MP from Manitoba, or a province like Newfoundland, could decide 
Quebec's future? Which is the irresponsible one?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, what we want is the same thing the 
people of Quebec want, that is to say an orderly process to settle the 
challenge facing us. That orderly process is the primacy of the rule 
of law, the courts and the Constitution, and in the aftermath of a 
referendum we shall have the Constitution and an orderly process.
<P>
	With the process the hon. member proposes, we will indeed have 
chaos, because a unilateral declaration of independence is 
irresponsible. On behalf of all Canadians, including the people of 
Quebec, we have chosen to refer these questions in order to clarify 
the underlying principle concerning the Canadian system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, some fine Constitution, one rejected by all Quebecers. 
There is no political party in Quebec-be it the federalist Liberal 
Party of Quebec or the Parti Quebecois-no government which has 
recognized the Constitution. It was imposed upon us in the dead of 
night by the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The minister tells us that he is calling upon the Supreme Court 
because Quebec has no right to declare its sovereignty unilaterally. 
I wonder why Quebec could not make its decision to become 
sovereign on its own, while Canada could make a unilateral 
decision to keep Quebec in Canada against the will of Quebecers. 
How can it be that some are allowed to do what others are not? Is 
that what you call democracy?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, let me remind you that you must 
always address the Chair.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, much as the hon. member wants it 
to be, the issue here is not whether the population of Quebec can 
express itself freely. That has never been in doubt. We have had 
two referenda in the past and if the present Government of Quebec 
has its way, there will likely be a third I suppose. However, that is 
not the issue.
<P>
	The real issue is that the present Government of Quebec states 
that right after the referendum, if the result is what it wants, the 
present legal order will come to an end and it will unilaterally walk 
away from Canada, from this country. That is simply out of the 
question.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Justice. During his minister's 
statement this morning, the Minister of Justice said, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The leading political figures of all the provinces and indeed the Canadian public 
have long agreed that this country will not be held together against the will of 
Quebecers clearly expressed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Could the minister explain exactly what ``the will of Quebecers 
clearly expressed'' means?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there were several ways in which I 
referred to the clearly expressed will of Canadians this morning.
<P>
	For one thing, it is the clearly expressed will of Canadians that 
the interest of Canadians throughout the country be taken into 
account on this question which affects them all. For another thing, I 
emphasized that it is the clearly expressed will of all Canadians, 
including those in Quebec, that we conduct ourselves in accordance 
with the law.
<P>
	I also emphasized that it is the clearly expressed will of 
Canadians that when their leaders, including the leaders of the 
Government of Quebec, address issues on the public agenda, they 
do so in keeping with the values of Canadians: tolerance, 
accommodation, discussion, dialogue. That is the way Canadians 
want us to approach our issues, not by unilateral action, not by 
standing up and walking away from the table unilaterally. That is 
not the way we do things in Canada. That is the commonly 
expressed will of Canadians.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
unfortunately, the Minister of Justice did not understand my 
question. I referred to ``the will of Quebecers clearly expressed''. 
That was my question. He is talking about the will of Canadians. I 
think the minister missed the point completely.
<P>
	I think it would be only fair and reasonable to give him a second 
chance. I will put my question to the minister again. Could he 
explain exactly what ``the will of Quebecers clearly expressed'' 
means?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can answer that question. In fact I 
can say that if the hon. member wants to know what the clearly 
expressed will of Quebecers is, then she ought to look at the results 
of the last two referendums.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
should begin by commending the government and the minister for 
finally taking this belated action in referring this matter to the 
Supreme Court. We also note the strong support the government 
has received from the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	Even as other governments in the world are becoming concerned 
about the rule of law in Canada, some in Quebec who call 
themselves federalists have made it clear that they reject any 
attempt to defend the rule of law in the courts and to defend 
Canada's right to self-determination.
<P>
	Supporting a unilateral right of the PQ to self-determination is 
unacceptable to ordinary loyal Canadians across the country. What 
steps is the government taking to persuade these Quebecers of the 
importance of supporting this effort to assert Canadian 
sovereignty?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I very much hope that our 
federalist allies in Quebec will see the value of clearly determining 
these questions that have now been put at issue.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	As to what we are doing about it, we are expressing our position 
as forcefully and in as straightforward a manner as we can. We 
have framed questions that I think captured clearly what is really at 
issue here. Indeed, I wrote to one Quebecer this morning, Paul 
Bégin, the attorney general of Quebec, to invite him to participate 
with me in the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think it is very important for the attorney general of Quebec to 
participate in this exercise before the court.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The fact of the matter is he and I have divergent views on these 
important legal questions. What Canadians do when they have 
divergent views on important questions is they put them before the 
court for resolution. I have invited him to join me in the court so 
that we can get his views there and get a judgment from the highest 
court in the land.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to explore whether this action represents the totality of the 
government's plan or whether it has further plans.
<P>
	Yesterday at a congressional hearing in Washington, Christopher 
Sands of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies 
speculated that there has been talk that the federal government 
plans to put a secession clause in the Constitution after the next 
election and that it would raise once again the issue of a national 
referendum on this issue.
<P>
	Is the federal government prepared to go further and to say that 
all Canadians must have a say in their constitutional future and the 
future of their country, and that such a policy would include a 
national referendum?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we expressed our commitment 
clearly in the speech from the throne, indeed in language very close 
to that used by the hon. member.
<P>
	We said that if there is to be another referendum, that the process 
must be democratic, that we would ensure that the question is clear, 
that all the facts are on the table, that the consequences are well 
understood and that all Canadians would have a say in the future of 
their country.
<P>
	The step we took today is intended to address the most 
fundamental legal question, namely, do we operate within the rule 
of law or outside it? I am confident that the court will see that the 
Constitution and the rule of law must prevail.
<P>
	As to the hon. member's question specifically, I can say that we 
shall take whatever steps are necessary in the months ahead to 
comply with the commitment we gave in the speech from the 
throne.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to follow up on the nature of that commitment.
<P>
	Gordon Robertson, the former clerk of the Privy Council, has 
said that the government needs contingency legislation to deal with 
the possibility of an attempt at secession. The minister will know 
that Patrick Monahan of Osgoode Hall has said the same thing.
<P>
	Is the minister prepared to go further and to table a bill in the 
House providing a legislative framework for any attempt by a 
province at secession?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4747"> 4747 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the present we are going to 
pursue the fundamental issues that will now be heard by the 
Supreme Court of Canada. I do reiterate that we are going to fulfil 
our commitment expressed in the throne speech.
<P>
	The hon. member has referred to two instances where 
responsible Canadians have spoken out to raise approaches to these 
difficult issues. That is going on all across the country. Canadians 
are looking at these issues, they are producing constructive 
responses and that is a very valuable process. We encourage and 
support it.
<P>
	We are listening carefully. We shall cull from that process the 
best of the proposals. We shall bring them here for discussion. In 
the fullness of time we shall embark upon a course to enable us to 
fulfil the commitments we made in the speech from the throne.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Justice, in answer to a question from a 
member of the Reform Party, said that he would consider the 
possibility of having a national referendum on the future of 
Quebec, like the referendum on conscription or on Charlottetown.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Justice. Does he or 
does he not intend to call a national referendum to determine the 
future of Quebecers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are focusing now on the 
fundamental legal issues raised by the attorney general of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The questions referred to the Supreme Court of Canada today 
must be answered because the attorney general of Quebec has taken 
a position that is unacceptable under Canadian law. We intend to 
take this opportunity to deal with this very important matter. We 
will start with these questions and later, during the months to come, 
we will meet our other commitments.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> In his 
reply, the Minister of Justice started by referring to a national 
referendum and now mentions he has other commitments, so could 
he put all his cards on the table and tell us whether he intends to 
have a national referendum with his ``rule of law'' in which 
everyone outside Quebec will be able to determine the future of 
Quebec? We had conscription, and we had Meech. Is this going to 
be another example of so-called democracy?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member will know that it 
was the hon. member from the Reform Party who raised the 
cross-Canada referendum; it was not something which I 
mentioned.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite likes to pretend that anyone who 
relies on the rule of law is speaking against the democratic 
expression by the population of Quebec of its will. That is simply 
not so. The people of Quebec have every right to express 
themselves democratically in a consultative referendum.
<P>
	Where my hon. friend goes wrong and where the attorney 
general of Quebec goes wrong is to say that from that result they 
can proceed unilaterally to walk away from the contract, just leave 
the table. That is the crux of the issue.
<P>
	Let us not confuse the issue. We respect the right of the 
population of Quebec to express itself democratically, but we must 
insist that there be no unilateral action, that we keep in mind that 
this issue affects the interests of all Canadians and it will only be 
resolved in accordance with principles that provide for its orderly 
disposition.

conflict of interest code which states in black and white that a

the guidelines which apply to the spending of public money by a

for two years for the Reform Party. He is paid with public money. 
He is a friend of the leader of the party. There is a very nice lady,

Mr. Speaker, it is scandalous what is happening in the House today. 
The Prime Minister is willing to follow Mr. Mulroney's guidelines 
but refuses to follow his own guidelines. This Liberal government 
and ethics continue to have a long distance feeling.
<P>
	The defence minister's pork barrelling clearly breaks the Prime 
Minister's conflict of interest guidelines and the Prime Minister 
refuses to do anything about it.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister show some leadership today and live up 
to his own ethical guidelines and cancel this contract?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. 
Speaker. We are satisfied that the guidelines were followed, that the 
person is competent to do the job which the minister asked him to 
do and that it is within the budget approved by the House for the 
operation of the office of the minister. I just gave an example of 
people who have been rewarded. I think they must be competent. I 
hope they are competent because this party needs a bit of 
competence around. We are not complaining, because they are 
doing their jobs. But they were rewarded. They were not known 
until they ran for the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>

that. It is all within the guidelines, the rules for ministers and

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans,

Revenue. The report tabled today by the auditor general confirms 
once again that Revenue Canada has become a real sieve. After the 
family trust scandal, we learned today that Revenue Canada lost up 
to $630 million to tax evasion in the area of excise taxes for 
1994-95 alone.
<P>
	How can the minister explain to taxpayers the fact that Revenue 
Canada's carelessness allows the big oil companies and the tobacco 
industry in particular to avoid paying up to $630 million in taxes?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcomed the report of the auditor general. As an officer 
of the House he provides me, as a minister, with information, 
advice and examples of where  I can continuously improve the 
activities and the working of my department.
<P>
	I note that in this report he has identified many areas where 
Revenue Canada has evolved and actually made improvements. He 
has also identified areas where we can continue to improve. I am 
glad to say that we have tabled action plans in all of those areas 
which he has accepted and endorsed.

incredible.

measures she will take to recover the amounts owed and stop these 
abuses?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, absolutely. Let us put the auditor general's report into 
context. I prefer to suggest that the glass is two-thirds full instead 
of one-third empty in the area of commodity taxes.
<P>
	In his report, he says that in 1993-94 there was tax evasion in the 
area of commodity taxes, cigarette smuggling, to the tune of $1.5 
billion. One year later that has been reduced to $500 million, a 
reduction of two-thirds.
<P>
	When we are talking about commodity taxes we are talking 
about the criminal element, about people who do not have books 
that we can go in and audit. The department is working very 
effectively with the Solicitor General of Canada, the Minister of 
Justice, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Finance to work out 
a comprehensive strategy.
<P>

worked very effectively. I would like to say that we will continue 
the great effort and commitment to reduce that $500 million to 
zero.

my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	More than three weeks ago, Restigouche Micmacs started 
fishing lobster illegally, out of season. On Monday, after tolerating 
the situation for more than three weeks, the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans decided to issue the Micmacs a communal fishing 
licence they never asked for, aggrieving local fishermen.
<P>
	In light of the fact that the Micmacs have the clearly stated their 
intention of developing a commercial lobster fishery and do not 
recognize the authority of Fisheries and Oceans in that area, how 
does the minister justify issuing this permit?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a fact that the 
Listuguj First Nation, in claiming historic rights, as was amply 
vindicated in the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada, 
asked for a permit. It was issued a communal licence by the 
department. The communal licence established very serious 
restrictions in the interest of conservation measures, limits as to the 
number of catch, limits to the type of gear to be employed. Those 
restrictions are enforceable under the Fisheries Act.
<P>
	We are aware of complaints of violations and these are being 
investigated. If necessary the restrictions will be enforced. 
Obviously it is in the interest of all of us to achieve an amicable 
settlement. The hon. member will agree with that. The department 
is examining that with all parties. However, the regulations will be 
enforced if necessary.

	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker,

want provinces to control their own resources, not have other 
provinces control them.
<P>
	The minister cannot have it both ways. As I said yesterday, 
Liberals have no problem interfering with fair contracts. It is just 
unfair contracts they have a problem dealing with.
<P>
	The Liberals defend selling Alberta down the river but they 
refuse to take action as the people of Newfoundland are forced to

Mr. Speaker, as I have said, it seems to me that the contradiction 
here is between the expressed position of the Reform Party and

	The House resumed consideration of the motion
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to 
enter into debate on the motion of the day by the Bloc Party.
<P>
	It is interesting that it should use its day for this particular topic. 
It is illustrative of one of the things which is wrong with the 
country. The very fact that we have in the House a large number of 
members whose set goal is to remove themselves and their part of 
the country from the rest of us shows that there are some problems 
and that we as legislators ought to be paying attention to them.
<P>
	There is no doubt in my mind that if this federation were to work 
properly, we would not be here debating these kinds of questions.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	Bloc Members have raised an issue which is on the minds of 
many people in Canada, fair taxation. They have done it in a very 
specific case and with respect to an auditor general's observations. 
The issue they are drawing attention to is a very important one, that 
there is unfair taxation.
<P>
	During my short time as member of Parliament, this being my 
first term, I have listened to a large number of people from across 
the country, but primarily in my own riding of Elk Island. One 
thing I hear often is that people are no longer content to allow half 
of their earnings or more to be spent on their behalf by people who 
do not listen to how that money should be spent. Over and over we 
hear individuals and small business people talk about the taxation 
system and how it is a great detriment to their personal welfare or 
the well-being of their business. It is onerous. It is too heavy a 
burden for the people of this country. It is based on a false 
supposition that there is someone in far away, distant Ottawa, a 
politician or bureaucrat who knows better how to allocate those 
funds that they have earned than the people do.
<P>
	That is the large assumption which has been made by successive 
Liberal and Conservative governments, and we are shackled by it. 
We have come to the point where too many of us are struggling to 
make ends meet. Meanwhile our taxes must be paid. We will end 
up working into the middle of July for this thing called tax freedom 
day, the day when finally we can begin to earn for ourselves and 
our families.
<P>
	I admit that some of the tax money is used for good purposes. I 
would not deny that. I am very happy to be in this country. I am 
very grateful that we have a good infrastructure system in this 
country. Our highways are very good by international standards. 
We have excellent communication facilities and our taxes go to pay 
for all of that.
<P>
	That is not the question. The problem is the large amount of 
waste, the large amount of money which is spent on programs 
which do not carry the support of the majority of citizens but are 
foisted on us by a bureaucrat or politician in a distant city. 
Consequently, I hear more and more disgruntlement and discour-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4754"> 4754 </A></B>
<P>
agement with the way the government is managing its affairs. 
People are overtaxed and they are getting tired of it.
<P>
	How should we react to this? According to members of the 
official opposition party today taxation should be fair. I agree with 
that component. There should should be no large amount of 
earnings which would go untaxed while other earnings are taxed at 
excessive rates.
<P>
	Not very long ago someone told me that he is now in some 
financial and employment difficulty. He said that if had been able 
to pay less in taxes over the last number of years he would have had 
a nest egg put away which would have helped him through a 
difficult time. Instead, because of high taxation over the years his 
personal nest egg is much less than he would like it to be, and so he 
is thrown on to government programs. Unfortunately the 
government, with its continued policy of overspending and 
borrowing, adds to the load of taxpayers and our taxes keep rising 
and at the same time we experience the downsizing of the very 
government programs which were supposed to be provided by the 
taxes that we are being asked to pay, I should say coerced to pay.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	The bottom line is that in areas like the Canada pension plan, UI 
which is now called employment insurance, premiums over the 
years have gone up a lot. I know in the last year or so there has been 
a small turn downward in the UI premiums and that is a very 
commendable step but it is too tiny a step.
<P>
	In other areas we are asked to pay a great deal and there is a 
decreasing assurance that the government programs we have paid 
into will actually deliver for our needs. I do not believe that this is 
at all the real nub of the issue for the members of the Bloc in terms 
of their wanting to separate, but I believe it adds to it.
<P>
	I believe that if we in Ottawa were to run our fiscal affairs in 
such a way that government overspending was eliminated so that 
this government like all other governments in Canada would have a 
defined goal of living within its means, then there would be much 
less of a cry by provinces like Quebec that say: ``We do not want to 
swim with you guys anymore, we want to go it on our own''. It 
would be just too expensive for them. Whereas the way it is right 
now, being part of this confederation is an increasing burden for 
many of us.
<P>
	I appreciate the members of the Bloc. I do not know if that will 
be misunderstood so I need to explain. I am actually very grateful 
they are here. It is a reflection of the fact that we have a free 
democracy. I wish they were not here for the reasons they are here, 
but each one of them as far as we know was properly and 
democratically elected. They have as much right to be here as any 
one of the rest of us.
<P>
	What we really need to do is to get to the root of the problem. 
Why did the people in Quebec elect them? Why were they sent 
here? It is inescapable that they were sent here because of the fact 
that Quebecers increasingly perceive that Ottawa is not doing for 
them the job they want done.
<P>
	When we come to this whole question of taxation and 
government spending, certainly one of the areas is that taxation 
should be fair. The government has the right to tax us and by 
common consent to provide programs that Canadians want and the 
taxation load should be made as equal as possible for all of the 
members of the taxpaying public. I believe there are some 13.5 
million taxpayers in this country. Each one of them has a vested 
interest. They are shareholders in this country so to speak, in this 
company called Canada. They deserve and have a right to demand 
that the money be spent carefully.
<P>
	In saying something else about the tax system, whether we 
recognize it or not, taxes and taxation are a very inefficient way of 
looking after people's needs. Generally when people spend other 
people's money, the amount of accountability goes down. I have 
observed that around here since the time of my election. I have 
certainly seen it by observing the way even senators and members 
of Parliament spend money. It is easy to spend money which is not 
your own. It is more difficult to spend your own.
<P>
	This is one of the reasons I am a firm advocate of a free 
enterprise system and a system which permits us to meet each 
other's needs through private enterprise and private initiative. I 
remember way back when I was just a youngster there was not this 
proliferation of government programs. In fact the generation in 
which I grew up was one in which most people would deny the help 
that was offered to them by government because of a large amount 
of personal pride and self-sufficiency, at least in the part of the 
country in which I grew up, out in the west.
<P>
	In those days when someone had a problem we who had the 
ability to help would help in the way in which we could. I 
remember as a youngster one of our neighbours was unfortunately 
killed in a farm accident. My dad was one who helped organize the 
neighbours. They immediately went to help this newly widowed 
lady do her harvest. They did her harvest first and then they did 
their own. They could afford to do that because at that time there 
was enough money left over despite the taxes. Sure, times were not 
easy on the farm but they had the financial ability to help someone 
in need.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	I have experienced this personally. Acquaintances of mine have 
fallen into hard times and I wished that I could have helped them 
more than I did. Unfortunately, what with the municipal taxes, the 
provincial taxes, the federal taxes and GST, by the time all these 
taxes are removed from my earnings and after I meet the basic 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4755"> 4755 </A></B>
<P>
necessities of life for my own family, the amount of  money I have 
left to give charitably to people who are in need is greatly 
diminished.
<P>
	Now my way of helping people is to say: ``Let us go down to the 
government office and see what kind of assistance is there for 
you''. That is wrong. I am very distressed about it. We have 
allowed governments at all levels to take over from us as 
individuals the expression of compassion which we as Canadians 
value.
<P>
	I hear expressions especially from the Liberal side that they do 
not want to cut these social programs because they are 
compassionate. If that is really true, if the government were to 
reduce its involvement in those compulsory programs which we 
have no choice but to support, then each one of us individually 
could do so much more. We could help people in a much more 
genuine way than a government department somewhere trying to 
help people in a wholesale way with reduced budgets.
<P>
	The last issue I want to talk about in my little time here is the 
question of debt. I am always reluctant to give the Liberals great 
accolades when they have not done the job adequately. Usually 
what I say is when we were elected in 1993 and when all this 
present batch of Liberal MPs were elected, we understood that the 
deficit, the amount of government overspending, was around $35 
billion or $40 billion a year. It was in that range.
<P>
	It is interesting how whenever there is a change of government 
the last year of the previous government is always tremendously 
bad and then it gets better. I have often wondered how that happens 
mathematically under accounting rules.
<P>
	We had a large deficit. Now we have a deficit which has been 
reduced and everybody is cheering: ``We have reduced it to $27 
billion''. Unfortunately, I do not believe this is being properly 
communicated to Canadians. There are a lot of people who think 
that our debt and deficit problems are solved with this Liberal 
government. Unfortunately, that is not true.
<P>
	What has happened is that the government has reduced the rate at 
which we are going into debt. We are still adding $100 billion to the 
debt during the term of office of this government. We have added 
approximately $10 billion a year to mandatory interest payments. 
Those payments are not going down because the debt is still 
increasing. That means that next year our interest payments are 
going to be even higher than they were last year. Even though the 
debt is increasing at a slower rate, it is still increasing. The amount 
we owe is going up, up, up.
<P>
	It is becoming urgent that through proper and fair taxation 
techniques and through the reduction of government involvement 
in programs which Canadians do not support that we downsize 
government. It is urgent that we return to the people of Canada the 
autonomy that comes when they can spend their own money for  
purposes they themselves choose rather than for purposes that are 
chosen by someone else.
<P>
	I encourage the Liberal majority government on the other side, 
all those individual backbenchers to really exercise the authority 
they have as elected members of Parliament. I would like to see 
them throw off the shackles of party discipline and really hold their 
own government accountable in areas of deficit reduction. It is 
shameful that after four years we still do not have a definite date on 
which it is planning to say: ``We will not be borrowing next year. 
No more borrowing''. Would that not be a wonderful day?
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	I should not mention my son, so I will not, but it is as if when he 
got a speeding ticket for going 80 in a 60 zone he said to the officer 
that from now on he would only go 75. It would not wash. If the 
speed limit is 60, he should be going 60. It is not sufficient to 
reduce it just by a little bit. It is the same thing with the borrowing. 
It is not acceptable until our borrowing has stopped, until our 
budget is balanced and our deficit is zero. That is the only 
acceptable goal.
<P>
	I do not know why this government has been so unwilling to 
state a definite target date to aim for on that and to actually reach a 
goal that it has set instead of these wishy-washy, floating, moving 
targets that the government may reach if everything goes well and 
if it does not go well it will happen more slowly. I am distressed 
with that and the politicking that goes on while Canadians in 
general are going into debt and are being asked to pay $500 a 
month per taxpayer just for interest. That is not acceptable.
<P>
	In conclusion, I am someone who is committed to doing my part 
in government. It is incumbent on all of us to spend the taxpayers' 
money as though it were held in trust, to spend it as though it were 
our own, to be careful and frugal. It is incumbent on all of us to do 
everything we can in order to eliminate the deficit, to stop the 
borrowing, to start reducing the amount we owe, reducing the 
amount of interest that is payable, reducing taxes and giving that 
boost to the economy that would provide jobs and dignity to people 
who are currently unemployed. Our country would be in so much 
better shape.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to ask some questions and make some comments on the speech by 
the hon. member for Elk Island.
<P>
	There is this concept, which is also part of the motion we are 
debating today, that somehow the Canadian taxation system is not 
fair. In fact I heard the hon. member start off with that in the first 
part of his speech.
<P>
	I would just like to comment on the fact that recent statistics, if 
we study them, show that the top 30 per cent of Canadian taxpayers 
are paying 66 per cent of the total  of all taxes in this country. We 
have a system in Canada which is called progressive taxation so 
that the more one makes the more one pays. The reality is that our 
system has been regarded as fair and progressive from years back. 
It is also part of the Bloc motion that we are somehow taxing the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4756"> 4756 </A></B>
<P>
poor and letting the rich off. This just is not borne out by the 
statistics of reality.
<P>
	I would like to address some of the issues that have been brought 
forward by the Bloc motion and which have also been mentioned 
by the hon. member.
<P>
	Our system of taxation is based on voluntary compliance. What 
voluntary compliance means is that 13 million taxpayers agree to 
file their tax returns every year and have them assessed by Revenue 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	This is a process which is accepted in western democracies. It is 
a very efficient system. In a sense it is based on the honour system. 
There are some internal controls and some checks and balances but 
basically it is run on the good wishes and goodwill of taxpayers.
<P>
	There is one big feature about that. When people file their tax 
returns they believe they are confidential. I would like to take the 
opportunity to read the section of the Income Tax Act which 
addresses this matter. I would be interested in the member's 
comments on it.
<P>
	It states concerning the provision of information in section 241: 
``Except as authorized by this section, no official shall knowingly 
provide or knowingly allow to be provided, to any person any 
taxpayer information, knowingly allow any person to have access 
to any taxpayer information or knowingly use any taxpayer 
information otherwise than in the course of the administration of 
the enforcement of this act, the Canada Pension Plan Act and the 
Unemployment Insurance Act''.
<P>
	The purpose of this is to give people assurance that when they 
send their information to Revenue Canada that it is confidential.
<P>
	This matter that has been brought forward by the Bloc today, and 
I would be interesting in the member's comments-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I wonder if the hon. member would perhaps let 
the hon. member for Elk Island answer some of the questions that 
have been raised. I would not want it to be all questions and no 
answers. I will go to the hon. member for Elk Island and if we have 
time I will come back.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess in principle we have a reasonable 
tax system in this country. I would agree with that.
<P>
	It is not working the way it ought to work. As the hon. member 
mentioned, and I hope I heard him correctly, there are a lot of 
people, at least our perception is so, who earn an awful lot of 
money who pay little or no tax.  Then of course there are those 
people who make very little money who pay little or no tax, but the 
bulk of the tax burden is on the middle wage earner and we pay 
dearly.
<P>
	Every one of us, even without being able to go into the tax 
records of others, can think of examples of people who are very 
well off. I remember when my wife and I were first married, which 
is now over 35 years ago, we had a reasonable mid-sized car, some 
borrowed furniture when we were first married, and I had to pay 
my taxes. In fact, it was deducted from my earnings every month. I 
was making a little over $400 a month and $35 a month, as I recall, 
went to the tax man.
<P>
	We developed a friendship in the new town in which we lived 
where there was a couple who were very well off. He drove a large 
luxury car. They had a beautiful home with all the newest 
furnishings. He told me that he did not pay any tax ever because he 
was a successful businessman. He was able to write all of this off. I 
objected to it at the time. I said I did not think that was fair. He said: 
``I'm only using the tax rules. I am not doing anything illegal''. 
There is one example.
<P>
	A much more recent example has to do with the MP pension 
plan. When Reformers came here, we said and we were directed by 
our voters, that the members' pension plan is too rich. It costs the 
taxpayer too much relative to how much we personally put in. On 
principle we said we wanted out.
<P>
	The day I went to do my payroll stuff when I was first elected I 
asked: ``Can I opt out of that plan?'' I was told that I could not. Two 
years later the government tinkered with the legislation and 
included in it a small window of opportunity for those who felt 
strongly about it to be able to opt out. The unfairness was that for 
two years we were cut out of RRSP room because we were forced 
to be in this plan, but when we got the money back we had to pay 
income tax on the whole amount and were not allowed to roll it into 
an RRSP equivalent to that same amount. That is an unfairness in 
the tax system. I think it is a very serious unfairness to me 
personally. There are many others who would not share that great 
concern.
<P>
	There are those inequities. They need to be fixed up. I really 
believe that the motion before us is an indicator of an unfairness in 
the system where some individuals can earn large amounts of 
money and through one method or another can avoid paying their 
fair share of tax on it. That needs to be corrected.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We have about a minute left, perhaps about 30 
seconds, for a very brief question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think he really addressed 
one of the questions I posed to him. The Bloc Quebecois is talking 
in its motion about revealing taxpayers. How does the member feel 
about the Bloc's  attitude about revealing the identity of taxpayers 
as they also proposed in their motion before the finance commit-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4757"> 4757 </A></B>
<P>
tee? In other words, expose taxpayers to possibly a witch hunt 
much like Nixon did in the United States when he chased after 
political enemies. Does he agree that is an acceptable process?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> I certainly agree with the hon. member that 
confidentiality in the tax reporting system is valuable, particularly 
for businesses.
<P>
	It guards commercial security and information which I think is 
right. But I still believe it would be quite fair for us as ordinary 
Canadians-I still consider myself to be one-to know exactly 
what we need to do in order to earn large amounts and not to have 
to pay tax on it.
<P>
	The only group I know of that can really get away with it right 
now-I hate to repeat this-are members of the MP pension plan. I 
have made some calculations. The amount one would have to put 
away in order to provide that is several thousand dollars a month. 
In all practicality it is a deferred income scheme. It allows MPs to 
take part of their earnings now and receive them later at which time 
they would be taxable. That is not available to other Canadians.
<P>
	The question the Bloc has raised today is an issue based on the 
same principle. Here is something that is available to one group of 
Canadians. Why is it not available to another group of Canadians? 
That is the part that we would like to see clarified.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me say how much I welcome the opportunity to discuss 
this motion as it has been presented to the House and to shed light 
on the real and substantive issues that the case before us demands.
<P>
	The members of the opposition have really gone out of their way 
to distort the issues, to confuse the Canadian public. What they 
forget to say time and again is that this decision was a decision 
made by the former government, the Tory government in 1991. It 
was brought to our attention by the auditor general and now we 
have to deal with it and ensure that the integrity of the tax system is 
maintained and improved. That is what the opposition forgets to 
talk about.
<P>
	The other thing it forgets to talk about is that we did take action. 
When the auditor general brought this to our attention we 
responded immediately to the issues and presented them to the 
finance committee for review. It is a very public body with 
members from all the elected parties in this House that represent 
this country from coast to coast to coast.
<P>
	The opposition members forget to talk about the fact that we 
have actually acted on the results of that committee report, that we 
are making changes, that we are committed to having a fair and 
equitable tax system.
<P>
	The thing they continue to talk about, the myths they continue to 
perpetuate are these. They think that if they keep repeating the 
words family trust and scandal over and over again they can make 
something out of nothing. But in fact this topic has nothing to do 
with family trusts, nothing at all.
<P>
	I sat on the finance committee with the member who proposed 
this motion, the member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot. When we 
focused specifically on the issue of family trusts, we heard 
witnesses, we talked to experts, we listened to testimony, reviewed 
the implications and made recommendations to the Minister of 
Finance how we should change family trusts in this country. The 
Minister of Finance read that report, as he reads all the reports of 
the finance committee, and in fact went further than our 
recommendations to deal with that particular tax strategy.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	In fact, the government, in response to the issue of family trusts, 
has eliminated the election to defer the 21 year deemed disposition 
rule which was introduced by the Tory government. It is gone. It is 
not part of the legislation any more. We did that. It is gone.
<P>
	In addition, the government eliminated the preferred beneficiary 
election for trusts. This ensures that trust income cannot be 
arbitrarily allocated to a beneficiary instead of being taxed at the 
trust level just because the beneficiary is at a low marginal income 
tax bracket. That has all been changed. Family trusts have been 
dealt with.
<P>
	I was part of the committee. The Bloc member who has proposed 
the motion to the House and who keeps talking about family trusts 
was there as well. He knows that these changes have been made. I 
want to assure Canadians that they can have confidence in the 
system and that that tax loophole does not exist for the advantage 
of the wealthy any more.
<P>
	In addition to making the changes to family trusts, the 
government has gone even further in terms of increasing the 
fairness of the tax regime. In fact, we have tightened the rules on 
tax shelters. We have improved our large business audits. We have 
eliminated the $100,000 capital gains exemption. We have 
introduced draft legislation to strengthen the reporting of world 
income in order to prevent the use of offshore tax havens and the 
evasion of taxes.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance mentioned last week that he has 
implemented to date 30 different improvements to the Income Tax 
Act to make it more fair and equitable. That is the kind of 
government we are. We are improving fairness to ensure that all 
Canadians have appropriate opportunities to make their 
contributions and to benefit from the taxes which they pay.
<P>
	This is not about family trusts. I cannot say that more 
emphatically. What this issue is about is how we tax the property of 
Canadians who emigrate and how we tax the  property of people 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4758"> 4758 </A></B>
<P>
who are not Canadians but who hold Canadian property. It is about 
the thing we call taxable Canadian property, that is, and let us be 
clear, property that remains taxable in Canada even though the 
owner may not live here and may not reside in the country. Taxable 
Canadian property is an extremely complicated notion. It is an 
extremely complicated aspect of the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	As the Minister of National Revenue, I received the report from 
the auditor general on this topic. As I read the chapter I took it very 
seriously. I met with the auditor general for three hours to go 
through, line by line, his concerns as written in the report. We 
began by talking about his concern of how the department ruled on 
the issue of taxable Canadian property. He talked to me about the 
fact that he understood the complexity of the legislation. He 
understood that, in fact, it is very unlikely that any law had been 
broken. He was asking whether or not the ruling was reflective of 
the intent of Parliament when it drafted the legislation.
<P>
	He was not suggesting anything inappropriate. He was not 
suggesting anything illegal. He was suggesting that in the ruling we 
may have highlighted something which needed to be drawn to the 
attention of the House for its consideration.
<P>
	That is particularly an issue for the Minister of Finance. It is an 
issue of policy, not of administration. I met with the Minister of 
Finance and suggested that an appropriate response to the auditor 
general in this regard would be to send this part of the Income Tax 
Act to the finance committee for a full and open review. That is 
what we did.
<P>
	I would like hon. members to understand that this was the first 
time in 25 years that this part of the act had been reviewed. It was 
timely. It was appropriate. The finance committee reviewed it in its 
fullest context. They had expert witnesses who are credible 
internationally look at the circumstances, to review the decisions. 
Six out of the eight said there was nothing inappropriate in the 
decision, that the ruling was correct as the law is written.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	The finance committee looked at it and asked: ``Is this really the 
way we want things to work in Canada or should we make changes? 
Is it time to make changes? Should we clarify our intentions?'' 
Members of the committee made some very clear suggestions to 
the Minister of Finance that he is now reviewing and considering 
and will act on in due course.
<P>
	There was a second concern which was raised in the auditor 
general's report relating to this topic. The concern spoke directly to 
my responsibility as the minister of revenue. He talked about the 
way in which the ruling proceeded. He gave the dates, the timeline. 
He indicated that he was confused about where and when  and by 
whom the decisions were made. As I read the report I was 
extremely concerned.
<P>
	In the course of the three hour discussion I had with the auditor 
general I asked him if he was suggesting that there was political 
interference in this case and was he asking me to investigate 
political interference. He responded: ``I have no reason to doubt the 
integrity of your department''.
<P>
	We went on and discussed the issues he was concerned about. He 
was concerned that there was no documentation which directed my 
attention to how the decision was made. It was not clear, not full in 
its nature. We must have that kind of documentation if we are going 
to have a fair, open and transparent system. I immediately agreed 
with the auditor general and I immediately directed my officials to 
ensure and build a new plan of action to be implemented 
immediately to ensure that documentation of all our decisions was 
clear, full and made available when requested. That was an area of 
real concern.
<P>
	The auditor general expressed his concern about consistency, 
highlighting the particular example of the matter where an opinion, 
not a ruling, was given in another part of the country on a similar 
topic at a different time which was different than the ruling in 1991. 
He indicated some concern about the consistency of decisions 
within my department. Again I agreed and said that we must have 
consistency. Canadians must be able to rely on the rulings. No 
matter where they are they must get the same answer from the 
department when a similar question is asked.
<P>
	As a result and subsequent to 1991 the department has made very 
credible changes to the way we operate, primarily using technology 
so that all the rulings and opinions are listed in a data base which 
can be accessed. Now any department officials who are making 
rulings can refer to the data base, see what decisions had been made 
in the past and ensure that there is consistency and integrity in the 
responses given to Canadians.
<P>
	Third, he was concerned about the transparency of our decisions. 
He was concerned that we made decisions and then did not 
publicize them for the broad benefit of all Canadians. We changed 
that some time ago. Our concern originally was with the integrity 
of confidentiality which we must maintain for all Canadian 
taxpayers. We must ensure that every individual's details and 
circumstances remain with us and are not exposed to broad public 
review. When we get these rulings we have to sever them and 
present them publicly in a way so that there is no connection 
between the individual tax filer and the decision. We have found 
ways of doing that and we have implemented that strategy in our 
day to day process.
<P>
	When we look at the issue there are really two sides to it, one of 
policy which was dealt with very effectively by the Finance 
committee. It has made recommendations to the minister and he is 
considering them.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4759"> 4759 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	The second area was administration. The finance committee 
decided on its own to look at those issues, to hear from witnesses, 
to talk to the auditor general, his assistant, the deputy in my 
department and the deputy of finance to talk to them about that 
system of decision making. Their conclusions were the same as 
those of the auditor general. In fact, the auditor general when 
questioned in the public accounts committee said: ``I have never 
had the occasion or the need to ever question the integrity of senior 
officials at Revenue Canada'', a reiteration of what he told me. In 
the finance committee the assistant auditor general said: ``We have 
seen no evidence of bad faith and we have seen no evidence of 
wrong doing''.
<P>
	Committee members heard that testimony and reported to me as 
the minister that they saw no evidence of scandal. The only people 
talking about scandal reside in the opposition. All they talk about 
are these two things, family trust and scandal. They are not part at 
all of the discussions presented to me by the auditor general.
<P>
	I would like to take the opportunity as we are discussing the 
integrity of the tax system to tell members a little more about what 
we are doing in Revenue Canada to respond to the needs and the 
wants of Canadians. Most recently, my department is undertaking 
the largest re-engineering project in Canadian history. There are 
40,000 employees in 800 offices across this country engaged in a 
structural change that will bring together two very separate 
organizations.
<P>
	Traditionally in my department the tax side was distinct, the 
customs side was distinct. They had their own deputy ministers, 
their own policies and procedures, their own penalties and interest, 
their own publications, all quite separate. As a result of changes 
made by my colleague, the former minister of revenue and now the 
Minister of Transport, we have redesigned our whole department. 
We have brought the sections together under one administration 
and that is contributing to a savings of $300 million to the 
Government of Canada and the taxpayers. Together we are 
providing a system that is going to give the Canadian public a real 
competitive advantage.
<P>
	I was in the United States in March and met with 500 exporters 
and importers. I said to them that they had to understand that in 
Revenue Canada I have responsibility for what is effectively their 
IRS, their customs administration and their trade administration. 
They sucked in their breath. They could not believe it. I said yes, 
and you could not do that in the United States but because of the 
way we have organized ourselves, because of our size we could 
bring and house these separate entities together so that our citizens 
can contact the government more effectively and efficiently.
<P>
	This whole issue of horizontal management becomes real and 
alive. Canadians no longer have to call and  someone says ``I am 
sorry, that is someone else's business''. In my department 
everybody can respond to those issues: a single window. That is 
what 
<P>
Canadians want. They want effective government, a government to 
respond to them as citizens, to provide that service, and that is what 
we are doing. It is a tremendous challenge but the employees of 
Revenue Canada are rising to that challenge.
<P>
	Today the auditor general in his report completed a whole 
chapter talking about our administrative consolidation. He praised 
us for the approach we have taken. He praised us for the 
contribution that change is going to make to the fairness and 
effectiveness of the system, for the return to the taxpayer. He 
indicated that our activities should be a model for other 
departments and agencies.
<P>
	It is a pleasure for me to receive that report and to say to the 
employees who are in the service of the Canadian public in my 
department, thank you. You are making a difference to the way this 
government responds to Canadians, to the way we are serving the 
Canadian public. It is real and it is tangible.
<P>
	More specifically, there are other things that we are doing on the 
revenue administration side.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Members will know that different tax regimes were developed 
individually in their own silos, the personal tax structure, the 
corporate tax structure, the consumption tax structure; all separate, 
all with their own penalties and interests, all with their own 
management teams.
<P>
	We are breaking that down as well so that we can now look at a 
Canadian citizen, a Canadian business as an entity. They do not 
have to deal with Revenue Canada with four business numbers. We 
can look at them in total. Their tax positions can be understood 
completely by us.
<P>
	That is a real competitive advantage. It is a responsive, positive 
change in the way of doing business. On the customs side, the same 
thing is happening. Very effectively, we are now moving to 
understand that we have to facilitate effective trade to let the good 
things pass through our border quickly and efficiently. But by 
golly, to keep the bad things out, firearms, drugs, people we do not 
want in our country, we have to have a smart border.
<P>
	Our strategy is to maximize the potential of our employees, to 
use new technologies, to build partnerships with the private sector 
and yes, with other levels of government and other governments to 
provide Canadians with the most competitive revenue and customs 
administration they can possibly have.
<P>
	I am very proud of the work of my department. I am very proud 
of the response that my department took to these issues directed to 
us by the auditor general. I want  to make clear to the Canadian 
public that the opposition is full of political huffery and puffery on 
this item.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4760"> 4760 </A></B>
<P>
	Again, it is not about family trust. We have dealt with that 
effectively. It is not about scandal. There is no indication of 
scandal. What this is about is our government's taking efficient, 
effective, immediate action when concerns are drawn to our 
attention. It is about a government that believes in the fairness and 
equity in the tax system.
<P>
	It is a government that believes it can make a difference and will 
make a difference. It will provide Canadians with the tax regimes 
they deserve.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I very much appreciate the comments of the minister. There is 
another side to this. She mentions there are two sides to the 
argument. I intend to follow that for just a moment.
<P>
	We have listened to the minister and other members of the 
government side speak of the due diligence they have paid to this 
problem in the revenue department. We have heard the chairman of 
the finance committee mention how they have called witnesses. 
They have invited the opposition parties to call more witnesses. 
They have looked at it as thoroughly as they could in depth.
<P>
	There has been a lot of talk, talk, talk about this issue. I am 
pleased they are coming to some resolution. The issue is not 
entirely family trusts. In my mind the issue related to that which is 
perhaps more important is government accountability. To whom is 
it accountable?
<P>
	There is a disturbing trend. For example, as legislation is being 
amended I hear members of the legal community saying that one of 
the concerns that they have is that the government is seeking less 
and less accountability in rather small and obtrusive ways.
<P>
	For example, little words like ``shall'' are being modified to 
``may'' where there is less accountability, and phrases like ``in the 
opinion of the minister'', which is not challengeable in any court 
because how does one challenge someone's opinion?
<P>
	Relating to the issue of revenue generation and family trusts, and 
going one step beyond that, I have seen how the government has 
looked carefully over a long period of time at this issue, but there 
are other instances also.
<P>
	For example, when a farmer took a truckload of grain across the 
border, he was taken to court. There is nothing wrong with that. 
When the judge said there is nothing wrong, the regulations were 
changed in a flash. It did not take weeks and months and years. The 
government acted immediately.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Another example: Shortly after this Parliament convened after 
the election, we were confronted by a crisis of smuggling tobacco 
products. What happened?  The government acted very quickly by 
lowering the duties collected on tobacco products and dealt with 
the smuggling problem in this manner. It acted very quickly. The 
consequence of that however is there are thousands of young 
people now involved in smoking. They have taken up this highly 
addictive habit and face years of suffering trying to get away from 
it. The medical costs of caring for them later on have not been 
calculated but they will be high.
<P>
	The difficulty is not simply family trusts, it is government 
accountability and to whom it is accountable. Is it willing to be 
accountable to the law as all citizens are, or is it seeking to be less 
and less accountable? It is my contention that this is the case.
<P>
	In this instance the Liberal government has spent a long time 
talking about the issue. I will be interested to see exactly what the 
outcome is. Hopefully it will be that large family trusts will not be 
able to leave the country without paying due taxes as the rest of us 
do.
<P>
	The government is quite properly looking to claim all legitimate 
revenues. Forms are being sent out to people to tell stories about 
other people who may not be paying their taxes, who may be 
escaping their taxes through the underground economy. Are we 
asking our citizens to be stool-pigeons while other people are quite 
legally removing their money from the country? There is a matter 
of fairness that Canadians really object to.
<P>
	These are the concerns which I have as I talk about government 
accountability. I ask the minister if she would please respond. Is the 
government prepared to be accountable in all areas, or simply in 
the areas where it is most convenient for it?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> Madam Speaker, let me say that yes 
indeed the government is prepared to be accountable in all aspects 
of its responsibilities. When we talk about accountability I would 
like to share with the House something else we have done in the 
department which responds directly to the member's concerns.
<P>
	It is only fair when we ask Canadians to open their books to us as 
we collect their taxes and look at their position, that we do the 
same. As a result of that I have asked my department to take the 
time to prepare on the basis of an internal audit, reports for this 
House, for members opposite and for their constituents on the 
different programs we take responsibility for.
<P>
	Most recently we did a full report on the tax filing year that 
indicated the positives, the fact that people are getting their refunds 
much faster now as a result of E-mail and other changes to our 
system, that we have implemented new strategies like E-filings, 
telephone filings which make sense to Canadians and respond to 
them. At the same time this report identified areas of weakness 
where we have to make improvements and respond more directly to 
Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4761"> 4761 </A></B>
<P>
	Most recently we have issued our second report, a report on the 
child tax benefit. The hon. member may be interested to know that 
the newest line of business in Revenue Canada is providing 
benefits to Canadians, returning revenues back to Canadians as 
appropriate: the issue of the child tax benefit and the GST credit 
for example. We have done a review of our child tax benefit 
program and strategy. We have found aspects that are very positive 
about it, but aspects that yes indeed we have to improve.
<P>
	These are the kinds of measures this government is taking to 
respond to the concern of the hon. member in the area of 
accountability.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, we are 
privileged to have the minister here responding to the motion and 
answering questions. I thank her for her very lucid communication. 
I commend her for her style of speaking.
<P>
	She indicated that this particular issue which has been brought 
up by members of the Bloc has been solved by her department, that 
the loophole has now been closed and that it is no longer permitted. 
I presume if the same attempt were to be made now, the tax revenue 
would not be forgone by the Government of Canada.
<P>
	Was there an attempt made to reassess the tax payable on the 
amount that was taken out of the country?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> Madam Speaker, I should clarify a 
couple of things.
<P>
	The concerns of the auditor general were really two. One dealt 
with policy: the issue of taxable Canadian property; how we apply 
it; how we should not apply it. The other was the issue of deemed 
disposition and when taxes should be paid on Canadian property.
<P>
	Those issues were reviewed by the finance committee and 
recommendations were given to the Minister of Finance, whose 
purview it is to deal with the policy of the Income Tax Act. He is 
currently reviewing them. As he does, I have in my department 
maintained a moratorium on rulings of taxable Canadian property. 
It is only appropriate and prudent that we give the minister time to 
make those considerations and ensure that the issues do not come 
before my department simultaneously. We want to ensure that the 
intentions of the members of the House and their concerns about 
this particular aspect are reviewed, given a full airing by the 
minister and then, when he makes his decisions, we will again 
return to the normal process of rulings, given the changes to any 
legislation.
<P>
	Beyond that I would say we have taken further action on the 
administrative side. Very clearly the auditor general and the 
committee were concerned about three things: the transparency of 
our decisions; the consistency of our decisions; and the 
documentation which we have  in our files around all the decisions 
we make. I am glad to confirm to the House and to all Canadians 
that we have taken action in all three of those areas, as I indicated 
in my speech. I believe that should add comfort and assure the 
integrity of our taxation system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to address the House this afternoon on the controversial 
topic of family trusts, and, more particularly, of the auditor 
general's report.
<P>
	There is no getting around the fact that it was very ill-considered 
of the finance committee, which is obviously controlled by the 
Liberal majority, to have criticized the auditor general and his 
report, because the auditor general is an institution that must, at all 
times, be above criticism.
<P>
	I appreciate the fact that the minister recognizes that the auditor 
general is doing a good job. Beyond the fact that I know that the 
minister is the soul of honesty, I must say that the scheming that 
has come to light in her department and that she says she is trying 
to rectify, is not going to encourage the public to have great 
confidence in the federal revenue department.
<P>
	Beyond the technical considerations the minister laid out earlier, 
the fact still remains that the average citizen does not necessarily 
have great confidence in the federal tax system. If you met a 
businessman anywhere in this great land and you asked him 
whether he was treated fairly by the tax system, I am not sure you 
would find him very enthusiastic. On the contrary, he would point 
out a number of situations that he finds disgraceful, a number of 
measures that he finds unfair.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	And even if we were to give him a technical explanation for 
certain situations, he would be no more convinced.
<P>
	When average citizens, the men or women who work five days a 
week, who have families to raise, file their tax returns at year's end, 
do they think they are being asked to pay their fair share of taxes, or 
do they think they are being asked to pay more than the more 
fortunate members of society?
<P>
	So you can understand that when the auditor general tells us that 
a rich family, with the help of what is known as a family trust and 
by means of tax provisions permitting money to be moved out of 
the country, has used these tax rules to shelter a sum of two billion 
dollars from taxes, average citizens do not understand. They do not 
understand why the act allows something like this to go on while 
they must pay every last cent of taxes they owe.
<P>
	You will agree with me that they have reason to worry. The 
legislative tax measures that are in place and that are administered 
by Revenue Canada cannot be justified  solely from a technical 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4762"> 4762 </A></B>
<P>
point of view, but must also demonstrate respect for this country's 
citizens, whatever their income.
<P>
	Basically, the problem is that people who have money are able to 
get the technical expertise they need to find legal ways to save on 
their income tax. Technically speaking there may be nothing 
wrong, but the fact remains there is something distinctly immoral 
about this.
<P>
	The average person is not in a position to say, with a big smile, 
that everything is okay because it is legal, because all the rules and 
regulations have been observed and the experts said it was all right. 
How can you make it morally acceptable to someone who earns a 
modest weekly wage and pays provincial and federal income tax of 
up to 20, 25, 30, 35 or 40 per cent and more, that someone can take 
two billion dollars, transfer it to the United States and not pay a 
cent of income tax? That is hard to swallow.
<P>
	For the benefit of the minister, I will tell you about a letter I 
received a few days ago. It was from a woman in Saint-Raymond, 
in the riding of Portneuf, a woman with a family, who last year had 
a job under a program managed by Human Resources 
Development, commonly referred to as DEPS and section 25s.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	I hope the minister will listen for a few moments, because I think 
the situation will interest her and help her understand why some 
people feel the family trust issue is particular shocking.
<P>
	This woman, who worked under a job readiness program of 
Human Resources Development for many months, hired a 
babysitter so her children would be looked after at home. Instead of 
paying this person under the table, thus making her work illegally, 
she paid her a reasonable amount so she agreed to give her name 
and this woman from Saint-Raymond could claim child care 
expenses as a tax deduction. In other words, she acted like a law 
abiding citizen so she could claim this deduction.
<P>
	But there is a problem because the money to pay for her salary 
comes out of the Unemployment Insurance Fund. So she is not 
entitled to this deduction. So, imagine, this woman who spent more 
to avoid hiring someone illegally was denied the deduction to 
which all other workers who have a job are entitled.
<P>
	There are numerous technical reasons, and the minister will 
agree, for which this woman is not entitled to that deduction but 
fundamentally, morally, and I hope the minister is listening 
carefully, that woman feels very angry and frustrated and is 
disappointed by a tax system she finds unfair.
<P>
	That is what is outrageous. On one hand, the auditor general tells 
us that a wealthy family was able, through a family trust and with 
rules on taking money out of the  country, to shelter $2 billion. This 
is three times the cost of the disaster in the Saguenay. That is a lot 
of money. Three times the cost of the disaster in the Saguenay: $2 
billion.
<P>
	On the other hand, this woman I just talked about is losing the 
equivalent of $1,000. I realize my time is running out but I believe I 
have demonstrated that what is outrageous is not that some things 
are legal but that the law has more consideration for the rich than 
for the poor.
<P>
	I hope the minister will be able to address this situation as soon 
as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the Bloc 
Quebecois' motion on this allotted day, particularly as I am 
Chairman of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts.
<P>
	I believe it is our duty, when we have the floor, to put things in 
perspective, so that our listeners can understand what we are 
talking about.
<P>
	On May 7, 1996, the Auditor General of Canada, Denis 
Desautels, tabled a report. Under an Act of this Parliament, the 
auditor general is expected to submit three reports each year. In this 
report, one chapter in particular caught our attention, not only the 
attention of the official opposition but also that of all the members 
of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts.
<P>
	Let me explain. I am talking about Chapter I, entitled ``Other 
Audit Observations''. This is a kind of catchall, not so much in 
terms of its content but because it contains a variety of 
observations.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	This chapter described two particular cases. The auditor general 
had examined two particular cases relating to the transfer of assets 
from one family trust to another family trust in the United States. 
The figure was astronomical. The principle would also have been 
unacceptable had the figure been smaller, but the very fact that it 
was a tax-free transfer of $2 billion made it even more so.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Public Accounts met, as it does 
each time the auditor general tables a report, and as it did today, in 
fact. In committee, we try to determine which priorities we should 
look at, study and call witnesses about.
<P>
	You will understand that the official opposition wanted to study 
these two family trusts quickly, I must stress this fact, right from 
the beginning, as the Chairman of the Standing Committee on 
Public Accounts, the only committee to be chaired by a member of 
the opposition. The rules of our democracy entitle the official 
opposition to chair that committee which acts together with the 
auditor general. This committee monitors the  government and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4763"> 4763 </A></B>
<P>
different departments to ensure, for Canadian taxpayers, that their 
taxes are being spent efficiently. In fact, such is the role of a state 
where taxes are collected. We pay the taxes and we make sure that 
we get our money's worth.
<P>
	We wanted to examine this issue on a priority basis and that is 
why we, in the official opposition, decided it warranted further 
debate in the House, because we were unable to find out in detail 
what really happened in these events we now call a scandal. This 
term was not necessarily chosen by the official opposition. The 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Revenue said 
that the government members do not like to hear us using the word 
``scandal'', but we are not the ones who first used this term. It was 
first used by neutral and independent reporters who happened to 
examine the case. We could quote Martin Leclerc, from the <I>Journal 
de Montréal</I> and the <I>Journal de Québec</I>; we could quote Gilles 
Gauthier, from La Presse. They are not in the pay of a specific 
party. They were the ones who said this situation was outrageous, 
that it did not make sense.
<P>
	We can tell you that, again today, as a result of delaying tactics, 
the official opposition is not in a position to do its job properly 
because, as we speak, we cannot find out what really happened.
<P>
	As my colleague, the member for Portneuf, was saying earlier, 
we have a few questions of our own. Why, when it is time for two 
rich families to transfer, tax free, $2 billion, are all the officials, all 
the senior officials at Revenue Canada available to meet with them, 
help them win their case and proceed with the transfer?
<P>
	This is what worries us about the 1991 decision. It was handed 
down on December 23, 1991. If there are questions or comments 
later on, I already know that Liberal members will say: ``This did 
not happen while we were in power, it happened under the 
Conservatives''. Quite true. Nice try. Indeed, the Liberals were not 
in power in 1991, but they will not be able to get away with what 
was made public today by the auditor general in his report. 
Revenue Canada is going to have to account for $630 million worth 
of tax evasion. The auditor general mentioned that this is due to a 
lack of auditing of major oil companies and the tobacco industry; 
$630 million in 1994-95 alone.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	This means that the Liberals' argument that they were not here in 
1991 still holds. However, what practical steps have they taken to 
close the door?
<P>
	The Liberals want us to stop reviewing chapter 1 of the auditor 
general's report, claiming that the Standing Committee on Finance 
has already done so. They want the Standing Committee on Public 
Accounts to work on something else. I know some members here in 
this House could say: ``Yes, but the committee agreed to hold only  
one meeting on family trusts''. Maybe the Liberal majority 
members are smarter than I, but, as I said to the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts, I do not feel that one single sitting 
is enough to shed light on what really happened on December 23, 
1991.
<P>
	Because we, the members of the official opposition, have always 
believed in the institution personified by the Auditor General of 
Canada, we also find it unfortunate and deplorable that the 
Chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance and member for 
Willowdale tried twice to discredit, to corner, to trip up the auditor 
general and his colleagues. He never assumed such an attitude 
towards the Deputy Minister of Finance, Mr. Dodge, or the Deputy 
Minister of National Revenue, Mr. Gravelle. This is what we call 
double standard. Instead of showing some respect for the Office of 
the Auditor General of Canada,an independent and democratic 
institution that has no political ties, he chose to play party politics.
<P>
	The member for Willowdale is well-known for the way he 
conducts the proceedings of the Standing Committee on Finance. 
As Chairman of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, I do 
not need the member for Willowdale and Chairman of the Standing 
Committee on Finance, telling me what to do.
<P>
	The fundamental issue is the issue of the accountability of senior 
officials. This is regrettable, but I must tell you that the question of 
accountability of senior civil servants will not be studied by any 
parliamentary committee. The Standing Committee on Public 
Accounts, of which I am a member, will not be able to do it in one 
single sitting any more than the Standing Committee on Finance 
did. In a democratic society, it is of considerable concern when 
people are not accountable for their actions and their decisions.
<P>
	We will never know neither the circumstances which led to the 
transfer out of Canada of $2 billion, tax free, nor all the reasons 
surrounding these improprieties. I am not the one mentioning 
improprieties in this context, it is the auditor general.
<P>
	To conclude, if we go beyond this case, it is the whole process of 
external audit of the government which has to be reviewed. Maybe 
Liberals are longing for the time when they were in opposition. 
They were more aggressive then, more lively, perhaps, and they 
will probably be there again after the next elections. The only 
committee chaired by an opposition member is being side-tracked 
despite its formal mandate to study the auditor general's report. 
The auditor general is under attack and will not have any forum to 
defend his indictment of this government, if the Standing 
Committee of Public Accounts is not able to shed light on this 
question.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that this is a frontal attack on the 
principle of government accountability to Parliament.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the hon. member from the Bloc. In 
its position as the official opposition to the Government of Canada, 
the job of the Bloc is always to hold the government accountable. 
Its job is to ensure that any legislation coming before the Chamber 
will be accountable to the people of Canada. In particular, its job is 
to watch the public purse. In particular, the Bloc motion states that 
the government is opening the door to other capital transfers that 
will deprive the federal government of hundreds of millions, and 
possibly billions, of dollars every year.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	I cannot understand the Bloc political party. Only a year ago the 
transfer of money across the border to the United States was under 
discussion in the committees and in this Chamber. Changes were 
suggested to the tax treaties between Canada and the United States. 
The general public has to understand that these are reciprocity 
agreements which apply to Canadians and Americans.
<P>
	A suggestion was made by the Senate banking committee in the 
form of a bill that came to this Chamber eventually. This political 
party was asked to pass judgment on a major change in tax policy 
that would mean a reduction in the withholding tax on 
multinational corporations that sent their money from their 
subsidiaries to their parent company in the United States. Do you 
know what the Bloc said, Madam Speaker? The Bloc said on page 
14707 of <I>Hansard</I> that it was a wonderful thing because now our 
capital could freely flow into the United States.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member to justify his position in view of what he is 
saying today. Here is what was said at page 15541 of <I>Hansard</I>: 
``The bill does not specifically say how many millions and billions 
of dollars are at stake in this protocol. We do not know which 
country, Canada or the United States, will benefit the most from 
this tax liberalization protocol but we support these proposed tax 
changes''.
<P>
	How does the hon. member support the position of the Bloc 
when it supported the movement of capital out of this country and 
at the same time put in the words of this motion today and present 
this picture to the people of Canada?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond: </B>Madam Speaker, in Quebec, when the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation gives us the time programs will start, it 
always says ``one hour later in the maritimes''. That is confirmed 
by the statements of the hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls, 
one hour later in the maritimes, but he did not make any relevant 
comment on the issue.
<P>
	I would like you to ask the Speaker if he would be kind enough to 
send me the page in <I>Hansard</I> where I spoke on this bill. I cannot 
recall saying what the member says I did. It could just be my 
<P>
memory, but I really do not recall saying that. But there is one thing 
I remember saying and I have repeated it. What we want, and the 
hon. member did not understand that, is to shed some light on what 
really happened on December 23, 1991.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I will mention to the hon. member that I worked 14 years for 
Abitibi-Price. That company had a paper mill in Grand Falls, 
Newfoundland, in his riding. I ask the member, when he returns to 
his riding this weekend, to ask the paper maker, the guy who works 
in the boiler room, the guy who works in the chip mill if they 
accept the fact that the rich can move $2 billion U.S. without 
paying income taxes. Is it normal, is it acceptable to the paper 
maker in the Grand Falls mill?
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to be sharing my 
time with the hon. member for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
the dean of this House.
<P>
	It is time to ask what is really going on here. What is the real 
motive behind the Bloc Quebecois' fascination with this issue?
<P>
	When smart people do odd things, it ought to make a person 
suspicious. I am just a little suspicious about the motives operating 
here.
<P>
	It cannot be that the Bloc wants to embarrass the previous 
government. That is a rather bizarre thing, not that I object.
<P>
	It cannot be that the Bloc believes that the government has not 
acted on the auditor general's recommendations because it has 
done so. First, there was a moratorium on additional tax rulings; 
second, a referral to the finance committee; third, a very serious 
piece of work from the finance committee and, from that will 
undoubtedly flow action on the recommendations of that 
committee.
<P>
	This fascination of the Bloc cannot be because its members think 
we have not responded in a timely fashion. We have.
<P>
	The fascination cannot be based on some perception of 
interference or wrongdoing in the decision making process because 
the auditor general has admitted that there was no such thing.
<P>
	The fascination with this issue cannot be because there is 
something wrong in taxpayers seeking advance tax rulings on 
complex transactions. As they well know, the auditor general in 
previous years has reviewed and praised the advance ruling 
process.
<P>
	If the taxpayers in question wanted to do something untoward, 
wanted to get away with something, they  certainly would not have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4765"> 4765 </A></B>
<P>
come to Revenue Canada and asked for a tax ruling. I suggest that 
they would have done it.
<P>
	One of the reasons the auditor general praised the tax ruling 
process was that it provided, if you will, a heads up to Revenue 
Canada about transactions and actions out there so that Revenue 
Canada would be right up to date on the things that were 
happening. This taxpayer talked to Revenue Canada. He or she did 
not have to do that.
<P>
	The fascination of Bloc members can be understood. It is not for 
any of the reasons above. It is because of who they believe the 
taxpayer is. Maybe it is someone rich, they say. Maybe it is an 
anglo. Maybe it is an ethnic. We can draw a lot of lessons from 
their fascination with this issue.
<P>
	What lessons can we draw from the way the Bloc has handled 
this matter about the kind of society it would build in Quebec? Let 
me tell members. Based on its performance on this matter, its 
members would build a society in which being successful would 
bar a person from fair treatment.
<P>
	They would build a society in which there would be no taxpayer 
confidentiality. They would build a society in which envy would be 
the basis for policy, a society led by accountants that envy, 
bookkeepers of offence, measurers of science. What kind of 
economy would be left in Quebec in that environment?
<P>
	What kind of society would they build? Based on the Bloc 
Quebecois' minority report on this issue, I will say what kind of 
society it would be building: a society in which expertise and 
experience is dismissed if someone's opinion disagrees with its 
ideology.
<P>
	In their minority report, Bloc members dismiss out of hand the 
seven out of eight tax experts who appeared before the committee 
and concluded that the opinions Revenue Canada provided, based 
on the law and regulation as it then was, were incorrect.
<P>
	What kind of society would they build? It would be a society in 
which your opinion would be unassailable if you agreed with their 
ideology. They cite Professor Brooks, the other of the eight who 
supported the Bloc's position and disagreed with the seven other 
experts.
<P>
	His opinion, of course, was unassailable but the other experts, in 
the Bloc member's opinion, had a conflict of interest. How 
convenient.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	What kind of society would Bloc members build? A society in 
which minorities in Quebec might hope to be tolerated but never be 
quite equal. We are all minorities. It just depends where you draw 
your borders.
<P>
	What kind of society would it be? It would be a society led by 
historical revisionists recasting and perverting history for their own 
ends. The francophone history in Canada is not one of shame but 
one of which to be  proud. It is one of building a great country 
together, of opening a continent. What do they want to do? They 
want to lock francophones up in Quebec.
<P>
	What kind of society would they build? It would be a society in 
which someone else is always responsible for the problems: the 
anglos, the rich, the ethnics, the federalists. Who will they blame if 
they go it alone?
<P>
	It would be a society built on an insecurity so severe that they, 
the separatists, attempt to insulate themselves from criticism, 
labelling those who have criticized them as sellouts or part of some 
great overarching conspiracy, a society where government would 
decide when to suspend the rule of law, and the rule of law is all 
that stands between us and tyranny.
<P>
	They would also build a society where it appears, based on the 
separatists own actions and statements, that there is collective 
responsibility. The Jewish community is responsible for Mr. 
Galganov, but the separatists and the francophone community are 
not responsible for Mr. Parizeau's comments about ethnics, for Mr. 
Landry's treatment of ethnics or Mr. Villeneuve's comments.
<P>
	I am pleased to have had this opportunity to participate in this 
debate but I weep for Quebec, for the decent, hardworking, fair, 
open people of Quebec who are demeaned by the behaviour and 
attitude of the separatists as we have seen in this debate and in so 
many other debates.
<P>
	I have confidence in the people of Quebec. They will never allow 
themselves to be led down the garden path to the narrow, stifling, 
miserable future the separatists have in mind for them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened to my colleague from St. Paul's 
comments on the motion before us today. It is hard to believe that 
the hon. member for St. Paul's can make such insulting comments 
not only about Bloc members but about all Quebecers.
<P>
	This shows-as the people listening to us will realize-how the 
Bloc was justified in putting forward the issue of family trusts, how 
this hurts the Liberal government across the way, how they are not 
defending the interests of taxpayers in Canada and Quebec. It is the 
interests of those who contribute to their election fund they are 
looking after.
<P>
	In 10 minutes, he managed to talk about the experts he claims the 
Bloc Quebecois is denigrating. He forgot to say that the experts 
who appeared before the finance committee were invited by the 
committee chairman himself and that these experts come from 
firms that, as we said before, contribute generously to the Liberal 
Party's coffers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4766"> 4766 </A></B>
<P>
	When someone as credible as the auditor general came before 
this committee to shed light, to tell the truth, he was harassed. 
They would have fired him if they could, because he had dared 
to tell the truth.
<P>
	Then the hon. member for St. Paul's paints everything with the 
same brush. This is called condemnation in-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> In absentia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Not in 
absentia, as my colleague said, but they are trying to link people 
who are not linked in any way. He criticized Mr. Parizeau for the 
comments he made the night of the referendum; he also criticized 
Mr. Landry's comments and those made by Mr. Villeneuve, which 
were condemned by everyone in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Our colleague's remarks were dishonest and, if he is an 
honourable man, he will withdraw them.
<P>
	He should tell us why someone who is so pure, so intent on 
finding the truth, is not asking his government to disclose all the 
facts on the family trust matter. This is what the Bloc Quebecois 
wants, what the auditor general wants, what the people of Canada 
and Quebec want: to shed light on the huge amounts of money 
leaving the country without a penny in tax being paid, as we have 
been saying for the past three years. Year after year, they cut over 
$5 billion a year from the programs aimed at the unemployed.
<P>
	That is what we want to know. We do not want to be treated as 
the hon. member, who talks through his hat more often than not, 
has treated us.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Madam Speaker, I will be brief. I think members 
can express views on either side of this side. The hon. members for 
the opposition never hesitate to speak their minds and provide us 
with their interpretation of facts, history and reality. I think we are 
entitled on this side to do the same. If they do not like how it 
sounds or how it feels, I cannot help that.
<P>
	I might add one other item to my list of what sort of society they 
might be talking about. That is one where one's professional 
competence and professional ethics are attacked if one does not 
agree with their opinion because that is what they are doing with 
respect to the experts before the committee.
<P>
	I remind the hon. members that one expert was invited by the 
Bloc Quebecois, which was entitled to have as many others as it 
wanted. It could only come up with one.
<P>
	This issue is about taxpayer migration. This government has 
dealt with family trusts in the last budget to the extent that family 
trusts impact this issue of taxpayer migration. I think the finance 
committee has done an excellent job of addressing those concerns.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, as I rise to speak on this motion today I am 
really amazed with its content. It has been some time since I saw a 
motion in this House that is worded in the way this one is today. It 
is really trying to get at rulings that were made in 1985 and 1991 
relating to the immigration of taxpayers and the distribution of 
Canadian trust property to a non-resident beneficiary. It is also very 
much about migration taxation.
<P>
	The opposition motion today tries to convince people that the 
doors are open for other transactions to leave the country and they 
talk of this in terms of hundreds of millions and even billions of 
dollars. This is an absurd assumption. What they are trying to do is 
create a perception of a loss of tax dollars. The finance committee 
has brought an excellent report into this House and found no such 
transactions taking place.
<P>
	As I have said, this is an absurd assumption. Are billions of 
dollars leaving the country tax free? The answer is a clear and 
unequivocal no. Revenue Canada is not aware of any similar 
transactions since 1991, and the finance committee confirmed it 
found no indication of large revenue losses or tax planning 
opportunities that occurred because of the 1991 ruling.
<P>
	The minister of revenue, as she said today, has placed a 
moratorium on any such rulings in this area of the Income Tax Act 
until such time as the government plugs the loopholes.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans 
indicated today that the Liberals would be blaming this on the Tory 
administration. The Canadian public has already passed judgment 
on the Tory administration. It did that on October 25, 1993 in the 
general election. Therefore we do not have to pass it on to it, it was 
there during its time. However, there was no evidence found of 
wrongdoing on the part of tax department officials in this ruling. 
That is in the report that the finance committee brought into this 
House.
<P>
	I want to emphasize that the Minister of National Revenue has 
stated that we have a moratorium on any such procedures until the 
government plugs the loopholes. This is in effect a freeze on all 
procedures, and no decision to let money out of this country can be 
taken while that moratorium is on. How do we get fish out of a lake 
when the lake is frozen? We have to drill a hole. But the finance 
minister and the Government of Canada are saying they are going 
to plug the hole. The Bloc can try as it likes but it will not be able to 
drill a hole in the ice on that lake and get the fish out. The 
Government of Canada is going to review these tax laws which 
have not been reviewed for 25 years. It has already taken many 
measures in this regard.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4767"> 4767 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore let us not get carried away with the idea that 
something terrible is going on today because the finance 
committee, the auditor general and other officials, six leading 
auditors of this country, have said there was no wrongdoing. The 
Department of National Revenue says that nothing has happened 
since 1991.
<P>
	If they are trying to put a hole in the Liberal armour in Quebec, 
they will have to try harder than this. The people of Quebec are 
smart enough to know they are not being led down the garden path 
by tactics such as this. Just reading that motion is the worst bedtime 
reading anybody could possibly have.
<P>
	The government has stated on the floor of this House that the 
problem today is how to treat capital gains when someone, an 
immigrant, a person, a trust, a company or a partnership wants to 
leave Canada. That is the question. That was the auditor general's 
main point. The majority finance committee report of the House 
endorsed it by saying action must be taken. The Minister of 
Finance said: ``We agree and we intend to take action''.
<P>
	At another place in <I>Hansard</I> on September 20, the government 
said that the majority finance committee report was very thorough 
in the way it dealt with this point and that the government intends 
to take action. The Minister of Finance, on behalf of the 
government, said: ``We wanted to shed some light on the matter 
and the majority report of the finance committee did so, and we 
intend to act''.
<P>
	It becomes very clear that the motion which the House is 
debating today has been placed on the Order Paper by the official 
opposition as an example of straight crass politics, and that is why 
it does not mention the positive approaches that have been taken by 
this government to update the Income Tax Act. The average 
Canadian needs the facts surrounding this issue and they are getting 
them. They do not need the kind of political rhetoric portrayed by 
this motion.
<P>
	I repeat that a moratorium has been placed on all rulings with 
respect to taxpayer migration until the government has introduced 
legislation and taken other steps to plug the loopholes. It wants to 
study the finance committee report in depth.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	Let us compare ourselves with other countries. In the House we 
are always downgrading ourselves in many ways. I want to 
compare Canada's tax laws with those of other countries.
<P>
	Our tax laws are tighter than those of other G-7 nations. Our tax 
administration system is the most highly respected of any today. It 
is pure speculation that money has been lost. There is no evidence 
from any source that money has been lost.
<P>
	It is another matter when we come to a debate such as this to 
examine the issues in their full complexity, not just  in simplistic 
statements such as those stated in the motion today. It is another 
matter to examine the actions of hardworking and dedicated 
officials in the context in which those actions occurred.
<P>
	It is very easy to criticize somebody, talk about the good and the 
bad, put people into categories of heroes and the villains. But that is 
why it is absolutely necessary to explain the whole issue on the 
floor of the House. It is quite another matter when we consider that 
one of the central issues we are examining today relates to the 
highly complex and frequently uncertain area of the tax treatment 
of taxpayers who migrate.
<P>
	Chapter 1 of the auditor general's report issued on May 7 of this 
year raised issues related to income tax rulings and in particular 
Canada's tax policy as it relates to persons who become or cease to 
become resident in Canada.
<P>
	The fact that these concerns dealt partially with family trusts 
should not obscure the fact that the principal issue in this matter is 
the tax rules relating to taxpayer migration.
<P>
	I think this is something which is very relevant. It has been said 
that the period since the end of the second world war will be 
regarded by historians as the twilight of the nation state and the 
dawn of the single world economy.
<P>
	According to <I>Webster's Dictionary</I> the term globalization did not 
even exist until 1944. Today it is the defining watchword of our 
modern world. Yet surprisingly tax rules relating to taxpayer 
migration were not enacted by Parliament until 1971 and have not 
been significantly reviewed in the 25 years since they were 
enacted.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
somewhat disappointed with the remarks made by the hon. member 
for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, whose career as a politician 
is coming to an end. I am sad to see him make remarks that can 
only bring shame on parliamentarians.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member, as a former chair the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts and a senior member of this House, 
with 36 years of service, could tell us what message he thinks he is 
sending the Canadian people with remarks like that. When he 
chaired the public accounts committee, would he have let the 
auditor general's report be torn to pieces along with the auditor 
himself, who simply did his job and nothing more?
<P>
	Why was this issue, which was before the public accounts 
committee, referred to the finance committee, an obscure 
committee controlled by the Liberals? The Liberals are the 
majority on the finance committee. Right there, there is cause for 
concern, there is something fishy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4768"> 4768 </A></B>
<P>
	A member with 36 years of experience in politics just does not 
lend himself to this kind of thing. Either he stays put or, better 
yet, he stays home because these goings-on were downright 
unacceptable. He mentioned experts, tax experts, the same experts 
who participated in the making of the December 24, 1991, 
decision.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	In what way were the rules of law adhered to and the wish to get 
to the bottom of this issue respected, this issue raised by the auditor 
general, who, thankfully, is not working for the Liberal Party but as 
an agent of this House.
<P>
	They shot the messenger with red hot bullets to shut him up. 
They tried to discredit him. Why is the ruling party doing that? 
Could it be that the auditor general has uncovered something he 
was not supposed to uncover? Did he express suspicions he should 
not have expressed? What need was there to attack the auditor 
general and deal with this matter on the quiet in a finance 
committee controlled by the Liberals, who are, as we know, the 
major players on these committees?
<P>
	Does the hon. member, who has 36 years of experience in 
politics, take pride in what he is trying to have Quebecers and 
Canadians alike believe? He should not have a hard time 
convincing them, seeing that the scandal was revealed by 
sovereignists, members of the Bloc Quebecois. It is easy to 
convince the Canadian public, terrified of the BQ, that it was a bad 
thing the BQ uncovered. But the auditor general is not a member of 
the Bloc. He is probably the man with the highest moral authority 
in all of government. This is the man that they have tried to tear to 
pieces for possibly putting his nose in something he should not 
have put his nose into.
<P>
	I urge the hon. member to make amends and acknowledge the 
fact that the Standing Committee on Public Accounts should have 
given the matter full consideration, reported to this House and 
recommended an enquiry.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> Madam Speaker, I just want to say to the hon. 
member that it is quite obvious that I got through to the true 
intention of the Bloc Party in the House of Commons today when 
he turns around and makes a personal attack on me. My hide is 
thick. I can take that. But I can also dish it out.
<P>
	I am going to say to him today that the Auditor General of 
Canada has always had the highest respect from the member for 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke.
<P>
	I have no hesitation in saying that it was this government which 
took the initiative. It was not the Bloc. Do not stand and say that the 
Bloc took the initiative. The Government of Canada took the 
initiative and referred the matter to the finance committee of the  
House of Commons and the finance committee brought in the 
report.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Madam Speaker, first I 
wish to inform you that I will share my time with my colleague 
from Chambly, so I have ten minutes for my speech.
<P>
	My first three words in the present debate are: shame, shame and 
shame.
<P>
	I listened to the hon. member for 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke and I totally disagree with the 
chronology that he just described. I have the course of events 
written here, showing how cynical the government's methods were.
<P>
	First of all, on December 23, Revenue Canada issued its ruling, 
that is to say, officials held discussions leading to a decision. In his 
report, the auditor general mentioned that at least four meetings 
were held that day. This was already preferential treatment for the 
kind of companies, or rich families we are discussing today.
<P>
	This was also done behind closed doors. Two days before 
Christmas, when everybody was celebrating, officials were called 
together four or five times to try and to see what could be done for 
friends. We will prove later that they were friends of the Liberal 
Party.
<P>
	On December 24, they issued their ruling. When asked for a 
ruling or when a ruling is appealed, revenue officials rarely issue a 
ruling within 24 hours. That happened in the case discussed today.
<P>
	In 1993, the auditor general ordered Revenue Canada to publish 
its rulings, because he realized that it did not publish its rulings 
regarding family trusts. I also totally disagree with the hon. 
member who spoke just before me, the hon. member for 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, because family trusts have been 
in the Bloc Quebecois' platform since the very beginning, since its 
founding-and I was there-and also during the election 
campaign.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	We realized there was a major problem. The middle class and the 
poor were hit by all kinds of taxes and measures, while other 
Canadian families were benefitting from the government's 
generosity. We pointed this out from the very beginning and we 
started doing something about it, since we were elected in October. 
The hon. member can look at the record: the Bloc Quebecois' first 
questions in the early days of this Parliament related to the issue of 
family trusts, which was part of our platform.
<P>
	Finally, on March 21, five years after the beginning of this saga, 
Revenue Canada made its ruling public. On May 7, the auditor 
general released his report, in which he alludes to a precedent that 
could cost Canadians hundreds of millions of dollars.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4769"> 4769 </A></B>
<P>
	Following the release of the auditor general's report, the Bloc 
continued to ask questions. In a very unfair move, the government, 
rather than asking the public accounts committee, chaired by a 
Bloc Quebecois member, to review the issue, as should have been 
the case-although it would have been risky for the 
government-asked instead the finance committee to shed light 
on these events.
<P>
	There is no surprise. The revenue minister often hides behind the 
report of the finance committee, because it was prepared by the 
Liberal majority of course, but she never talks about the minority 
report of that same committee. The minister claims the exercise 
was conducted according to normal practices.
<P>
	Not so. The public accounts committee is the one that should 
have been instructed to examine the issue. And what did the 
finance committee do as soon as it convened? It asked experts to 
come and testify. My colleagues told you about this. I have the 
names of these experts.
<P>
	The committee invited officials from Ernst and Young, Stikeman 
Elliott and Coopers and Lybrand. These are all tax consultants who 
give advice to rich Canadian families so they can avoid paying 
taxes to Revenue Canada. This is tantamount to putting the wolf in 
charge of the sheepfold. And this is what happened.
<P>
	Once the report appeared, everybody said: ``This has been done 
democratically, the finance committee has reviewed the issue, 
there is no problem, experts were called on to give evidence.'' 
Nobody tells us that foxes were called to tell us how to mind the 
geese. As a result, we might never know where those two billion 
dollars went and what families were concerned. That too was 
disclosed, the names of the families. Again, those are 
presumptions. What is sure is that it happened and maybe it keeps 
happening right now. Yes they can talk about ice and holes in the 
ice that can be plugged.
<P>
	In our opinion, that keeps happening and were it not for our 
colleagues' intervention, our colleagues for Saint-Hyacinthe, for 
La Prairie and for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, we would 
still be allowing fortunes to move out one way or the other. We 
would ignore it. That is not exactly how we want things to be done.
<P>
	Earlier, my colleague for Portneuf talked about the 
importance-I would rather call it the appearance-of tax equity. 
Is there appearance of tax equity?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Not at all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bachand:</B> Not at all.
<P>
	Think about the blue-collar worker employed by the City of 
Saint-Jean who looks at his pay cheque on Friday and sees that a 
third of his pay goes to income tax and various other taxes, and who 
knows that at the end of the year Revenue Canada will show its 
claws if he  contravenes the law. Can he phone Revenue Canada 
and ask for a ruling? Can he ask whether it is legal to do such a 
thing? We just got an answer this afternoon: no.
<P>
	But if your name is Bronfman, if your name is Conrad Black-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Or Paul 
Martin.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bachand:</B> -or Paul Martin, you can give a call not only to 
Revenue Canada, but also to the Prime Minister of Canada, and ask 
them for some kind of sweet deal.
<P>
	Actually, what we would like to know is precisely what they are 
refusing to tell us. The young woman who is a white collar 
employee of the city of Saint-Luc or the bus driver working for the 
bus company in my riding are just fed up. They keep telling us they 
have had it with taxes, they are overburdened. How can a small 
family with a combined annual income of $45,000 and no tax 
loophole consider that the tax system is fair, when they hear about 
blatant inequities like the one being debated today?
<P>
	The tax system should have the appearance of fairness. A 
principle of justice is that justice should appear to be done. Today, 
we do not even have a semblance of tax fairness.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Even the finance minister dared to say: ``There is no problem 
with family trusts. I have my own.'' And we know it too. Bronfman 
and Conrad Black are sure to have one too, and their children will 
benefit from it for generations to come.
<P>
	But what about the man on the street, the blue or white collar 
worker, the bus driver, the subway train operator, or the average 
worker in a company? Can they leave millions of dollars to their 
kids? I do not think so.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the hon. member for Nipissing has left, 
because the Liberal Party is so arrogant that it behaves as if it owns 
the House of Commons in a system where there are no rules to 
govern those who sit here. If it were not for the minimum rules we 
have around here, I think the Liberal Party would say that it owns 
the House of Commons and that it no longer wants an auditor 
general. Of course, because he does not always agree with them. 
But he is a watchdog; it is his role not to always agree with the 
Liberal Party.
<P>
	The philosophy of the Liberal Party of Canada is quite simple: 
its members will continue to protect their rich friends. I think that 
we, in the Bloc Quebecois, will continue de protect the middle 
class citizens who are tired of being taxed and witnessing such 
unfairness. We will continue to protect the needy who are affected 
by the cuts, because, in order to balance the tax base and the 
budget, the government cuts programs for the underprivileged, 
taxes the middle class and turns a blind eye to all those rich 
families who flee the country with all their money.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4770"> 4770 </A></B>
<P>
	This is not the philosophy of the Bloc Quebecois, but the 
philosophy of the Liberal Party of Canada. It will come back to 
haunt them in the next election. If they do not change their minds, 
the people will realize that such unfairness does not make any 
sense and the Liberal Party might meet the same fate as my hon. 
colleague for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke wished upon the 
previous Conservative government earlier on.
<P>
	It is all very well to have power, but not to the point where one 
becomes domineering and arrogant. The people will realize it some 
day. We sit here, in opposition, to make Quebecers and Canadians 
aware that they are much better served by an opposition party, by 
an auditor general who acts as a watchdog, as some kind of 
opposition, and wants to help the party in office to get back on 
track.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I note that the member of the Bloc Quebecois does not 
take credit for raising this issue. It is the auditor general.
<P>
	I would like to express my appreciation for his acknowledging 
that. The auditor general does have an extremely important role in 
holding the government accountable.
<P>
	This issue raises for me the lack of accountability of this 
government and its intention to be even less accountable as we 
proceed through its mandate.
<P>
	I think of the changes in legislation that are coming through 
where the government is seeking to have more discretion in its 
power as it governs. It is interesting how power seeks power.
<P>
	There are little changes like changing in the legislation a ``shall'' 
to a ``may'', which leaves more discretion; a comment such as ``in 
the opinion of the minister'' in the legislation, which leaves no 
latitude for appeal.
<P>
	There are a couple of issues that I would like to raise about 
government accountability in my own constituency. There is the 
appointment of returning officers. What is the accountability of the 
government in this?
<P>
	In my constituency there have been two returning officers 
appointed by this government. As far as I can tell neither of them 
has had any public input.
<P>
	As I read the qualifications, I read that the work is by nature 
impartial, non-partisan: ``The returning officer must conduct all 
business accordingly. Returning officers must abide by the 
government's conflict of interest code and Elections Canada code 
of professional conduct and must abstain from all activities of a 
politically partisan nature''.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	Yet it is well known in my community that both people who were 
appointed-one has since resigned and the other remains 
appointed-are indeed part of the Liberal organization. Where is 
the accountability there?
<P>
	I would also like to raise the issue of the Nisga'a treaty and the 
agreement in principle where a large portion of the province of 
British Columbia has been set aside without consultation of the 
people of British Columbia. Included in this agreement are 
educational matters, justice matters, infrastructure matters, 
commercial fishing matters. Where did the government include 
people in this? Where is the government's accountability to the 
people who elected it? This is the issue.
<P>
	As we talk about family trusts, people are extremely nervous 
because of the way the Liberal government has gone about 
governing the nation, not in a fair manner at all.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bachand:</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to see that the 
Reform member shares our view on this matter. We rarely agree, 
but on the subject of the government's responsibility regarding this 
iniquity, we share the same opinion. For the record, though, I 
would like to say that the Auditor General released his report on 
May 7, but that this was part of the Bloc Quebecois' electoral 
platform in 1993 and that, by chance, we reached the same 
conclusions. Of course, when the Auditor General tabled his report, 
we agreed with it.
<P>
	I want to give the Bloc Quebecois credit for this because it had 
already identified the problem. The fact that the Auditor General 
confirmed this, put us in agreement. We too have criticized the 
accountability of the government, which continues to hide behind 
committees that, until now, have been pretty phoney.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, honestly, 
I cannot say that I am happy to speak today on the motion tabled by 
the official opposition. This is not the first time that I have 
criticized apparent conflicts of interests, flagrant iniquities against 
ordinary taxpayers by the current government.
<P>
	I need only mention the Pearson Airport episode. There was even 
one Liberal, alleged be the revenue minister's father, who said that 
there were plenty of apparent conflicts of interests and shady 
dealings that should be investigated. And this is not from a Bloc 
member but from the father of the current Minister of Revenue, a 
very well-known Liberal named Nixon, who had made that 
recommendation to the government. The government did not pay 
heed. It was as if he had not said anything.
<P>
	I remember the then Minister of Transport, who said that it was 
no use to dig up such things. And yet, they dig up things when they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4771"> 4771 </A></B>
<P>
find a low income earner who  defrauded unemployment insurance 
of $200. They will pursue him even into his grave. It is worth their 
while to dig up such things. But matters involving billions of 
dollars is only wheeling and dealing.
<P>
	The Pearson deal is not the only example. Do the members 
across the way remember Power DirecTv? A decision was reversed 
even though it had been taken by the authorities responsible for 
overseeing these things. The Cabinet changed it. It just happened 
that there were people at Power DirecTv who were close to the 
Prime Minister and his entourage.
<P>
	In the case of Ginn Publishing, they did not even wait for the 
lawyer's report to again return things to friends of the government 
party and its leaders.
<P>
	I could go on and on. I remember a minister who was in Los 
Angeles at one time and who came to ensure that Canadians had 
truly taken control of a film distribution company. He was ready to 
swear and put in writing that this company was really a Canadian 
company.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	There are many examples, and everything leads us to believe that 
there will be others.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Finance. I was watching the 
Liberals pull out their hair earlier: the Standing Committee on 
Finance has decided this; the Standing Committee on Finance does 
not want to know anything, it does not want to find anything, as in 
the case of Pearson Airport. There is none so blind as he who will 
not see. This is the case of the Standing Committee on Finance. If 
the members opposite can convince other Canadians of this, it is 
their problem. But, as the member for Saint-Jean said, I am not sure 
they will not get their comeuppance royally in the next election, as 
other parties that have done similar but not such bad things as this, 
I would say. With some 177 seats, a government can devise laws 
benefiting the wealthy, and the opposition, official or not, can do 
nothing about it. That is what has happened in the three years since 
the government came into power. It is a shame involving 
everybody.
<P>
	We come here to implore the common sense of independent 
experts, of six independent experts who probably were involved in 
a series of decisions, the one taken on 23 December 1991 in 
particular. They were at the party held on December 23, and we are 
asking them if, in their opinion, everything was done according to 
the rules. My colleague called that a just application of tax equity. 
The government is not even trying to give an appearance of 
clearness and cleanliness. It does not care. ``We are too strong, they 
will never dare to destroy us, because we are the ones who decide 
in the end.'' And even the Minister of Finance said: ``I do have a 
family trust.'' Indeed, and it is made up of taxable Canadian 
property. The day he sends his ships for a trip in the South with the 
intention of not bringing them back, how will we look, since he is 
the Minister of Finance?
<P>
	That is almost what happened with the $2 billion. Can you 
imagine how much tax $2 billion represents? ``No, we cannot do it 
because this is a friend. Scratch my back, I will scratch yours''. 
That is how it works across the way.
<P>
	At one point, Canadians will have to realize that they are being 
bamboozled as they have never been in the history of Canada. We 
have already seen governments making timid attempts, but today, 
we are seeing people taking the cash and laughing all the way to the 
banks-overseas. Two billion dollars! It does not make any bloody 
sense at all.
<P>
	Still today, I thought that the haemorrhage had been staunched, 
but no. Today, we saw in the auditor general's report that there is 
still $630 million worth of loopholes of all kinds. We are not 
talking about petty thieves, but about big tobacco companies. It is 
all the same gang. When we dig a little bit, we can find the 
connections. People will attend a $3,000 a place fundraising dinner 
to have a look at the Prime Minister and have the opportunity to rub 
shoulders with him in the men's room.
<P>
	It is terrible to say, but when you are on the government's side, 
no threat of any kind can rattle you, not even from the auditor 
general. That man was demolished. It is as simple as that. If you do 
not like the message, just shoot the messenger.
<P>
	Not only must laws be implemented in a fair and reasonable way, 
but they must appear to be implemented in a fair and reasonable 
way, just as with justice. We operate under the rule of law, like the 
justice minister said this morning, and the courts established the 
rule of law long ago. Not only must justice be administered, but it 
must appear to have been administered. But appearances do not 
matter in this case. Old chums received a little help, and I would 
not be surprised if not many family trusts were left.
<P>
	A provision that was reasonable and, in a certain way, logical 
was used ill-advisedly, it was used in a way not intended originally. 
It is all a sort of institutionalized misappropriation of funds with 
the wealthy members of society, who make off with the money, the 
next one with his boats, no doubt, it is probably one of the last 
remaining, but an inquiry must be called.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	When the truth is what you want, you do what is necessary to 
obtain it. An independent inquiry, a royal commission if necessary, 
must be called, and independent experts brought in, not those who 
took part in the ruling. The RCMP should be involved, and the bank 
accounts of those who had anything to do with this ruling 
scrutinized closely.
<P>
	When you want to find something, you look for it. In this case, 
they do not want to find anything, and so they are not looking. They 
are saying: ``This is just a bunch  of separatists who have stumbled 
over something. Nothing to worry about. The people of 
Newfoundland, westerners and easterners will never dare to believe 
separatists, so the way is clear. We can have the rink to ourselves 
and do as we please''. That is what is scandalous about this affair, 
and the Liberals can tell me what they like, but it is not going to 
wash. It will not wash. Something stinks in this business and we 
will not let up until we find out what it is.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have just a few words on this motion put forward by the 
Bloc. In looking at this motion, I think it is first, a condemnation of 
the Tories and second, a condemnation of the Bloc itself. I say that 
because what the Bloc is talking about are family trusts.
<P>
	Bloc members are talking about family trusts and trying to 
blame the Liberal government for a report given by the finance 
committee. Where they are wrong is in their accusations against the 
Liberal government. It was the Liberal government that brought in 
the capital gains tax on family trusts. It was the Liberal government 
that brought in the rule that would supposedly close the loophole 
created by forming a trust because a trust does not die. This was the 
problem facing Canada back in 1971. Prior to that, we had the 
inheritance tax in Canada. We had the estate tax in Canada, as in 
the United States today. It also has the capital gains tax.
<P>
	We had the inheritance tax and the estate tax in Canada and along 
came a royal commission that recommended substantial changes, 
the Carter commission, but those recommendations were not 
followed at the time. I wish some of them had been but they were 
not. The Liberal government at that time brought in a capital gains 
tax that would affect family trusts at half the normal taxation rate 
of income.
<P>
	When that was brought in a problem came up, as it always does 
when one changes the law. There were ways around it, especially 
for paying taxes. The way was found around it by putting assets in 
trust so that when somebody died you would not have to pay the 
normal capital gains tax that was imposed by the Government of 
Canada in 1971.
<P>
	At that time the Liberal government, in order to close the 
loophole, said that at the end of 21 years, regardless, the taxes that 
would normally have been paid on the increased value of the assets 
would then become due in 21 years. That was during the Liberal 
administration, to close the loophole of wealthy people being able 
to hire very expensive law firms and accounting firms to get around 
the tax law.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	What happened? For 21 years assets had been put into a trust. On 
January 1, 1972 the new law came into effect and all of a sudden we 
are now in 1992, and guess what?  That money would now be owed 
to the Government of Canada. It was estimated to be in the 
hundreds of millions of dollars.
<P>
	I and other members of the opposition went through access to 
information and we discovered that expensive consultants were 
hired during the Tory regime to try and convince the government to 
lift that 21-year rule that the Liberals brought in, to make 
everybody pay up.
<P>
	In looking at the correspondence to the then ministers of finance 
of the Tory government, you could see that a man who had $100 
million in trust was going to have to pay $11 million in 1992. 
Another man who had $200 million might be liable for $15 million; 
another man with $70 million was going to have to pay $7 million. 
They were pleading with the Tory government: ``Don't let this 
happen. I do not want to have to pay all this money. After all I only 
have $100 million''. It almost made you want to cry. This was in 
letter after letter after letter.
<P>
	Then came the consulting firms. We also received the surveys 
that were done by the consulting firms. I will not mention their 
names because if I do perhaps it will give them more business 
because they were very successful in changing the mind of the 
government of the day.
<P>
	The problem became, what could somebody do with a family 
trust, with this magic 21 years coming up and the taxes having to be 
paid? Could it be rolled over? An anti-avoidance rule was brought 
it. A person had to go before a judge and prove that it was not being 
done to avoid taxes. All of these rules were there to prevent it from 
being done.
<P>
	It is in that setting that we discuss these family trusts. A great 
many of them did not mind paying the taxes. From the documents 
that we received at that time from access to information some were 
quite willing to pay the tax. I recall one gentleman who owed $12 
million writing to the agency that was trying to change the law 
saying: ``I have to pay $12 million but there is no problem''.
<P>
	In 1985 the government of the day made a decision. The 
government has to be held responsible for what bureaucrats do. If 
the Department of Finance and Revenue Canada do something, the 
ministers and the government are held responsible. A decision was 
made.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	In 1991 they moved $2.2 billion in this one instance across the 
border to the United States. If the purpose was to escape the 
21-year rule, which I do not know if it was but I rather suspect it 
was not, they should not have worried at that time. They should not 
have worried because we had a government in power which, as sure 
as you are sitting there, Madam Speaker, was going to change the 
rules so that all of this money would not become due. That is the 
Tory way of doing things.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4773"> 4773 </A></B>
<P>
	The Tories always supported, as the Reform Party does, the very 
wealthy in our society, the people who have loads of money and 
the people who they identify as keeping the economy moving.
<P>
	A change was made. The change I am talking about took place 
on December 23, 1991. A couple of weeks later they actually 
removed the 21-year rule. In other words, all of these family trusts 
were supposed to pay taxes after 21 years. A decision of the 
Government of Canada said that all of this money which would 
have become due after 21 years would not become due until the 
death of the youngest member of the family.
<P>
	That was the Tory government, the same Tory party that is trying 
now to regain power in Canada. They want to become popular 
across the country again, that same Tory party with those same 
Tory principles, the same as the Reform. Some people say the 
Reform Party is worse.
<P>
	The Tory party said: ``All of that money is not going to come due 
now which the Liberals proclaimed''. The Liberals closed the 
loophole. The Trudeau administration brought it in. All taxes that 
are avoided will come due in 21 years. That is why it was called the 
21-year rule.
<P>
	At the last moment the Mulroney administration gave a reprieve. 
They said: ``Oh, no, you won't have to pay up''. At the last minute 
in 1992 they said: ``It's okay. You won't have to pay up because we 
are going to bring in a tax change and we are going to change it so 
that the money will not become due until the death of the youngest 
person in the family''.
<P>
	The Tories were replaced by the Liberals. In the debate before 
the House today the Bloc say it pertains to family trusts. What did 
the Liberals do when they got in? It was the Liberals who closed the 
loophole. Along came the current finance minister and he changed 
the law again. The door that was opened up by the Tories has been 
closed. The Liberals said: ``You won't be able to do that any more. 
We are going to give you a few years until 1999 but at the end of 
that, no more''.
<P>
	The Bloc stands in this Chamber on a motion and criticize the 
Liberals for creating loopholes on family trusts. It was the Liberals 
who closed them. It is this Liberal government and this Minister of 
Finance who have once again closed the family trust loophole.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	The second portion of the motion is an outright condemnation of 
the Bloc. The reason it is a condemnation of the Bloc is because 
that party is supposed to be the official opposition in the House of 
Commons. I am not supposed to be. Liberal backbenchers are not 
supposed to be. We have had, on occasion, to delve into the facts to 
take the place of the official opposition. Why did we have to do 
that?
<P>
	The Bloc's motion talks about condemning the Liberals for 
something which the finance committee  suggested. It condemns 
the Liberals for the tax free transfers of family trusts when it was 
the Liberals that closed all the loopholes. The Bloc is condemning 
the Liberals for what the Tories did and what the Tories would do 
again if they ever got back into power. If the Reform Party got into 
power the same thing would happen.
<P>
	What did the Bloc do? I have gone over the record of that 
political party just to see the way it has treated the transfer of 
hundreds of millions and possibly billions of dollars every year. 
The Bloc claims that the Liberals opened the doors. It is an absolute 
total outrage.
<P>
	What did the Bloc say about the transfer of funds across the 
border into the United States?
<P>
	The Liberals took action on the transfer of $2.2 billion, which 
involved, as the auditor general said, secrecy. There was secrecy in 
Revenue Canada on the rulings. Let us not forget that if the ruling 
in 1985 had become public the tax auditors and the tax lawyers 
would have been on to it and all of a sudden Revenue Canada and 
the Government of Canada would probably have realized they had 
a problem.
<P>
	What did the current minister for Revenue Canada do? First, she 
said that rulings will be made public. What did the finance minister 
do? The finance minister closed the loophole again, just as the 
Liberals had closed it before the Tories opened it up again.
<P>
	We had a response from the finance minister. He is perhaps the 
greatest finance minister in the history of the country. The minister 
for Revenue Canada is doing a fantastic job. They responded in 
concrete ways. Not only that, I understand that there are perhaps 
even further measures going to be taken to ensure that this will not 
happen again.
<P>
	There are two sides to the argument. People talk about the 
transfer of money across borders. It is the thing to talk about these 
days. The borders are opening up. Barriers are being dropped. 
Withholding taxes are disappearing, at least between certain 
nations in the industrialized world. We are into globalization. We 
are into a situation in which multinationals control over half of the 
trade in our world today. What we are doing is removing barriers.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	What did the Bloc members say when the United States received 
what it wanted through the Senate banking committee? What did 
Bloc members say about the announcement on the withholding tax 
on dividends, that is, the payment from subsidiaries to their parent 
companies in the United States and from subsidiaries in the United 
States to their parent companies in Canada-not many of them, 
most of it goes the other way.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4774"> 4774 </A></B>
<P>
	What did Bloc members say when the tax rate was dropped by 
50 per cent, amounting to about $700 million? They said the same 
thing to that as they said to the other proposition that was in the 
same agreement which said that the tax on interest gained would 
be dropped from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. The tax on royalties, 
even copyright royalties would be bifurcated so that they could 
be dealt with individually.
<P>
	What did they say with that great loss of revenue? The Bloc said: 
``It does not specify how many millions and billions of dollars are 
at stake in this protocol. We do not know which country, Canada or 
the United States, will benefit the most from this tax liberalization 
proposal. We do not know, but we support it''.
<P>
	What did Bloc members say when the Americans wanted, and 
we changed, the estate tax relief that was granted to a wealthy 
person in Canada who had property in the United States including 
stocks and bonds through a Canadian bond agency? What did the 
Bloc say when the suggestion was made that a tax credit would be 
given in Canada for somebody if they had a billion dollars worth of 
property in the U.S. and were subjected to the U.S. inheritance tax, 
estate tax?
<P>
	What did they say? I have it here. The Bloc said: ``We are proud 
and happy to participate in this development in supporting this 
Senate proposal because it goes in the direction that we have 
always advocated. The only way to live side by side is to support 
legislation that will make more harmonious relations between the 
two nations''.
<P>
	I will conclude. The Bloc members are frustrated. What are they 
frustrated about? They are frustrated about the popularity of this 
Liberal government. They are frustrated because we are the best 
performing economy in the industrialized world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the member 
for Gander-Grand Falls, as we have come to know him, has often 
shown his support for the most disadvantaged, for the people of his 
riding, of his province. I have the utmost respect for him. His 
commitment to certain fundamental things with regard to social 
programs and unemployment insurance, and the fact that, several 
times, he expressed his disagreement with the government have 
forced him to remain a backbencher within the Liberal Party.
<P>
	I know that an election will be called some time soon. One year 
or maybe less from an election, the member is trying, in the 
presence of his whip and other colleagues who are listening to him, 
to improve his image within the party because he wants to run 
again in the next election, which is perfectly normal.
<P>
	Even though he likes us and often tells us so, why not pick on the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois a little. They have not said all they 
should have said about possible loopholes for rich people.
<P>
	With respect to family trusts, he tells us that the matter will be 
resolved in 1999. We will have other arrangements then. What does 
that say? It tells wealthy families that they have another three years 
to prepare for the forthcoming changes.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	I will tell you that, as in the Pearson deal and many other 
instances, the bad things that the member says came from the 
former Conservative government, where some people benefited 
from certain advantages, are more often than not related to these 
wealthy families. Oddly enough, in these cases, the friends of the 
Conservative Party have become the friends of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	Why is that so? One just has to read the report of the Chief 
Electoral Officer on political party funding. One can see that large 
corporations also contributed to the Liberal Party of Canada's 
funding, equally in most cases. This is less true of the Reform 
Party, which gets 80 per cent of its funding from private 
individuals. In the Bloc Quebecois, our funding comes solely from 
individuals, as is the case for the Parti Quebecois.
<P>
	Would the member, who supports the have-nots, who seeks 
political correctness, be in favour of correcting the impression of 
inequity in this whole issue? That is what the Bloc is asking for. 
Frankly, I ask the member if he can blame us for supporting the 
Auditor General of Canada when he says that there is a need to shed 
some light on what has happened and to inform the public.
<P>
	How can he blame us for wanting to shed some light on 
something very obscure? If nothing is found, then so be it. At least 
the public will be reassured, as well as the 100,000 people that the 
Government of Canada is suing for unemployment insurance fraud 
in the amount of $100 or $200. Of course, the member for 
Gander-Grand Falls is not saying a word about that one year away 
from an election. Last year, he was talking about it. Why is he not 
talking about it this year? Is he so eager to improve his image 
within the Liberal Party? In that case, he will lose my respect.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Madam Speaker, the Bloc members at times, very 
rarely but at times, do show some indication that perhaps they want 
to make the government accountable, something other than their 
trying to figure out a way to break the country up. There are rare 
occasions.
<P>
	That is why I bring to the attention of the hon. member, to the 
attention of the House, to the attention of the Speaker, and through 
the Speaker to the people of Canada that this official opposition 
really does not belong in the situation we are in. They stand up
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4775"> 4775 </A></B>
<P>
here today and talk about tax changes and blame the Liberals, when 
it was the Tories who did it and would do it again if they ever got in 
office.
<P>
	Then the hon. member does not like it. He does not like it 
because what I have taken out of <I>Hansard</I> is something which I 
could never understand but I do know why they did it. That is how 
the official opposition could turn around and approve and support it 
and say: ``Bring it on. We love it. It is just as good as sliced bread''. 
Massive tax changes that they were supposed to be objecting to.
<P>
	They supported the very thing today they blame the Liberals for, 
for more flows of capital into the United States. They asked for 
more. Why? They asked for more because during the debate in the 
House where I took these quotations from they said that they were 
preparing for separation. Therefore they would like to have lots of 
ways of getting capital into the United States because they want to 
deal directly with the United States. That was the logic used. 
According to that logic they are not fulfilling their duties as the 
official opposition.
<P>
	What the Bloc members are scratching about now is when they 
realized the Government of Canada has been so fantastic as to lead 
the industrialized world in economic growth, the member 
complains about contributions to the Liberal Party. The official 
figures show that Canada leads Italy, France, the U.K., Germany, 
Japan and the United States and stands all alone in economic 
growth for next year. At that rate one would expect the 
contributions to increase.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I heard the most eloquent discourse of our 
colleague from Gander-Grand Falls.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Give him a good rating.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> It is hard to give anything else but a good rating to 
such a fine speech, and I thank my colleague across the way for 
bringing that up.
<P>
	My colleague referred to the growth of Canada during recent 
times and the forecasted growth for next year. I wonder if he is 
aware that Canada's forecasted growth for next year in terms of 
employment is such that it is predicted it will exceed all the 
European G-7 nations put together. Is he aware of that? Is that not 
in itself testimony to the kind of leadership that has been given to 
this country by the hon. Minister of Finance?
<P>
	There is an excellent proposition I want to bring to his attention. 
Next year Canada will have the lowest deficit to GDP ratio of any 
G-7 nation.
<P>
	In terms of net cash requirements, there will not be any net cash 
requirements next year. We will not be borrowing any funds from 
abroad. We are in this enviable position thanks to the fine 
leadership of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to add one thing to the 
excellent dissertation that was just given.
<P>
	As the hon. member is aware, those estimates were not made by 
the Fraser Institute or the Canadian association of accountants or 
any Canadian organization. All of those estimates the hon. 
gentleman just gave were made in Paris. Who made them? 
Economists representing 27 nations in the world, the OECD. 
Twenty-seven of the nations in the developed world whose job it is 
to sit down and to realize the economic growth in the world and to 
promote those excellent standards and lo and behold Canada leads 
all the rest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this debate. I was 
anticipating such an opportunity but I did not know it would come 
so quickly. I want to share my time with the hon. member for 
Gatineau-La Lièvre.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have been hearing today that the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois want to denounce the government for all sorts of reasons 
that they have been telling us about. At the same time, in their 
speeches, the members of the Bloc Quebecois and also those of the 
Reform Party, the members of the opposition, have pulled out all 
the stops in a vain attempt to show that the government did not, in 
their view, act properly with respect to family trusts.
<P>
	Nothing could be further from the truth. First, the member for 
Gander-Grand Falls gave a very good overview of the issue just 
now in his most excellent speech. Furthermore, it must be recalled 
that the question is not about family trusts, but about exporting 
assets when a Canadian decides to move out of the country. This is 
where the problem arises.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	It is the same problem, albeit with different amounts, whether we 
are talking about a Canadian who suddenly decides to move from 
Montreal to Boston, a so-called ordinary Canadian, or a wealthy 
individual who leaves a large Canadian city with all his assets, his 
millions and so on.
<P>
	It is also important to remember that the controversy that has 
apparently shocked the member across the way, a former organizer 
for the Conservative Party, if memory serves-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Me? Never in my life.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The action that has so shaken the hon. members 
across the way took place in 1991, when Mr. Mulroney was Prime 
Minister of Canada. As the member for Gander-Grand Falls has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4776"> 4776 </A></B>
<P>
pointed out, the Canadian  finance minister has done everything 
required, in order to plug this sort of loophole in future.
<P>
	Second, we have heard about the moratorium announced by the 
revenue minister. Third, we have also heard that in future this sort 
of ruling will be made public.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore we have seen that the government has been vigilant, 
notwithstanding the attempts of members across the way to 
demonstrate otherwise.
<P>
	What we should note is that the auditor general did not say that 
the present Government of Canada had done anything wrong. He 
made no suggestion at any time to that effect. That has not been 
said by the members across the way. However, I think some 
members across have adopted the strategy that if enough mud is 
sent toward the government some of it is bound to stick and the 
objective will be achieved.
<P>
	Maybe some of that is true, although I think it is holding 
Canadians in rather low esteem to try to use this strategy, but by 
and large it is not true and Canadians will see what those people 
across the way are up to.
<P>
	There is also another interesting proposition when we are talking 
about money leaving Canada and going elsewhere. We all recall 
during the referendum of last year when the separatist provincial 
Government of Quebec attempted at the time to speculate on its 
own loss using provincial taxpayer money. In other words, what the 
government did at the time was it bought huge amounts of 
Canadian dollars and then resold them later, making money in the 
process and participating in an exercise that could be best described 
as betting on its own loss.
<P>
	That was a rather strange thing for a separatist government to do. 
In other words, it went at it this way: ``We will surely lose so let us 
participate in this exercise and rake in the profit that will be created 
by moving money across the Canada-U.S. border in two different 
ways and in a very short period of time''. That was the exercise in 
which that government participated. In the flurry of activity that 
occurred at that time not much was said about it, but the fact still 
remains that it is true.
<P>
	I have in front of me the Nesbitt Burns ``Economic Research 
Provincial Handbook'' produced by David Rosenberg, senior 
economist for Nesbitt Burns, dated September 1996, in which he 
describes the economic outlook of Canadian provinces. This is not 
designed to be a commercial in any way, but I really recommend 
this book to all colleagues because it is, after all, not published by 
the government. It is produced by an organization in the financial 
area and presumably when things do not go the way of the financial 
community it does not take too long to remind Canadians of its 
thoughts.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	Here is what I read from the general overview. I will get into 
some of the provincial summaries a little later. In this document it 
states, from page 3, which refers to the economic growth of 
Canada:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Growth should be more conducive to an improved fiscal performance in both 
1996 and 1997. The real GDP is expected to advance 2.9 per cent next year after this 
year's 1.8 per cent uptick, marking the second strongest gain this decade. Alberta 
will retain its growth leading status of the past five years, with 2.5 per cent growth 
this year, and 3.5 per cent next, while strong population gains should keep B.C. a 
close second at roughly 3.2 per cent in 1997.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It goes on to describe the Canadian growth that will occur and it 
complements the position that Canada is in. It is clear from this 
document that we are into some major growth over the next few 
years. I look at my own province of Ontario:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ontario's auto production and exports are on track for another record 
year-which will likely be surpassed in 1997-as assembly capacity is in the process 
of being dramatically enhanced. Parts makers and assemblers already invested more 
than $13 bln in new plants and machinery during the first half of the 1990s, and 
more investment is on the way. The new $300 million Honda minivan plant in 
Alliston, now under construction with production to commence in the fall of 1998, 
will have an annual capacity of 100,000 vehicles. Toyota is spending $600 mln to 
expand its Corolla production and its Cambridge facility. Chrysler is consolidating 
its entire North American production of LH line at its Bramalea plant, in conjunction 
with a $500 mln overhaul of its operations as the firm gears up to build the new line 
of mid-size sedans for the 1998 model year.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It goes on to describe the great things that are occurring in this 
country everywhere. The unemployment situation is stated in the 
document. Of course we know about the 669,000 new jobs created 
by the government since we came to office. It also mentions the 
major gains in the area of reducing unemployment next year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So, you see that the affairs of state are being well managed by 
this government, that the Minister of Finance, the Minister of 
National Revenue, the Prime Minister, and the whole cabinet, are 
doing an excellent job of managing the country's assets. Members 
may try to persuade the people of Canada to think otherwise, but, as 
usual, they are mistaken.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would never 
be ashamed to admit to having been a Conservative Party organizer 
if I had been, but that is not the case and I would just like to 
reassure the government whip. I just wanted to clarify that. 
Moreover, I was a Nationalist Party candidate in Quebec in 1984.
<P>
	The government whip then goes on to say that I was too critical, 
that the Bloc Mps have been too critical. Here we have one of the 
four ratpack members, the one  whom, when they were in 
opposition, the media labelled as the most aggressive, almost 
harassing, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4777"> 4777 </A></B>
<P>
member of the bunch. In fact he ran after ministers, even trying to 
break up their press conferences and other such antics.
<P>
	Now he takes a holier-than-thou tone, speaks quietly, no 
aggression. He is the House whip now, and adopts this manner 
because he would like to cool down the emotions of the hon. 
member for Lévis.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	This is the same hon. member who is heavily involved just now 
in collecting money for the poor souls accused by the director of 
elections for Quebec. They have been told that they spent money 
they ought not to have during the Quebec referendum last year. He 
is assuming that attitude, perhaps, to attract the sympathy of 
Quebecers, but they will not forget that.
<P>
	Now, not knowing what more to say on the matter-he is 
probably tired, and has every reason to be-he starts to read a 
report that has nothing at all to do with today's question on 
economic growth. But let us talk about economic growth.
<P>
	I have had the time to read another report, one that could well 
have worried the hon. member for Newfoundland just now, one 
which tends to show that investments are not very high in Quebec, 
among other things. Some say that the share of investments in 
Canada is only in the 11 or 12 per cent range, from its previous 
level of 17 per cent. This report indicates that 59 per cent of private 
investments are made in Ontario, his province.
<P>
	The people in the other provinces ought to be really worried 
about this, since it means that all of the efforts of this government 
on the economic level are probably linked to the number of Liberal 
MPs in the province. In Ontario, practically all members are 
Liberals, so it flaunts the fact but does so discreetly so the other 
provinces will not notice. We all know this government has a very 
soft spot for Ontario.
<P>
	I am from the riding of Lévis. When defence contracts are 
announced, MIL Davie is asked to tender its bid against another 
shipyard, but recently, when it was time to order army tanks, there 
was no call for tenders and the contract was awarded directly. 
People in other provinces have the right to hear about that.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, whatever members opposite may think 
about it, is the official opposition, and as such we condemn the 
treatment of family trusts. We did so during the last election 
campaign. We did not wait for the auditor general's report. We said 
this should be investigated.
<P>
	At the very beginning, when the auditor general expressed its 
concerns about $2 billion that were transferred to the United States, 
all we asked is that the government shed some light on the 
question. The government whip can say anything he likes, but we 
in the  Bloc Quebecois intend to keep insisting that this government 
<P>
do everything that is necessary to clarify the situation around the 
transfer of $2 billion and that it take all necessary steps to ensure 
this does not happen again. We will not give up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I duly noted the accusations 
made by the hon. member across the way, who is condemning me 
for daring, with other Canadians, of course, to assist those who 
helped keep our country together last year. Last week, Bloc 
members accused us in this House of violating Quebec laws. The 
Bloc found us guilty even before the trial had started.
<P>
	I see the hon. member for Saint-Hubert across the way. I think 
that, as a legal expert, she should talk to her colleagues and teach 
them that one is generally innocent until proven guilty, especially 
before the trial. The judge has not ruled yet, he has not even heard 
the case, but they have already found these people guilty.
<P>
	I am not about to apologize for defending Canadians. This 
concert will be held on October 27 here in Ottawa; Canadians can 
all get tickets by calling Ticketmaster at 755-1111.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It being 6.13 
p.m., it is my duty to inform the House that proceedings on the 
motion have expired.
<P>
	The House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NEGOTIATIONTERMSOFSEPARATIONACT">NEGOTIATION TERMS OF SEPARATION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-230, an act to provide for a national referendum to authorize 
the government to negotiate terms of separation with a province 
that has voted for separation from Canada, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise in 
support of my private member's bill, Bill C-230, which is entitled 
an act to provide for a national referendum to authorize the 
government to negotiate terms of separation with a province that 
has voted for separation from Canada.
<P>
	Repeatedly we have seen severe impacts right across Canada 
when the Government of Quebec has decided to ask Quebecers to 
vote to leave Canada. The possibility of such a separation has 
brought severe repercussions for its own province and all the 
people of Canada, including both short term and long term impacts 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4778"> 4778 </A></B>
<P>
on investment, from housing prices to business and industry, on the 
value of our dollar, on the rate of interest which must be  paid to 
induce people to invest here and on the sense of personal comfort 
and well-being of our people. Even the threat of Quebec separation 
has been like blackmail hanging over our heads.
<P>
	However, I want to make clear from the beginning of my 
comments today that I have had this legislation drawn up not to 
encourage Quebec to leave Canada but instead to promote 
discussion and eventual agreement on the ground rules for such a 
secession in order to prevent repeated referendums and the chaos 
which surrounds them. We must avoid the bad effects for our entire 
nation if a separatist government in Quebec again tries to pull the 
wool over people's eyes about the true meaning and full 
consequences of what a vote to separate from Canada will mean.
<P>
	I know from many discussions with people outside Quebec that 
such separation will not be quick, it will not be simple and it will 
not be easy. Perhaps most important, such a separation will not lead 
to increased economic well-being for the people of a foreign 
country called Quebec nor for Canada.
<P>
	For example, the North American free trade agreement was 
originally negotiated with a strong Canada. How would a foreign 
country called Quebec and a weakened Canada fare against U.S. 
negotiators in an entirely new round of NAFTA bargaining which 
would be required if Quebec separates?
<P>
	To look at just one aspect, what would happen to the current 
Quebec dairy quota if Quebec decided to become a foreign 
country? No longer a part of a great nation, which despite our 
lingering internal trade barriers, today is a great economic union. 
Once the people of Quebec are given the true facts about what 
separation from Canada would mean, it is extremely unlikely they 
would decide to leave. Nevertheless it just may happen although 
passing Bill C-230 would help to prevent that.
<P>
	The government has done virtually nothing to prevent it. By 
contrast, as an example of a prudent government response, 
yesterday United States congressman Tom Campbell, a Republican 
from California, had a U.S. congressional subcommittee hear 
testimony from academics about the possible consequences for the 
United States if Quebec separated from Canada.
<P>
	Mr. Campbell's researchers emphasized this morning that their 
witnesses confirmed that an entirely new NAFTA would be 
required if Quebec separated from Canada.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	Other international consequences would be its affect on NATO, 
the UN, the St. Lawrence Seaway and American purchasers of 
Canadian and Quebec debt. How ironic that the Government of 
Canada by contrast with the U.S. Congress has chosen instead of 
preparing people to bury its head in the sand and has neglected to 
bring forward legislation on this critical bill. Even debate on  this 
private member's bill has been limited to one single hour today.
<P>
	However, the topic has met better fate at the hands of many 
serious thinkers across Canada since I introduced Bill C-230 on 
March 8 of this year.
<P>
	This summer the C.D. Howe Institute released a commentary 
entitled ``Coming To Terms With Plan B, 10 Principles Governing 
Secession''. It began with the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The silence of the federal government during two Quebec referendums has left 
the Parti Quebecois free to describe how it would achieve secession. Maintaining the 
silence is irresponsible and will lead to chaos if Quebec tries to declare independence 
unilaterally.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I also find it ironic that the Quebec premier has repeatedly 
indicated that he believes neither the courts nor the law of Canada 
should be applied with regard to the possibility of a unilateral 
declaration of independence by his province.
<P>
	He is only too willing to use the law and the courts as his defence 
with regard to the Churchill Falls contract with his neighbouring 
province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Obviously the Quebec 
premier has chosen to cherry pick which laws he will respect and 
which laws he will ignore.
<P>
	Most Canadians respect the law and at this time there is no 
Canadian law which would allow the province of Quebec to 
separate legally. As the C.D. Howe commentary points out, the 
lack of such channels within the Constitution:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-is a case for deep concern. Canada is a democracy whose ultimate legal and 
political foundation is the consent of Canadians to be governed under the Canadian 
Constitution and Canadian law. If a significantly large and determined majority of 
Canadians in a particular province withhold that consent then the absence of 
appropriate legal wording to achieve secession will not prevent them from realizing 
their goal. Thus, the absence of an agreed upon procedure to govern secession will 
lead to confusion and conflict over the legitimacy of any proposed secession.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Clearly Quebecers have a big stake in ensuring that a vote to 
secede is regarded as legitimate. Otherwise consequences could be 
disastrous. The best way to avoid confusion and conflict would be 
to accommodate the legitimate needs and aspirations of the 
province of Quebec within Canada. That does not mean giving into 
blackmail which says do what we want or we will leave.
<P>
	On behalf of the people of my own riding of 
Okanagan-Shuswap I want to emphasize that we want Quebec to 
remain in Canada as one of 10 equal provinces whose citizens are 
equal before the law. The people of Okanagan-Shuswap respect 
the fact that Quebec is different from us in many ways. However, 
we totally reject the idea that Quebec should be offered any kind of 
powers or status greater than what is offered to every other 
province of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4779"> 4779 </A></B>
<P>
	If the people of Quebec reject the idea of remaining within the 
revitalized Canadian federation, the break up will cost all of us 
a great deal of pain.
<P>
	One way to lessen that pain would be to pass a law like Bill 
C-230 so that a majority of Canadians agree in advance on the 
ground rules for negotiation with regard to separation. Also trying 
to avoid Quebec separation the Reform Party has released a 
position paper called ``20/20'' which presents many ways that all 
provinces would be given greater powers simply by administrative 
decision with no need whatsoever to reopen the Constitution.
<P>
	However, in the event that such changes either are not made or 
do not satisfy the people of Quebec, it is our responsibility as the 
Parliament of Canada to have legislation in place which will serve 
as the ground rules for how a legal separation could be 
accomplished and that will clearly tell Quebec voters what a vote to 
separate will mean.
<P>
	Personally I believe that the law must respect the will of the 
people.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	I firmly believe that my fellow Canadians would be willing to 
look for a way to allow the people of the province of Quebec to go 
their own way, if in fact it could be clearly demonstrated that it was 
the will of the majority of the people of Quebec to become a 
foreign state; to give up their Canadian citizenship and their 
Canadian passports; to lose their unrestricted right to enter, travel 
and work in Canada; and, to lose their right to send some of their 
brightest and best people to Ottawa to represent them in the 
Parliament of Canada and in many of the highest ranking positions 
in the Public Service of Canada.
<P>
	What has been done so far? Due to the lack of foresight of this 
government, there is not even a subcommittee of either this House 
or the Senate currently discussing this critical issue.
<P>
	Regarding this lack of foresight, after examining the 
international experience, the C.D. Howe Institute basically said 
that advance planning in the event of secession could avoid 
violence and hardship later by establishing a consensus on the 
terms.
<P>
	To promote such a consensus by encouraging debate I draw 
members' attention to Bill C-230 itself. It begins with a preamble, 
which states that the principles should exist in law to determine 
whether a vote to separate is a legitimate expression of the wishes 
of the people and that the provincial electoral districts where there 
is not the majority vote to separate must have their wishes 
respected equally with districts where the majority of the people 
vote to separate.
<P>
	Simply stated, if Canada can be divided because of the will of 
the people, then Quebec can be divided because of the will of the 
people.
<P>
	Pundits have urged that Cree and other aboriginal people whose 
traditional lands lie within Quebec have a fiduciary relationship 
with the Government of Canada which could only be ended with 
their consent.
<P>
	Personally, I believe no political unit should be forced to leave 
Canada against its will whether aboriginals or simply strong 
federalists. Their decision to remain in Canada must be every bit as 
binding on the Government of Quebec as the legitimate Quebec 
vote to leave Canada should be binding on Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-230 spells out how I believe we could be sure that a 
separation vote was legitimate. Of course, a serious problem with 
my beliefs is that I cannot tell the separatists in Quebec what to do. 
However, this Parliament not only can but must tell the 
Government of Canada what to do.
<P>
	If Bill C-230 were passed into law, it would say that unless 
certain conditions are met, the Government of Canada cannot 
negotiate separation. It would tell the Government of Canada that it 
must hold a binding national referendum within one year if elected 
parliamentarians agree that a fair vote was held in the province 
wanting to separate. Note that while I include an elected Senate, an 
appointed Senate is excluded because it represents only political 
patronage and not the will of the people of Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-230 says that we must have a national referendum but 
only if Parliament agrees that the provincial vote to leave Canada 
was conducted according to the conditions set out on pages 3 and 4 
of this legislation.
<P>
	Some details about the process would include: full and fair 
advanced advertising and printing on every ballot that a vote to 
separate means a vote to become a separate state, foreign to 
Canada; cease to be a province of Canada; cease to have 
representation in the Senate and in the House of Commons; lose the 
right to be citizens of Canada; lose the right to hold a Canadian 
passport; and lose the right to unrestricted entry and travel within 
Canada and the unrestricted right to work in Canada.
<P>
	They must also notify provincial voters that the Government of 
Canada cannot negotiate separation of any electoral district in 
which a majority of at least 50 per cent of the votes cast, plus one 
vote, are against separation from Canada; nor could provincial 
electoral boundaries have been changed so that the number of 
native people or non-francophone people was significantly altered 
from the preceding election.
<P>
	This House and an elected Senate would have to agree by a free 
vote, that is, a vote in which the party whips told their members 
they are free to vote their conscience.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4780"> 4780 </A></B>
<P>
	I have included many provisions in Bill C-230 to ensure that 
this issue is decided with the maximum respect for the wishes of 
the people. The ultimate respect for the wishes of the Canadian 
people will be shown by referring this entire issue to their final 
judgment by means of a binding national referendum.
<P>
	After all, it is their country being carved up. They feel just as 
strongly about it as some Quebecers do about the partition of 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1830 )</B>
<P>
	According to Bill C-230, the question to be put before the people 
no later than one year after a legitimate provincial vote to separate 
should be as follows: ``Do you agree that the Government of 
Canada may negotiate terms of separation between Canada 
and-?'' The name of the province would be inserted here.
<P>
	Once again the nationwide ballots would have to repeat that 
electoral districts which did not vote to separate would not be 
included in the separation. This would help keep separation within 
the realm of politics and promote a peaceful resolution rather than 
the wars and/or major civil disobedience likely to follow if, for 
example, Quebec tries to force primarily English speaking sections 
in and around the city of Montreal as well as the aboriginal peoples 
mostly living in northern Quebec in the region known as Ungava to 
leave Canada against their will.
<P>
	Many people have argued that the Ungava region was only given 
to the province of Quebec to administer on behalf of Canada and 
that Ungava certainly did not form part of the province at the time 
Quebec joined Confederation. They say, therefore, that it must not 
be included in a foreign country called Quebec. I prefer that the 
issue be settled by vote and not by academics arguing.
<P>
	Finally, Bill C-230 would allow elected representatives of the 
people of Canada to include additional questions in this binding 
national referendum, for example a formula for dividing the 
national debt.
<P>
	During the last referendum we came very close to losing this 
country. I have had to sit here in the House many times and listen to 
the government on the other side, which buried its head and said 
that everything was fine, talk about us as Reform members not 
doing anything with regard to that situation. It knew full well that it 
begged and pleaded with us not to interfere because it had the 
situation under control in the province of Quebec and we would 
only get in the way and hinder the process.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I have to admit, I along with many other 
colleagues fell into the trap that the Liberals laid for us in the 
House and we believed them. Look what almost happened. They 
now use that against Reform whenever they feel like it. They are 
forgetting quite  conveniently how they pleaded with us to let them 
please handle it and it would be brought under control. Shame.
<P>
	In conclusion, I repeat that the federal government should take 
reasonable actions to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the 
people of Quebec within Canada. However, if Quebec still votes to 
leave it is essential to pass legislation like Bill C-230 to make the 
separation process as orderly as possible.
<P>
	I would now like to ask for unanimous consent from the House to 
make this bill votable.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Do we have 
unanimous consent of the House to have Bill C-230 a votable bill?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, Bill C-230 
tabled by the member for Okanagan-Shuswap is aimed at giving 
Canadians the impression that the Reform Party has a serious, 
carefully thought out plan for preserving national unity.
<P>
	While our government is pursuing a positive strategy of 
renewing the federation and giving all Canadians hope for the 
future, the third party is telling Canadians to throw in the towel, to 
launch themselves into a negotiation process in the wake of a 
referendum that has not and may not take place.
<P>
	This demonstrates yet again that the Reform Party does not have 
a real strategy for national unity. To put it simply, it has no vision 
for national unity and no vision for the country. The third party has 
patched together a series of third rate ideas and calls it a plan.
<P>
	At a certain level I think I understand why this bill is being 
brought forward today. My hon. colleague, like many Canadians, 
was shaken by the last referendum. He is trying to respond to the 
concerns of Canadians but has chosen a misguided approach.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our government's strategy is, above all, to deal with the real 
issues concerning all Canadians: economic growth, job creation, 
maximum government efficiency, as well as the protection of our 
social programs and our environment. But the federal government 
is also committed to providing certainty and legal clarification 
regarding the issues arising from Quebec's possible secession.
<P>
	Earlier this year, we became involved in a case submitted to the 
Superior Court of Quebec by Guy Bertrand. We were forced to do 
so partly because of the Quebec government's position in this case. 
That government claims that the issues related to Quebec's 
secession do not come under the jurisdiction of the  courts, that 
they have nothing to do with Canada's laws or Constitution, and 
that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4781"> 4781 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec can unilaterally determine how it will secede without 
taking Canada's Constitution or its judicial system into account.
<P>
	Given the Quebec government's position and Judge Pidgeon's 
ruling, our government announced that it would refer to the 
Supreme Court the basic issues raised by the Pidgeon ruling.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Under that procedure the federal government is submitting to the 
supreme court questions of law and fact that it deems important for 
the court to hear and consider. We made this decision because the 
federal government owes an obligation to all Canadians to provide 
social, economic and legal stability. This obligation requires the 
federal government to provide certainty and legal clarification 
regarding the issues surrounding Quebec's possible secession.
<P>
	Now is the time in this period of relative calm, with a future 
referendum not immediately looming, to seek judicial clarification 
of these issues.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By referring these issues, we are asking the Supreme Court to 
establish a legal framework and a common understanding that will 
allow us to address certain fundamental issues surrounding 
Quebec's secession.
<P>
	Our decision to use this approach at this time does not in any 
way bring into question the right of Quebecers to express their 
views on their own future through an advisory referendum. We are 
appalled by the Quebec government's decision to place itself above 
the law and outside the jurisdiction of Canadian courts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As for the result of the reference, the most important outcome 
will be that we finally have some certainty on the fundamental 
legal issues arising from the Quebec government's plan for 
secession. Nevertheless, the Government of Canada is pursuing its 
commitment to renew the federation through a wide range of 
constructive, well thought out initiatives.
<P>
	In the February speech from the throne, our government 
indicated its willingness to withdraw from areas such as labour 
market training, forestry and mining development, social housing 
and recreation. Further progress was made during the constructive 
discussions and the first ministers meeting in June. This work is 
ongoing and we are on track with our plan.
<P>
	At the first ministers meeting it was agreed that our government 
would continue to work with the provinces in the coming months, 
building on the work of the ministerial council on social policy 
reform and renewal to develop a new partnership for securing and 
modernizing the social union.
<P>
	In the weeks following the first ministers meeting the federal 
and British Columbia governments agreed to a full bilateral review 
of the responsibilities and roles of the federal and provincial 
governments in the management of the Pacific salmon fishery.
<P>
	These are the types of measures that build goodwill, measures 
brought about through partnerships based on mutual respect and 
the desire to enter the 21st century as a renewed, united federation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These measures may not be flamboyant enough for my colleague 
across the way, but they show that the Canadian federation is 
flexible and benefits all its partners.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	We are proving that Canada works and that separation is not a 
solution. We are proving that another choice is available, namely 
the renewal of our federation, and that it is a best choice. Polls 
show that most Quebecers favour this option. I would therefore 
urge the third party to support this option.
<P>
	This is the kind of positive attitude we need, in Canada, to see us 
into the 21st century, all the while remaining united. This is the 
attitude we, in the Liberal government, have. We do not sink into 
negativity; we are not afraid to take positive measures.
<P>
	We want to unite Canadians, not divide them. We are also 
resolutely committed to a national reconciliation process.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are putting in place initiatives that will lead to greater 
co-operation among governments and will reinforce the economic 
union and social fabric of this country. We are taking a step by step 
approach to bring about real practical changes. In so doing we are 
demonstrating the flexibility of the federation and undermining the 
myths that build support for separatism. This is how we will 
achieve national reconciliation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Premier of Quebec himself, Lucien Bouchard, has realized 
that he had better set his separatist designs aside and focus on 
concerns regarded as priorities by Quebecers: the economy, job 
creation and putting the fiscal house in order.
<P>
	According to a Gallup poll released earlier this month, no fewer 
than 45 per cent of employed Quebecers are afraid to lose their 
jobs. That is the kind of concern that must be looked into and that 
we, in our government and our party, are presently looking into.
<P>
	Quebecers want their government to take part in the discussions 
with the federal government and the other provinces, so that the 
interests of Quebec are represented.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4782"> 4782 </A></B>
<P>
	They want change, of course, but change within Canada. That 
is the message they conveyed in the October referendum and this 
government, our party, is in the process of acting of on this 
message.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The bill proposed by the hon. member for Okanagan-Shuswap 
does not respond to this message, nor does it correspond to the 
wishes of Quebecers and other Canadians who are asking their 
politicians to work together constructively to renew the federation, 
promote economic growth and work toward creating a climate 
suitable for job creation.
<P>
	It is a far cry from the measured approach our government is 
taking to clarify issues and allow for a constructive dialogue to take 
place well in advance of a future referendum. The leader of the 
third party may believe he has 20-20 vision on national unity issues 
but this bill shows he has a big blind spot.
<P>
	For these reasons I cannot support Bill C-230.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
Bill C-230 introduced by the member for Okanagan-Shuswap is 
entitled An Act to provide for a national referendum to authorize 
the government to negotiate terms of separation with a province 
that has voted for separation from Canada. It proposes rules which 
would apply to a referendum on the separation of a province from 
the rest of Canada.
<P>
	In spite of its neutral wording, it is obvious that this bill 
primarily seeks to impose on the province of Quebec rules for its 
next referendum on sovereignty.
<P>
	What the member for Okanagan-Shuswap proposes is 
strangely similar to the secession act passed in 1990 by the Soviet 
regime, in the former USSR. I will remind the member of certain 
facts regarding the passing of this act. Unlike Canada's 
constitution, the constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialists 
Republic included a clause granting republics the right to freely 
separate from the USSR, without any procedures or conditions.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	At the beginning of the nineties, following the crumbling of the 
Gorbachev regime and of the Berlin wall, some sovereignist parties 
took office in certain republics. Given this situation, president 
Gorbachev quickly had the Soviet government pass an act on 
secession.
<P>
	The act, which was passed in April 1990, set the conditions for 
separation. In fact, it sought to make it impossible to exercise this 
right by the means proposed in Bill C-230. For example, the Soviet 
legislation defined the referendum procedure to be used by the 
republics, including the type of initiative allowed, the voting 
procedure and the number of ballots required for the decision to be 
valid.
<P>
	The bill proposed by the member for Okanagan-Shuswap gives 
the House of Commons and the Senate the right to rule on the 
eligibility of the question and its wording, should the yes side win.
<P>
	Indeed, should the yes side win, the Senate and the House of 
Commons will determine whether the question that was put was a 
simple and direct question; whether an affirmative vote was cast by 
a majority of at least fifty per cent plus one; whether the 
referendum was held in compliance with the laws of the separating 
province and whether its results were recorded on the basis of the 
electoral districts of the province; whether notice of the referendum 
appeared in the <I>Canada Gazette</I> and in at least one major 
newspaper in each riding of the province which, of course, means 
Quebec; whether the effect of a vote in favour of separation was 
clearly stated on the ballot including: the fact that the province will 
become a separate state, foreign to Canada; that it will cease to be a 
province of Canada; that it will cease to have representation in the 
Senate and House of Commons; that its residents will lose the right 
to be citizens of Canada; that they will lose the right to hold a 
Canadian passport; and, finally, that they will lose the right to 
unrestricted entry to and travel within Canada, and the unrestricted 
right to work in Canada.
<P>
	By granting the House of Commons and the Senate the right to 
review the holding of a referendum, the bill proposed by the 
member for Okanagan-Shuswap gives the two houses a veto over 
a province seeking to achieve sovereignty. Indeed, this bill 
provides that the conditions I just listed can only be met if the 
House of Commons and the Senate render a favourable decision.
<P>
	In the current context, it would be surprising, to say the least, to 
expect members of this House and the other place to make an 
objective decision. In addition, the bill gives the House of 
Commons and the Senate the authority to refer to the Supreme 
Court any question relating to the holding of a separation 
referendum.
<P>
	In point of fact, this bill allows the process whereby a province 
wishes to become independent to be defined by the courts. Should 
the will of a people to decide on its own destiny be relegated to 
questions of a legal nature?
<P>
	The referral to the Supreme Court must please the Minister of 
Justice, since he confirmed only today that he intends to seek the 
opinion of the Supreme Court by submitting to it, by way of a 
constitutional reference, the question of the legality of Quebec's 
sovereignty. In fact, any legal strategy intended to thwart the will 
of a people must be eclipsed by the freedom of that people to 
democratically decide on its political future.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	Nonetheless, once the Senate and the House of Commons have 
determined that the sovereignty referendum is valid, the Governor 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4783"> 4783 </A></B>
<P>
in Council shall hold a  Canada-wide referendum that is binding on 
the Government of Canada within one year.
<P>
	The question in this Canada-wide referendum will be whether or 
not the people of Canada authorize the federal government to 
negotiate the terms of separation of the province wishing to secede. 
The legislation on secession passed by the Supreme Soviet of the 
former USSR that I mentioned a little earlier provided for the same 
consultation mechanism.
<P>
	In the event that a republic voted in favour of sovereignty, this 
legislation required the results to be submitted to all the other 
republics in the Union. Like Bill C-230, the Soviet legislation on 
secession also made provision for the right of partition of certain 
groups within the Republic. These groups were literally given the 
right to secede from another group that was seceding.
<P>
	The right to self-determination is an attribute of peoples and of 
nations. Quebec being a nation within the Canadian federation, it 
follows that, should it become sovereign, its borders would be 
guaranteed against any challenge by Canada, the corollary of this 
right to independence being the respect of the territory associated 
with this people or this nation.
<P>
	It is illogical to say that a riding within the province could take 
advantage of that right, just as francophone populations outside 
Quebec could not demand to be linked back to Quebec.
<P>
	Finally, we all know what happened to president Gorbachev's 
plan; the independentist republics simply ignored it. Let us be 
straight with ourselves, however: Canada cannot be compared to 
the former USSR of 1990. The mere fact that Bill C-230 is oddly 
inspired by such an authoritarian model does, however, give one 
pause, even though this trend is not a great surprise to anyone.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has always defended the principle of 
sovereignty of the provinces and their respective legislatures on 
their own territory. Provincial governments, being the elected 
representatives of the population, have the authority to achieve 
sovereignty, provided they receive a democratic mandate from 
their population to do so.
<P>
	As I said a while ago, this bill is aimed primarily at Quebec. 
Should there be another referendum in Quebec, the bill is aimed at 
not only submitting the provincial government to the authority of 
the federal government, but also at preventing Quebec from 
exercising its right to sovereignty. The Bloc Quebecois has always 
been opposed to any move by the federal government to hamstring 
the Government of Quebec by dictating the conditions for access to 
sovereignty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, Bill C-230, introduced today by the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Shuswap, would provide for a national referendum to 
authorize the government to negotiate terms of separation with a 
province that has voted for separation from Canada.
<P>
	It is the second time within only a few months that the Reform 
Party has proposed a debate on a variation on the same theme. It is 
clear that by introducing this bill, the third party favours 
confrontation over national reconciliation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Whereas the government is working to improve the federation so 
that it better responds to the real concerns of Canadians, the 
Reform Party seems to be interested only in the hypothetical 
scenario of secession. That being said, the practical constructive 
approach the federal government is focusing on to renew the 
federation does not prevent the government from understanding 
and sharing some of the concerns expressed today by the member 
for Okanagan-Shuswap.
<P>
	I probably do not need to remind the member that the federal 
government has made a commitment to clarifying the legal 
questions relating to the possibility of Quebec secession.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I nevertheless wish to recall why our government intervened in 
the Bertrand case. We did so to defend the rule of law, to express 
our profound disagreement with the position of the Attorney 
General of Quebec, who maintained that Canadian courts had no 
role to play in issues concerning separation and that these issues 
had no connection with Canadian laws or our Constitution.
<P>
	In the light of the position taken by the Government of Quebec 
and the ruling by Judge Pidgeon in the case of lawyer Guy 
Bertrand, our government announced that it asked the Supreme 
Court of Canada to give an advisory opinion on the fundamental 
issues relating to separation which arose from the Pidgeon ruling.
<P>
	It is reassuring for all Canadians to note that the Superior Court 
dismissed the main arguments of the Government of Quebec, 
which maintained that accession to sovereignty had nothing to do 
with the Canadian Constitution. The judgment pointed out, first of 
all, that the case is an important one, and that it cannot be rejected 
without a hearing; second, that the legal aspects of secession are 
complex and important and therefore deserve to be heard on the 
merits of the case; and third, that the courts play a fundamental role 
in protecting the rule of law.
<P>
	Let it be clear that the government's decision to ask for a 
reference to the Supreme Court of Canada in no way challenges the 
right of Quebecers to decide on their own future through a 
consultative referendum. What we want is to establish a framework 
based on legal certainties that will permit us to reply to certain 
fundamental questions to do with a possible secession.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4784"> 4784 </A></B>
<P>
	Contrary to what the government of Quebec is advocating, this 
is a responsible action on the part of our government, which must 
ensure social, economic and legal stability for Canadians. As long 
as there is a question of another referendum in Quebec, our 
government will assume its responsibility of ensuring that all the 
cards are on the table.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are thus on the one hand fully assuming our responsibility 
and on the other hand and as a priority pursuing our plans to renew 
the federation step by step which is what Canadians want. On the 
contrary, rather than making a constructive contribution to the 
debate and helping Canadians to come closer together, the Reform 
Party has a tendency to exploit the differences that divide for 
partisan ends.
<P>
	The issues of concern to Canadians are economic prosperity, 
jobs, social programs and the unity of our country. They are also 
the priorities our government has set for itself.
<P>
	Canadians want their government to work together to bring 
about the changes that will make the federation work more 
effectively and more efficiently. They want gradual changes that 
will yield direct, positive results. The government is forging ahead 
with the measures to make the Canadian federation work better 
which were announced in the speech from the throne in February 
and the last budget and discussed at the first ministers meeting in 
June. In that regard, allow me to summarize for the benefit of my 
hon. colleague the initiatives for change that have been announced 
or implemented.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The federal government is pursuing its efforts with the provinces 
and territories for a review of the roles and responsibilities of the 
various levels of government. It has therefore undertaken to 
withdraw from areas of activity that are more properly the 
responsibility of the provinces, municipalities and other 
stakeholders, such as job training, certain sectors of transportation, 
mining, forestry, recreation and public housing.
<P>
	In this regard, the proposal made last May by our colleague, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, is a concrete example 
of delivering on a promise that was important for our government 
and for most of the provinces, which have, for some time now, been 
asking for more responsibility in this area.
<P>
	It is a practical example that will make it possible to tailor 
programs to the particular needs of the regions, thus marking an 
important step towards a more flexible federalism.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With respect to social programs, the government is committed to 
ensuring that all Canadians can continue to rely on a secure, lasting 
social safety net. We are working  with the provinces to ensure that 
Canada's social programs continue to express the national 
objectives, values and principles cherished by our fellow citizens.
<P>
	Again, with a view to co-operation and dialogue, a 
federal-provincial-territorial committee on social policy and 
national standards was proposed at the first ministers meeting in 
June and was endorsed by the provinces in August in Jasper, 
Alberta. Alberta recently appointed the co-chair of that committee. 
Our colleague, the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
together with the Minister of Health will thus be able to pursue the 
discussions on this matter which is of key importance to all 
citizens.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As far as the economy is concerned, the government will 
continue to work with the provinces to reduce the barriers to 
internal trade and manpower mobility.
<P>
	It is also in the interest of better serving the public interest that 
the federal government is proposing the creation, in co-operation 
with the interested provinces, of new mechanisms to reduce 
overlap in the sectors of securities, revenue collection and food 
inspection.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the environmental field the federal and provincial 
governments have agreed on a renewed partnership to develop 
effective management objectives and principles. In the field of 
tourism the provinces and territories have welcomed the private 
sector's co-operation in connection with the activities of the 
Canadian tourism commission.
<P>
	These are a host of tangible examples of the progress that can be 
achieved through co-operation between the different orders of 
government. Discussions are evolving to renew the immensely 
successful national infrastructure program. The federal 
government is working with the provinces and territories to 
develop a proposal that is acceptable to all. This matter will be 
discussed at the upcoming finance ministers meeting next month.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Furthermore, our government is committed to restricting its 
spending power in areas that are the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
provinces. It will no longer use its spending power to create new, 
shared-cost programs in areas under provincial jurisdiction without 
the consent of the majority of the provinces. Provinces that opt out 
and establish a comparable program will receive compensation. It 
is the first time the federal government has offered to limit its 
powers outside the context of formal constitutional talks. This 
commitment marks a turning point in the history of federalism.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is how our government is renewing the Canadian 
federation, by proposing constructive solutions to the  issues which 
concern Canadians in an atmosphere of co-operation, dialogue and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4785"> 4785 </A></B>
<P>
respect. We believe that the spirit of co-operation and openness 
will enable us to further Canadian unity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore, for all the reasons I enumerated previously, I cannot 
support the bill introduced today in the House by the hon. member.
<P>
	Again, I do not dismiss the concerns about the possibility of 
another referendum in Quebec. Our government is well aware of 
them and is acting responsibly, as was pointed out in the throne 
speech.
<P>
	However, I believe that co-operation, not confrontation, is the 
way to bring about the changes Canadians want and to guarantee 
the unity of our country.
<P>
	We will continue to demonstrate that as we gradually improve 
the way our federation works, we will be in a better position to 
respond to the needs and aspirations of all citizens.
<P>
	If the Reform Party wants to do everything it can for national 
unity, we urge it to drop the confrontational rhetoric and work on 
national reconciliation and the renewal of our federation, in the 
best interests of all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-230 today, put 
forward by my colleague from Okanagan-Shuswap.
<P>
	As I sat here listening to these last two Liberal speakers I got the 
distinct feeling that these two hon. members must have been living 
in a complete vacuum over the last three years. This separatist 
group here has been standing in this House every day since the 35th 
Parliament started, saying: ``We want to secede from Canada. We 
want to separate from Canada''. I wonder if these hon. members 
have been hearing that.
<P>
	This is why we got into so much trouble in the referendum in 
Quebec. This government appears now, after listening to the 
member for Simcoe North and the member for Ottawa-Vanier, to 
prefer to just carry on the with status quo. Let us just try and keep 
doing what we have been doing.
<P>
	That is what almost lost us the referendum in October 1995. This 
government, these Liberals, would not face up to the fact that these 
separatists and the Quebecers they duped into following their line 
want to separate from Canada.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	What does it take to get the message across? I do not want that 
province to leave Canada. That province belongs as much to British 
Columbians, Nova Scotians, Albertans, Ontarians and 
Saskatchewanians as it belongs to Quebecers. It part of Canada, 
even though only one part.
<P>
	This Liberal government, the member for Simcoe North, says 
that we want to proceed with positive and constructive measures. 
That is Liberal talk for we want to have more appeasement and 
more accommodation for the province of Quebec.
<P>
	I cannot believe the member for Ottawa-Vanier said the 
Reform Party talks about a hypothetical scenario of secession. The 
Bloc and the Parti Quebecois in the province of Quebec just went 
through a referendum in 1995 to determine whether the people 
wanted to separate. There is nothing hypothetical about that. What 
is the member for Ottawa-Vanier thinking about? He says it is 
absolutely important that we ensure that all cards are on the table.
<P>
	We stood in this House day after day leading up to the 
referendum in 1995 and told the Prime Minister and this Liberal 
government, whose members were sitting on their hands: ``For 
goodness' sake, put the cards on the table for people who are 
thinking about leaving Quebec by voting yes. Put the cards on the 
table''.
<P>
	There were no cards on the table. We came that far from a yes 
vote because this Liberal government did not have the backbone 
then to put the cards on the table. It obviously does not have it now 
to put the cards on the table.
<P>
	The member for Ottawa-Vanier made another incredulous 
statement that the Reform Party would like to exploit the 
differences between Canadians. What an incredible statement.
<P>
	There has been no political party in the history of Canada that 
has done more to foster the differences between Canadians than the 
Liberal Party of Canada in any Parliament at any time of our 
history since 1867.
<P>
	Continually, day after day, year after year, the Liberal 
government, whatever it was of whatever year, has done more to 
foster the differences between Canadians than to bring Canadians 
together as one people.
<P>
	That is on record a million times. How can the member for 
Ottawa-Vanier talk about the Reform Party's wanting to exploit 
the differences when this party has built its political career by 
fostering the differences between Canadians? What an incredible 
statement.
<P>
	The reason the member for Okanagan-Shuswap put forth Bill 
C-230 was that this government does not have the guts to deal with 
these separatists on a face to face basis. It would rather beat around 
the bush and try to smooth things over.
<P>
	We are talking about a group of Quebecers-thank God not all 
Quebecers, a majority want to stay in Canada-who have been 
duped by a small group of politicians into believing that there is 
some nirvana out  there if they should leave Canada, a nirvana 
called Quebec nationhood.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4786"> 4786 </A></B>
<P>
	I say thank goodness the referendum failed in 1995. Unless this 
Liberal government gets its act together, it may not win the next 
referendum the separatists hold. If it continues on a path of do 
nothing, say nothing and hope the problem will go away, its 
members are going to lose.
<P>
	Now we get down to the issue of Bill C-230. I say that Quebec is 
part of Canada and always has been. Since we became the country 
of Canada, Quebec has been a part of it. It has enjoyed the benefits 
of Canada as Canada has enjoyed the benefits of the province of 
Quebec. We have a country here. We have a nation.
<P>
	But some people in Quebec have decided that somehow they will 
be better off if they leave this great country of ours. Somehow they 
have managed to convince a number of people in the province of 
Quebec that this would be a good thing to do.
<P>
	In 1995 in the last referendum, did they talk about separation 
leading up to the actual voting day? No. They talked about some 
fuzzy sovereignty association. The Liberal government would 
hardly even mention the word separation in this House unless we 
dragged it out of them.
<P>
	This separatist group that wants to break up this country did not 
have the courage to put a simple question to the people of Quebec: 
Do you want to separate from Canada, yes or no? It referred to 
some bill that had been passed in the Quebec legislature that dealt 
with some sort of fuzzy sovereignty association, negotiating some 
arrangement with Canada.
<P>
	The separatists say they want to separate but they did not have 
the guts to go to the people of Quebec and ask them if they wanted 
to leave Canada, period. That is what the question should have 
been. If that had been the question that was put, the no vote would 
not have squeaked by like it did. The no side would have won by a 
huge majority because the people would have clearly understood 
the question. It would not have been some convoluted question that 
the separatists came up with, but it would have been a clear 
question.
<P>
	The Reformers stood here and talked to the Prime Minister. We 
said: ``Why do you not tell the people of Quebec what they are 
voting for? Why do you allow the separatists to put this convoluted 
question before them? Why is the Liberal government not saying 
something about it? Why are you not clarifying it?'' Why did they 
not put all the cards on the table like the member for 
Ottawa-Vanier was talking about? That is what we demanded of 
the Liberal Party. In response the Liberals said: ``You Reformers 
keep out of it. We know how to handle it''.
<P>
	We saw how the Liberal government handled it. It just about lost 
it. We came close to losing the vote in Quebec  because of the 
Liberal government's inaction. The Liberal government did not 
have the courage to deal with these separatists head on.
<P>
	The majority of the people of Quebec do not want to separate 
from Canada. We cannot believe what this separatist group has 
been telling us. We cannot believe what Mr. Bouchard in Quebec is 
saying. We cannot believe that.
<P>
	The people of Quebec are Canadians who happen to live in the 
province of Quebec. I would say that if the Canadians who live in 
the province of Quebec had a clear question put to them: yes or no, 
do you want to separate from Canada, it would be an overwhelming 
no. That is what we are demanding in Bill C-230: that this Liberal 
government have the backbone, the courage to talk about the real 
question and not to let people get suckered in by these separatists 
here.
<P>
