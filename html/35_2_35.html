House this morning and move at second reading Bill C-220, which 
I have put together in consultation with thousands of Canadians.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to establish an energy price 
commission to regulate the wholesale and retail price of gasoline. 
The purpose of price regulation is to avoid unreasonable increases 
that affect the cost of living and depress business activity.
<P>
	The bill will facilitate reasonable consistency in prices from 
province to province, allowing for production and distribution 
costs. The regulation further minimizes the risk of collusion in 
pricing and prevents dominant suppliers from setting unreasonable 
prices.
<P>
	The bill also links the issue of price control to competition. Any 
investigation of an alleged offence under the Competition Act 
related to gasoline pricing is remitted by the competition tribunal 
to the commission for investigation, which reports to the tribunal 
before it makes a determination or order on the matter.
<P>
	The bill is extremely timely and important. I am asking all 
members to consider supporting the bill in any way they can 
because it relates to the pricing of gasoline. It relates to, in essence, 
the consumption of energy by Canadians. Whether you are a 
farmer, a business person or a consumer, energy and gasoline are 
the key components of our economic well-being.
<P>
	We have a very cold climate. We require more energy in terms of 
industry, more energy in terms of transportation, more energy in 
terms of moving goods  and services around the country. Moving 
goods takes energy; gasoline and oil.
<P>
	It is a key element of our economy. We have not seen any 
government initiatives or a wish of parliamentarians to ensure 
consumers, farmers and business people are treated fairly in 
relation to this commodity by the oil companies.
<P>
	Instead we see the opposite. Parliamentarians and the 
government look at this issue and say there are only five oil 
companies in the country that basically set the price of gasoline and 
we should let these five oil companies do whatever they please. It is 
more important for us to regulate everything else under the sun, in 
many cases things which affect not the entire country or the entire 
economy but one-tenth of one per cent of one organization or 
one-tenth of one per cent of this and that.
<P>
	I am asking parliamentarians and the Government of Canada to 
consider the impact of gasoline pricing in Canada, particularly the 
developments over the last 30 to 35 days. Gasoline prices in most 
regions of Canada have increased by 10 cents per litre, a 30 per cent 
increase in net revenues to the oil companies when taxes are 
factored out.
<P>
	There has been a 30 per cent increase in 30 days, and what 
response has the government taken? It has turned the other way. It 
has ignored Canadians. It has ignored this blatant effort by the oil 
companies to gouge Canadians on an absolutely necessary 
commodity and element of our economy, the engine of our 
economy. It has turned a blind eye to the fact that this is a 
non-renewable resources.
<P>
	One cent of the ten cent increase takes about $375 million out of 
the pockets of Canadians. If this 10 cent per litre increase is upheld 
over the next year it will result in almost $4 billion being taken out 
of consumers' pockets.
<P>
	Why is this happening? The oil companies say the price of crude 
oil has increased in the last 30 days from $18 per barrel to $23 per 
barrel U.S. There is some validity to that. The price has increased. 
However, let us put it in context and look at the average daily price 
of oil in Canada.
<P>
	Since 1990 the average daily price of crude oil in Canada has 
declined year after year. In 1992 the average daily price of crude 
was about $20.58 per barrel U.S. For the first part of 1996 up to 
mid-April the average daily  price is not $20.58, but 50 cents per 
barrel less. However, we have seen a 30 per cent increase in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2034"> 2034 </A></B>
<P>
price of gasoline. My information is from energy and mines 
concerning the average daily price of gasoline.
<P>
	This year the price per barrel is 50 cents less than it was four 
years ago, and the price has been lower in between. Yet the oil 
companies say the price of crude has gone up, that they have to jack 
up the prices and gouge Canadians because the government will not 
respond in any fashion at all.
<P>
	They give the excuse that they are not doing very well in terms 
of profits. Let us have a look at that. In 1994 Imperial Oil had a 29 
per cent increase in profits over 1993. Shell had a 43 per cent 
increase. In 1995 Imperial Oil had a 43 per cent increase in profits 
over the previous year, one of its record years. Shell, which had a 
record year in 1994, in 1995 had a 63 per cent increase in profits. 
Imperial Oil, in spite of the profits, employed 452 fewer 
employees, and Shell employed 471 fewer employees.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	In the first quarter of this year before the price kicked in and 
went up in terms of the price per barrel, Imperial Oil had a 300 per 
cent increase in its first quarter profits over last year, which was its 
record year.
<P>
	Factoring out some of the differentials, it says because of that we 
had a tax rebate. Factor out the tax rebate and it still had a 15 per 
cent increase after excluding the windfall rebate from the taxpayers 
of Canada. That does not wash.
<P>
	Imperial Oil employees tell me that in spite of record profits they 
were called into their offices across the country and were told 10 
per cent of the employees of Imperial Oil are history in the next 18 
months, not on the basis of attrition, retirement or vacancies but on 
the basis that the 10 per cent lowest productive workers in the 
company are gone.
<P>
	What kind of corporation is this? What kind of response does the 
government have to oil companies gouging at the gas pumps, 
making record profits and laying off people at record levels and not 
responding to the corporations and saying we are all in the same 
boat together? This is our country. We have an economy in trouble. 
How about chipping in and investing some of their money in 
employee wages or keeping their employees? How about 
reinvesting some of this money in capital or exploration projects in 
the communities in which they earn the profits, and then share the 
rest of the profits with whomever they want? We do not care.
<P>
	Take some corporate responsibility. Where is the leadership in 
this country? The other reason they talk about the gas prices going 
up is that every day the price goes up. They have to adjust the price 
of gasoline. In the gulf war of 1990 they said they had a 90-day 
supply. There was a 90-day inventory before the prices went up.  
This recent increase was 90 hours, not 90 days, an obvious attempt 
to gouge.
<P>
	As well, what about the thousands of products produced from a 
barrel of oil? A barrel of oil does not produce only gasoline. It 
produces 10,000 different products. Half the things in the House of 
Commons are produced from crude oil derivatives: clothing, 
plastic glasses, TV cameras, VCRs, fridges and stoves; all 
derivatives of oil.
<P>
	They do not fluctuate from minute to minute and region to 
region. The oil companies have to be accountable and called before 
a commission to justify their price increases. I am a business 
person. I have no problem with businesses making profits as long 
as they do not gouge people, as long as they justify the price they 
are charging for their products and services. That is not a key 
problem here. These companies are not justifying the increases 
they are making.
<P>
	They give us comparisons. They say the price of gas in other 
countries is much higher than in Canada. They give me a list of 
industrialized nations. In all the industrialized nations gas prices 
are higher than ours, except in the U.S.
<P>
	I asked the Petroleum Producers Institute and the oil companies 
how many of these countries produce oil. The only net producer on 
that piece of paper is Canada. Yet we are the second lowest gas 
sellers.
<P>
	I asked about a comparison of countries that actually produce 
oil. ``Duh, we do not have a list. We will track it down for you''. 
They do not have to because we have the list. Of all the producing 
countries in the world, Mexico, Venezuela and the Middle Eastern 
countries, along with other parts of the world that produce oil, their 
gasoline prices when taxes are factored out are much lower than in 
Canada. We are the highest of the net producers in the world. Why? 
We allow the oil companies to get away with not justifying their 
price increases.
<P>
	The most ludicrous response I heard from the oil companies was 
the reason the prices are going up is that Iraq may be bringing 
production out of the markets. Economics 101 says very plainly 
that argument is a laughable falsity. If more production is coming 
on the market, more supply, less demand, the price goes down. 
They think people are airheads in this country. I do not think people 
appreciate that sort of ridiculous response from the oil companies.
<P>
	What we have to look at is what is important for Canadians, what 
is important for Canada. A question in a recent poll in the Regina 
<I>Leader-Post</I>, April 22, was should the federal government move to 
regulate the retail price of gasoline. Of 3,786 respondents, 3,519 
said yes, 93 per cent; 267 or 7 per cent said no.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2035"> 2035 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	Saskatchewan produces 15 per cent of the oil in Canada. 
Looking at the regional price of gasoline in Regina, it is higher 
where there is a refinery than in places the oil is transported to. 
When the tax differential is factored out the price is actually the 
highest in the whole country.
<P>
	Why? Spring seeding is starting and farmers make bulk fuel 
purchases so the oil companies say: ``Let us rip off the farmers. The 
New Democrat member of Parliament for Regina-Lumsden keeps 
raising the issue across the country. Let us pull his chain a bit and 
gouge the consumers in his home province. There is an NDP 
government in Saskatchewan. It is one of only three provincial 
governments that have balanced budgets, fair tax rates and which 
are protecting social programs. Let us jerk their chains and give 
them a little shot''.
<P>
	All I am asking is that parliamentarians consider setting up an 
energy price review commission so that oil companies can justify 
their price increases before it. By the same token governments 
should appear before the commission to justify tax increases and 
make sure they are fair to taxpayers.
<P>
	Governments and parliamentarians have obligations. We are 
obligated in many ways to be the balance to the economic powers 
that run our economy. We are obligated to protect consumers when 
they are unfairly gouged by an oligopoly, a monopoly or a 
company. That is our obligation. We are paid to hold those people 
who influence and control the economy accountable in a fair 
manner for Canadians. That is all we are asking people to consider 
this morning.
<P>
	The response has been: Why would we want to regulate the oil 
industry? I have mentioned in some of my arguments that it is a 
non-renewable natural resource. It is a key engine to our economy. 
We must also consider that we regulate all sorts of other things.
<P>
	We regulate communications. The CRTC regulates radio and 
television broadcasting. There are 1,000 companies out there which 
could give us our communications services. There are satellite 
dishes, cable companies and a number of television and radio 
stations in every region. It is good that they are regulated because 
consumers are provided with an even, balanced view of the world. 
Communications does not influence and control our entire 
economy, although it is important to the economy. There is no 
doubt about that. Energy is the key component for everything but 
we disregard it and let the five major oil companies do what they 
like.
<P>
	We could mention to the competition bureau that we think the oil 
companies are fixing prices. In one hour all the gasoline prices in 
this region went up to the same level. The bureau's response was: 
``We do not have anything in writing from the president of one oil 
company to another saying they should fix prices. We  cannot 
pursue this because we need some evidence''. People have told me 
that the bureau of competition policy is laughable. We do regulate 
other business and industries to the advantage of Canadians.
<P>
	I could go on. I have information members would be willing to 
listen to, but I know my time has almost expired. I know the 
Minister of Health is very anxious to hear more. I am very anxious 
also to meet with him after to give him more information if he 
wishes, particularly about health care. I could offer him some 
advice on that too.
<P>
	At this moment, I would like to ask for unanimous consent for a 
vote to refer Bill C-220 to the Standing Committee on Industry.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Do we have 
unanimous consent to change the reference to a committee on this 
bill?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Madam Speaker, I am sorry to hear that some 
MPs will not give unanimous consent. I would therefore ask for 
unanimous consent to refer the subject matter of the bill to the 
Standing Committee on Industry.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is there 
unanimous consent to send the subject matter to the Standing 
Committee on Industry?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Madam Speaker, I notice that the Liberal member 
for Dauphin-Swan River did not provide unanimous consent. 
That is unfortunate. I was born in Dauphin and I am getting all 
kinds of calls from her constituents saying that we should be 
undertaking a review.
<P>
	Finally, I would ask members for their unanimous consent to 
make this bill votable.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is there 
unanimous consent to make the bill votable?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
opportunity to participate in the debate about a proposed energy 
price commission.
<P>
	The hon. member for Regina-Lumsden has provided an 
opportunity to discuss the cost of a commodity which is vital to the 
daily lives of us all: gasoline. He is quite right. The cost of 
petroleum affects the cost of everything in this country. 
Transportation is part of the cost of everything we do. It affects 
virtually every product and service we buy or sell.
<P>
	Coming from a rural community in Manitoba I know that 
nowhere is this more true than on the farm. Fuel costs are a large 
part of farm inputs. Even the smallest  change in the price of fuel 
can make a big difference to the farmer's bottom line. As a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2036"> 2036 </A></B>
<P>
government we know this and that is why we did not increase fuel 
taxes in the recent budget. Food, clothing, shelter and even the cost 
of finding and holding a job is affected by the price of the fuel 
which literally drives our economy.
<P>
	The hon. member for Regina-Lumsden is quite right. The cost 
of fuel should be reasonable and affordable. However, there are 
several major areas on which we do not agree.
<P>
	Clause 8 of the bill states that every person who sells gasoline 
must obtain approval of the price from the government. That is not 
at all what Canadians want. The taxpayers of Canada do not want 
another bureaucracy as a solution to a perceived problem. The 
people of Canada do not want a new petroleum price police 
investigating who is paying what price for what product.
<P>
	If this bill were passed, the federal government would be, 
according to Canadian law, infringing on provincial jurisdiction, 
intruding unnecessarily into competitive markets and spending 
large amounts of taxpayers' money.
<P>
	I can assure hon. members that the idea of a new energy price 
commission cannot be supported by the Minister of Natural 
Resources nor the Minister of Industry. The reason is that study 
after study has concluded that government regulation on petroleum 
prices simply does not work.
<P>
	Over the last 20 years, in every province except one, provincial 
governments have abandoned, rejected or never even considered 
the regulation of gasoline prices. The sole exception is Prince 
Edward Island and where are the highest gasoline prices in Canada, 
excluding taxes? Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	In Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, 
Ontario and Manitoba, petroleum prices and proposals to regulate 
them have been studied by government boards, task forces, 
commissions and legislative committees. The federal government 
has also studied the matter extensively. Here is a small sampling of 
the reports.
<P>
	In 1987 a commission of inquiry into gasoline pricing in 
Manitoba declared:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Regulation of gasoline-markets by means of hearings and the usual process 
of regulatory bodies is-not advisable-.Crude oil and gasoline 
markets-continuously change, making regulation impractical, and 
introducing distortions, since it would not be possible to adjust prices quickly 
enough.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This form of regulation would-force the price upon all market participants 
through legal coercion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Canadians consider that coercion, legal or otherwise, is not a 
norm in this country.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	In 1986 in a report on the petroleum industry, the federal 
Restrictive Trade Practices Commission discussed the maze of 
restrictions which inevitably follows the introduction of price 
regulation:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Such restrictions (in facilities, hours, types of operation) cripple the ability of 
the industry to meet consumer demand, and to charge lower prices made 
possible by lower cost of distribution-induced by competitive measures or 
pressures.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The variety of offerings across the country by independent marketers and by 
integrated firms illustrates the value of allowing each business the freedom to 
meet consumer needs as it sees fit-to strive at all times to maximize its appeal 
to-the public by giving them what they want.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Giving the public what they want, not what a government, a board, 
a committee or a new national energy price commission thinks they 
want.
<P>
	What is remarkable about these many reports is how relevant 
they are today. The same analyses, assessments and judgments 
apply today as they did 10 or 20 years ago. The principal difference 
is that today Canadians are more conscious than ever of the 
advantages of business versus government in delivering goods and 
services, what they want, when they want it, at a price they want to 
pay. The fact is gasoline markets today exhibit all the 
characteristics of a competitive market.
<P>
	One of the roles of Natural Resources Canada is to provide 
Canadians with current data. The department constantly monitors 
prices across Canada to determine relevant facts about gasoline 
marketing.
<P>
	The federal government already has an agency with a mandate to 
monitor competition and investigate complaints: the competition 
bureau. This is where dealers or consumers can bring any evidence 
they have of anti-competitive behaviour.
<P>
	It is illegal for retailers to agree among themselves to set prices 
that may lessen or prevent competition, to try to influence another 
retailer's prices by agreement, threat or promise, or to persuade 
wholesalers to cut off gasoline supplies to discount retailers 
because of their lower prices. Any Canadian may report alleged 
offences to the competition bureau by mail, by fax, or by calling a 
toll free telephone number.
<P>
	With regard to this bill, I offer three principal facts. Petroleum 
prices come under provincial jurisdiction. Agencies which regulate 
prices have in the past consistently led to prices which are not 
lower but higher. Most important, there is overwhelming evidence 
that we do indeed have vigorous competition in the marketing of 
petroleum products. These are compelling reasons why in 1996 
informed Canadian consumers and taxpayers do not consider, do 
not need and do not want an energy price commission.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2037"> 2037 </A></B>
<P>
	Few people are ever completely satisfied with the price and 
quality of goods and services they buy. No doubt all of us would 
like to buy gasoline at prices lower than they are today.
<P>
	From the report of the groups commissioned over the last 20 
years to study petroleum prices the conclusion is clear, unequivocal 
and straightforward: In 1996 the last thing people want in this 
country is a new petroleum price police. The last thing we need in 
this country is an energy price commission.
<P>
	This Liberal government is committed to the future, not the past. 
What we want is not more but less bureaucracy, not closed but open 
markets and not less but more choice.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first of all, I will admit that after listening closely to the two 
previous speeches by our colleagues from the other two parties and 
despite our friendship for our colleague from Regina-Lumsden 
who introduced this bill, we unfortunately cannot support Bill 
C-220 for the various reasons I will explain during my 
presentation.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Again, the purpose of this bill is to establish an energy price 
commission to regulate the wholesale and retail price of gasoline. 
In our opinion and that of the government party-and according to 
my own observations-this bill would give the government the 
authority to meddle in a flagrant and unjustified manner in the 
normal process of free market pricing, which goes against the 
global trend of market pricing of gasoline in this case.
<P>
	On the one hand, history shows that setting a ceiling price on 
gasoline can be dangerous and even create some serious shortages 
since oil companies tend to sell less when prices are low-and this 
is normal-while demand increases. They thus stockpile their 
products. These shortages can lead to quota problems, waiting lines 
and corruption, as we saw in some countries in South America and 
Asia.
<P>
	On the other hand, the setting of a ceiling price by the 
commission could also result in an economic slowdown for oil 
producers in western Canada.
<P>
	An example of an unsuccessful attempt to control gas prices is 
the national energy policy-as many members on the other side 
will recall-initiated by former Prime Minister Trudeau during the 
oil crisis, which, as you may recall, caused widespread discontent 
at the time.
<P>
	In fact, every time the federal government interferes in the oil or 
energy sector, as in the case of the Varennes tokamak, Quebec loses 
out. If an energy price commission is established, as my colleague 
proposes by introducing Bill C-220, it should review not only gas 
prices but also the injustices done to Quebec through  past federal 
interventions. This commission could perhaps recommend that the 
House give Quebec a generous compensation like that given to the 
maritimes for harmonizing the GST.
<P>
	We would then try to set the amount of this compensation. An 
example of the injustices that could be reviewed by this 
commission is the impact of the famous Borden line imposed by 
the federal government in the 1960s. Members will remember that 
the Borden line energy policy systematically blocked the 
development of Montreal's oil production from Venezuelan and 
Middle Eastern imports by completely closing the market of those 
provinces located west of the line, to protect western oil 
development.
<P>
	However, the policy was abolished when world prices started to 
rise quickly between 1973 and 1977. This resulted in the oil 
production from Sarnia and the prairies flooding the eastern 
Canadian market, in the closure of most Montreal refineries and in 
the loss of thousands of jobs. In addition to refineries disappearing 
because of this totally unjust policy towards Quebec, our whole 
petrochemical industry was also severely affected.
<P>
	To this day, Quebec, and particularly the Montreal region, still 
suffers from the consequences of this policy implemented by the 
federal government of the day. Unlike the maritimes now, for the 
GST, Quebec was never compensated for its heavy losses. If the 
commission that the hon. member hopes to establish with Bill 
C-220 does become reality some day, perhaps it ought to take a 
look at the issue of compensation for Quebec.
<P>
	The commission could also look at the development of the 
Athabasca tar sands. It should definitely not limit its role to 
regulating gasoline prices, but should look at the current 
investments being made to produce gasoline in Canada. Perhaps it 
should also examine the famous Hibernia project, that 
cock-and-bull story which has cost taxpayers in Quebec and 
Canada astronomical amounts of money. This is another example 
of failed federal involvement in the energy sector, which has had 
serious consequences on the economy as a whole. This project was 
launched before the 1989 federal election. Now, the current 
government is trying to get out of it.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	At election time, the government had decided to withdraw from 
that project. However, it has since absorbed 25 per cent of the 
production costs. The government allocated over $1 billion to that 
project, but that was not enough. In addition, the present 
government promised loan guarantees corresponding to 40 per cent 
of construction loans, up to $1.66 billion.
<P>
	A promise was made to stop using the taxpayers' money for this 
scheme. But a promise was made to scrap the GST and that was not 
kept, a promise was made to cancel the helicopters and that was not 
kept, a promise was made to cancel the Pearson Airport contract 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2038"> 2038 </A></B>
<P>
and that  was not kept, a promise was made by the Clark 
government to put a limit on the price of gasoline-which led to 
their defeat-and that was not kept. However, the federal 
government was probably quoted out of context or forgot about that 
promise too, and continued to pour more money down that drain.
<P>
	The energy price commission, which my hon. colleague would 
like to see established, would have a field day if we gave it a 
mandate to investigate this matter.
<P>
	But getting back to Hibernia, Ottawa then spent $350 million 
buying back 25 per cent of Gulf's shares in the Hibernia project. In 
addition, Ottawa financed the shares acquired by Murphy. And to 
top it off, it gave deductions and tax credits to Murphy, Mobil and 
Chevron, oil companies raking in billions of dollars, to reduce their 
income taxes, poor things, and the government gave them interest 
free loans, guaranteeing them benefits in the event that they were 
unable to take advantage of these deductions and these credits.
<P>
	Chevron and Mobil each took advantage of $40 million in 
interest free loans from the federal government. Thus, while the 
federal government was increasing the tax on the price of gasoline, 
it was squandering public funds at a terrible rate. The increase in 
the gasoline tax is being used, among other things, to offset the 
accumulated losses in the Hibernia project.
<P>
	I very much doubt that federal intervention with respect to the 
price of gasoline can solve any problems and provide even the 
remotest additional guarantee of fairness. I also very much doubt 
whether the creation of this commission can give taxpayers in 
Quebec and Canada a degree of stability in gasoline prices. I do, 
however, recognize the good will of my colleague. But they say the 
past is an indication of the future, and I would far prefer that the 
federal government stay right out of areas that, in any event, do not 
concern it.
<P>
	When the Hibernia project was first launched, the federal 
government's top advisers predicted that the price of a barrel of oil 
would reach $70. We, as taxpayers, have paid billions of dollars for 
their mistaken forecasts.
<P>
	We Quebecers fervently hope that this government will not get 
involved or, if it does, that it will do so only with the consent of the 
provinces so that they can have a say in the appointment of 
commissioners as well as in the operation and mandate of the 
commission. All the money invested in Hibernia, the billions of 
dollars wasted, could have been spent on reducing the gasoline tax, 
thus giving taxpayers a much needed break.
<P>
	While presenting his plan to harmonize-or rather to hide-the 
GST last Tuesday, the Minister of Finance said that the federal 
government had an obligation to help the poorest regions and 
provinces, that there should be a more equitable distribution of 
wealth. He should now put his money where his mouth is.
<P>
	Instead of wasting vast sums of money on foolish projects like 
Hibernia, it would be better to reduce the gasoline tax. If they 
simply want to offer a fair compensation to the regions or the 
Atlantic provinces, it would be better to reduce the gasolinetax rate.
<P>
	If this government wants a more equitable Canada, it should put 
its money where its mouth is by finding more legitimate uses for 
this money. It should see to it that these oil companies, which too 
often benefit from unjustified tax exemptions, pay their fair share 
of taxes.
<P>
	Finally, this government should let the provinces take 
responsibility for their own areas of jurisdiction and let the market 
set the prices. In short, the federal government should mind its own 
business.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on private member's Bill C-220, an act respecting 
the energy price commission.
<P>
	This bill would establish an energy price commission to regulate 
the wholesale and retail prices of gasoline. The purpose of price 
regulation is to avoid unreasonable increases which affect the cost 
of living and depress business. This is the reason for the bill and the 
justification for setting up an energy price commission as given by 
the hon. member for Regina-Lumsden.
<P>
	I too am extremely concerned about the price of gasoline. Every 
time I pull up to the pumps or get a load of bulk fuel delivered to 
my farm I am concerned about the price of gasoline. I often wonder 
why it is as high as it is.
<P>
	This legislation does not provide a answer to the problem. This is 
a typical NDP solution to the problem, a socialist solution to the 
problem. It is not a practical solution. It has been tried before for 
other commodities and in other countries. This type of action has 
completely failed. In fact, as the hon. member who spoke from the 
Liberal Party said, regulation often leads to higher prices. Clearly 
this is not the solution.
<P>
	Setting up an energy price commission would provide another 
opportunity for patronage appointments. Such a body would 
employ high priced, taxpayer funded civil servants. There is no 
other way to make a commission like that work.
<P>
	Canadians do not need a higher cost of government. We need 
smaller government. We need less money spent by government. We 
do not need any more bodies to provide opportunities for the 
government of the day to make patronage appointments. It is 
clearly the wrong way to go.
<P>
	I would like to mention a few figures presented by Michael 
Ervine, president of QIS Solution Inc., in his presentation to the 
House of Commons natural resources committee when speaking on 
the topic of the price of  gasoline. Mr. Ervine pointed out that the 
average price of regular gasoline in Canada today is 55 cents a litre. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2039"> 2039 </A></B>
<P>
Of this price about 15 cents a litre represents the cost of the crude 
oil. About 30 cents a litre is the tax on this fuel at the pump. Only 
10 cents a litre is what is left for the oil companies to refine the 
fuel, to transport, to lease equipment and to sell the product. 
Therefore, 10 cents a litre out of 55 cents a litre is to provide all of 
these costs.
<P>
	When looking at a breakdown of costs of gasoline the tax 
component is by far the highest single component. What is a 
practical way of dealing with the problem? There is one most 
effective way for the government or the New Democratic Party to 
deal with this issue of what they perceive to be high gasoline 
prices. Again I say I feel they are high too. I feel it every time I buy 
a litre of gasoline for my farm or for my car. The most effective 
thing to do is to lower the tax component.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Saskatchewan has a reputation for having high taxes on gasoline 
in that province. Again, the way to deal with the problem is to 
reduce the tax component which is over half of the total cost of 
gasoline.
<P>
	How is the tax component reduced? There is only one way to do 
that. Reduce government spending so that it does not have to tax at 
these totally unreasonable levels.
<P>
	The hon. member for Regina-Lumsden is correct in one 
respect. The price of gasoline is too high. It is higher than it should 
be because the tax component is too high. That is the area on which 
the hon. member should be working.
<P>
	The hon. member referred to a survey which appeared in the 
Regina <I>Leader Post</I>. In that survey about 93 per cent of the people 
who responded said they favoured this type of a commission. When 
going to the people on an issue it is important to do the background 
work before the survey or the poll. The background work is to 
make sure that all the information gets out before the survey or poll 
is taken.
<P>
	I wonder if on this issue the Regina <I>Leader Post</I> or the hon. 
member for Regina-Lumsden did their work and got the 
information that I just presented on the cost of gasoline, which 
stated that over half the cost is taxes. Did they do their job to get the 
message out to the people that the tax component is the problem 
here?
<P>
	I do not know for a fact that gasoline is not higher than it should 
be even acknowledging the high portion of tax. I am not saying it is 
not too high. But the way to deal with the problem is not by setting 
up an energy price commission, but to make sure of fair, good, 
strong, competition legislation which is enforced.
<P>
	I acknowledge that some progress has been made over the last 10 
years. The body that deals with the Competitions Act has made 
some progress. I believe it is much better than the old legislation 
that was in place.  This Competitions Act, and the people who 
administer it, have gone a long way in trying to make it easy for 
people to let the bureau know if they feel there is unfair 
competition. I am sure it has heard from a large number of people 
who feel that the price of gasoline is too high.
<P>
	The competition bureau's services are readily available to people 
through a 1-800 toll free number. This allows people who feel there 
is not fair competition to complain that companies are not dealing 
with prices fairly.
<P>
	Progress has been made. I cannot determine if there really is a 
problem of fuel prices being too high other than the tax component 
which is clearly much too high. Over half of the cost of gasoline is 
tax at the pump, plus royalties and other taxes built into the rest of 
the price.
<P>
	The way to deal with this is to make sure that we do have good, 
fair competition legislation, that the Competitions Act is 
strengthened if it needs to be strengthened, and that it be used and 
enforced.
<P>
	I cannot support the legislation. It is up to other members of the 
Reform Party to determine how they will vote on this issue. Some 
Reform MPs may support the issue, but I doubt it very much when 
we look at the facts behind this.
<P>
	I will not support the bill. Other Reform MPs can make their 
own decision. I believe this is a socialist, bureaucratic solution 
which will not work. The matter must be dealt with it through the 
competitions bureau.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to address the House on private member's Bill C-220, an act 
respecting the energy price commission, which was introduced by 
my colleague, the hon. member for Regina-Lumsden. I would 
like to thank my colleague for the research and effort that was put 
into Bill C-220, leading to its introduction on March 4 of this year. 
He is a sincere, hard-working member.
<P>
	The bill, as drafted, would establish an energy price commission 
which would confer on the Government of Canada the right and 
mandate to regulate the price of gasoline throughout the country. 
As I understand it, the commission would approve wholesale and 
retail gasoline prices across the country. Indeed, no person could 
offer gasoline for sale at a price not approved by the commission.
<P>
	At the outset, I would like to explain that competition in an 
unfettered market rather than regulation leads to the lowest 
possible prices, both for the consumers and industrial purchasers of 
gasoline. Competition is seen as a means rather than an end unto 
itself. It is only through the process of competition that resources 
are allocated impartially, with the consequence that the efficiencies 
derived therefrom lead to lower prices.
<P>
	This is the current view of the government and the majority of 
our trading partners. At a time when  Canadians are attempting to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2040"> 2040 </A></B>
<P>
improve their competitive position in international markets we 
must steer away from regulations which, by their very nature, lead 
to the kind of production and distribution inefficiencies that 
eventually cause an increase in the price of inputs and in 
distribution costs.
<P>
	On the issue of regulation, it is worth noting that at the Toronto 
economic summit in June of 1988 the G-7 countries first explicitly 
enunciated the goal of intensifying both individual and collective 
efforts to remove unnecessary controls and barriers to the operation 
of competitive market forces and to rely on increased competition 
to achieve economic efficiency and adaptability.
<P>
	Reform of the regulated sectors of our respective economies has 
been in the forefront of economic agendas over the past 10 years. It 
is widely understood that less rather than more regulation is 
desirable. Barriers are descending within industries, between 
markets and across national borders. Trade, directed both north and 
south and east and west, has thus been encouraged. The potential 
for increased wealth for Canadians has been augmented.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-220 and the commission is said to avoid 
unreasonable gasoline price increases. In addition, it proposes to 
maintain consistent prices for gasoline from province to province, 
all the while allowing for production and distribution costs. My 
colleague in his bill would exempt purchasers who enter into 
supply contracts for the supply of gasoline to their vehicles or to a 
storage facility owned by these purchasers from the authority of the 
commission.
<P>
	From my reading of the bill, the underlying suggestion is that we 
need to regulate the price of gasoline in Canada. There has been a 
great deal of attention in this House and in the media about the 
price of gas in some specific local markets in parts of Canada. 
Before we decide that federal regulation is the answer to these 
localized problems, should we not ask if the price of gas has risen 
significantly and whether or not increasing the regulatory burden 
on this industry would actually improve the current situation?
<P>
	In fact, the price of gasoline, in real terms, excluding all taxes, 
has been on a downward trend since 1990. In addition, there exists 
no significant differences in the base price of gas, excluding taxes 
and exchange rates, between the United States and Canada. Given 
this situation, should we as legislators impose a structure on the 
industry which would deny to consumers and businesses alike the 
benefits derived from real competition and retail gasoline markets?
<P>
	In addition, the introduction of such a bill appears somewhat 
premature. I am informed by officials of Industry Canada, Natural 
Resources Canada and the Canadian Petroleum Products Institute 
that they are nearing completion of a regional competitive analysis 
of  petroleum products. This report will examine pricing issuesin various urban and regional markets in the context ofdetermining the key factors which derive competitiveness in 
specific Canadian markets.
<P>
	I would now like to provide my colleagues with a number of 
examples of the benefits of competition. Consumers could no 
longer benefit from the price wars that presently occur in retail 
gasoline markets, nor could they enjoy the benefits of the entry of a 
new competitor who would lower their prices to gain a market 
share.
<P>
	Prices set by markets rather than governments tend to be lower 
to the consumer. The decision in July of 1991 by the province of 
Nova Scotia to discontinue its gasoline pricing regime reflected in 
part a recognition that such decisions should be left to competitive 
market forces. When prices were no longer regulated and a new 
independent entered the market, gas prices fell in Nova Scotia from 
58.9 cents to 52.9 cents a litre, a very significant decline.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	As is well known, gasoline stations communicate what they 
charge by posting large signs on their properties. This informs 
motorists and competing gas stations. Because gasoline is 
essentially a homogeneous product, motorists see one brand as 
being more or less identical to another. Gas station operators fear 
that if they charge a higher price than a competing station they will 
lose business. For similar reasons, if they charge a lower price they 
know it will be matched. In the end they make less money selling 
the same volume of product.
<P>
	Retailers that monitor their competitors and independently take 
action that best serves their interests are simply following rational 
economic logic.
<P>
	On the larger stage, such a commission would remove the 
incentive for petroleum producers to be more efficient. Price 
controls weaken the stimulus for firms to either swiftly adapt 
themselves to changes in demand or to developing more efficient 
methods of distribution. It is easier for the firms that have 
experienced cost increases to ask the regulatory body to increase 
the controlled price than to attempt to lessen their operating costs.
<P>
	When prices are controlled at the retail level, retailers in turn 
may avoid passing on any discounts that they have been successful 
in exacting from manufacturers to the ultimate consumers for fear 
of breaking the law. In this manner retailers are constrained in their 
attempt to aggressively compete.
<P>
	Competitive markets incur no cost of administration to 
governments, nor do they impose on the firms involved the cost of 
compliance with more laws, both of which would be borne by 
consumers over time.
<P>
	Turning now to another subject in relation to this bill, I have 
further concerns with respect to the wisdom of raising yet another 
issue which impacts on the Canadian  Constitution at this stage in 
our country's history. The regulation of petroleum products falls 
within the jurisdiction of the provinces. The federal government 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2041"> 2041 </A></B>
<P>
does not currently intervene on these matters. This could very well 
be a fatal flaw in this initiative of my colleague.
<P>
	I would now like to discuss the Competition Act which is 
Canada's legislation governing trade and commerce affecting 
competition. The act is a framework law of general application. It 
applies, with some exceptions, to all sectors of the Canadian 
economy, namely manufacturing, resources and services. The law 
touches on the every day life of all Canadians by maintaining and 
encouraging competition in the marketplace with the objective of 
providing consumers with competitive prices and a variety of 
choices in the goods and services which they purchase.
<P>
	As the hon. member is aware, in 1994 the Minister of Industry, in 
response to concerns raised about gasoline pricing, asked the 
director of investigation and research who heads the Competition 
Bureau to review the provisions of the Competition Act to 
determine their adequacy in dealing with anti-competitive 
behaviour in the petroleum industry.
<P>
	In response, the director reported that he actively enforces the 
Competition Act by monitoring developments in the marketplace 
and reviewing complaints from consumers and those in the 
petroleum industry to determine whether there is evidence of 
anti-competitive activity.
<P>
	While there will always be fluctuations in markets owing to 
competition and other factors, the director's view is that the 
provisions of the legislation are adequate to deal with 
anti-competitive behaviour in relation to gasoline prices.
<P>
	The director regularly reviews the act and the minister will 
propose amendments whenever he deems it appropriate. The above 
mentioned report is public and I encourage concerned members to 
read it. I also encourage anyone who has information that 
anti-competitive activity is ongoing to bring it to the attention of 
the director.
<P>
	The act is available to deal with any competition problems that 
develop in petroleum product markets. As a matter of fact, on 
January 26, Mr. Justice David Dempsey imposed a find of $50,000 
against Mr. Gas Limited which was found guilty of having 
influenced upward, by threat, the prices charged by one of its 
competitors, Caltex Petroleum Incorporated in September 1992 in 
the Ottawa area.
<P>
	It should be noted that contrary to the context suggested in Bill 
C-220, matters involving anti-competitive pricing are most often 
treated as criminal offences under the Competition Act and as such 
proceed through the criminal courts under the auspices of the 
Attorney General of Canada.
<P>
	The competition tribunal has to date only adjudicated on matters 
of a civil nature. A select set of pricing matters which may be 
brought before the tribunal are usually the result of disciplinary or
<P>
punitive action taken by dominant firms in a market rather than 
those arising from a criminal agreement among competitors.
<P>
	In conclusion, it remains my view that gasoline prices should be 
set in the competitive marketplace. Anti-competitive behaviour 
will be appropriately addressed under the Competition Act.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House urge the government to direct the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs to proceed with the drafting of a Victims' Bill of 
Rights, and that, in such areas where the Committee determines a right to be 
more properly a provincial concern, the Minister of Justice initiate 
consultations with the provinces aimed at arriving at a national standard for a 
Victims' Bill of Rights.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to bring to the House 
of Commons an issue of paramount importance.
<P>
	Many people have helped us work on this bill since the summer 
of 1994. We have turned it into a motion to try to get some action in 
the House of Commons. The motion to establish a national bill of 
rights will be voted on this evening at 6.30. I encourage everybody 
watching and listening to see where the House of Commons stands 
on a national bill of rights for victims. This is when we will 
separate fact from fiction, right from wrong.
<P>
	As I stand in the House I find it quite embarrassing today to find 
that the government is to table legislation on gay rights when 
victims across the country and the Reform Party are fighting to get 
victims' rights. It is a total embarrassment that the priorities are on 
one aspect and not on the other in this society.
<P>
	I dedicate this speech to the hundreds of thousands if not the 
millions of victims in Canada today. In particular I dedicate my 
speech to Sheena who was taken from us by a drunk driver. We 
shall never forget the good times and her family will always 
remember.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2042"> 2042 </A></B>
<P>
	Many people think victims' rights in Canada today are things 
like changes to the Young Offenders Act, the repeal of section 745, 
the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, the gun law or the 
many other bills in the great jungle of criminal justice laws in 
Canada. That is not the case. Those are the laws we use to help 
judge right from wrong. Those are the laws which are supposed 
to protect people from becoming victims in the first place. Those 
are the laws which victims seek to change.
<P>
	On the other hand, victims' rights reflect the protection victims 
require after a criminal act has been perpetrated. They are the rights 
victims must have to ensure justice and equity exist and to protect 
them from being revictimized by the system.
<P>
	Keith Kempt, a gentleman I met in Mission, British Columbia, 
said it best to me. He lost his young fellow when another individual 
shot him and killed him. Keith said to me not too long ago that 
criminals need correction; victims need rehabilitation. How 
appropriate a comment by a victim.
<P>
	I hope the debate today will be constructive. We know a large 
number of victims have been advised of this debate and are 
watching as I speak now. I ask the people watching and listening to 
listen closely, to see if they will come to the same conclusion we 
have that a national victims' bill of rights is necessary. If you listen 
to the content and the sincerity of the speeches, you will see why 
we need this bill of rights. I encourage people across the country to 
write to us. Write to your MP, write to me in the House of 
Commons with your comments. Victims need our help. They need 
a national bill of rights.
<P>
	Some provincial jurisdictions are involved. There are some 
actions within this bill of rights that would require administration 
by the provincial system. Just as the provinces co-operated with the 
federal government to implement reforms to the plea bargaining 
process, the same co-operation would be required here. Let us not 
blame one another for currently not having a victim's bill of rights; 
let us build one now.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	I quote Somerset Maugham: ``It is a funny thing about life, if 
you refuse anything but the best you very often get it''. Let us 
develop the best together for victims, with victims.
<P>
	The provinces of Ontario and British Columbia have recently 
attempted to address this issue through legislation. I looked at the 
legislation and I can see these rights are conditional to some extent; 
conditional to the Privacy Act, to the Freedom of Information Act 
and to the rights of the criminal. I do not think today we should be 
in the position to say the rights of the criminal are more important 
that the rights of the victim. I think we have to say there are 
unconditional rights of victims. Victims need more reassurance 
than having things  conditional today. Victims need more 
consistency than that.
<P>
	There are many victims' rights groups in the country that agree 
with our position and the criteria from which we set out what 
victims' rights are. Let us not leave them alone anymore. Let us 
support these groups, their membership, those victims.
<P>
	There are groups like CAVEAT, CRY, Victims of Violence, 
Citizens United for Safety and Justice, Victims Resource Centre, 
Fair Justice, Move the Rock, and Peace and Justice for Canadians, 
to name some of the ones that have supported this initiative.
<P>
	The standards we have established for a Canadian victims' bill 
of rights are here, and I wish to read them and table with them in 
the House. Afterwards I want to present an explanation for each 
article so that Liberal members can understand what is behind this 
incentive.
<P>
	It is important to give an idea of some of the hurdles we have to 
cross in this country. To quote from the legal industry, Russ 
Chamberlain, a criminal defence lawyer, said in the Vancouver 
<I>Province</I><B>, </B>that crime victims want an eye for an eye. He said they 
want someone else to fix their petty problems and that their pitch 
for personal vengeance can improperly affect a jury's verdict.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Victim impact statements are just venting the spleen and do not serve justice 
and should be allowed, banned completely.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The consequences of criminal conduct are obvious to any intelligent person. 
It does not assist-to have persons who are the victims of criminal conduct 
spend all their time weeping in front of the jury.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I ask any reasonable and logical individual in this country to 
think about what this criminal lawyer has said. I sincerely believe 
the justice industry, the legal industry, sees victims as excess 
baggage in the process, and that is unfortunate and that is what we 
are to change here.
<P>
	Let me read into the record exactly the criteria we want and then 
I will explain why. A definition for a victim, if you can believe it, is 
not existent in this country nationally, nor is it in many provinces. 
A victim is anyone who suffers as a result of an offence, physical or 
mental injury, or economic loss, or any spouse, sibling, child or 
parent of the individual against whom the offence was perpetrated, 
or anyone who had an equivalent relationship, not necessarily a 
blood relative. That is what a victim is.
<P>
	Let us see what victims require. Victims have the right to be 
informed of their rights at every stage of the process, including 
those rights involving compensation from the offender. They must 
also be made aware of any victims' services available; not too 
much to ask.
<P>
	Second, victims have the right to be informed of the offender's 
status throughout the process, including, but not restricted to, 
notification of any arrests, upcoming court dates, sentencing dates, 
plans to release the offender from custody, including notification of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2043"> 2043 </A></B>
<P>
what  community the parolee is being released into, conditions of 
release, parole dates, et cetera. All information is to be made 
available on request.
<P>
	Third, victims have the right to choose between giving oral 
and/or written victim impact statements before sentencing at any 
parole hearings and at judicial reviews.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Fourth, victims have the right to be informed in a timely fashion 
of the details of the crown's intention to offer a plea bargain before 
it is presented to the defence; not too much to ask.
<P>
	Fifth, victims have the right to know why charges were not laid, 
if that is the decision of the crown or police.
<P>
	Sixth, victims have the right to protection from anyone who 
intimidates, harasses or interferes with the rights of the victim.
<P>
	Seventh, victims have the right to have police follow through on 
domestic violence charges. Once a victim files a complaint, police 
should have the authority to follow it through to the end.
<P>
	Eighth, victims have the right to know if a person convicted of a 
sexual offence has a sexually transmittable disease.
<P>
	I do not consider any of those difficult issues. Having worked 
with many victims since I was elected, I have come to realize that 
what they are asking for is fairness, something reasonable, 
something that gives them the feeling that they, too, are equal 
citizens to the criminal.
<P>
	Let me go back and indicate why some of these are in here. Why 
do we define a victim? Shortly after the death of Sian Simmonds, a 
young girl in my riding, I was sitting with her dad, Chris, in his 
living room. Sue, the mother, had a very difficult time after Sian 
was murdered. They were both enraged and saddened that they 
could not get any counselling assistance for Sue. Why? The 
officialdom out there said Sue was not the victim.
<P>
	If the mother of a girl who has been murdered is not a victim, 
who is? It is not the dead person, it is the remaining parents. We 
have to define what a victim is today.
<P>
	Victims have the right to be informed at every stage of the 
process. Two weeks ago on a Friday I went to a sentencing hearing 
in my riding. Tami McKenzie, the mother of the victim, was going 
to it. I asked her whether she would make an attempt at having her 
victim impact statement read into the record rather than have it go 
in through the back door where the judge reads it and puts it on file.
<P>
	She did not even know what a victim impact statement was. I had 
to tell her. I should not be telling her. There are many people in this 
country who have no idea what victim impact statements are, or 
any other part of the  process. We need a process and a commitment 
to advise victims of their rights.
<P>
	When I was watching ``To Serve and Protect'' one evening on 
television, I saw the RCMP reading rights to a criminal who bashed 
a lady who was laying on the street crying with blood on her hands. 
They were ignoring the other individual, who probably never did 
find out what her rights were. Where does she go? Who lays the 
charges? Will she go to court? If she goes to court, will she get 
assistance? Not done in this country, but it has to be.
<P>
	Victims should have the right to be informed of the offender's 
status. In my riding an lady who was separated from her husband 
found that he came home one night, threw gasoline throughout the 
house and torched it. They escaped. He got a year or so in jail and 
she specifically asked: ``Let me know if he is getting out, when he 
is getting out, the terms and conditions of getting out, where he will 
live when he does get out''. What happened? No one told her. She 
got a call and there he was out and the nightmare started again.
<P>
	This is not isolated. This is time and time again across the 
country. I am happy to see the justice minister intently listening. 
There are many victims today listening to what we have to stay in 
the House of Commons. I sincerely hope we get some answers.
<P>
	The right to choose between giving oral and written victim 
impact statements should be a common right. However, as I read 
earlier, prosecutors and defence lawyers have a very difficult time 
with victim impact statements. This is mainly because the crime is 
against the crown and not the victim. When it is, a victim is seen as 
an extra, a difficult situation for the lawyers in the trial which is 
wrong.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Victims need to be informed in a timely fashion of the details of 
the crown's intention to offer plea bargaining. I wish I had more 
time to tell the House about Allen and Debbie Wayne in my riding. 
A young offender who was currently under prohibition from 
driving stole a 4 X 4. He smashed into young Allen Junior's car, 
broke Allen Junior's two legs, his arm, his pelvis, crushed his head 
and he still does not have much of a chance of living. In fact his 
mom, Debbie, told me several weeks ago they had to make the 
decision to cut his leg off. They explicitly asked that charges not be 
plea bargained and if they were, they asked that they be told if they 
were being bargained down.
<P>
	The offender had eight charges against him. They found out from 
me and no one else that the eight charges were reduced to three 
minor charges. As a consequence this guy gets off but he is not a 
nice fellow. He was already under a prohibition from driving. What 
was he given? Fifteen months, I believe, open custody, he can go 
home; one day concurrent open custody for driving  while 
prohibited; and something like three years prohibition from driving 
which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2044"> 2044 </A></B>
<P>
he was already under in the first place. I cannot tell the House how 
sick and crushed that makes victims feel. Allen and Debbie Wayne 
today are angry and I do not blame them.
<P>
	Victims should have a right to know why charges are not laid, if 
that is the decision of the crown or the police. Is that not such a 
common sense solution to some of this? My secretary in my riding 
office had her house broken into by the same group three times last 
year. Charges were not laid. When I pursued it, and pursued it and 
pursued it again, I found out that charges were not going to be laid. 
Why? Because they were looking at some drug charges against 
these guys. She never did get charges laid against those people.
<P>
	Victims should have a right to protection from anyone who 
intimidates, harasses or interferes with their rights. Why not? The 
justice minister may say we have that in the charter of rights and 
freedoms and so on, but it is not the case. We have to put some 
emphasis on it.
<P>
	Joan in my riding was sexually assaulted with a weapon. We got 
the guy. We found out who it was and he was charged and has gone 
in. He was writing her letters. Joan is 63 years old. This fellow was 
writing letters from Vancouver remand, telephoning her and so on. 
We have got to do more in that area.
<P>
	Police must follow through on domestic violence charges. We 
only have to look at what happened in the Vernon situation. One of 
the victims went to the police and said: ``He is stalking me. He is 
going to come after me, but do not do anything because if you do, I 
am going to be murdered''. So the police did not do anything. All 
they had to do was to follow it up from there and they would have 
found out that the fellow had purchased and registered guns.
<P>
	Finally, we should know whether a person convicted of a sexual 
offence has a sexually transmittable disease. I could talk a lot about 
Jose Mendoza, and I have in the past. Tasha who was raped, not 
sexually assaulted, could not find out whether this guy had a 
sexually transmittable disease. Why? Because he did not want 
anybody to know. He did not want Tasha or anybody else to know. 
They are to keep their hands off of him.
<P>
	Well done is better than well said. We have to do the job we have 
been sent here to do. This is not a partisan issue. I sincerely hope 
the Liberals particularly the justice minister think about this. Give 
the motion an opportunity to get to the justice committee for 
consideration to work out with the attorneys general in this country 
how we can improve on a system which needs improving.
<P>
	People like Darleen Boyd, Chris and Sue Simmonds, Corinne 
and Ron Shaeffer, Chuck and Dona Cadman, Dawn and Bill 
Bakeburg, who are all people I have worked with, Debbie and Dan 
Mahaffy-Debbie is here  today-Gail and Terry Smith, Paul and 
Marilyn Cameron and millions of other Canadians are hoping a 
national victims bill of rights can happen. It can start today. It can 
start at 6.30 this evening. Let us get away from looking at the gay 
rights issue today. Let us look at victims rights. Let us make a real 
attempt to do something positive in the country.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	I will finish with a quote from Robert F. Kennedy who said it 
best: Some men see things as they are and say, why; I dream of 
things that never were and say, why not. To me that says just about 
everything on the issue. It is not impossible. There is no need for 
excuses. There is no need to say that the Reformers voted against 
Bill C-68 or any other bill. That is criminal justice legislation. 
There is a need for a commitment today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the government, the minister and all members of the House are 
very interested in doing what we can to assist the lot of victims of 
crime. We are introducing various forms of legislation.
<P>
	I wonder when so many victims rights groups across the country 
support the gun control legislation why did the Reform Party vote 
against it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, I knew this 
was going to be the approach today.
<P>
	Talk about thick. I just said that in this country we have criminal 
justice legislation which determines right from wrong. Victims 
rights legislation concerns rights people need subsequent to a crime 
being committed against them.
<P>
	Bill C-68 in our opinion had serious problems. We were looking 
for how to fight crime. That bill had flaws in it. It is not the issue 
here. That is what I am trying to get at. It is going to take all day in 
debate to get that point across because I do not think the Liberal 
MPs understand what we are talking about. We are going to try to 
keep the debate on that rather articulate level if that is possible.
<P>
	We voted against the Young Offenders Act. Why? Because it did 
not go far enough and this government knows it. And the young 
offenders are still a major problem in this country with regard to 
crime. That does not mean we disagree with victims rights. It does 
not mean that at all. In fact, we cannot develop a Young Offenders 
Act or a gun law and say that we have done it all for the victims. 
Unless the member has not heard what I just finished reading, it has 
nothing to do with it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, may I begin this afternoon by 
congratulating the hon. member for Fraser Valley West and his 
colleagues for using their opportunity today, an opposition day, to 
put this  resolution before the House of Commons. It provides us 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2045"> 2045 </A></B>
<P>
with the occasion to discuss and consider the circumstances of 
people who are too often overlooked in the criminal justice system.
<P>
	Victims have until relatively recent times been the orphans of the 
justice system. Although steps have been made toward progress in 
recent years, they have been imperfect. There remains a great deal 
to do.
<P>
	In the two and one-half years it has been my privilege to serve 
the government and the public in my present capacity, I have made 
it my business whenever the opportunity arises to meet with those 
whose lives have been touched by crime. For the most part these 
have been surviving family members of Canadians who have been 
murdered.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	I have found those meetings to be very difficult because of the 
emotions involved. Questions are often asked for which there are 
no simple responses. There is in the final analysis nothing that one 
can do, whether minister of the crown, member of Parliament, 
police officer, judge, friend or even loved one which will 
satisfactorily take the place of the person who has been lost to 
crime.
<P>
	I have had those meetings because I believe it is an important 
part of my job. It is important for persons who have lived through 
such tragedy to have the opportunity to speak directly with 
someone who must take responsibility for Canada's criminal 
justice system and to express their experiences and their 
perspective. I have had those meetings because I have learned from 
them. My own insight, my own understanding and my own 
perspective of criminal justice matters has been broadened and 
enriched from what I have learned in those encounters with 
Canadians who have had a direct, personal and very tragic 
experience with the criminal justice system.
<P>
	Let me make it clear at the outset that I do not think there is 
anyone who would contend today that the criminal justice system 
should be organized just for victims alone. Their perspective is 
important and essential. There is a great deal we can do to improve 
the system as it relates to them.
<P>
	However, the victim is not the only participant or the only 
stakeholder in the criminal justice system. There is the public, 
which has a right to see a system that is fair and balanced and 
operated for their benefit. There are the police who must walk the 
streets and take risks with their own personal safety to enforce the 
law and to assist in its prosecution. There is the offender. It is one 
of the principles of sentencing in the criminal law that we should 
strive toward rehabilitation when it is possible. Indeed the safest 
and the surest form of public protection is to rehabilitate the 
offender so that the person can return to society and not offend 
again.
<P>
	The victim's perspective is not the unique or only perspective 
when it comes to designing the criminal justice system, but it is a
<P>
very important one. As I have said, too often through insensitivity 
the interests and the personal stake of the victim are overlooked.
<P>
	I am not comfortable to simply rhyme off shopping lists of 
legislative achievements as though they were a simple answer to a 
complex question. I do not pretend that we have done as much as 
we could have, or that we have done enough to improve the 
criminal justice system in the last two and one-half years. 
However, I do think that a discussion of this issue today would be 
incomplete unless I drew attention to the efforts we have made as a 
government to improve the system as it relates to victims.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For example, we amended the Young Offenders Act with Bill 
C-37, making the victim impact statement part of the process for 
the first time.
<P>
	With Bill C-41, we amended section 745 to ensure that victims 
take part in the process of determining eligibility for parole, and we 
amended the Criminal Code concerning the victim's role in the 
process.
<P>
	With Bill C-41 we also added sections concerning restitution, 
giving victims the opportunity to recover property or money in 
restitution from the offender.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With Bill C-42 we made it easier for those who are the victims of 
domestic abuse to seek peace bonds or restraining orders to keep 
the offender away and to make it more likely that it is the abuser 
and not the victim who is taken from the matrimonial home.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In Bill C-68, which stepped up the control of firearms, we 
amended the act by adding a mandatory minimum four year prison 
sentence for anyone using a firearm to commit any of ten crimes 
listed in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	In C-72, we acted in response to the use in criminal cases of the 
defence of self-induced intoxication. We clearly stated that 
involuntary intoxication would not be allowed as a response for 
anyone accused of a violent crime against another person, and we 
changed the act after a Supreme Court of Canada decision on this 
matter.
<P>
	With Bill C-104, we added sections allowing police forces to 
take forensic DNA samples with court permission.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The DNA sample provisions in the Criminal Code for the first 
time provide expressly that police can seek permission to take 
bodily samples even without the consent of the offender to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2046"> 2046 </A></B>
<P>
tested for DNA purposes, a  measure which I may say was 
supported by my friends across the way.
<P>
	We have now before Parliament pending legislation which, 
among other things, would toughen the penalties for stalking, 
particularly where lives are taken. It deals with the victimization of 
children through juvenile prostitution by providing for stern 
minimum penitentiary terms for pimps and measures which would 
also make it easier for children to testify against their pimps when 
charges are brought.
<P>
	In addition, we will in the weeks to come bring forward, in 
collaboration with the solicitor general, measures which will 
further amend the criminal law to provide more effectively for 
those offenders who are sentenced to finite periods of 
imprisonment but who can be predicted to be at high risk to 
re-offend violently on their release. We will label for the House 
concrete proposals to change the Criminal Code so that such 
persons can be supervised for periods as long as 10 years after their 
release from prison.
<P>
	I know that the hon. member for Fraser Valley West recognizes 
that the way the criminal justice system operates in general and 
more particularly the way it treats the interests of victims is a 
shared federal and provincial responsibility. I do not say that to 
avoid the responsibility that we have federally, I accept that. But 
the administration of the criminal law, the organization of the 
courts, the manner in which prosecutions are carried on and the 
standards that the crown attorneys follow are prescribed by the 
provincial and not the federal government. Therefore, it is very 
much a shared responsibility that we must discharge together.
<P>
	The question then becomes: What is it that we can do as the 
federal participant in this system to encourage, facilitate and 
achieve the objectives that we share? I can report to the House this 
is not the first time that the issue of the treatment of victims in the 
system by both levels of government has been in issue.
<P>
	As the House may know, every year there is a meeting among the 
federal attorney general and the provincial and territorial attorneys 
general to discuss matters of common interest. This year's meeting 
is to occur here in Ottawa in about two weeks. At my request, the 
issue of victims, their place and their treatment by the criminal 
justice system has been put on the agenda for that meeting.
<P>
	It is my intention to put before my provincial and territorial 
colleagues a proposal that we reaffirm basic principles about how 
victims are treated in the system.
<P>
	In 1988, at just such a meeting, the federal and provincial 
attorneys general endorsed a statement of basic principles to 
govern the treatment of victims. I would like to read from that, if I 
may. In many ways it reflects the same principles that are contained 
in the  statement that was read by the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley West.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	In 1988 the ministers adopted this statement:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In recognition of the United Nations' Declaration of Basic Principles of 
Justice for Victims of Crime, Federal and Provincial Ministers Responsible for 
Criminal Justice agree that the following principles should guide Canadian 
society in promoting access to justice, fair treatment and provision of assistance 
for victims of crime.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Victims should be treated with courtesy, compassion and with respect for 
their dignity and privacy and should suffer the minimum of necessary 
inconvenience from their involvement with the criminal justice system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>2. Victims should receive, through formal and informal procedures, prompt 
and fair redress for the harm that they had suffered.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>3. All victims should be informed of what reparations are available to them, and 
what steps they have to take to obtain them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>4. Victims should be informed of what role they will play in the trial, the trial 
date, developments in the case, and the final court decision.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>5. Victims' opinions and concerns should be sought out, and the necessary 
assistance provided to them throughout the entire trial.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>6. When the victim's personal interests are involved, his or her opinions and 
concerns should be brought to the attention of the court, provided this is allowed 
by the rules of criminal procedure.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>7. The necessary steps should be taken, as required, to ensure the safety of 
victims and their families, and to protect them against threats or reprisals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>8. Enhanced training should be made available to sensitize criminal justice 
personnel to the needs and concerns of victims and guidelines should be 
developed, where appropriate, for this purpose.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>9. Victims should be informed of the availability of health and social services 
and other relevant assistance so that they might continue to receive the 
necessary medical, psychological and social assistance through existing 
programs and services.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>10. Victims should report the crime and co-operate with law enforcement 
authorities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the statement of basic principles that the ministers 
adopted eight years ago. I intend to put it before them again next 
month and to invite them to reaffirm those principles because to my 
eye and in my experience while those high sounding principles are 
easy to adopt, it is quite another thing to put them into practice 
every day in the courts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2047"> 2047 </A></B>
<P>
	Too often a victim is not consulted about the adjournment of 
a case. Too often the perspective of the victim is not sufficiently 
respected in dealing with matters of sentence, and too often after 
the case has left the court and the offender is taken away to serve 
the sentence, the victim is forgotten. There is no follow-up, no 
provision of services, no effort to bring to the attention of the 
victim recourses and remedies that are available.
<P>
	I will use the occasion of the meeting next month to remind my 
colleagues of those commitments made eight years ago, to canvas 
with them concrete steps that can be taken to bring those principles 
to life and methods by which we can improve on and elaborate on 
those principles.
<P>
	I undertake to the hon. member for Fraser Valley West that in 
preparation for my meeting with my colleagues, I will examine the 
statement of principles he read from this morning and determine 
how much of that statement I can add to what is in the document I 
have read from to improve it and to broaden it in its scope.
<P>
	The resolution today is a welcome opportunity to discuss an 
important subject. It is a good use of the House's time. I share the 
concern that has been expressed by the hon. member. I may not 
agree with every element of the means he has described by which 
the objectives can be achieved, but the objectives we do share.
<P>
	I also join with him in acknowledging that we have a distance to 
go before the criminal justice system serves the interests of victims 
as it should, while recognizing and emphasizing that is not the only 
perspective we must keep in mind.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	I wish to tell the hon. member for Fraser Valley West that we will 
be happy to support his resolution and have the justice committee 
look at this issue. I will bring to the committee whatever might 
arise from my meetings with the provincial and territorial ministers 
so that together, in a fashion that is not partisan but is co-operative, 
we can act to improve the circumstances and improve the criminal 
justice system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
what I heard was encouraging. I believe what I heard is that tonight 
we will see a positive vote from the Liberal government to move 
victims' rights into committee with the intent of developing a 
national bill of rights. That is good. That is what we are asking for.
<P>
	I know that the minister meets with a lot of victims. I guess I 
come from the old school says that well done is better than well 
said; seeing is believing and that sort of thing.
<P>
	The minister read a statement of principles from 1988. While 
those principles may be a statement they are not practised today in 
Canada. That is the point that we are  trying to make. That is why 
we are going down this road, to ensure that they are practised. I 
could give a litany of cases to cover what I have just said.
<P>
	The minister talks about Bills C-68 and C-69 and section 745. 
That is another issue and we will get to it. Today we are talking 
about specifics on items like the mere and simple fact of advising 
victims of what their rights are. Surely it is not a 1988 statement of 
principles in the United Nations or anywhere else in this world 
which dictates that. Common sense dictates that. That is not a 
difficult process to do today.
<P>
	Since the Liberals have indicated they are going to vote for this 
tonight, we will doggedly follow through on those issues. It is not 
good enough anymore to say we will. It must be done.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister again to confirm that he will be 
voting for this, in fact, that the Liberal government will be voting 
for this motion tonight. If that is the case, then we can proceed now 
with the debate on how to implement this and the effects of the 
eight items plus the definition of a victim. The minister talks a lot 
about the legislation, victims and so on but a victim is not even 
defined, so who are we talking about? What is a victim? I would 
like to get confirmation from the minister that the Liberal 
government will be voting for the motion tonight.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Madam Speaker, may I make my position clear. I am 
going to support this resolution tonight. I think it will be a free vote 
on our side of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> You think it will be? Good, good.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> The practice or the habit on this side of the House has 
been to invite members to vote as they see fit. I have no difficulty 
supporting this resolution in matters of this kind whether it is a 
resolution or a private member's bill.
<P>
	I do not regard reference to other legislation that we have 
introduced as beside the point. I do not pretend it is enough but I 
also do not think that the discussion is complete unless we refer to 
it.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act, Bill C-37, allowed for the first time, 
and it was quite remarkable, victim impact statements to be 
introduced. I am sure the hon. members would agree with that 
proposition.
<P>
	In Bill C-41, section 745 was amended to permit the victims to 
participate in the hearing. That arose directly out of a meeting I had 
with Marie King Forrest whose husband was a Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police officer in Saskatchewan who was murdered. The 
offender was bringing a 745 application and she was not able to 
take part. As a result of that, I amended Bill C-41 to include a 
specific provision that would add to section 745 of the code a 
statement that victims' perspectives must be taken into account 
when those applications are brought.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2048"> 2048 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	In the case of Daviault and the Supreme Court of Canada, where 
there was self-induced excessive intoxication, there was an 
allegation of sexual assault. There was a victim in that case. In the 
name of that case and the name of the principle for which we felt 
we should stand, we introduced Bill C-72 to say self-induced 
intoxication should not and cannot be an answer in that 
circumstance. That involved a victim.
<P>
	In the DNA bill, Bill C-104, I remember Mr. Manning being on 
the Hill a year ago and bringing his circumstances as a victim very 
forcefully to our attention. He and other victims were the 
beneficiary of that legislation.
<P>
	I do not agree with the hon. member that the legislative steps that 
have been taken are separate, because they are very much a part of 
serving the cause of justice, including the perspective of victims, 
and I say they very much reflect the commitment of the 
government to that cause.
<P>
	Many references the hon. member makes quite correctly to the 
ways the system falls short in being fair to victims have to do with 
administration and therefore provincial responsibility. Provinces 
across the country are having to reduce expenditures because of 
fiscal restraints. Crown attorneys are being laid off, court staff is 
being diminished and services are being reduced.
<P>
	One challenge we will face in living up to the statement of 
principles adopted eight years ago is to achieve the principles with 
diminished resources. I emphasize for my friends opposite and for 
the House that it is a very important part of all this. Whether we 
have the resources federally and provincially to provide the kind of 
services that are required will be a challenge. It will mean giving 
priority to these efforts and reallocating money from other 
purposes. I believe it is the right thing to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
compliment the Minister of Justice on the flowing rhetoric and 
great words he used in terms of describing victims and supporting 
my colleague's motion today.
<P>
	My concern is the historical difference with this Liberal 
government since it has been in power between the works it uses 
and the impression and perception it gives to the Canadian public 
that it is doing something good when the reality is it does not go far 
enough and does not tackle the problem head on.
<P>
	I like his analogy to victims being the orphans of the justice 
system. Then he goes on to reaffirm his personal belief of the basic 
principles for victims and he read off a list that is eight years old. 
He talked about how he is to recommend this list once again at the 
provincial meeting.
<P>
	My concern is that these principles are not legislation. What we 
need is legislation. My colleague's motion today  is a step toward
<P>
bringing about change in the law, legislation that will protect 
victims. That is the endorsement we are seeking.
<P>
	I would like to know if the minister at those meetings will be 
getting the provincial justice ministers on board to changing the 
laws in the country by introducing federal legislation which will 
then be endorsed by provincial legislations to have a victims' bill 
of rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Madam Speaker, the problem with the principles of 
1988 is not their age. The problem is the extent to which they may 
or may not have been acted on. What we are talking about today are 
principles. We are not talking about specific legislation.
<P>
	There were concrete steps taken after 1988. After those 
principles were adopted the Criminal Code was amended to add 
provisions for the identification and prompt return of property to 
victims from whom it had been improperly taken; prohibitions on 
the publications of the identity of certain victims; the use of victim 
impact statements; the imposition of a victim fine surcharge and 
restitution provisions. There were steps taken after 1988.
<P>
	Where we find common ground today is that those principles are 
fine. They may even be improved on by the form of words used by 
the hon. member for Fraser Valley West. We will look at that, but 
not enough has been done to respect and to act on those principles.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	I made reference to some legislation that we have introduced. 
There is no doubt more can be done and we have a willingness to do 
it. The important thing is to bring those principles to life in the way 
we write the law and in the way we administer it. On that we have 
common ground.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
today the Reform Party is tabling a motion urging the government 
to direct the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs to 
proceed with the drafting of a victims' charter of rights. Indeed, 
Reformers are really asking for a charter of rights.
<P>
	First, I submit that this an issue that comes mainly under 
provincial jurisdiction. I want to make this very clear, and I will 
elaborate on that point.
<P>
	On December 13, 1993, Quebec passed the Crime Victims 
Compensation Act, to replace the Act respecting assistance for 
victims of crime.
<P>
	The act provides for the payment of various forms of 
compensation to victims of criminal acts, including income 
replacement benefits, academic retardation benefits, loss of 
physical or psychological integrity allowance, bereavement 
allowance, and also an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2049"> 2049 </A></B>
<P>
allowance for supporting a child born following a criminal offence 
of a sexual nature. The act also provides for the refund of certain 
costs related to personal assistance and  rehabilitation, as well as 
for the administrative support required for its implementation.
<P>
	An office and an assistance fund were set up. Thanks to this 
assistance fund, help centres were established in various districts to 
comfort victims and to support them throughout the judicial 
process. The Commission de la santé et de la sécurité du travail was 
given a mandate to administer this act. This commission has 
regional offices.
<P>
	The Reform Party is also proposing that consultations be 
initiated with the provinces to arrive at a national standard for its 
proposed victims' charter of rights. This is unacceptable, since this 
is essentially an area of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	First, a national standard can only be arrived at in an area of 
exclusive federal jurisdiction, such as defence, bankruptcy and 
insolvency, divorce, postal services, unemployment insurance, 
aboriginal issues, the Criminal Code, criminal law, banks, weights 
and measures.
<P>
	Beyond these explicitly listed areas in section 91 of the British 
North America Act, any action by this House is likely to be 
opposed by the provinces, unless it is in an open or vacant field, or 
unless the proposed legislation is ancillary to legislation in an area 
listed under section 91 of the 1867 BNA Act.
<P>
	This House may enact any ancillary provision required to 
provide effective and complete legislation. However, it can only 
legislate on the rights of victims in an indirect fashion, that is 
through legislation concerning an area expressly mentioned in 
section 91.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Is this a question of national interest? Certainly not. However, 
the federal government may intervene and does so within these 
areas of jurisdiction. Thus, the Criminal Code and the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act contain provisions aimed specifically 
at victims of crime.
<P>
	One of the provisions of the Criminal Code is that trials and 
preliminary hearings may be heard in camera, that a court may 
make an order restricting publicity in order to protect the identity 
of witnesses in proceedings involving sexual offences or in which 
violence is alleged to have been used, threatened or attempted.
<P>
	Other provisions allow videotapes to be used in place of the 
testimony of a witness, or certain testimony to be given outside the 
courtroom so that a witness will not have to appear before an 
accused.
<P>
	These provisions, furthermore, are the subject of two bills 
recently introduced in the House, Bill C-27 and Bill C-217, which I 
myself tabled. If passed, these bills will further ease the testimony 
of victims of crime.
<P>
	The Criminal Code also provides that a court may, on the 
application of a person aggrieved, at the time sentence is imposed, 
order the accused to pay that person an amount by way of 
satisfaction or compensation for  loss of or damage to property 
suffered by that person as a result of the commission of the offence.
<P>
	The Corrections and Conditional Release Act provides that a 
victim may provide information for use by the Parole Board in 
determining whether an offender will be granted parole and under 
what conditions. In addition, the Board or the Correctional Service 
shall, at the request of a victim, disclose to him certain 
information, such as the date of commencement and length of the 
sentence, and the dates on which an inmate becomes eligible to be 
released on unescorted temporary absence or parole.
<P>
	Other information may be disclosed when, in the opinion of the 
chairperson or the commissioner of corrections, the interest of the 
victim outweighs any invasion of the offender's privacy that could 
result from the disclosure. Such information includes the 
following: If the person is being detained, the penitentiary where 
he is incarcerated, the date of any anticipated hearing, the type and 
date of release, the destination of the inmate, and the conditions of 
his release.
<P>
	Many victims would rather turn the page and try to forget this 
tragic episode in their lives. Out of respect for them, the Parole 
Board and the Correctional Service do not automatically send 
information to the victims, who must make a written request if they 
wish to obtain such information.
<P>
	In short, the current situation does not warrant the measure 
proposed by the Reform Party. The provinces are in a better 
position to protect the victims of criminal acts, and they can do so 
in a manner that better reflects their particular environment. This is 
not to say that the federal Minister of Justice should stop 
continuing to improve the law in areas that can affect victims of 
criminal acts.
<P>
	Given that this is a matter that comes essentially under 
provincial jurisdiction, and that the provinces, including Quebec, 
have already legislated this area, we oppose the motion of the 
Reform Party.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with my colleague from 
Nanaimo-Cowichan. I would like to express my thanks for the 
opportunity to rise today and address the motion to introduce a 
victims' bill of rights.
<P>
	Every act of violence touches each one of us. It crosses party 
lines, gender lines, cultural, sociolinguistic and economic lines. 
Our concern is the reality that brings us together as we all struggle 
with the infuriating, frustrating and heart wrenching results of 
violent crime.
<P>
	While all aspects of this bill of rights are of great significance, as 
critic to the department of status of women I am particularly 
concerned with issues that address victims of domestic violence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2050"> 2050 </A></B>
<P>
	Since my election to Parliament I have seen any number of 
times the consequences of a justice system that neglects the 
welfare of victims of crime. These consequences are particularly 
stark and devastating for the victims of violent crime and domestic 
violence. The following will bring to light how devastating, as I 
share with members a few of the numerous cases I have dealt with 
in my riding of Calgary Southeast.
<P>
	These cases specifically involve domestic violence including 
pedophilia and stalking. The sensitivity and confidential nature of 
some of these cases means I will not make reference to the names 
of the constituents concerned except for the case of Helen Leadley. 
Helen has courageously brought her story to the public, and 
Parliament is already familiar with it.
<P>
	In early 1994 Helen Leadley approached our office for 
assistance. Her concern was that a convicted violent offender by 
the name of Robert Paul Thompson was up for parole in 1995 and 
she feared for the safety of her family. She explained to me that 
Thompson had been convicted for the murder of her daughter, his 
common law wife, Brenda Fitzgerald. Mr. Thompson's record 
dated back to 1969. The crime of murder, for which he is currently 
serving time, he committed while on a day pass from the Bow 
Valley correctional institute where he had been incarcerated for two 
counts of hit and run. Thompson was caught, found guilty by a jury 
trial and put in jail for his crime.
<P>
	Helen and her grandchildren have never had the opportunity to 
go on with normal lives. Helen would spend the next 10 years 
fearing for the life of her family. Thompson sent death threats to 
Helen and her family promising that once released, and he remains 
quite confident that he will be released, he would follow through on 
these threats.
<P>
	While Thompson is being provided for by the state, Leadley 
family members live in fear for their lives, never able to put the 
tragedy of Brenda's death to rest, as they have spent countless 
hours agonizing over and working to prevent Thompson's release.
<P>
	On June 13, 1995 I attended Thompson's parole hearing in 
Renous, New Brunswick. There I was able to present a written 
statement to the parole board on Helen's behalf requesting that 
Thompson serve his full life sentence. Helen was denied 
permission to make any verbal statement to the parole board. As 
unimaginable as that ruling is, it remains that victims are not 
permitted to speak during the parole hearing.
<P>
	Fortunately the board ruled against Thompson's release but he 
will be allowed to apply again and again in the years to come until 
he is successful.
<P>
	As Helen works valiantly to keep the shattered pieces of her 
family life together, she must also find the strength to go on 
fighting to secure her own protection because the state seems 
incapable of doing that. When will she be  free from this burden? 
As long as we continue to neglect the victims of crime, people like 
Helen will continue to live in fear and sorrow.
<P>
	More recently, another constituent came to see me, this time for 
assistance in protecting her family against a sex offender who had 
sexually abused not only her daughter but six other little girls 
including his two daughters. The individual in question was 
convicted on seven counts of sexual assault three years ago, 
sentenced to nine years in prison but became eligible for early 
parole this past February, ludicrous as that may be.
<P>
	The constituent asked that I attend the parole hearing at the 
Bowden Institution in Alberta. Once again neither the victims nor 
their parents were allowed a voice at the hearings. In this case the 
decision was made in favour of society and the victims, as the 
offender was denied earlier parole.
<P>
	However, the positive outcome was outweighed by the 
uncertainty felt by the victims as they awaited the process as well 
as the emotional anguish of having to relive the violation as they 
revisited the horrible memories of the crime. The very intrusive 
representation by the pedophile as he used this hearing to absolve 
himself was truly offensive.
<P>
	I will share with members the story of a family haunted by a 
former spouse who while in prison issued death threats to his 
ex-wife and her husband. The offender in question was scheduled 
for release sometime around April 4, 1996. Authorities informed 
me that in all likelihood his release would be granted. I was 
informed by those same authorities that this man is capable of 
following through on his threats. He has been diagnosed with 
degenerative personality disorder, a disease that causes him to 
become increasingly aggressive and increasingly dangerous.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	This offender has made threats against me and my staff in the 
constituency office. When I contacted the RCMP to find out what 
could be done to protect not only my constituents from this 
dangerous man but also me and my staff, I was told that until he 
reoffends there is not much that can be done short of surveillance. 
While our justice system fulfilled its promise to release the 
criminal as scheduled, it continues to neglect the very real and 
overwhelming threats to the lives of its victims and the rest of our 
community.
<P>
	In light of the above, I take this opportunity to express my 
support for the victims' bill of rights. For too long we have worked 
to protect the accused at the expense of the victims. While I 
understand the need to ensure the accused are treated with fairness 
under our laws, must it be done at the expense of those innocent 
individuals who have already experienced abuse and humiliation 
and who have to suffer the further insecurity of never knowing if 
they will ever be safe again?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2051"> 2051 </A></B>
<P>
	How much longer will we buy into the argument that what is 
needed above every possible consideration is rehabilitation? What 
of protection for our citizens? What of making individuals 
accountable for their actions? What of the rights of the victims 
and of potential victims in society? It is time to stop giving 
priority to criminals and violent offenders who prey on our 
families and children.
<P>
	As we see cases of domestic violence increasing we must ask 
what are we doing to alter effectively that reality. While I am a 
strong advocate of prevention and the incorporation of preventive 
measures to curb the tide of the growing number of violent offences 
being perpetrated within families, I also believe it is well past the 
time that we put in place effective measures to respond to the needs 
of the growing numbers of victims in the nation.
<P>
	As we can see from these real life examples, victims are not 
being accorded the protection they need or even a say in the 
process.
<P>
	Domestic violence presents particular problems for the criminal 
justice system. Some of the most violent crime in our communities 
is committed in the home by close family friends and family 
members. Unfortunately children and women bear a 
disproportionate amount of this aggression.
<P>
	In one of the most widely referred to studies on domestic 
violence, a 1993 government publication entitled ``Changing the 
Landscape: Ending Violence-Achieving Equality'' found that 34 
per cent of Canadian women have experienced a physical assault 
from a partner in an intimate relationship. Five per cent of the 
women reported being threatened, 39 per cent were sexually 
assaulted, while 50 per cent of Canadian women say they have been 
abused in some way. A shocking 45 per cent of women have faced 
violence at the hands of husbands or boyfriends they live with.
<P>
	Children have also been the target of abuse and violence. What is 
equally damaging for children is the relationship that exists 
between the witnessing of violent domestic abuse and the 
probability of becoming abusive later in life. Government of 
Canada research illustrates that children who witness violence, 
especially against a mother, are more likely to be abusive as adults. 
This is tremendously troubling, considering that 39 per cent of 
women have reported that their children were witnesses to violent 
acts committed against themselves.
<P>
	This points to a growing crisis that has dangerous social 
implications for Canadian society. One of the problems in 
overcoming domestic violence is the inability to break the cycle of 
repeat abuse after a conviction has been made and a sentence has 
been served. Ex-convicts regularly attempt to re-establish contact 
with former spouses or family members with devastating effects. 
Oftentimes victims are not aware their abusers are not back on the 
street. They show up unannounced,  occasionally with violent 
intentions. Victims should be notified when a convicted abuser is 
freed from jail so they may take precautions to protect themselves 
and their children against repeat aggression.
<P>
	Again, there is an imbalance here, which the Minister of Justice 
suggested a few moments ago. The criminal justice system in my 
view must become more focused on protecting victims from 
harassment and intimidation.
<P>
	The victims' bill of rights challenges the criminal justice system 
to follow through, from beginning to end, charges related to 
domestic violence. The system has learned to effectively take into 
consideration the rights of the accused and the convicted, but it has 
no corresponding capacity to link the victims of crime to the 
process of justice. Without question a victims' bill of rights would 
have a positive effect in redressing the imbalance which presently 
exists.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I thank the hon. member for her comments. I join with her, as do all 
members, to discuss and debate what can be done to assist victims 
within the criminal justice system.
<P>
	A statement of principles was adopted in 1988 by the federal and 
provincial attorneys general and ministers of justice. Since that 
time concrete legislative steps have been taken at the federal level 
and in some cases at the provincial level to assist victims of crimes.
<P>
	At the federal level we have implemented such legislation as Bill 
C-68, gun control measures with the universal registration system 
in place. Those who have been victims of violence from a spouse 
through court process can initiate proceedings. The police when 
guns and firearms are registered will be able to seize the firearms 
of a person who has threatened or assaulted another.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to explain, when we are all doing 
our best and what we can within the federal purview to assist 
victims, why the Reform Party would vote against the registration 
of firearms, which would make the world a safer place for victims.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Madam Speaker, at issue 
today is the victims' bill of rights. The Minister of Justice 
expressed in his delivery the appreciation for the broader debate 
that does cross partisan lines.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for his comment but it seems he has a 
singular focus today on the very flawed legislation of Bill C-68. 
That is all I will to say with respect to that question. Some elements 
of it are very good and there was certainly an indication of that on 
our side of the House, but some elements of it are very wrong 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2052"> 2052 </A></B>
<P>
minded, create great inequities, are totally unfair and  have very 
little merit in terms of addressing the issue of crime in Canada 
today.
<P>
	I am a copious note taker. I was at the parole board hearing in 
Bowden, Alberta on February 29 when the pedophile I mentioned 
in my speech presented his arguments and his remorse. It was a 
very self-centred presentation to the parole board hearing. All of us 
sat in silence, as we were requested to do by the parole board.
<P>
	If concrete steps have been taken, as the hon. member has 
suggested, in addressing the issues of victims, which cover a host 
of areas, I would be most happy to photocopy for him the dozen or 
so pages I have that clearly point out that in spite of the concrete 
steps he believes may have been taken they really do little to 
address the issue.
<P>
	When we have someone who has been incarcerated and has 
taken a homecoming program to address his inner child, a human 
sexuality course to address his sense of relationship, stress 
management courses, an alternative islands program, self-esteem 
programs, grief recovery programs, I would like to ask the hon. 
member, and I certainly will in private, exactly what has been done 
for the victims of the man who committed these horrendous crimes 
against seven little girls.
<P>
	I would like him to explain the concrete steps that have been 
taken by the government to address the whole issue of victims and 
the pathetic attempt to address the issue of the resources they have 
no access to and the ridiculous matter he raises of gun control with 
respect to a victims' bill of rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today and speak on this motion before 
us advocating a victims' bill of rights. It might be appropriate for 
me to remind everyone of what the motion states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House urge the government to direct the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs to proceed with the drafting of a victims' bill of rights, 
and that, in such areas where the committee determines a right to be more 
properly a provincial concern, the Minister of Justice initiate consultations with 
the provinces aimed at arriving at a national standard for a victims' bill of 
rights.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	I am very pleased to note that this is a votable motion.
<P>
	It is a timely and long overdue initiative which seeks to establish 
the rights of victims and their families as a cornerstone of our 
judicial system. That it has not been attempted in any substantive 
or meaningful way by the government is a sad commentary on its 
lack of commitment to safer streets and communities, although I 
am heartened by some of the words I heard the Minister of Justice 
speak in addressing this motion a short while ago.
<P>
	Some colleagues across the way will no doubt disagree with 
some of what we say on this issue. I also expect some  of them will 
vote against these proposals. If they listen, I am confident that our 
discussion today will draw attention to the subject of victims 
rights. In doing so, it is my hope to provide a voice in the House to 
the thousands of people who are the real sufferers of crime each 
year, the victims.
<P>
	Victims for the purpose of this initiative also include the families 
of the persons against whom the offence was perpetrated. For them 
there is sometimes no escape from their suffering. All victims will 
bear the psychological scars of their ordeals for years to come.
<P>
	While a victims bill of rights may not address all their concerns, 
the measure contained in this initiative in part would allow them a 
say before every legal proceeding that deals with the disposition of 
an accused. It is on this aspect of the victims bill of rights that I 
would like to spend the remainder of my time.
<P>
	Clause 3 of the proposed bill declares that every victim has the 
right to choose between giving an oral and/or a written victim 
impact statement before sentencing, before parole hearings and 
before any judicial review. Simply put, victims and their families 
are not presently guaranteed the right to make oral impact 
statements at the trial of an accused, yet the accused seems to have 
every right.
<P>
	If accepted, this bill of rights would ensure that a victim could 
choose to make such a statement at each stage where the legal 
system deals with the accused or the convicted. It would also allow 
them to determine if they want to give that statement verbally, in 
writing, or both. I do not think that is an unreasonable proposal.
<P>
	Being allowed to do both is significant. It would prevent the 
courts from altering or editing a written victim impact statement. 
That was done to the statement submitted by Mrs. Mahaffy in the 
trial of Paul Bernardo. In that case, Mrs. Mahaffy submitted a 
statement only to find that it had been edited to the point that it no 
longer reflected what she wanted said about her daughter's death 
and the impact it had on her family.
<P>
	The bill does not stop there. The bill would also allow a victim 
and their family to make a verbal impact statement at the parole 
hearing of a convicted criminal. In this regard, I will share with 
members in this House the tragic experience of a constituent of 
mine.
<P>
	Her name is Inge Claussen. Many in my riding of 
Nanaimo-Cowichan will know her as my very capable 
constituency assistant in Duncan. Seventeen years ago, Mrs. 
Claussen's teenage daughter was abducted and brutally murdered. 
An individual with a known criminal history was subsequently 
charged and convicted of the crime.
<P>
	Now, 15 years after being sentenced, this person-no, not 
person-this animal is now scheduled for a section 745 parole 
hearing asking for early release. Meanwhile the family of the slain 
girl does not have the ability to  give a verbal impact statement at a 
parole hearing, after which this animal could be put back on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2053"> 2053 </A></B>
<P>
street where again it will have the opportunity to prey on more 
innocent children.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I sincerely hope no one should every have to endure the horror 
this woman and her surviving family had to go through. Sadly 
though, given reality, I must expect there is still a possibility of 
that.
<P>
	Rather than contribute to the pain and anguish of the victims and 
their families, rather than sully the memory of those victims killed, 
every effort should be made to give them a voice.
<P>
	In the case of parole hearings, the right to make an oral victim 
impact statement should be guaranteed, if only to serve as a 
poignant reminder of the impact the offence had on a victim and the 
victim's family. Just as important, such measures should ensure 
victims of crime are treated as something more than observers of 
the judicial process. In point of fact, it would allow them to be 
active participants with something relevant to say, something 
beyond what happened during the commission of the offence.
<P>
	Victim impact statements allow an individual to share with the 
court and for that matter share with the accused what the crime has 
done to them. It makes all involved acutely aware of the suffering 
endured by the victim and the victim's family. The catharsis of 
being able to do so helps in the healing process of the victim and 
allows them to form some semblance of closure on the incident.
<P>
	However if the past actions of this government are any 
indication, we are not likely to see the reforms we want as they are 
outlined today any time soon. I hope from the words of the minister 
today I am wrong in saying that.
<P>
	As I reflect upon this government's effort in the area of criminal 
reform addressing the rights of the victim, I am not encouraged. 
The approach used seemingly and invariably puts the rights of the 
accused ahead of the victim.
<P>
	In recent years this country's criminal justice system has fallen 
into disrepute among Canadians. Increasingly, there exists a 
cynical opinion among many people that justice in this country is 
spelled and hence viewed in two different ways. There is ``justice'' 
which is viewed and spelled in the traditional way and incorporates 
the sacrosanct ideals of equality and fairness. Then there is ``just 
us'', the albeit harsh reality exploited by defence attorneys and 
their clients that the only people entitled to the principles of justice 
are the accused.
<P>
	Sadly, recent tinkering with the Criminal Code has done nothing 
except enhance this unfortunate perception among Canadians. Real 
reform and leadership is needed on the issue. Only courage by 
legislators in this House will set things right.
<P>
	I want to end my remarks by urging members opposite to put 
aside any partisan beliefs they might have and consider very 
seriously what is being proposed here. At the heart of this effort is a 
sincere attempt to assist victims of crime and to put more justice 
into the justice system.
<P>
	When we vote on this motion, it does not have to necessarily be 
about winning or losing. As long as we work from the premise that 
these measures would benefit all Canadians who might one day 
find themselves victimized by crime, we will have accomplished 
something.
<P>
	I ask members from all parties to join with me and support the 
initiative before the House today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the statements made by the hon. member 
refer to justice as being fairness, equality and the protection of 
victims rights. I take it then the hon. member feels that is the 
appropriate way to deal with it, since we want to treat people 
equally.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	In dealing with amendments such as sexual orientation, human 
rights legislation or amendments to the Criminal Code and the 
treatment of people in the criminal justice system, justice is the 
equal treatment of people, not preference for one group or another, 
but equal treatment. Does the hon. member feel that the justice he 
quotes, and not ``just us'', refers to members of gay communities as 
well as heterosexual communities and their equal treatment in all 
aspects of law, sentencing and in human rights legislation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Madam Speaker, I certainly believe in justice for 
everyone.
<P>
	The member in his intervention really is trying to take our focus 
off the motion before us to say now that the rights of the gay 
community are coming up, can we get a commitment from the 
member. Justice is justice. I do not think we should single out any 
particular group and say they should be given special rights. We are 
saying justice for all.
<P>
	The issue before us today is justice for the victims of crime as 
opposed to the continued over justice for the perpetrators of crime. 
That is what I would like us to zero in on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, before I commence the formal part of my address, let me 
simply add that all members in the House know of some event or 
some circumstance which has impacted either on them or on close 
friends whereby the victim has had some long term scarring and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2054"> 2054 </A></B>
<P>
would appear  to have had very little public recourse in terms of 
addressing that level of hurt.
<P>
	My colleague for Erie who will be sharing my time with me, will 
be adding to my comments today. I personally support the thrust of 
the proposal members opposite are making today.
<P>
	Throughout the country over many years there have been 
attempts to put something in place. Manitoba has had some pilot 
projects on victims services. I am sure that is true of other parts of 
the nation as well. Various municipalities have engaged personnel 
to attempt to assist a family or the victim of a crime, whether it be 
vandalism, theft, or some other sort of violation. A system has been 
put in place because of the difficulty in handling life after the fact.
<P>
	The hon. member's concern for victims of crime is very 
admirable. We have often heard the public criticize the judicial 
system for placing the rights of the offender ahead of the rights of 
victims. That was addressed to some degree by the previous 
member with regard to justice for all. One cannot defend one side 
or the other on that one.
<P>
	I agree that more needs to be done to protect the rights of a 
victim. I would also emphasize that we must be cautious. It is not to 
imply that one way to achieve protection of a victim is to diminish 
the rights of an offender. Therein lies the tricky part; not to allow 
the legislation currently in place in human rights legislation or in 
the charter.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	We would ask ourselves whether there is a necessary trade off 
between competing rights. Is justice better served by somehow 
reducing the rights of an accused person? The emergence of the 
victims' rights movement in Canada is one of the most important 
criminal justice trends we have seen in the last 20 years. Yet I doubt 
any victim organization in Canada would advocate eliminating the 
right of an accused to a fair trial, the right of due process, the 
protection of habeas corpus or the protection of an accused against 
self-incrimination. Do I need to remind the House there are rights 
guaranteed to all Canadians under sections 7, 10 and 11 of the 
charter of rights and freedoms?
<P>
	I will not dwell on this matter of comparing the rights of the 
accused with the rights of the victim, but this may be necessary in 
considering the content of a bill of rights. I believe a more 
constructive approach is simply put to determine where and how 
the victim should be involved in the criminal justice process.
<P>
	The concept we should embrace is access to justice for the 
victim. At what point in the criminal justice process does the 
victim deserve to have input? There were some suggestions in my 
colleague's speech and I would not attempt to diminish the thrust 
my colleague was putting forward.
<P>
	However, are there various points along the process where we 
can examine with close scrutiny where access should be made? 
Should there be input to the police, to the investigation, to the trial 
of the accused, at the sentencing stage and later at the parole 
decision making stage and finally when the offender is released 
from custody assuming that guilt is determined in the issue?
<P>
	If we can provide the victim or the victim's family with 
appropriate access to the criminal process in a timely fashion, 
maybe we can be a little less concerned about who has more or who 
has fewer rights.
<P>
	Let us examine the progress made over the last two decades both 
in terms of general recognition of the needs of the victim and 
specific measures. Much of the policy and programs dealing with 
the victims is derived from a report by a federal-provincial task 
force on justice for victims of crime in the early 1980s, which 
offered 79 recommendations to both levels of government for 
improving social criminal justice and health responses to victims 
of crime.
<P>
	In 1985 Canada co-sponsored the United Nations declaration of 
basic principles of justice for victims of crime. It was widely and 
universally accepted that Canada was a leader in this movement. 
This document soon became the basis for a unique Canadian 
statement of principles. This statement was endorsed by the federal 
government, the provinces and the territories in 1988. It has 
provided a reference point for provinces to develop their own 
policy and legislation on victims' rights, and most jurisdictions 
now have victims oriented legislation.
<P>
	It is important to note provinces' perspectives since provinces' 
responsibility for the administration of justice means that not all 
access to justice issues are under federal control.
<P>
	The law now provides for victim impact statements. Section 735 
permits provinces to determine the forum for the victim impact 
statement in their jurisdiction. In effect this provision creates 
flexibility, for example, by allowing police based victim witness 
service programs to generate victim impact statements or 
alternatively crown or court based services as appropriate.
<P>
	Victim fine surcharge provisions were also added to the Criminal 
Code by Bill C-89. The victim fine surcharge is an additional 
monetary penalty imposed on an offender at the time of sentencing. 
A victim fine surcharge is required to be imposed in addition to any 
other punishment imposed on an offender convicted or discharged 
of a Criminal Code offence or an offence under part III or part IV of 
the Food and Drug Act.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	In addition to these surcharges, several provinces have passed 
legislation to impose a victim's surcharge on provincial offences 
and this revenue may also be used for victims' services in those 
provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2055"> 2055 </A></B>
<P>
	I will do my personal best to bring forward concerns and 
information which will support this thrust by members opposite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to ask the member exactly what he meant when he said 
do not let what we do for victims interfere with what we need to do 
for criminals. A statement like that bothers me when we are 
addressing victims' rights. Is he fearful that criminals will lose 
rights because of our efforts?
<P>
	Numerous victims' groups have been formed across the land. 
There is FACT, Families Against Crime Today, which is led by Stu 
Garrioch in Calgary. There is CAVEAT, which I am sure everyone 
is familiar with. There is CRY in British Columbia. There is the 
Move the Rock group. There is the kid brother campaign in 
southern Ontario. There are thousands of people who belong to 
victims' groups. The one thing they tell me is they would really 
like to return to having some sort of a life; if only the government 
would listen.
<P>
	This government has been here two and a half years. These 
groups are increasing. Would the hon. member comment on why he 
thinks these groups are continually growing and why these people 
cannot return to their previous lifestyles.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Madam Speaker, the member opposite raised 
two very legitimate concerns.
<P>
	It was not my intent to create the impression that we need not 
worry about the victim, that we need worry only about the 
perpetrator. The point I was making is we have to be cautious in 
carrying through with our fundamental legal positions in 
legislation and in the charter of rights and freedoms so that victims' 
rights are not seen as removing the rights of offenders.
<P>
	The second comment concerned the growing number of victims' 
organizations. The member was adding to the number of persons 
involved in those organizations. Those organizations are 
symptomatic of the communications industry and how it has been 
growing throughout the country. Nothing happens in Vernon, as an 
example, that we do not hear about instantaneously throughout the 
nation or throughout the world.
<P>
	I have a daughter in Australia. We have already had 
communications from that area because of the massacre that 
happened there yesterday.
<P>
	Let us not refocus the impact. We are simply attempting to 
ensure victims and their families have some involvement in the 
total criminal justice system. It is for that reason that I support the 
member opposite in his opinions.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, at the outset I 
wish to advise that I will support this initiative by my Reform 
colleagues and will vote in favour of it.
<P>
	I will endeavour to take a different approach in my remarks in 
support of this position. I am pleased to address the House on this 
motion for a bill of rights for victims because it is crime that 
creates victims. I take this opportunity to look at the collective 
measures all sections of society can take to give further importance 
to the prevention of crime and victimization.
<P>
	Crime prevention, particularly through social development and 
multi-disciplinary approaches, addresses the underlying causes of 
criminality and victimization and can provide long term safety and 
security.
<P>
	In Canada the need to prevent crime meaningfully is mobilizing 
every sector of society, starting with citizens and the grassroot 
organizations, service providers, the private sector and all levels of 
government.
<P>
	No country or community is immune from crime and its 
devastating effects. However, a growing body of knowledge is 
emerging with respect to comprehensive strategies, and this 
information can assist communities that want to take action. There 
is knowledge on how to mobilize our institutions and our citizens 
and develop a partnership effort on assessing social, situational and 
other factors associated with crime, planning and co-ordinating a 
multi-disciplinary approach.
<P>
	For a crime prevention plan to be truly representative and 
responsive to local crime problems, the community should be 
involved at all stages and in all aspects. It has been established that 
the greater the degree of community participation and solidarity in 
addressing social and crime related problems, the higher the level 
of urban security.
<P>
	The need for close co-operation between governments and 
communities and for the establishment of broad coalitions of all 
those concerned with crime problems cannot be stressed strongly 
enough.
<P>
	A meaningful strategy for the prevention of crime and 
victimization encompasses four key elements. First, crime 
prevention through social development consists of a 
comprehensive approach to systemic crime prevention through 
social development which targets the combination of social, 
personal, educational and economical factors which place 
individuals at risk and contribute to crime.
<P>
	Our research suggests the various aspects and causes of criminal 
behaviour share common characteristics such as personal, familial 
and social breakdown. A social intervention approach, which seeks 
actions through policies, programs and services already present in 
the social development field such as social housing, health, 
education, income security and social services, may lessen the 
factors which may lead a person to crime.
<P>
	The second is crime prevention through community 
mobilization. The involvement of all sectors of the community in 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2056"> 2056 </A></B>
<P>
planning and implementation process  of crime prevention 
strategies must be an integral part of crime prevent. Community 
safety and crime prevention strategies should address factors 
associated with the prevention of crime and the needs and priorities 
identified by their communities.
<P>
	Third, situational crime prevention strategies or opportunity 
reduction approaches such as neighbourhood watch, block parents 
and crime prevention through environmental design have 
considerable potential for reducing crime in Canada. Most police 
agencies have established crime prevention units which promote 
various community based programs aimed at reducing 
opportunities for a specific crime such as vandalism, theft and 
break and enter. However, such programs have limits, especially 
over the long term, as offenders become displaced to other areas or 
choose to commit other types of crime.
<P>
	The fourth is effective justice approaches. The maintenance and 
improvement of a fair and equitable criminal justice system is the 
foundation to effective crime prevention. Actions such as the 
control of firearms, the recognition that spousal abuse and child 
abuse are crimes and that timely responses to young offenders 
through appropriate and effective legislation and enforcement will 
help to ensure that crime prevention is a reality.
<P>
	Crime prevention targeted to the social causes of crime requires 
a longer term and less visible effort than does catching perpetrators 
or installing mechanical devices. Their concept requires a new 
approach, where the belief that it can be done accompanies the 
commitment to make it happen. More can be done to prevent crime 
by interceding in practical ways and through social development 
situations.
<P>
	Key research on the benefits of crime prevention through social 
development must be brought to the attention of all concerned 
citizens, communities and the media. Canada has taken an 
important step in putting greater emphasis on crime prevention by 
developing a national strategy on community safety and crime 
prevention. This took place following a major consultation with 
stakeholder groups, through an in depth examination by a 
parliamentary standing committee and through a national 
symposium.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	The national strategy is a broad framework of action which 
brings together a number of partners and a special focus on the 
development of information and tools to help communities develop 
and implement specific measures to meet its needs.
<P>
	The strategy was developed in close co-operation with 
stakeholders, including provinces and territories, which are 
primarily responsible for many aspects of crime prevention and 
which contribute to individual and  community safety, such as 
education, health, social services and the administration of justice.
<P>
	Measures implemented on the national strategy by governments 
and by non-governmental organizations include greater 
co-ordination and communications, public education and 
awareness, enhancing knowledge, support to communities, 
incorporating crime prevention legislation and official mandates 
and developing innovative funding strategies.
<P>
	The establishment of a National Crime Prevention Council in 
July 1994 was a key element of the national strategy. This body is 
made up of 25 members from a variety of disciplines, including 
education, social work, police, victims, private sector, 
criminologists, public health, and so on. It serves as an adviser to 
governments and a central co-ordination and information sharing 
structure to unify crime prevention efforts and develop practical 
solutions for communities.
<P>
	The mandate of the council is very broad and reflects the fact 
that Canada is only beginning to understand what can be done to 
define the prevention of crime and victimization and help 
communities become safer places.
<P>
	The National Crime Prevention Council has adopted social 
development as the most effective approach to crime prevention. 
Children and youth are their key priorities, as a focus on early 
prevention is the means to prevent victimization and criminal 
behaviour later on.
<P>
	It is developing prevention strategies that address the underlying 
factors associated with crime, such as poverty, unemployment, 
inadequate parenting, family violence, lack of opportunities, 
systemic discrimination. Its members believe that the long term 
solution lies in targeting services and resources that diminish the 
effects of hardship and disadvantage and that provide children with 
the best possible opportunity to fulfil their potential. The positive 
results from these actions will benefit society in many ways and 
will assist in reducing the rates of crime and victimization.
<P>
	The council's work also includes looking at measures aimed at 
strengthening families to safeguard children at risk. Earlier work 
has pointed to the need for such measures to be comprehensive and 
implemented at the national and international levels.
<P>
	These measures should focus on mitigating the situation of 
dysfunctional families or families characterized by erratic, absent 
or excessive discipline, a high probability of mistreatment and a 
lack of positive role models. Early intervention can help put an end 
to the cycle whereby child abuse and the delinquency associated 
with such abuse is passed on from generation to generation.
<P>
	While the national strategy for community safety and crime 
prevention and the national council are at early stages, I believe 
that this work is very promising and that we have taken a decisive 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2057"> 2057 </A></B>
<P>
step toward safer communities.  This is the type of work that in the 
long term will prevent victimization.
<P>
	As I indicated to our Reform colleagues, a positive and 
constructive initiative such as this can and will be supported by this 
member and can and will be supported by this Liberal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to address a comment and a question to the 
member.
<P>
	To bridge the gap from the volunteer status for victim services 
and the position of victims in the whole process, does the member 
not see that specific legislation is needed to change the situation 
from statements of principle and words of good intentions? This 
would bring the status of victims into the mainstream of operations 
where the victims have in law rights that can be enforced and they 
have legal benchmarks to which the justice system can be held to 
account when it fails to deliver on behalf of victims?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maloney:</B> Madam Speaker, I agree with my colleague. We 
have already commenced some of these initiatives. Perhaps I can 
refer to a few of them. Bill C-37 acknowledged victims' 
declarations; Bill C-41 amended section 745 to ensure that the 
victim could take part in deliberations; the Criminal Code which 
allows for the victim's role in the entire process, victim's 
statements and so on. There is a whole list of initiatives here which 
certainly satisfy the suggestions my friend has made. Yes, I agree 
with him, and yes, we are doing something about that.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, as a 
physician in my life before Parliament I would like to address the 
final victims bill of rights statement that the victim should know if 
a person convicted of a sexual offence has a sexually transmitted 
disease. I would like to relay the specific case of Margot 
Blackburn. In September, 1992 Margot was working in a church 
rectory. A convict was in the church doing community service on a 
day pass. The convict had a bad past record and he raped her.
<P>
	He was caught of course, convicted and sentenced to 12 years in 
prison. Margot, being up to date on medical issues, knew there was 
a possibility of an infectious disease being transmitted to her. This 
man was convicted. He admitted he had raped her. He said he was 
sorry and all the other things.
<P>
	Margot asked if he could have given her AIDS. She applied to 
the court and asked for the perpetrator, Louis B., to have an AIDS 
test. When I tell this story to high school students across the 
country they look at me with horror when I say that the result was 
no chance, no AIDS test, zero. The convict and his rights take 
precedence over Margot Blackburn.
<P>
	She wanted an AIDS test, and an eminently reasonable request it 
was in my view, since there would have been a significant gap 
between the time of infection and when a test would show positive 
in her. If the convict was positive, she would know full well she had 
reason to worry.
<P>
	In Canada, the rights of the criminal in this case collide directly 
with the rights of Margot, and take precedence. I say to the kids: 
``You young ladies in this class, what do you think of the Canadian 
justice system when I tell you that? Whose rights should take 
precedence?'' I have not had a single, solitary student in grade 12 
say to me that Louis B.'s rights should take precedence over 
Margot's. They say absolutely not.
<P>
	This issue, without question, puts the justice system into 
disrepute. Reformers want to change that. If a conflict exists 
between the rights of the victim and the rights of the criminal, the 
rights of the victim must take precedence.
<P>
	I found a very interesting recent editorial in a newspaper written 
by someone who sits in this House, although not on this side, who 
very eloquently said that. The Canadian Resource Centre for 
Victims of Crime proposed in 1993 that the Criminal Code should 
be amended so that a blood test can be ordered when the court is 
satisfied that (a) reasonable grounds exist that the victim has been 
exposed to risk of infection, and (b) the taking of blood can be done 
without jeopardizing the life or safety from whom it is taken. In my 
view, no one can argue with that.
<P>
	I will discuss a second case of a victim in Canada who I consider 
to be abused by our system. His name is Miles Fritz. He is a young 
man who lives in Cayley, Alberta. He is a master electrician and 
was working in the Yukon.
<P>
	One evening while doing his dishes he heard a cry from outside. 
His 64-year old neighbour had been set upon by three thugs. Miles 
is a scrawny buzzard, something like me. Nevertheless he rushed 
out to save his neighbour. He found the three thugs literally kicking 
his neighbour unconscious. He leaped on them and beat them off. 
However, one thug drew a knife and stabbed Miles in his right 
forearm. Miles almost bled to death but they saved him with 
transfusions. As a result of this, he has a permanent disability.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	A master electrician uses his right hand a lot. Miles has lost 
some nerve function, he has lost some power and activity. He will 
never again work as a master electrician.
<P>
	The guy who stabbed him had been released on probation that 
very morning from prison. He received a sentence of nine months 
with two years' probation. What does Miles receive? Miles, who is 
a hero in my eyes, who saved his neighbour's life, receives nothing. 
Too bad, Miles, there is nothing for you.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2058"> 2058 </A></B>
<P>
	The perpetrator gets counselling in prison for his drug addiction, 
for his past, for the way his mom and dad treated him, for the 
poverty that he underwent. Miles, the hero, gets a kick in the shins.
<P>
	Miles puts our criminal justice system into disrepute. Reformers, 
every one of us, stand here today saying that if the rights of the 
victim collide with the rights of the perpetrator, the rights of the 
victim shall take precedence. We need a victims' bill of rights in 
Canada. I call on my colleagues in a non-partisan way to bring this 
to fruition quickly.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, when I showed you two 
fingers, I did not mean that you actually terminate your speech at 
the time. I was just indicating that time when I was going to go to 
statements. If you wish to take the floor at the end of question 
period, you still have time. Would you please indicate what you 
would like to do?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, since I was splitting my time 
with the member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, my 
time was over.

	<B>Mr. John English (Kitchener, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today

and children, were burned beyond recognition. A bomb was placed 
under the gas tank of a public bus, and as a result numerous lives 
were lost and countless injuries sustained.
<P>
	This senseless attack is only one of many in Pakistan's recent 
history, where terrorist activity has become a part of everyday life 
for many of its citizens. Canada will always condemn those who 
choose the path of violence for political gain and support nations 
which seek to eliminate these terrorist groups whose courage is no 
more than the end of a gun barrel or the chemicals of a bomb.
<P>
	I am confident that all Canadians support the determination to 
rid Pakistan and other countries of terrorist activity. I wish to offer 
my sincere condolences to the families suffering as a result of this 
terrible bombing. Certainly it is the strength and determination of 
the people of Pakistan to persevere that inspires many other nations

	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one 
of the founding principles of the Reform Party is that the 
punishment of crime and the protection of law-abiding citizens and 
their property should be placed above all other objectives of our 
justice system.
<P>
	Instead, the Liberals emphasize apologizing to criminals and 
offering them personal compensation when they participate in riots 
and are injured.
<P>
	Canadians want their government to send a strong message to 
criminals that if they violate the rights of law-abiding citizens they 
will be held accountable and society sanctions will have real teeth.
<P>
	The Liberal government's refusal to listen to the people on such 
measures as the repeal of section 745, the early parole provisions of 
the Criminal Code, shows how out of touch it is with Canadians.
<P>
	When Canadians go to the polls in the next election they will ask 
themselves who has shown real commitment to protect them. Who 
is willing to stand up and introduce common sense legislation that 
puts the safety of our families and communities as its first priority? 
On both accounts there is only one answer, the Reform Party of 
Canada.

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this morning my private member's Bill C-220 calling for an energy 
price commission was debated. The purpose of the legislation is to 
protect consumers from gas price gouging by having oil companies 
justify price increases.
<P>
	The Reform Party opposed the bill and supported the oil 
companies in their initiative to charge whatever the market will 
bear. Liberals opposed the legislation because they believe the oil 
companies are charging fair prices and should be encouraged to 
charge higher gas prices.
<P>
	In a referendum of nearly 4,000 people conducted in Regina 
after hearing the oil companies' reasons for price increases, 93 per 
cent voted in favour of regulating gas prices.
<P>
	Why do Reformers and Liberals stand four square in support of 
high gas prices? Why when farmers, business people and 
consumers need and ask for protection from Parliament do the 
Liberals and the Reform Party side with big business, the big oil 
companies? Perhaps the answer lies in the fact that both these 
parties receive substantial political contributions from the oil 
industry.

<P>
	Tasmanians have not had the benefit of gun control laws like 
those in Canada. Automatic and semi-automatic weapons are freely

<P>
	Canadians can take some measure of comfort knowing they have

campaigned on tougher gun control, a government that delivered.

Industry Canada recently announced an exciting new project called

<P>
	The goal of the government is to create a climate of opportunity 
for businesses. Strategis supports this goal by putting the 
knowledge, experience and expertise of Industry Canada in the 
hands of small and medium size businesses.
<P>
	Strategis is based on partnership with government, industry, 
universities and community colleges all working together to 
provide better access for businesses to the information they need to 
compete.
<P>
	Smaller communities like my riding of St. Catharines may not be 
close to the hub of technology or government research, but with 
Strategis the latest information on industries and companies, 
market opportunities, advanced technologies and trade is available 
on the business Internet.
<P>
	I congratulate Keith McDonald from McDonald Systems &amp; 
Consulting for taking the initiative to spread the message of 
Strategis. Strategis is about giving businesses a leg up. It is about

	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, exactly one week ago a Vancouver woman was awarded a 
record $473,000 in civil damages as a result of charges that her 
father sexually assaulted her from age three to well into her teens.
<P>
	Some may laud the justice system for recognizing the plight of 
the victim. She sued and she won. However, there are loopholes 
which can prevent an innocent victim from ever being awarded 
compensation. In this case the perpetrator has no intention of 
paying. With the way Canada's bankruptcy laws operate the 
defendant is able to claim personal bankruptcy and be freed of 
having to pay these kinds of court orders. The offender gets off and 
the victim is victimized all over again.
<P>
	Members of the House industry committee will have the 
opportunity to accept amendments as a result of my private 
member's bill. Having the victim suffer once is bad enough. 
Suffering twice for the same crime should be unthinkable.

the Liberal government decided to take the shameful action of 
gagging debate in order to ram through two controversial 
legislative measures: Bill C-31 on the GST and Bill C-12 on 
unemployment insurance, once again demonstrating the federal 
government's lack of sensitivity to the public.
<P>
	Before the Liberals came to power, no government, not even the

finally enshrining victims' rights on an equal footing with those of

over the past 20 years across the nation. I have met with many of

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, now that the Deputy Prime Minister is here, we can start.
<P>
	Editorial writers in the weekend newspapers were appalled by 
the attitude of the Deputy Prime Minister, who now refuses to 
honour her formal promise to resign if her government did not 
scrap the GST. The <I>Globe and Mail</I> is now calling for the Deputy 
Prime Minister's resignation, while <I>La Presse</I> argues, with good 
reason, that her attitude seriously undermines the credibility of all 
politicians in Canada.
<P>
	Since the Deputy Prime Minister had the time to reflect on all 
this on the weekend and since there is a wide consensus across 
Canada that she should resign, does she not feel that she should go 
back on her decision and honour her promise to resign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, one thing is for certain: I 
did not make any decision on my political future because of the 
editorials in the Toronto and Montreal newspapers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since the Deputy Prime Minister herself had insisted that 
killing the GST should be a formal election promise, she cannot 
claim today that she spoke a little too fast, without thinking, and 
that it was an honest mistake.
<P>
	Will she admit that not only her credibility but that of the whole 
government is at stake in this matter and that she should therefore 
resign, at least as Deputy Prime Minister and as a cabinet member?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we have always told 
voters-before, during and after the election-that a two-tax 
system causes many problems for small and medium size 
businesses, many problems in terms of trade, and that what we are 
doing with the new tax is introducing a harmonized system in 
keeping with our commitments on page 22 of the red book.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister should note that what causes 
problems for business, for all Canadians and for politicians is that a 
cabinet member is not keeping her promise. That is a source of 
problems.
<P>
	By failing to resign, does the Deputy Prime Minister admit that 
she is undermining the integrity of the whole government and that 
she will then bear the heavy burden of creating a precedent in 
Canada by refusing to respond  and to honour her promise? Does 
she not realize that she is undermining the integrity of the whole 
government, since she must honour her promises as a member of 
the government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are meeting our 
commitment. On page 22 of the red book, we promised to replace 
the GST with a new tax that would be easier for trade purposes as 
well as for small business and for consumers.
<P>
	That is why the Consumers' Association of Canada, the 
Canadian Manufacturers' Association and the organizations 
representing Canada's small businesses support what we are doing. 
That is why I do not have to resign for fulfilling our promises on 
page 22 of the red book.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does 
the Deputy Prime Minister realize that, by not fulfilling a formal

discredit on all politicians in this country, and that her only option 
is to resign? She has no choice, she must resign.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly do not accept 
the claim of the hon. member that I am discrediting women in 
politics.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I do not want to brag about women in politics, but Canadian 
women are well aware that if there is someone who worked hard to 
include them in politics it is my leader and my party.
<P>
	During the last election campaign, the leader of the hon. 
member's party did not believe in a policy to recruit women; he did 
not want one. We had such a policy and I am proud that 37 women 
are currently in this House, thanks to our policy.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, given 
the seriousness of the situation, and given that the Deputy Prime 
Minister refuses to resign to fulfil her commitment and preserve 
the credibility of her government, will she agree to submit her case 
to the Prime Minister's ethics counsellor, so that he can submit his 
written conclusions to the House?

	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, broken promises are fast becoming the watchword for this 
Liberal government. It has broken its promise on the GST. The 
Deputy Prime Minister has broken her promise to resign. By 
booting the member for York South-Weston out of caucus, the 
government has broken its promise to give its MPs greater 
freedom.
<P>
	The red book clearly states that more free votes would be 
allowed in the House of Commons. I ask the Deputy Prime 
Minister this. Will her government keep one crucial promise and 
allow MPs to represent the wishes of their constituents in a free 
vote on the proposed gay rights amendment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since we formed the government we amended the rules of 
this House. We allowed free votes on every private member's bill 
and motion. We allowed committees to propose legislation which 
was never done before. For example, take the case of Bill C-69. 
This was a bill that came from the procedure and House affairs 
committee and was sent to the Senate, but was passed by this 
House. It was a bill that did not come from the government. It came 
from committee.
<P>
	We are gradually implementing all our reforms on how this place 
is going to work and we will continue to do so. We have had free 
votes and free votes will continue to exist.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on page 92 of the Liberal red book the Prime Minister 
promised that ``more free votes will be allowed in the House of 
Commons''.
<P>
	To date we have yet to see one free vote on any piece of 
government legislation. Canadians have some very strong views on 
the gay rights issue and they deserve to be truly represented in this 
House.
<P>
	I ask the Deputy Prime Minister again, will her government 
allow a free vote on its proposed amendments to the human rights 
act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not know where the member has been. For the last 
two and a half years practically every week when this House is in 
session we have free votes on private members' bills and private 
members' motions and we continue to do so.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	In terms of her specific question, she has to wait. The Prime 
Minister will make a decision in due course.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it appears the Prime Minister is not willing to hold a free 
vote on this amendment. I hope that does not mean that closure is 
next.
<P>
	How times have changed. The Liberals used to howl with 
outrage every time the Mulroney Tories limited debate. Now, 
whenever they start taking political heat from Canadians, they 
automatically introduce closure. They did it with MP pensions, 
they did it with gun control, they did it with the budget and UI 
reforms to name just a few.
<P>
	Will the government allow all Canadians to have their say on this 
important amendment? Will the Prime Minister promise not to use 
closure to ram it through the House of Commons?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister will decide 
whether this party will have a free vote on that amendment and he 
will do that when it is appropriate to do so.
<P>
	In response to the question put by the hon. member, first, the 
reality is that for a party such as hers which is so interested in 
taking head counts in polls before deciding how its members will 
vote, the party opposite should know that as recently as this 
weekend the Liberal Party of Canada had no difficulty in deciding 
where it stands on the issue by overwhelmingly voting in favour of 
the amendment we proposed. Second, an Angus Reid poll which 
polled the views of Canadians across the country announced that 
the vast majority of Canadians are behind this amendment.
<P>
	If that is not good enough for the Reform Party, there is 
something wrong with it.

<P>
	At the meeting of the Quebec branch of the Liberal Party, the 
Prime Minister waxed eloquent about the integrity of his 
government. And yet, in the Somalia affair, there are growing signs 
that information was falsified and concealed. Even the chief of 
defence staff, General Boyle, who was personally chosen by the

affair.

defence minister to suspend General Jean Boyle until the inquiry is 
over?

has been asked a number of times in recent days and I am 
compelled to give the same answer.
<P>
	We have a process in motion. A commission of inquiry is 
looking into all aspects of the Canadian force deployment to 
Somalia. Some other issues that are perhaps tangential but which 
may deal with the documentation issue with respect to Somalia 
have been raised. The commission has started hearings and those 
hearings are ongoing.
<P>
	All people concerned will have the opportunity to give their side 
of events and their points of view over the next couple of weeks. I 
would ask the hon. member the basic courtesy to allow all those 
people to come forward and let the decision be made by the 
commission in due course.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am quite 
prepared to observe the basic courtesies, but normally, when 
someone is the subject of an inquiry, he is temporarily suspended, 
precisely in order to get to the bottom of the events at issue. It is a 
question of credibility.
<P>

witnesses, why is the minister of defence making an exception to 
this sacrosanct rule by refusing to suspend the general until the 
inquiry is over?

are today involving victims' rights, members of this party vote as 
they see fit. I already told the House this morning that I am going to 
be voting in favour of the resolution because I share the objectives 
expressed by the hon. member. I expect that other members of the

quite right. A review period was established in Bill C-91 that will 
come into effect in the spring of 1997.
<P>
	At the same time, he understands that the NOC link regulations 
which were enacted pursuant to section 55(2) of that legislation are 
very complex. In order to determine whether they have the desired 
effect of appropriately balancing the interests that lie in this area 
between the rights of patent holders to protect their patents-which 
I believe is what he is endeavouring in suggesting that these should 
not be changed-against the interests that consumers have in the 
legitimate acquisition of generic products when patent rights have 
expired-to which I am sure he also does not object-I think he 
understands that the essence of patent protection is that it extends 
for a period of time after which it ends. That is the law.
<P>
	The NOC link regulations are intended to establish a mechanism 
whereby both interests are adequately protected. In order to 
determine whether that has been achieved we are looking at the 
litigation that has ensued from those regulations and we will 
determine what the best result is to follow from that.

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadian women are dying because of a fatal flaw in the way the 
police are forced to handle domestic violent cases.
<P>
	The tragic shooting rampage in Vernon, B.C. where a man killed 
himself after shooting his estranged wife and eight members of her 
family illustrates what can happen when warning signs are ignored 
for whatever reason.
<P>
	Does the the justice minister not agree that it could save lives if 
we gave police the power to follow through on domestic violence 
charges after a complaint is made, whether the complainant asks 
for the charges or not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, such discretion is provided for 
already and is well within the administrative powers of police 
forces at present.
<P>
	While I recognize the very genuine concern on the part of the 
hon. member in his question and the tragedy in Vernon, I must say, 
before concluding my response, that there is a healthy measure of 
irony in the hon. member's question.
<P>
	It was the member and his colleagues who for months stood in 
the House to oppose the measures we introduced in Bill C-68 to 
more rationally control access to and use of firearms, to put in 
place systems and processes that would enable authorities to follow 
up in cases of domestic abuse and to make sure firearms are 
removed from persons who represent a danger to themselves or 
others.
<P>
	To hear the hon. member today suggesting that further steps 
should be available in such cases is indeed a very distinct irony.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
probably should ask if the justice minister feels any better that 
these victims were shot with a registered gun. I wonder if that 
would make any difference.
<P>
	In the mass murder in Vernon, the estranged wife did not ask for 
charges to be laid because she was afraid for her life, naturally. 
However, 10 people are dead because the police were handcuffed.
<P>
	Contrary to what the minister has said, is he saying today that 
there is no way we can give the police the tools they are asking for, 
or the tools victims' rights groups are asking for, or the tools that 
Canadians are asking for to help prevent more needless deaths in 
these kinds of tragedies?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, all the tools or remedies or 
procedures that the hon. member is suggesting are either already 
available or well within the grasp of police forces in Canada. It is a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2066"> 2066 </A></B>
<P>
question of the  police forces themselves making use of those 
remedies and those procedures.
<P>
	With respect to the nature of the gun being responsible for the 
tragedy in British Columbia, let me observe that the reason we are 
after the registration of all firearms and the reason the House has 
now approved that in Bill C-68 is that information available to the 
police to better enable them to predict such tragedies and take 
remedial steps to remove firearms will be available to all police 
across the country. That is what we achieved with Bill C-68.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	A report released on March 14 by the American secretary of state 
confirms that atrocities and human rights violations are on the rise 
in Algeria. However, the Government of Canada continues to 
refuse to suspend the deportation order hanging over the heads of 
Algerian nationals who have taken refuge in Canada.
<P>
	Will the minister finally acknowledge that a climate of violence 
prevails at the moment in Algeria and that Algerian nationals 
should, like nationals of other countries selected by her 
department, benefit from a suspension of deportation measures?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the advisory committee looking 
at conditions in countries where people are deported meets 
regularly to assess situations in various countries, because, as you 
know, when we decide to send someone back to his country, the 
risks are always evaluated.
<P>
	Obviously, we will not send someone back to his own country 
when there may be reprisals or his life is at risk. We are very 
careful on this. We study each case, each file, when individuals are 
to be deported. For the time being, we are continuing deportations 
to Algeria.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
seems to be totally unaware of the rise of fundamentalism in 
Algeria, and her advisory committee is meeting behind closed 
doors.
<P>
	How does the minister explain that decisions on whether 
deportation orders are to be suspended for a given country are made 
in conditions of secrecy, according to criteria known only to her 
officials? Why is Algeria not among the countries presenting a 
risk?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, each situation is considered on 
its merit. For a given country as a whole,  various factors are taken 
into consideration. We are well aware of what is going on in each 
country. We also know what has happened to people after we sent 
them back to certain countries. We have consulted various 
authorities internationally as well.
<P>
	I will repeat what I said. Each time we make a decision regarding 
a particular individual, we evaluate the potential risks they run in 
returning to their country. For the time being, we will continue to 
send people back to Algeria and continue to study each case in 
detail.

<P>
	All provinces agreed it was important that we move collectively

we want to make it safer. As a result over the next number of weeks 
we have directed our officials to come back with a plan whereby we

refers involves a request by counsel for some of the parties to look 
at hours and hours of videotape in respect of which as I understand 
it production has already been made with respect to summaries of 
the evidence that was recorded thereon. The position taken by 
counsel for the department on that request is that the commission's 
time is better spent looking at other issues than at looking at hours 
and hours of videotape which may not be germane or relevant and 
the substance of which has already been disclosed.
<P>
	I can say that the position taken by counsel is based on the 
premise that this is a collateral matter. May I also say my 
understanding is that counsel has offered to the commission that it 
should look at the hours and hours of videotape and decide for itself 
whether there is any purpose to be served in taking time to display 
it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I

National Defence, how will the minister guarantee to the public of 
Canada that the Somalia commission will get to the bottom of all of 
the allegations concerning General Boyle and the whole alleged 
cover-up of information in the Somalia affair?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

hon. member's question, the guarantee is contained in the terms of 
reference for the inquiry. I would hope that he reads the terms of 
reference.
<P>
	It is not for us to debate on the floor of the House of Commons

	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	For 10 years now, the municipality of Salaberry-de-Valleyfield 
has been asking the federal  government to take action to protect 
residents from the dangers of train derailments. Even though it 
privatises railway companies, the government is still responsible 
for safety in the railway sector.
<P>
	Following the fifth derailment in six years in 
Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, what does the minister intend to do to 
protect residents against these freight trains in urban areas?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the issue of hazardous cargoes on trains, ships or aircraft 
is closely examined by the department. In the specific area the 
member has mentioned where there has been concern expressed by 
local authorities, it is being looked at by the Department of 
Transport at the present time.
<P>
	As the member indicated in the preamble to his question, it is a 
subject that goes back a fair length of time involving rerouting of 
lines. As soon as I have information on this subject, I will be happy 
to share it with him.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sorry, but the situation has been going on for 10 years 
and it is dangerous in Valleyfield. When the most recent derailment 
occurred in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, two railroad cars could have 
been carrying toxic chemicals.
<P>
	Is the minister waiting for a chemical spill to occur in a 
residential area before taking action to protect residents? These 
trains go by polyvalente schools and travel close to a school and to 
the hospital. What does the minister intend to do?

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I indicated in my earlier response, the issue of 
hazardous substances carried in tank cars or in other rail cars is a 
matter of serious concern.
<P>
	The difficulty the member has posed is that because of the nature 
of this country's development, rail lines quite frequently pass 
through inhabited and municipal areas. It is simply not possible to 
give the type of blanket guarantee he has requested. I can assure 
him however that the specific concern of this area and the 
possibility of any bypass or diversion will be looked at. In fact, it is 
currently being looked at.

<P>
	The Liberals have not kept their promise on page 22. It is not 
revenue neutral. It is not better for consumers. It does not promote 
provincial harmony; it promotes disharmony.
<P>
	Her actions strike at the core of why politicians are at the bottom 
of the barrel in terms of respect. Fifty-one Reformers promised to 
opt out of the gold plated pension plan and we did. That is integrity. 
That is honour and it is standing on principle. Why will the Deputy 
Prime Minister not do the same thing, deliver on her promise to 
resign, put her seat where her mouth is and seek re-election if she is 
so confident she has done nothing wrong?
<P>

that it would make more sense to resign and then have a $100,000

relevant to wool suits. It is one which we paid the price for at the 
time. We are acting completely within our rights and obligations 
under NAFTA and I would expect the United States would as well.
<P>
	In addition to that, even though we have been quite successful in 
moving wool suits from $5.6 million to $112 million in just five 
years, there still is a billion dollar trade surplus the United States 
has with us in terms of textiles and apparel. Therefore in addition to

from B.C. fishermen. At the same time the Nisga'a treaty and other 
commercial sales agreements could transfer as much as 50 per cent 
of the commercial catch to natives.
<P>
	How can the minister possibly justify a 50 per cent reduction in 
the fleet, one that fishermen will pay dearly for, and at the very 
same time a 50 per cent reallocation of the commercial catch to 
native fisheries?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first of all the hon. member has some of his facts 
wrong.
<P>
	In the sense of the commercial fishery and the 50 per cent 
reduction, we may not be able to achieve that in the short term. The 
maximum we could achieve is around 40 per cent through a series 
of licensing restrictions, licence stacking and voluntary buy back.
<P>
	From the round table discussion which stemmed from the report, 
my understanding is that the seiners wanted it around 30 per cent, 
the gill net representatives wanted it between 30 and 35 per cent 
and the trawlers wanted it between 25 and 50 per cent. What we are 
doing in this case is we are representing essentially what the 
industry has asked for.
<P>
	With respect to the Nisga'a the hon. member is totally wrong. 
The maximum number involved is around 25 per cent. This is done 
with the agreement of most of the parties involved. The Nisga'a 
have been negotiating for over 100 years and we have finally come 
to an agreement. I do not think it is right for the hon. member to try 
to throw off this very honourable agreement in principle on the 
basis of information which is not based on fact.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I begin speaking on the supply motion by 
congratulating my colleague from Fraser Valley West for 
introducing the victim's bill of rights. It is certainly a pleasure to 
see something concrete happening in the House regarding victims' 
rights.
<P>
	Not all victims are the result of murder. Many victims we find in 
Canadian society are people who have found themselves 
victimized through assault, attacks or other offences. Sometimes 
these victims go unnoticed and unheard.
<P>
	What we are concerned about with this victims' bill of rights is 
that there is a process and a procedure to make sure people who 
find themselves victimized by offenders have some recourse, some 
vehicle for having their story heard and their concerns addressed.
<P>
	Not that I have ever wanted to but simply because of the position 
I found myself in I have ended up speaking to over 20 parents of 
murdered children. Their stories vary from occasion and from 
location. For the most part what I hear from the parents of children 
who have been murdered is they feel when they enter the court 
system they are being revictimized. I also hear that from parents or 
from assault victims who find themselves getting entangled in a 
misunderstanding between the federal jurisdiction over creating the 
law and the provincial jurisdiction over administering the law.
<P>
	Caught in this conflict, these victims really feel they are being 
victimized for a second or third time when they enter the court 
process.
<P>
	Two aspects of this victim's bill of rights try to deal with a 
couple of problems that arise. One is section 4, which asks that 
victims be informed in a timely fashion of the details of the 
crown's intention to offer a plea bargain before it is presented to the 
defence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2071"> 2071 </A></B>
<P>
	That is a fair request. Anybody who has been victimized 
whether from a sexual assault, assault or in the worst cases a 
murder has a right to be part of the process. They have a right 
to know when there is an intention to downgrade a charge.
<P>
	A good number of the people who find themselves victimized go 
to court anticipating or expecting a first degree murder conviction 
for the criminal if that is what the criminal is charged with. They 
come away feeling very distraught when that has been downgraded 
either to second degree or to manslaughter.
<P>
	When people go to court, having been victimized from a sexual 
assault, and find out that charge can be downgraded through a plea 
bargain to make sure the offender does get convicted, they may 
downgrade the seriousness of the assault.
<P>
	Oftentimes because the victims or the families of the victims do 
not understand the process they feel cheated. If they were brought 
into the process, if they were brought into the discussions on why 
plea bargaining was being considered, why the need to look at 
downgrading the charge to get a conviction, perhaps they would 
feel less victimized the second or third time.
<P>
	Another concern of mine is that victims should be looked after, 
that there should be some vehicle in our system that when there are 
people who are victimized through no fault of their own, there is 
some compensation or some accounting that they, too, need to be 
cared for.
<P>
	The case that comes to mind is the case of a young 14-year old 
girl who was kidnapped out of a schoolyard after school by an older 
man and taken in his truck. The intent was considered when she 
escaped partially dressed. The offender's truck got stuck in the 
mud. While he was trying to deal with getting his truck unstuck she 
was able to get out of the vehicle and escape partially dressed. His 
intentions, therefore, were quite clear.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	The parents of that child realized that in order to heal completely 
this child needed to have counselling. They went to various 
agencies to see what kind of counselling she could receive. They 
were told they had to make an application to victim's aid and that 
perhaps the money for the counselling would be available in three 
to four months.
<P>
	Those parents realized that the counselling and healing had to 
start immediately. This 14-year old girl could not wait three or four 
months before dealing with what had happened to her. However, 
they were not a family of wealth and it took everything they had to 
find the financial resources to make sure that their daughter did not 
suffer long term consequences from this event.
<P>
	We then look at the offenders who have all of the counselling and 
treatment provided for them, and the victims are left trying to deal 
with their problems on their own. That concerns me.
<P>
	Another part of this victims' bill of rights which has to be looked 
at is the issue of the crown and the police notifying the victims why 
charges were not laid if that is the decision of the crown or the 
police.
<P>
	One case more than any other brings that to my mind. Clifford 
Olson on New Year's Day in 1981 picked up a 16-year old girl, Kim 
Werbecky, and raped her repeatedly over a 12-hour period. She 
eventually escaped and reported the crime to the police, who 
arrested and charged Clifford Olson. However, the crown did not 
proceed with charges because she was a prostitute. It felt she would 
be viewed as a liar and a tramp and was not to be believed. Thus 
Olson was released.
<P>
	At the time of his release Olson had already murdered one child 
and he would go on to murder another 10 children. It was not until 
two years ago that Kim Werbecky finally found out why charges 
did not proceed. She never had a chance to state her position or give 
her side of the story.
<P>
	It is extremely important that the crown and the police bring 
victims into the discussions. I know one individual living in my 
community who is very good about dealing with not only the 
victims but the victim's family, of talking to them of what the 
possibilities are, of where this case might go, of what would be 
expected of them and of the pain, suffering and stress they would 
feel.
<P>
	He takes it upon himself to deal with the realities of victims 
having to go through the legal system. He helps to reduce the 
trauma for these victims by including them in discussions before 
the trial and before the court case is heard. He includes them in plea 
bargaining, what it is all about and where it will take them.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that is left to the discretion of the crown. Not all 
crowns are as good as this individual at bringing the victims into 
the process. It should not be left to the individual. It should be the 
rule and not the exception. Unfortunately we find that it is the 
exception. Most crowns are busy, have large caseloads and literally 
cannot be bothered to look at the whole aspect of victims when they 
are going through the court system.
<P>
	I do not think most Canadians realize the crown is there to 
assume the responsibility of the victim. Society does not believe it 
is only the victim who has been victimized but society as a whole. 
Therefore the crown, on behalf of the individual, appears before the 
courts to get some justice and restitution.
<P>
	I do not think most Canadians realize the crown is really there on 
their behalf. They need to be brought more into the system with the 
crown so they appreciate and understand that they are working 
together on this, that the crown is actually working on their behalf.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2072"> 2072 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	Victims and their families must have a statutory right to be 
informed about what is happening. It should not be left to the 
discretion of the crown or to the discretion of the attorney general. 
Ministers of justice and attorneys general change often. They are 
not standard established positions. The individuals change with the 
will of the people and sometimes reflect how the Criminal Code is 
applied.
<P>
	It is very important that victims rights be written into statute so 
changes in government do not affect how they are dealt with.
<P>
	I congratulate my colleague for his efforts on behalf of the 
victims in society.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member and her party, as did the 
Minister of Justice today, for using their opposition day correctly 
and positively toward the service of all Canadians with this 
important topic of victims rights. In the red book we promised 
Canada safer streets, safer communities, a better and fairer society.
<P>
	The hon. members of the Reform Party spoke of two aspects of 
victims rights. One aspect is to have tougher legislation. The other 
aspect refers to counselling, the benefits criminals have through 
legal aid, mental health services or what other institutions there 
might be available. Reformers would make these services available 
to the victim as well, including counselling, support services, 
financial assistance if required, the opportunity to prepare impact 
statements and so on.
<P>
	How far would the hon. member take that suggestion in this 
legislation? Who would pay for such services?
<P>
	I am pleased to support the efforts they are putting forward 
today.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is an organization in our 
government, the correctional investigator, which listens to the 
complaints of convicted individuals in the penitentiaries. It hears 
complaints about the kind of food they get, the kind of cells they 
are in, whether they get to smoke.
<P>
	I would suggest that is a very good start. Take the resources for 
that agency and redefine it to provide services for victims. I do not 
feel that people who have been charged, convicted and sentenced to 
incarceration have any right to criticize or complain about the kind 
of food or the kind of health care they get. They get 24-hour health 
services which no other Canadian in the country gets, yet some of 
them complain about it. They complain about the way they are 
shuttled from cell to cell or where they are moved.
<P>
	The resources that go into that agency, I believe it is a couple of 
hundred thousand dollars a year, would provide a very good start to 
funding the cause of victims rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to debate the 
motion on the issue of victims rights.
<P>
	Although as a society we have an obligation to protect the rights 
of the accused and the rights of the convicted, we also need to 
establish and safeguard the rights of all victims and their families.
<P>
	If an occasion should arise where the rights of the victim and the 
rights of the perpetrator are in conflict, the resolution of that 
conflict should be very easy: it should be in favour of the victim. I 
sincerely believe this can be done without compromising our fine 
tradition of rights and freedoms.
<P>
	The call for better victims rights is not a new one. In 1981 a 
federal-provincial task force was struck to examine the role of 
victims in the criminal justice system. The task force reported in 
1983 with suggestions to provide information to victims, develop 
victims rights, develop victim services, introduce victim impact 
statements and compensate losses where appropriate. I agree with 
all of these proposals. However, I do not agree with its conclusion 
that many proposed victims rights ``were not appropriate to be 
included in the criminal law''. Since that time some progress has 
been made.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	In 1988, Bill C-89 amended the Criminal Code to allow courts to 
consider victim impact statements during sentencing. Recent 
amendments which will soon come into force will require courts to 
consider any properly prepared impact statement. Similar changes 
have been made to the Young Offenders Act and to the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act.
<P>
	Provisions have been placed in the Criminal Code regarding 
restitution. In section 727.9 of the Criminal Code a victim fine 
surcharge has been introduced, not to exceed 15 per cent of any fine 
levied. Unfortunately, proceeds go to the crown and not directly to 
the victim. Under section 725 of the Criminal Code a court can 
order compensation to a victim. However, application must be 
made by the victim who would need to seek a civil judgment to 
enforce the order and the accused would not pay the amount 
ordered.
<P>
	It is progress, but it is not enough. It is not sufficient for the 
federal government to point to the provinces and suggest that the 
administration of justice is a provincial matter. It is not good 
enough that changes on these matters are done haphazardly and at a 
snail's pace. It is certainly not good enough to suggest further 
patience by those whose lives have been shattered as victims of 
crime.
<P>
	The federal government has a clear responsibility to set the 
protection of victims as a national priority. I believe this motion 
can achieve that objective.
<P>
	We can accomplish our objectives by including the rights of 
victims in a preamble to the Criminal Code. On  matters which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2073"> 2073 </A></B>
<P>
traditionally fall within the scope of the provinces, this preamble 
should state that the administration of the law, as established in the 
Criminal Code, specifies the rights of victims.
<P>
	There are five principles which should be included in a statement 
of victims rights. First, victims should be kept informed of the 
criminal investigations, court proceedings and parole applications 
being undertaken in respect of criminal action perpetrated against 
them or their families. These people need to know the process. 
They need to be informed of what is going on. Victims of crime are 
not an impediment to court proceedings, the lawyers and others 
who administer the law. They are the reason for it and should 
benefit from it.
<P>
	Second, victims should be financially compensated for personal 
injury or financial and all other forms of loss which result from 
criminal actions against them or their families. They should not 
have to make a separate application to the court, nor be required to 
obtain a civil enforcement order. The thought that a victim must in 
essence sue an individual convicted of a crime against them to 
obtain restitution is beyond comprehension.
<P>
	Third, an individual convicted of committing a property crime 
should have a portion of their fine or labour in prison go to 
providing restitution to the victim. Innocent bystanders should not 
have to absorb the cost of another's deviant behaviour.
<P>
	Fourth, victims should have the unconditional right to have their 
impact statements heard by the courts and parole boards. The rules 
and processes surrounding this procedure should be simple and 
should facilitate, not impede such action.
<P>
	Fifth, the statement of principle should call for the 
administration of justice under the Criminal Code by the provinces 
in a manner which obliges them to inform victims of the services 
available to them, including possible legal recourse.
<P>
	The intent of the motion before us is to further protect the rights 
of victims who are all too often forgotten by the justice system, 
which is why I will support the motion today. I will carefully watch 
the progress of the minister and the committee. I hope they find 
merit in my suggestion to include the bill of rights in a preamble to 
the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I am not a lawyer, a judge or a learned legal scholar. I do not 
know the intricacies of the law. But I am a father, a husband and a 
concerned citizen. As parliamentarians we have an obligation to 
continue the progress of the last few years, to set a national 
standard and an example to protect and assist all victims of crime.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
encouraging to hear members opposite support this kind of 
endeavour. I have always said that to  get a national victims bill of 
rights it must transcend party lines. Individual members of 
Parliament must support the initiative.
<P>
	I have several questions. The first is related to the legal industry 
in Canada. I have quote upon quote of what the legal industry, in 
particular lawyers and judges, thinks of victims in this country. I 
will cite a couple of examples.
<P>
	Recently in the Bedford provincial court in Nova Scotia Judge 
Patrick Curran stated: ``I am not entirely happy with them''. He 
was referring to victim impact statements. ``For the most part I do 
not think they make an awful lot of difference''. That is the 
indifference I find in the legal system.
<P>
	This morning I quoted Russ Chamberlain which I will do again 
for my colleague opposite. Mr. Chamberlain is a criminal defence 
lawyer in Vancouver who said that crime victims want an eye for an 
eye, that they want someone else to fix their ``petty problems'', and 
that their pitch for personal vengeance can ``improperly'' affect a 
jury's verdict. He said: ``Victim impact statements are just venting 
the spleen and do not serve justice and should be outlawed, banned 
completely''.
<P>
	We could go through a litany of quotes from lawyers and judges 
in this country on victims who seem to be secondary in the process. 
They seem to be a royal pain to most of these people.
<P>
	Would the member comment on how the House could pass a 
national victims bill of rights when much of the problem lies with 
the legal industry whose members are intent on going their own 
way without the legislators, without the input from victims and 
certainly without the guidance from the national House of 
Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would agree with the hon. member 
for Fraser Valley West which may be a first and perhaps a last. I do 
not agree with the opinions of the legal people he quoted.
<P>
	Many of the lawyers and judges I have talked to who operate in 
my riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka share the feelings I have just 
expressed about the concern toward victims and their rights.
<P>
	The member asked how we should go about this. The House of 
Commons has to set the national standard. My suggestion is that it 
be placed in the preamble of the Criminal Code. However, I suspect 
the justice committee will look at many options. The preamble 
should clearly state the national will. That is what this Parliament 
is all about, stating the national will through its elected 
representatives.
<P>
	The preamble should state that we believe the rights of victims 
are important, that they are of primary concern to us as a country, 
that they are of primary concern to us as parliamentarians. We want 
to ensure that when people look to the Criminal Code for guidance, 
they will find the rights of victims in the code.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2074"> 2074 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the opportunity to address this motion on victims 
rights.
<P>
	We have heard the expression of support for the motion which 
has been put forward by the Minister of Justice. It is his personal 
intention to support the motion. Other members of the House will 
no doubt do likewise. It is the stated position of the minister to 
bring forward in a meeting of the federal and provincial ministers a 
proposal for the reaffirmation of the principles either as have been 
previously enunciated or as can be improved upon by the 
suggestions made by a number of the members of the House.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	The original principles governing the principles of justice for 
victims of crime were originally set forward in 1988. They were as 
follows.
<P>
	Victims should be treated with courtesy, compassion and with 
respect for their dignity and privacy and should suffer the 
minimum of necessary inconvenience from their involvement with 
the criminal justice system.
<P>
	Victims should receive through formal and informal procedures 
prompt and fair redress for the harm which they have suffered. 
Information regarding the remedies and mechanisms to obtain 
them should be made available to the victims. Information should 
be made available to the victims about their participation in 
criminal proceedings and the scheduling, progress and ultimate 
disposition of the proceedings.
<P>
	Where appropriate the views and concerns of victims should be 
ascertained and assistance provided throughout the criminal 
process. Where the personal interests of the victim are affected, the 
views or concerns of the victim should be brought to the attention 
of the court where appropriate and consistent with criminal law and 
procedure.
<P>
	Measures should also be taken when necessary to ensure the 
safety of victims and their families and protect them from 
intimidation and retaliation. Enhanced training should be made 
available to sensitize criminal justice personnel to the needs and 
concerns of victims and guidelines developed where appropriate 
for this purpose.
<P>
	Victims should be informed of the availability of health and 
social services and other relevant assistance so that they might 
continue to receive the necessary medical, psychological and social 
assistance through existing programs and services.
<P>
	Victims should report the crime and co-operate with law 
enforcement authorities.
<P>
	These are the principles that were agreed upon by the federal and 
provincial ministers responsible for criminal justice.
<P>
	Since 1988 and in an effort to bring these principles into reality, 
the federal government has enacted a number of pieces of 
legislation to enhance the role of the victims within the criminal 
procedure of the land and throughout the process so that they will 
indeed not be victimized twice but rather will feel as much as 
possible a part of the process.
<P>
	In addition to federal action, provincial governments across the 
land which have the constitutional authority for the administration 
of justice and the constitutional duty to administer justice have 
introduced in a number of cases provincial statutes dealing 
specifically with victims of crime and how they are dealt with 
throughout the process of the administration of justice. In addition 
to that, a number of programs have been put forward by provincial 
governments across this land in conjunction with communities to 
better enhance and protect victims throughout the criminal justice 
procedure.
<P>
	In my own community of Prince Albert, funding from the 
provincial level is made available to the community. The 
community working in conjunction with the police and the justice 
system has developed a program to better assist victims of crime 
through the court procedure and subsequent to it.
<P>
	All across the country steps like this are being taken. More 
public awareness is being focused on the needs of the victims by 
victims groups and communities. Certainly this field is evolving. 
We all want to do our part at the federal level, at the provincial 
level, at the municipal level, at the community level and at the 
individual level to assist this evolution. In these times of very tight 
resources for all levels of government while it is difficult to do 
immediately all we would like to do, the process which is in place 
to enhance the role of victims, to protect victims of crime and to 
ensure their healing as much as possible in a timely fashion will 
continue.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	In addition to assisting victims of crime, perhaps some of the 
best ways to ensure a reduction in victimization is with the 
co-operation of all levels of government to look more seriously at 
the prevention of crime.
<P>
	First would be looking at and eradicating the social conditions 
which lead to crime. More and more people and communities are 
turning to early intervention in the lives of young people to work 
with them before they end up in conflict with the law and start 
down the path to a life of crime. This is a very productive form of 
prevention which in the long run will reduce the number of victims 
within our society.
<P>
	In addition, it is important to introduce and pass appropriate 
pieces of criminal justice legislation which will make it very clear 
to the population what types of behaviour are not to be tolerated. 
The types of behaviour which are not to be tolerated must be given 
appropriate negative sanctions so that crime can be deterred.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2075"> 2075 </A></B>
<P>
	But sadly, crimes are committed. We need to deal with victims 
of crime to ensure their involvement with the justice system, while 
it can never be painless or easy, is made as easy as possible in 
some sense. The government has enacted a number of very 
specific provisions which deal with victims of crime and their 
involvement with the justice system.
<P>
	For instance, amendments have been put forward to section 745 
of the Criminal Code. When there is a section 745 application, 
victim impact statements will be considered. This is a positive step 
in the right direction. Both the Criminal Code and the Young 
Offenders Act now require that victim impact statements where 
available be heard by the courts. This is yet another positive 
development. In some cases it is appropriate to have the identity of 
victims of crime protected throughout a criminal proceeding. 
Those amendments have been brought forward.
<P>
	Power has been given to police for instance in the gun control 
legislation, under appropriate circumstances to remove firearms 
from the house of an individual who has shown violent behaviour 
or who has threatened individuals. Thus, the likelihood of harm 
from firearms would be reduced. This also assists the victims of 
crime.
<P>
	The department is also reviewing a number of other areas in 
which to assist victims of crime such as when the therapeutic 
records of victims of crime would be released to the courts.
<P>
	All of these areas have been looked at, introduced or are under 
active review by the department. It is important that we cannot pick 
and choose remedies we want to bring forward to assist victims of 
crime. We need to support provisions such as gun control which 
victims groups across the country want and applaud.
<P>
	Although it may be tough, we cannot back away from assisting 
the victims of crime. Whether it is introducing the appropriate 
criminal justice statutes, whether it is establishing the proper 
prevention programs or whether it is establishing a victims bill of 
rights which would more clearly delineate how victims are dealt 
with in the justice system, all these issues need to be dealt with.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	Certainly the minister will be supporting this motion. It is 
imperative that all levels work together, the federal and provincial 
governments, and the communities through whatever means, 
volunteerism, et cetera to each do our part to assist victims of 
crime. I thank the hon. member for putting forward the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the reality in this country is very different from what the 
Liberal Party has been putting forth. The reality is that violent 
crime, particularly among youth, is increasing faster than any other 
aspect of crime.
<P>
	The Liberals promised to deal with the Young Offenders Act in a 
substantive and effective fashion before it became the government. 
Have we seen anything? Absolutely not. We have seen pabulum 
come through the justice department when it comes to dealing with 
young offenders.
<P>
	I ask my hon. friend from the Liberal government to name some 
substantive and effective legislation the government has put forth 
to decrease youth and violent crime. If this is being put forth, I 
would like him to explain to the House why it has not decreased 
violent crime one iota.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, contrary to the statements put 
forward by the hon. member that nothing has been done by the 
government with respect to the Young Offenders Act, I can assure 
the House and the people of Canada this government has taken 
steps to deal with the most serious of young offenders crimes.
<P>
	First of all, for the most serious crimes, the penalties under the 
Young Offenders Act have been toughened. There is no doubt about 
that. It has happened.
<P>
	With respect to whether or not 16 or 17 year olds will appear in 
adult court, the onus that used to be in place has been reversed. 
Now the situation is that young offenders 16 and 17 years of age 
will be in adult court unless they can prove they should be tried in 
youth court. The situation used to be the opposite. The presumption 
had been that 16 and 17 year olds would be tried in youth court.
<P>
	In addition to that, a review of the Young Offenders Act by the 
justice and legal affairs committee continues. Hon. members of the 
Reform Party are involved in that. The committee will be visiting 
five regions of the country. Last week the committee completed the 
first leg of its journey when it visited the maritimes to hear what 
people thought about the Young Offenders Act with a view to 
making further changes.
<P>
	This government is committed to hearing input from people 
across the country which is not the style of the members opposite. 
They like to do things and forget about what the people think. This 
government likes to listen to the people and the justice and legal 
affairs committee will be doing that over the next little while. It 
will be recommending further changes to the Young Offenders Act 
for consideration by the justice minister. In addition, the 
federal-provincial task force on young offenders, the officials and 
ministers, will also be making recommendations to the federal 
minister.
<P>
	A number of very succinct and proper measures have been taken 
by this government. Every single time we bring forward something 
to assist the victims, whether it is Bill C-41, whether it is changes 
to section 745 or whether it is changes to the Young Offenders Act, 
the Reform Party votes against it.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege to speak on the motion concerning 
victims' rights tendered by the member for Fraser Valley West. I 
urge the Minister of Justice to create a national standard for victims 
of crime.
<P>
	We are calling for a fundamental change in the operation of the 
Criminal Code. It is a natural evolution of the movement for justice 
system accountability and a re-examination of the primary 
operational goals of the criminal justice system in Canada. Victims 
have a right to be informed of their rights at every stage of the 
justice process, including those rights involving compensation 
from the offender. They must also be made aware of any victim 
services available.
<P>
	On February 29 of this year, my colleague organized a victims' 
rights rally in Abbotsford, British Columbia. As I surveyed the 
faces in the crowd, I felt a visceral response from them, an urgent 
dissatisfaction with Canada's institutional response to crime and 
how we as society handle offenders in comparison with those 
innocents who are left in the offender's wake. It is clear to me that 
the way the criminal justice operations work does not represent 
mainstream Canadian values.
<P>
	Constituents of mine from New Westminster-Burnaby have 
written to the Minister of Justice. They have submitted petitions 
which I have dutifully presented to the government in the House. 
Sadly, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice do not seem 
to feel the same deep sense of wrong and urgency, to make the 
order of fundamental change that is required to assuage the 
community and respond to Canada's sense of what is right.
<P>
	What is required is a basic rebuilding of the justice system from 
its fundamental pillars. Central to that change must be that the 
system must no longer be so offender focused. That is the old 
agenda of the system defenders, the Liberals and Conservatives 
who gave us the justice system we have today. The community is 
demanding that system changers come forward who have an 
openness to rethink and remake our response to crime.
<P>
	This past while I have had the privilege of introducing several 
private member's bills in the House. They arise from my 
longstanding sensitivity to victims' issues. The message of victims 
has not been self-centred or full of retribution or revenge. Their 
concern is a search for meaning of their circumstance and a hope 
that changes will arise to prevent others from needlessly going 
through what they have experienced, that mostly came from the 
justice system itself, while they were in the midst of their pain and 
loss.
<P>
	As a former officer of the court, I have heard many stories from 
victims. I have observed firsthand how the labyrinthine system 
operates and how the disconnected  parts work in their 
compartments without a unifying mission or a mandate.
<P>
	I made a promise to my constituents that I would try, among 
other things, to make a difference in the way victims of crime are 
treated, the way they are regarded and how they are positioned in 
law. It is time to move beyond community volunteer programs, as 
important as they may be, and write into the law the position of the 
victim from the beginning to the end.
<P>
	On March 27 of this year I introduced private member's Bill 
C-247. I had received complaints that some persons were causing 
public disturbances and destroying an important part of community 
living, the places enjoyed by families. The victims in this case are 
the local communities across the country, especially for the 
liveability for young children. What is frustrating is that those 
causing the public disturbance, causing mothers to hang on to their 
children tightly as they pass them by and having merchants 
experience the social life of commerce turned into a danger zone, 
that these perpetrators are not controlled.
<P>
	We are well aware that our local shopping malls, community 
centres, sports arenas and libraries are popular hangouts for youths 
who want to be rather negative. In particular, the most popular spot 
to hang out in a mall is in the food court where the action is of 
people traffic.
<P>
	If the problem ensues and the mall security guard is forced to 
remove a person, a little known fact is that the person being 
removed is permitted by law to re-enter immediately, provided 
there is no resistance in the removal and no charge develops. There 
is nothing that the security guard can do but to continue to ask the 
person to leave.
<P>
	Why do we have such a loophole in the Criminal Code? It is 
because the community as victim in this situation is not regarded as 
highly as the nuisance-maker and show off, the destroyer of 
community peace and order.
<P>
	The property owner is being victimized because the Criminal 
Code is full of holes, the same holes that the Minister of Justice 
says do not exist.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	In my riding, the New Westminster police have a storefront 
office in the Westminster Mall as part of their community policing 
program. Members of the force have told me that their hands are 
tied in such a situation. They cannot do a thing unless the Criminal 
Code is changed.
<P>
	Every town in this country daily struggles with public order and 
millions are spent for security guards and monitoring systems 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2077"> 2077 </A></B>
<P>
because the local community, as a victim, is not important to the 
government. My small bill  on this matter will solve the problem 
for communities in that situation.
<P>
	When Reform members bring forward private members' bills 
they are serious attempts, not media stunts. We want to make 
Canada a safer place in which to live. We want people to have the 
ability to walk the streets in safety. We want Canadians to know 
that their rights are being respected. Most importantly, we want to 
ensure that victims of crime do not become pushed to the sidelines 
and receive little help while the perpetrator receives most of the 
resources of government help.
<P>
	In the previous session of this Parliament, I introduced Bill 
C-323, an act to amend the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (order 
of discharge). The way the act currently stands, an offender can be 
released from having to pay any damages arising from assault, 
awarded in a civil lawsuit, if the offender claims bankruptcy.
<P>
	When my Bill C-323 was before the House for second reading 
debate on December 8, 1996, government members were very 
supportive of my amendments to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
Act and indicated so in their speeches.
<P>
	The member for Lambtom-Middlesex stated: ``This is an 
excellent amendment. I commend the hon. member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby for it. I would like to see the same 
principle applied to all categories listed in section 178, not just the 
assault cases''.
<P>
	The member for Nickel Belt stated: ``This legislation is a clear 
example of a good idea whose time has come. We all know that the 
hon. member for New Westminster-Burnaby has hit upon an 
excellent idea and a worthy amendment and we all want to see it 
incorporated in the law as soon as possible''.
<P>
	Finally, the member for Durham stated: ``The bill presented by 
the member is a good one and deserves the support of the House. I 
would be happy to support the member in that initiative''.
<P>
	The words of these members are encouraging and I hope I will be 
able to count on their votes when my amendment is raised in the 
industry committee.
<P>
	Today's motion is to implement a victims' bill of rights. That is 
really no different in principle from moving an amendment to the 
bankruptcy act. Both would assist victims and both would make 
Canada a safer place to live.
<P>
	If Liberal members chose to vote against today's motion or work 
to dilute it, they will be telling their constituents that victims' 
rights are not paramount. For I assert that the notion of equal 
balance between victim and offender is a mistaken one and is not 
supported by Canadians.
<P>
	A victims' bill of rights is a good way to begin the process of the 
hundreds of adjustments to the system that need to be made at all 
levels of government so there  develops a unifying theme around 
which the justice system can operate. Peace and community order, 
protecting it and restoring it on behalf of victims can be a unifying 
theme.
<P>
	Those who are in conflict with society and affected by sanctions 
of the Criminal Code can be offered paths to community 
restoration by fulfilling the obligations of punishment in all its 
complexity.
<P>
	I recommend a thoughtful reflection of the deeper philosophical 
implications of what is being brought to the House by this motion. 
Let there be light. Let there be some insight. The light shines in the 
darkness and darkness comprehends it not. May light overcome the 
darkness and may we become more positive system changers 
instead of remaining mere system defenders.
<P>
	Canadians deserve better than our current justice system and 
today's motion is the place to start.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for putting his points forward.
<P>
	As is currently the case, a number of provinces have put forward 
victims' rights legislation and have through the use of various 
mechanisms raised money for the provision of services to victims 
within provincial jurisdictions. They have utilized the victims of 
crime surcharge which can be placed on fines which are collected 
for Criminal Code offences and have raised money in that respect. 
They have put in place services for victims.
<P>
	I believe there is room for the federal government to work with 
the provinces in this regard.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	I am curious why Reform Party members, who are usually so 
``let the provinces do everything and the federal government do 
nothing'' are suggesting that the federal government do everything. 
What would they do with the work that is already done by the 
provinces? Have they consulted with the provinces on what action 
the federal government would take? Have they agreement among 
the provinces on what action the federal government should take so 
that it is not imposing costs on them?
<P>
	In addition, how would the Reform Party handle the costs to the 
system that could be imposed?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a matter of cost, it is a matter of 
priority and a social philosophy of what you see as particularly 
important.
<P>
	We are looking beyond the volunteer status of victims' services. 
I have three victims' services programs running in my riding. One 
operates out of the RCMP detachment with a retired staff sergeant 
in charge. He has about 40 volunteers on his list.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2078"> 2078 </A></B>
<P>
	In New Westminster a volunteer victim services program is 
attached to the police. One also operates out of the crown 
counsel's office. They get some grant money from time to time 
but basically they are run on a volunteer basis at the discretion 
of a justice system that goes from the top to the bottom.
<P>
	We are talking about moving beyond that. It is something like 
the movement we had years ago when the Mothers of Drunk 
Drivers program became popular and reported in the news media. 
Those mothers began to sit in the back of courtrooms on a 
volunteer basis to provide pressure. Eventually the justice system 
ever so slowly responded and it is a different situation that we have 
now than 25 years ago.
<P>
	What we are suggesting is that it is time to move beyond 
volunteer services, perhaps even look at the Constitution. Victims 
need status in the law and in the overall operation of the justice 
system. We say that as far as the responsibility of the federal 
government is concerned, build the law and the victims' services 
will come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege to speak on the victims' bill of rights 
motion that my hon. colleague is putting forward. It is long 
overdue.
<P>
	This all started back in 1983-84 when the Liberal justice minister 
of the day said that Canadian justice was going to move away from 
making the victim its primary responsibility and move toward the 
convicted as their primary responsibility.
<P>
	This has had a fundamental effect on the mindset of the justice 
system over the last 13 years. As a result Reform members have 
had to put forward legislation along the lines of that which my 
colleague is putting forward, a victims' bill of right. Why? Because 
the victims of this country have had their rights abrogated by a 
judicial system whose interest should be to protect them first and 
foremost. That is no longer the case. Countless numbers of victims 
have had their rights subjugated to the rights of the convicted.
<P>
	Here are some pathetic examples. Imagine if you will you are 
person who has been raped. You have no rights whatsoever under 
the current justice system to know the health status of the person 
who raped you. You have no rights to know if he is HIV positive. 
You have no rights to know if he is carrying sexually transmitted 
diseases like gonorrhoea, chlamydia and hepatitis. Those rights do 
not exist. This is one of the things that my colleague and we in the 
Reform Party wish to change.
<P>
	Imagine if you will that your child has been violated by a 
pedophile or that a loved one of yours has been raped. Currently 
that rapist or pedophile can come an live right next door to you if he 
so chooses. That can happen. Do the victims have a right to know 
about this? No, they do not.
<P>
	In my riding I have had a situation where a serial pedophile who 
raped and violated little children more than 1,000 times came to 
live in the neighbourhood of its victims. These victims were 
absolutely beside themselves with fear and abject terror.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Why do we not have a justice system which protects these 
individuals from having to endure a situation of terror and fear 
after they have already been violated by an individual? That is 
fundamentally wrong and bespeaks poorly of a justice system that 
is meant to protect these individuals.
<P>
	It is fundamental that these victims have the right to know where 
and when the people who perpetrated these violations on them will 
be and where they will live and their whereabouts. As we all know, 
there is no treatment for violent sexual predators. There are many 
attempts but there is no effective treatment. Therefore victims have 
a right to know where these individuals are.
<P>
	The third is victims' impact statements. It must be the right of 
the victim to give a victim impact statement orally or in writing if 
they so choose. It is not a choice but it should be their right to have 
this. The courts must understand what it was like for that person to 
endure the crime perpetrated on them.
<P>
	Fifth, the victim must understand what is happening in the court 
proceedings. They must understand what is being plea bargained 
away, why it is being plea bargained away, and what deals are being 
made between the crown and the accused's defence. It is very 
important for the peace of mind of the victims that they understand 
the whole process taking place if they are to feel justice is being 
done.
<P>
	Sixth, it is very important that we err on the side of the 
protection of the individual in society at large. We have to move 
away from what we have said before, that the convicted will have 
our primary focus. The victim must be the primary responsibility 
of the justice system. That is simply not the case now.
<P>
	I will give a true life example. There was a young boy in my 
riding. He was a handicapped child who could not mobilize very 
well. He was 13 years old. He was sexually assaulted by an 18-year 
old boy. He was raped. The court case took place. The 18-year old 
was charged and convicted. The convicted 18-year old turn around 
and said ``I'm a victim because of things that happened in my 
past''. That may be so.
<P>
	What happened was that the child who was raped did not have 
anywhere near the counselling, the care and the attention from our 
justice system and health professionals he needed. The convicted 
had many times the amount of money in support than the victim. 
The convicted had the primary focus of the justice system whereas 
the victim was forgotten. This bespeaks of a  justice system that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2079"> 2079 </A></B>
<P>
does not fulfil its fundamental role, which is the protection of 
society and its members.
<P>
	It is true that many people who commit offences, who are 
incarcerated in our prisons have had very serious and very sad 
lives. Their early childhood development has been riddled with 
with a great number of tragic and unbelievably terrible things. This 
is very common. However, one's history does not exonerate one 
from committing criminal acts today. We can understand what they 
have done but it does not exonerate them or excuse them from 
committing those acts.
<P>
	Therefore we have to take a multilevel approach. We have to 
protect the victim, as my hon. colleague mentioned so eloquently 
in his speeches and in his victim's impact statement, which I 
encourage every member of the House to get a copy of before they 
vote on it. I also encourage every member to look at new ways we 
can address the precursors and ask ourselves why these individuals 
commit these offences.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	Many of these individuals have grown up in terrible family 
situations. We must deal with these situations early on. Children in 
environments where they are being beaten up and sexually abused 
are not being given the necessities to build up the basic pillars of a 
normal psyche. Where those things are absent we must collectively 
deal with the families to help the children. If the children do not 
have the pillars of a normal psyche they will grow up to be adults 
without the pillars of a normal psyche. That will manifest itself in 
conduct disorders in adolescence and in criminal behaviour in 
adulthood.
<P>
	These things can be done without spending money. In the United 
States some interesting experiments have been conducted. They 
have looked at inner city school boards where there is a high degree 
of violence, drop out rates, teen pregnancy and criminal behaviour. 
They brought the children into the schools very early on, at the age 
of five or six. Not only did they teach the children their A, B, Cs, 
they taught the children what appropriate conflict resolution was 
and what drugs were all about. They learned about self-respect and 
having respect for others. These are normal pillars of a normal 
psyche which we all require to function in a caring and functional 
society.
<P>
	These are things which the justice system ought to take a look at 
in conjunction with provincial counterparts, as the Liberal member 
mentioned. We must work with provincial governments and 
education departments, which are an integral factor, in addressing 
these problems to put an end to conduct disorders and violent and 
criminal behaviour.
<P>
	It is incumbent on all of us as legislators to put first and foremost 
the rights of innocent victims in our justice system. The convicted 
must be taken care of as well, but  our primary responsibility is to 
the victims who through no fault of their own have been violated.
<P>
	I encourage every member of the House to vote for the victims' 
bill of rights presented by the hon. member for Fraser Valley West. 
They will be doing it for themselves, their children and, most 
important, for Canadians from coast to coast.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
point out to the hon. member that the government has taken a 
significant number of steps in the review of criminal legislation to 
improve the safety of our homes and streets.
<P>
	Certainly it is within the discretion of local chiefs of police to 
indicate to the appropriate people, when considering all the 
circumstances at their disposal, to release in varying degrees into 
the community information about the presence of sexual offenders.
<P>
	The government has made changes to the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act to make it easier to keep individuals in 
custody to the end of their sentence.
<P>
	The government has also introduced gun control legislation 
which allows police in appropriate circumstances to remove 
firearms from a house where there is a threat of use by the 
perpetrator of a crime or by someone who has made threats.
<P>
	The minister has indicated that new legislation is on the way to 
deal with dangerous long term offenders. There is a possible review 
of the dangerous offender provisions to allow greater latitude or a 
greater length of time under which a dangerous offender 
application can be made.
<P>
	There has been the institution of peace bonds to ensure greater 
protection for victims of crime.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	There is the possible introduction of long term offender 
designation which would allow community supervision for up to 10 
years after release. This is in addition to a number of other steps 
which have increased the tools of law enforcement agencies, 
provincial attorneys general to detect and prosecute crime.
<P>
	We would like to see the hon. member acknowledging the 
progress by the government, while everyone in the House 
acknowledges there is still more work to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my hon. colleague for the question.
<P>
	On gun control, regardless of whichever way we look at this, 
there will be up to $500 million removed from the functional 
arm of justice to gun control. There is something called an 
economic cost. That means that if we are moving money from A 
to B, we had better make sure we are getting more bang for our 
buck in B than in A.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2080"> 2080 </A></B>
<P>
	There has been nothing to prove that the new legislation put 
forth will make any difference in crime. There is an abundance 
of studies showing the exact opposite, that the new changes in gun 
control will not work.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party are committed to having good solid gun 
control legislation which protects individuals and society but we 
are loathe to support legislation that will make our streets less safe. 
The gun control legislation put forth by the government had 
nothing to do with keeping the streets safer but everything to do 
with seducing an urban population.
<P>
	On the concept of the police, the police would do a lot more if 
they were supported by the courts, but they are not. If my hon. 
colleague would talk to the men and women in our police forces 
who day in and day out put their lives on the line and ask them 
whether the courts support them, he will get a very different picture 
because they do not.
<P>
	They do not because of the decisions made in the past and a legal 
morass our judicial system is now under. It is weighted down by a 
legal morass that prevents justice from taking place. We need to 
rethink and look at that.
<P>
	We also have to look at the way police officers are hampered by 
the legal documentation and paperwork they have to endure in their 
jobs. It impedes their ability to get their work done.
<P>
	On the concept of restitution, restitution is not mentioned 
anywhere. The government has not done anything to deal with 
restitution to the victims from the criminals.
<P>
	An important point for many individuals who have had to put 
restraining orders on individuals who have been hunting them, 
harassing them, is that restraining orders do not work. They are not 
enforced properly and we need to take a long, hard look at ensuring 
our restraining order system will work to protect those individuals 
being harassed and victimized.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to speak to the opposition motion put forward by the 
member for Fraser Valley West, the victims' bill of rights.
<P>
	Crime and victimization are complex and challenging social 
problems. The government believes dealing with these issues 
requires a thoughtful, informed and long term approach, one that 
deals with the early causes of crime.
<P>
	A two-month old baby is left to cry when he needs comfort so 
that he will not be spoiled. A three-year old girl hears her dad abuse 
her mom one more time. A pregnant woman has another drink. 
What do these situations have to do with crime prevention and 
community safety? As isolated incidents maybe not a lot,  but when 
they represent patterns for these children, the outcome may have an 
impact on crime and victimization.
<P>
	Under the safe homes, safe streets initiative, the government 
formed the Canadian National Crime Prevention Council, an 
independent council of 25 volunteers from across the country. Its 
main focus is on the needs of children and youth and its 
commitment is to crime prevention through social development.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	Thanks to the council's work we are discovering some of the 
links, links between what happens to children from the prenatal 
stage to six years old and what becomes of them as adolescents and 
later as adults in our communities. The child victim often becomes 
the criminal offender. The reasons for this are varied and complex.
<P>
	We know quite a bit about the childhood experiences of 
persistent offenders. We want to apply this knowledge to help 
children and families when they need it most. Poverty can bring 
with it a host of threats to children, including poor health, high 
family stress and difficulty forming warm, secure attachments to 
caregivers.
<P>
	Risks to a fetus, including fetal alcohol syndrome and low birth 
weight, may affect a baby's brain development which can lead to 
hyperactivity, emotional problems and then to school failure, a risk 
factor in itself of delinquent behaviour. When parents do not get 
along and are unresponsive or overly authoritarian, children are 
also at risk. Socially competent children need emotionally 
available parents.
<P>
	The community and the broader society in which our children 
grow can make a tremendous difference, not only in terms of 
financial support but also by encouraging resilience in high risk 
children. Resilient children who succeed despite having the odds 
stacked against them share certain traits. Many of these protective 
traits result from family and social influences.
<P>
	Optimism for example has its roots in infancy, in a child being 
able to count on life feeling good. Competence, another such trait, 
depends on the support, encouragement and opportunities provided 
by interested adults. If a parent cannot provide the support, then 
another relative, a family friend or member of the community can 
step in and fill the gap.
<P>
	Although much of this knowledge may seem like common sense, 
it must not be ignored when we develop policies and programs in 
response to crime and victimization. The lessons of early 
prevention are often pushed aside in the rush for harsher penalties 
for young offenders. There is even a demand by some for more of 
those charged with non-violent crimes to be imprisoned. This 
response may reflect our empathy for victims but it does not get at 
the underlying factors which lead to crime.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2081"> 2081 </A></B>
<P>
	What do parents, families and communities need to nurture 
children in loving, supportive environments? If a child or teen 
breaks the law, what is the best way to intervene, to repair the 
harm done to the victim and to prevent a second crime? A victims 
bill of rights would not protect a child from abuse, provide him 
with a hot breakfast or a sympathetic ear. The way to prevent 
Canadians from becoming victims in the first place is to nurture, 
value and protect our children. For it is the neglected, abused and 
mistreated child who is most likely to find himself or herself 
involved in criminal activity later in life, a pattern that can be 
broken before it is too late.
<P>
	The National Crime Prevention Council has been working in this 
vein on a prevention guide book for Canadians. The guide book 
will explain how crime and victimization can be traced back to 
childhood and how we can prevent crime from happening in the 
first place. I am sure that members of the House join me in looking 
forward to the launch of the guide book at the June Atlantic crime 
prevention conference in P.E.I. Early prevention is the key.
<P>
	I am pleased to advise the House and the member for Fraser 
Valley West that I will support this motion. It is a step in the right 
direction. However, we must focus on the formative years of our 
children to ensure they do not reach a state where they are heavily 
involved in crime.

	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have

follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House urge the government to direct the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs to proceed with the drafting of a victims' bill of rights, 
and that, in such areas where the committee determines a right to be more 
properly a provincial concern-and I emphasize this part of the motion-the 
Minister of Justice initiate consultations with the provinces aimed at arriving at 
a national standard-and I also emphasize this expression-for a victims' bill of 
rights.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Victims have rights, victims have needs. If I may, I will use an 
illustration from testimony I heard before the standing committee 
on justice from a person who had lost a loved one when a crime was 
committed. This person did not tell us about loss of income, but 
rather about her emotional loss. She did not tell us about the 
criminal aspects involved, but rather about needing the government 
to offer her support during this difficult time.
<P>
	This person was the indirect victim of a crime. I am telling this 
story to emphasize that the victims of crime are not the only direct 
victims. Sometimes people around the victim also suffer the 
consequences. The contribution the government can make to these 
direct or indirect victims is not just legal or financial, but also 
moral, supportive in nature.
<P>
	How many times do we see victims or their relatives hounded by 
the media? What recourse, what protection do these people in their 
state of shock have to help them hang on to the privacy they need at 
a difficult time?
<P>
	These are important questions. Victims and those close to them 
have rights because they have needs. Now, to meet these needs, to 
guard these rights, the question is: Who is best placed to do the job?
<P>
	Naturally, the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of protecting and 
compensating victims of crime; this is a given. And in Quebec, for 
a number of years now, we have had legislation that provides this 
protection and compensation for victims of crime. As I have just 
told you, in Quebec, the Government of Quebec has legislated this 
protection, this compensation. Why? Because it is a provincial 
responsibility.
<P>
	Because this is a provincial area of responsibility, the federal 
government therefore has no business interfering. Let us be very 
clear, then: the Bloc Quebecois is strongly in favour of the 
protection and compensation of victims, but by the appropriate 
level of government; and, in this case, it is the provinces. Quebec 
has been active for a number of years in this area of jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	To put it more plainly, the jurisdiction proposed in the motion is 
not a matter for the federal government through the criminal law, 
that is section 91 (27), but, rather, concerns property and civil 
rights in the province, or section 92 (13). Therefore, national 
standards in this area would constitute flagrant interference in the 
provinces' exclusive areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	You will tell me that that would not be the first time. I am afraid 
not. In how many areas has the federal government, through its 
spending authority, interfered? If we look strictly at spending 
authority, the federal government could begin compensating 
victims left, right, and centre, first thing tomorrow. In one sense, 
these people would probably not be upset, but as I pointed out, 
what is important for victims or those close to them, is less the 
money than the comfort and moral support.
<P>
	This person, who went through this unfortunate experience and 
described it to the justice committee added, and this is important, 
that a public servant had actually telephoned her the day after 
reading the newspapers to tell her that the pension cheque of her 
now dead loved one was already in the mail and that she should 
take steps to return it. The next day, twenty four hours later.
<P>
	What victims or those close to them need is not necessarily 
financial compensation, but understanding, moral support, respect 
for human dignity, and these are things that the provinces are well 
equipped to provide. The provinces have all that is needed to do the 
social work required to ensure the respect of human dignity. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2082"> 2082 </A></B>
<P>
repeat then, national standards in this area would  constitute a 
flagrant infringement on areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	This is not just my own opinion I am stating; on two occasions 
already the Privy Council-which, as you know, was the level of 
last recourse at the time, until its abolition in 1949-acknowledged 
provincial jurisdiction over victim compensation. This is the legal 
precedent, formed in the past, and formed solidly. It is something 
already in place, something that ought not to be opened to 
re-examination and challenge at this time.
<P>
	In 1920, in its decision on Canadian Pacific v. the British 
Columbia Workers Compensation Board, the Privy Council 
acknowledged that, when victims are to be compensated, even if 
the company in question happens to be under federal jurisdiction, 
section 92(13) of the Constitution takes precedence and the 
provincial legislation applies. Now, in 1996, we cannot again 
question a practice that was entrenched in our Constitution, unless 
the Constitution itself is laid open to question.
<P>
	In another decision, in 1937, following a reference on 
unemployment insurance, the Privy Council reaffirmed the 
provinces' exclusive jurisdiction over victim compensation. This is 
why-I shall make this my concluding statement-the Reform 
motion, despite its praiseworthy intentions, runs totally counter to 
the policy of the Reform Party, which has been calling since it 
arrived here for greater decentralization of the federal system and 
respect for the exclusive provincial areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	Praiseworthy intentions, but the wrong approach, surprisingly. I 
would have preferred the Reform Party to continue along its path of 
decentralization of powers and respect for the jurisdictions of each 
of the provinces, instead of giving in to what I am sure was a flood 
of good intentions, and questioning an area of jurisdiction which is 
clearly provincial.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
comment from the hon. member from the Bloc flies in the face of 
reality; decentralization on a number of issues from education, to 
health care, to job retraining and all these other areas we have 
talked about and have been promoting the idea or suggesting 
governments look at the British North America Act again and start 
getting things back in proper perspective and let the provinces look 
after certain areas and get the federal government to ensure 
standardization across the county and let the provinces handle 
things.
<P>
	However, when it comes to the justice system, to say that 
although our intentions are honourable in terms of victims' rights, 
the federal government very much has to be involved in something 
like this.
<P>
	It very much has to ensure that no matter where we live, whether 
it is in Quebec-a great province in this wonderful country where 
they belong and where this member should stop trying to pull them 
out of-British Columbia, Newfoundland or anywhere, we need a 
constitution, a set of laws which applies all across the country. 
Within the various provincial jurisdictions we then allow for the 
differences needed to be applied.
<P>
	We have federal laws in the criminal system and we have 
provincial laws. Quebec has civil laws as well and we respect that 
difference based on history. For him to say that although our 
intentions are honourable we should butt out of the legal system is 
ridiculous.
<P>
	This is an honest attempt by our member from Fraser Valley 
West to look after the interests of all Canadians whether 
anglophone, francophone or of ethnic origin from any country. It is 
to look after the victims. That is the point, victims who are, as the 
justice minister said, orphans of the justice system.
<P>
	Somebody commits a crime. They are tried and found guilty. 
The victim is either beat up, dead or suffering physically. Once the 
trial is over they are forgotten. What we spend money and time and 
effort on is rehabilitation. Our system of justice is out of whack. 
The punishment does not match the crime over half the time. The 
judges have too much leeway. Instead of spending time in 
narrowing choices, and the House has the right to do that, we waste 
our time on other measures. We should be concentrating on items 
like this to ensure we are bringing a balance to the justice system.
<P>
	This issue of decentralization and victims' rights is something 
the federal government should very much be involved in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know this intervention from the 
Reform Party is very sincere. However, in Quebec for many years 
we have been doing exactly what the Reform Party is proposing 
right now. Many other provinces have not done so. The privy 
council recognizes those powers and has given them to the 
provinces as per the Constitution
<P>
	Basically what I am saying is let every province copy the 
example of Quebec. Quebec is different. Quebec on this subject 
and on many other subjects has taken the lead in Canada. We were 
here first, so maybe that explains it. However, if anyone wants to 
come to Quebec and have a look at how we are doing it, they are 
welcome. Then they can copy whatever we are doing.
<P>
	However, do not duplicate once again here in the House with 
measures that are already implemented and working successfully 
in Quebec. That would be duplication. That would be spending the 
public's money unwisely. The intent is fine, but let the provinces do 
it as Quebec has been doing it.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Could the member for 
Portneuf help me out? Was it his intention to share his time? He has 
had ten minutes, and he has another ten minute block for his 
speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, that was my intention, and I 
thought it had been understood. I see that perhaps it was not. In 
which case, I am sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Drummond.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Everything is in order. The 
member for Portneuf used only ten minutes, which is the time 
allowed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to take part in the debate on this motion. It asks the 
government to direct the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs to draft a victims' bill of rights. If the committee 
determines a right to be a provincial concern, the Minister of 
Justice would have to initiate consultations to establish a national 
standard.
<P>
	The Bloc cannot join the Reform Party in supporting this motion, 
and I will explain why. However, I would first like to make it very 
clear that the Bloc Quebecois supports the protection and 
compensation of victims of criminal acts. This is basic, as my 
colleague for Portneuf pointed out. However, victim compensation 
is clearly a matter for the provinces, and the federal government 
has no reason to get involved in this area of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	This right is a matter for provincial administration of justice. In 
fact, this cannot be a matter of federal criminal law under section 
91(27) of the Constitution Act. It in fact comes under provincial 
property and civil rights under section 92(13) of the Constitution. I 
think this is clear.
<P>
	Therefore national standards in this area would be a flagrant 
encroachment on areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. Twice 
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the court of final 
appeal before its abolition in 1949, recognized the jurisdiction of 
the provinces over matters of victim compensation.
<P>
	First, in 1920, in the matter of the Canadian Pacific and the 
British Columbia Workmen's Compensation Board, the Privy 
Council recognized that, in the case of victim compensation, even 
if the company involved were under federal jurisdiction, section 
92(13) of the Constitution Act applied. This too is clear. The court 
concluded that the laws of British Columbia applied in the case of 
victim compensation.
<P>
	In another ruling in 1937, in the <I>Reference on Unemployment 
Insurance</I>, the Privy Council reaffirmed exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction over compensation of victims. Clearly, from these 
rulings, compensation of victims is a provincial matter. 
Accordingly the motion by  the Reform Party directly contravenes 
their party policy, which advocates greater decentralization of the 
federal system and full respect of exclusive provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	It is surprising as well to see the Reform Party defending 
victims' rights, when it voted against the bill on gun registration.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc believes that prevention is the best way to protect 
victims. In other words, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of 
cure, as everybody knows.
<P>
	With its contradictory positions, the Reform Party is revealing 
the inconsistency of its policy on crime.
<P>
	You cannot properly defend the rights of victims when you 
refuse to prevent crime by voting against the mandatory 
registration of guns, a measure aimed at preventing an increase in 
violent crime.
<P>
	Another reason this motion must be rejected has to do with the 
throne speech. Following the throne speech, the Liberal 
government made a commitment to stop spending and encroaching 
on areas under the jurisdiction of the provinces without their 
approval. Accordingly, before the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Legal Affairs is asked to consider the matter, the approval of 
the provinces would have to be sought. It would in all likelihood be 
denied by most of them.
<P>
	Quebec is the leader with its Crime Victims Compensation Act. 
This legislation provides for a plan to compensate injured victims 
of crimes. Compensation is also provided for families of 
individuals killed. This legislation does not prevent civil law suits 
against an assailant for material damages or bodily harm.
<P>
	This act fully meets the necessary objective of compensating the 
victims of criminal acts, especially since claims for compensation 
are examined by a commission which will ensure that the amount 
of compensation awarded is sufficient, fair and equitable.
<P>
	The provinces have no need of the federal level to administer 
areas over which they have exclusive jurisdiction, particularly 
since Quebec's legislation on the treatment of offenders and 
victims is far more open and far less repressive than elsewhere in 
Canada. But when there is a desire to impose national standards, 
not only must the areas in which the standards are to be imposed 
come under federal jurisdiction, but also the government must have 
the necessary funds to invest in the undertaking.
<P>
	At the present time, the federal government no longer has the 
financial capacity to invest in encroaching on areas of provincial 
jurisdiction. On the contrary, the financial hole the future 
generations will have to get themselves out of is due, in large part, 
to the massive federal invasion of areas that are the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2084"> 2084 </A></B>
<P>
	The federal government has used its financial clout to impose 
national standards on the provinces by sharing program costs. This 
centralizing trend is running down at this time, simply because 
of the financial irresponsibility of the federal government, which 
has sought to add to its power by thumbing its nose at the division 
of powers imposed by the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	In conclusion, it is clear that the federal government has no place 
in the area of victim compensation. Federal invasion of this area 
would constitute an unacceptable encroachment into provincial 
jurisdictions and would run directly counter to the Liberal 
government's promises in the throne speech.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
couple of quick questions. First, I heard from this speaker and the 
previous speaker about the encroachment of the federal 
government into provincial jurisdiction. Point 8 of our victims' bill 
of rights states that if a person convicted of a sexual offence has a 
sexually transmitted disease, the victim of that offender should be 
able to find out about that fact. There was rape case tried in 
Montreal where the victim asked to have the perpetrator tested for 
AIDS and it was denied under the charter of rights. Yet both the 
previous speakers said they are doing very nicely and they do not 
need these kinds of rights.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	That is one illustration. I am sure that if I searched I would find a 
lot more examples of how it is just not being done in Quebec even 
though it is claimed that it is.
<P>
	The approach being taken by the member is not a focus on the 
victims, it is still a focus on sovereignty and separation from the 
country. Is the member not trying to indicate that legislation that 
may come from this House would not apply to them because they 
choose to be another country, rather than concentrating on victims' 
rights.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that our colleague from the 
Reform Party is mixing apples and oranges. Nobody is trying to 
drag sovereignty into this motion. As I said earlier, the Bloc 
Quebecois is clearly in favour of protecting and compensating 
victims of crime.
<P>
	What we are saying is that the administration of justice comes 
under the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces. I will tell him 
again why that is so. This area of jurisdiction cannot come under 
the federal authority over criminal law set out in section 91 (27) of 
the Constitution Act. It comes instead under property and civil 
rights, which are under provincial jurisdiction, pursuant to section 
92 (13) of the Constitution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my congratulations to the hon. member for  Drummond 
for having grasped the problem. I do not think that Reform has. The 
Reform Party, and this we have seen in several matters, makes 
comments, talks about certain things without really understanding 
the ins and outs of the subject.
<P>
	Anything concerning the victims of criminal acts, and all of the 
issue of victims' rights, is the responsibility of the government of 
each province. If the Reform Party understood this rather important 
little item, it would perhaps see fewer problems in certain matters, 
would perhaps accuse us less of talking sovereignty or 
Constitution, if they at least wanted to respect the present 
Constitution. That is where one of the problems of the federal 
government lies, and the Reform Party represents that problem 
very well, the desire to legislate in areas that do not belong to it.
<P>
	As I saw for myself when a member of the justice and legal 
affairs committee where we assessed the Young Offenders Act 
among other things, we in Quebec are at least 25 years ahead of the 
Reform Party. I understand that they do not understand that this is 
an area that does not belong to them, that this is not a federal 
jurisdiction. If everyone respected the Constitution, the country 
might not be so deep in debt today, perhaps we would not be 
discussing the things we are today.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member for Drummond, perhaps for 
the benefit of the Reformers, to repeat the extremely important bit 
of her speech in which she said that Quebec has an act for 
compensating the victims of crime. I would like her to go over it a 
bit so that the Reform members might understand what they did not 
grasp. Now we are giving them the chance to turn to the French 
channel and listen to the answer they will get.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Quebec Crime Victims 
Compensation Act provides for a plan to compensate injured 
victims of crimes. Compensation is also provided for families of 
individuals killed. This legislation does not prevent civil law suits 
against an assailant for material damages or bodily harm.
<P>
	It meets the objectives for compensation of victims of crime, 
particularly because requests for compensation are examined by a 
commission for victims of crime, which ensures that victims 
receive sufficient, just and equitable compensation. This is the 
effect of this law.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to address one item in the speech of the hon. member for 
Drummond. She said the Reform Party is not consistent and is 
contradictory. It is not really protecting victims and victims' rights 
because we voted against the gun control bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2085"> 2085 </A></B>
<P>
	That is a pretty general and blank statement. Perhaps the 
information she received was ill-informed, much like the hon. 
member for Kingston and the Islands is half the time, uninformed 
and ill-informed.
<P>
	I want to put on the record that the primary reason this party 
voted against the gun control bill was because it was an omnibus 
bill. It confused the punishment for the criminal misuse of firearms 
which we support. We favoured that part of the bill and in fact we 
recommended in amendments that it go to five years instead of four 
years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Nonsense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> If the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands 
would listen he would also learn from this.
<P>
	It is the firearms registration portion that we were against and 
that is why we voted against it. I do not see where we are 
contradictory at all. We are interested in victims' rights.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> No doubt the hon. member 
for Kingston and the Islands would like to answer but he will have 
to wait for another time. I am sure he will seize that opportunity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would say this to the Reform 
member: When you are out to protect victims, you make sure you 
have the best means of protecting them, and the best way of 
protecting them is prevention. To my way of thinking, protection 
outweighs cure.
<P>
	Reform members opposed the bill on gun control, which, to my 
mind, is not the way to prevent violence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I 
remember correctly, the hon. member for Calgary Centre voted in 
favour of the gun control legislation that this government proposed. 
I am surprised he is talking from the opposing side about it right 
now.
<P>
	There is no question that all members in the House support 
services to victims and better treatment for victims within the 
criminal justice system.
<P>
	I have been involved in a judicial agency, Youth in Conflict with 
the Law in the Waterloo region. I was involved with a whole series 
of organizations that dealt with offenders, the community and 
victims. There is no question as we examine the various programs 
that are offered in the country that Quebec is very much a leader in 
the area of criminal justice reform as well as dealing with victims 
of crime.
<P>
	When I first became involved in working with offenders in the 
early seventies it became very clear that for the rehabilitation of 
young offenders, they would have to face up to their actions. They 
would have to make contact, where possible, with the people that 
they victimized and they would have to make restitution.
<P>
	We have a number of programs in my community. We have 
pioneered many programs related to the judicial system in the 
Waterloo region. One of the programs that we pioneered was Youth 
in Conflict with the Law, working with young offenders.
<P>
	Another program we pioneered was Kitchener House, a halfway 
house, so when people were being released from provincial 
institutions they would be eased into the community. The John 
Howard Society was active in our community and the Mennonite 
Central Committee started up the first victim offender 
reconciliation program back in the seventies. That is where the 
victim and the offender come together. When they are younger 
individuals it impresses on them the seriousness of their acts and 
the fact that there is a person involved who is hurt. From the 
victim's perspective, in many cases it helps them demystify who 
the offender is. We try to work out some compensation, fiscal and 
voluntary, that the offender can make to compensate the victim.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	We also recognized that victim services needed to be present 
within the police department. When victims were going to the 
courts and facing the trauma that victims face, people would be 
assisting them and explaining to them how the judicial system, 
which can be a very complex system, works.
<P>
	There was also a group which initially got involved because of a 
sentence handed down to a sexual offender. A grandfather had 
sexually abused his granddaughter and they felt the grandfather got 
an inappropriately low sentence. The group started out calling 
themselves citizens concerned with crimes against children. 
Initially it was a lobby group reacting against the sentence. The 
next thing it had become involved in victim services in the 
community working with children, doing a lot of prevention work. 
Its members are always ready to respond in case help is needed, be 
it from the police or from other family members, but they were 
always there to assist the victim.
<P>
	One of the troublesome aspects of the present state of affairs in 
the criminal justice system is we do not do enough to re-examine 
the way we deal with crime. In many cases we are following a 
knee-jerk approach, an approach that is being driven by the rhetoric 
of members of the Reform Party.
<P>
	We get into a mindset that says we should try to deal with crime 
in a ``lock them up, throw away the key'' approach. In my 
community the victim services program for the police which we 
pioneered and which was supported by the provincial government, 
under the Harris government has been cut, slashed. That is for 
victims' rights. They are the kissing cousins of the Reform Party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2086"> 2086 </A></B>
<P>
	The program for husbands who abuse their spouses, run by the 
John Howard Society, was slashed to the bone. This program was 
to stop people from reoffending and to stop further victimization.
<P>
	The sexual assault program, where community justice initiatives 
deal with victims of sexual assault, children and otherwise, was 
slashed by the provincial government. That concerns victims.
<P>
	The biggest problem is we tend to ape and the rhetoric of the 
Reform Party apes what is happening in the United States in terms 
of crime and crime prevention. There is no worse model that we 
can possibly follow. The Europeans have shown much more 
effective ways of dealing with offenders which in turn makes the 
cost of the justice system cheaper and in turn allows funding for 
victims' services.
<P>
	The tragedy is that there is not enough funding for victims' 
services because we are misspending it in the criminal justice 
system. At the present rate of sentencing it is expected that the 
population of prisons will increase by 50 per cent over the next five 
years. What a waste of money when keeping a person in prison 
costs $50,000 a year.
<P>
	Let us be very clear when I am talking about people in prison and 
the justice system, I am talking about people who are property 
offenders, non-violent offenders, people who could be handled 
much cheaper in the community, be it through community service, 
or restitution or probation.
<P>
	The climate that has been created is that away too much money 
is being thrown into the imprisonment area and we are doing 
precious little in the justice area.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	I recommend to the members of the Reform Party that they look 
at the work of the crime community safety council. They might 
even go back to March 1993 when Mr. Horner, a former RCMP 
officer, a Progressive Conservative and the head of the justice 
committee, came up with a unanimous all-party recommendation 
in a report which would have dramatically shifted the way in which 
we dealt with the criminal justice system. It would have led to more 
community prevention and more work with victims.
<P>
	If there is a problem in our system now, it is that we have not 
followed up on the recommendations of the Horner commission 
and the justice committee on this issue. There are many cases in 
that report of shifting resources to victims, to crime prevention and 
community safety. There is a rethinking of the way Canadians 
should deal with the whole issue of crime.
<P>
	There is no question that in many cases victims have been 
ignored. I have worked in the system since the early 1970s and it 
breaks my heart to see victim programs in my community being 
slashed by the Progressive  Conservative government in the 
province of Ontario. It is the ideological kissing cousin of the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	I accept that Reformers are being sincere in what they are trying 
to do. Please take a look at the justice committee report by Mr. 
Horner. Look at the cry from police across this country that there 
has to be a better, more effective way. Let us look to the European 
models and not to the United States. We know the American system 
does not work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today the 
Reform Party brought forth legislation that would enshrine a 
victims bill of rights into law in Canada. Today the Liberals 
brought forth legislation that would enshrine sexual orientation as a 
protected category under the Canadian Human Rights Act. Which 
of these two issues are the hon. member's constituents and 
Canadians more interested in having this House deal with? Which 
of those two issues is more important to Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are not living in a world of 
either/or. Many things are important to Canadians. I know that 81 
per cent of Canadians are concerned that people not be 
discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation. A 
poll has not yet been done in Canada which shows that Canadians 
condone discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 
However, that does not negate the whole issue of victims which we 
must address.
<P>
	I will repeat to the member that I shed tears when I see funding 
slashed by the provincial government for programs that were 
painfully developed to nourish community support for victims, 
victims in my community.
<P>
	There is no question that I will support the motion for a victims 
bill of rights, but we have to look at where the money will come 
from. We will get that money if we make the judicial system more 
effective. It will not be more effective if we continue with the 
rhetoric of the Reform Party. We will increase the rate of 
incarceration in this country by 50 per cent at a great expense and it 
will not be effective.
<P>
	I hope the Reform Party members phone their ideological 
cousins in the province of Ontario, the Progressive Conservative 
government members, to protest the cutting of victims programs. I 
expect and hope that members of the Reform Party will do that. I 
look forward to their doing that.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member mentioned the cost of keeping people incarcerated. Does 
the member know that in 1989 the bureau of justice statistics issued 
estimates of how many crimes are prevented when people are 
locked up rather than walking the streets? Analyst Patrick Langdon 
concluded that higher incarceration rates between 1973 and 1989 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2087"> 2087 </A></B>
<P>
cut the number of rapes by 66,000, robberies by  323,000, assaults 
by 380,000 and burglaries by 3.3 million.
<P>
	In addition, in 1995 a Princeton University criminologist wrote 
that the best available estimates of prison operating costs led him to 
calculate that imprisoning 100 convicted felons who offended at 
the median rate cost $2.5 million, but leaving them on the streets 
cost $4.6 million. It is actually cheaper to keep offenders in prison.
<P>
	Has the member heard of those statistics?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am amazed at what comes forward 
from members of the Reform Party. If their advice were to be 
followed we would lock up everyone possible and throw away the 
key. It is because of that kind of attitude that we have picked up on 
the American model which is very expensive and destructive. It 
does not promote safer communities. It ends up being very costly 
and does nothing for the victims of crime.
<P>
	The conference that was held at the Royal York Hotel in March 
1993 brought people together from across the country. Police 
officers, judges, people in government and people from 
communities were there. The Federation of Municipalities was 
there, as well as groups representing victims rights, young 
offenders and correctional services. They concluded, after looking 
at all the models in the free world, that the one which worked the 
best was the European model and the least desirable model was the 
American model.
<P>
	The hon. member did not take me up on my challenge when I 
asked him if he and his party were going to phone the premier of 
Ontario and say to him: ``We do not want you to stop funding 
programs for the victims of crime in the province of Ontario''. That 
is exactly what is happening in the province of Ontario right now.
<P>
	We have to pay attention to victims. We have to ensure that the 
support services are there for them. I hope Reform members will 
contact the premier of Ontario and say: ``We do not want you to 
stop funding programs for the victims of crime''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is my pleasure to speak on the motion today which urges the 
government to direct the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs to draft a victims bill of rights.
<P>
	The government has continued a trend to be more responsive to 
victims. The improvements to the justice system, initiated by the 
federal government, were made without any victims bill of rights. 
The government took action because it was the right thing to do.
<P>
	Earlier today we heard numerous examples of specific initiatives 
to benefit victims of crime. These initiatives go well beyond the 
principles that would be set out in a victims bill of rights. Actions 
do speak louder than words.
<P>
	I support the adoption of a federal declaration on the rights of 
victims, but I believe there are several factors to consider. I am in 
favour of a declaration of rights for victims, but I believe we should 
be speaking about concrete rights for victims. In lending support 
for a national bill, which I assume suggests federal legislation, we 
must be careful not to prescribe rights over which the federal 
government has no jurisdiction and no authority to enforce.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	Actions speak louder than words. Setting out principles and 
calling them rights which could not be effectively enforced would 
be pointless. We should direct our energy at addressing specific 
issues which we have the power to address.
<P>
	Recommendations for a victims bill of rights are not novel. This 
debate has been ongoing since the mid-1980s. Ever since the 
American Congress passed its federal victims bill of rights, many 
Canadians have advocated that we follow suit. It is difficult to 
disagree with a bill of rights for victims. However, we should 
ensure that victims of crime will benefit from a so-called bill of 
rights.
<P>
	We have had this discussion at both levels of government, 
federal and provincial. Since the report to ministers of justice of the 
federal task force on justice for victims of crime in 1983, the 
federal government, the provinces and territories have been 
engaged in ongoing consultations regarding improvements to the 
criminal justice system which would benefit victims of crime 
within the respective areas of responsibility. These consultations 
have squarely addressed the enactment of a victims bill of rights.
<P>
	In 1985 Canada co-sponsored the United Nations statement of 
basic principles of justice for victims of crime. Canada's justice 
system already reflected those principles in 1985. The UN 
declaration prompted the federal and provincial governments to 
re-examine the issue of a victims bill of rights. There was an 
overwhelming consensus that a national bill of rights would not 
advance the cause of victims.
<P>
	While all the provinces and the federal government were 
sincerely committed to making changes to the justice system, it 
was recognized that certain concerns could only be addressed by 
provincial legislation and other concerns could be addressed by 
federal legislation. The majority of concerns could not be 
addressed by legislation at all, but by changing attitudes about the 
role of the victim in the process and about basic human values of 
dignity and respect.
<P>
	It was also recognized that in order to be meaningful a bill of 
rights must have a mechanism of enforcement. Rights without 
remedies cannot truly be said to be rights. For example, if a bill of 
rights states that victims have the right to receive timely 
information about the status of  the investigation or the prosecution 
of the offender, what is the remedy when they feel they have not 
received 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2088"> 2088 </A></B>
<P>
timely information? Who is responsible? Likely it is the police 
and/or the crown.
<P>
	How can a single piece of legislation assign obligations to 
different participants in a justice system that play distinct roles and 
are employed by separate ministries? Moreover what is the 
remedy? Should the prosecution be called off because the victim 
did not get information? I do not think so. The advocates of a bill of 
rights do not think so either.
<P>
	The example makes the point that all we really can do is 
prescribe a set of principles to guide all players in the criminal 
justice system and continue to encourage them to adhere to these 
principles. The victim is essential to the proper functioning of our 
criminal justice system and is deserving of the utmost 
consideration at all stages in the process.
<P>
	The federal government is responsible for enacting the criminal 
law while the provinces are generally responsible for the 
enforcement of the law, the prosecution of offences and the 
administration of justice. Given that a bill of rights would not be of 
rights at all but of principles, the provinces and the federal 
government would get together and do something else.
<P>
	In 1988 at a meeting of justice ministers, the federal and 
provincial governments endorsed the Canadian statement of basic 
principles of justice for victims of crime. The notion of a statement 
rather than a bill of rights addressed both the jurisdictional and the 
practical concerns. All jurisdictions would ensure that whatever 
initiatives they pursued would reflect these principles, whether in 
policy or in legislation.
<P>
	Since 1988 several provinces, including Manitoba, Nova Scotia, 
New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and both the territories 
have enacted victim legislation which does refer to these 
principles.
<P>
	The Canadian statement of basic principles of justice for victims 
of crime states that in recognition of the United Nations declaration 
of basic principles of justice for victims of crime, federal and 
provincial ministers responsible for criminal justice agree that the 
following principles should guide Canadian society in promoting 
access to justice, fair treatment and provision of assistance for 
victims of crime.
<P>
	First, victims should be treated with courtesy, compassion and 
respect for their dignity and privacy. They should suffer the 
minimum of necessary inconvenience from their involvement with 
the criminal justice system.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	Victims should receive through formal and informal procedures 
prompt and fair redress for the harm which they have suffered. 
Information regarding remedies and  the mechanisms to obtain 
them should be made available to victims.
<P>
	Information should made available to victims about their 
participation in criminal proceedings and the scheduling, progress 
and ultimate disposition of the proceedings.
<P>
	Where appropriate the views and concerns of victims should be 
ascertained and assistance provided throughout the criminal 
process.
<P>
	Where the personal interests of the victim are affected, the views 
or concerns of the victim should be brought to the attention of the 
court where appropriate and consistent with criminal law and 
procedure.
<P>
	Measures should be taken when necessary to ensure the safety of 
victims and their families and to protect them from intimidation 
and retaliation.
<P>
	Enhanced training should be made available to sensitize criminal 
justice personnel to the needs and concerns of victims and 
guidelines developed where appropriate for this purpose.
<P>
	Victims should be informed of the availability of health and 
social services and other relevant assistance so they might continue 
to receive the necessary medical, psychological and social 
assistance through existing programs and services. Also, victims 
should report the crime and co-operate with law enforcement 
authorities.
<P>
	As members can see, the majority of these principles relate to 
matters that can be addressed only by the police, prosecutors or 
court officials. In other words, the majority of victim issues fall to 
the provinces. It was therefore essential that the provinces had 
input into the statement and so overwhelmingly supported it.
<P>
	The question is whether a national bill of rights for victims will 
do more than the existing statement of principles. A national bill of 
rights would likely be welcomed by victims, but they would be 
even more interested in concrete action on the government's 
commitment to issues like gun control, sentencing and the recently 
introduced initiatives of Bill C-17 and Bill C-27, which include 
provisions to strengthen or expand existing protections such as 
peace bonds and publication bans. Again, actions speak louder than 
words.
<P>
	We must also look at the progress made in the last 15 years and 
talk to victims to find out what they really need in 1996.
<P>
	In February of this year I read an article in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> 
that highlighted the hon. member's proposal for victim rights, in 
many respects similar to the Canadian statement of basic 
principles: a right to information about services, a right to be 
informed of the offender's status, court dates, sentencing dates, a 
right to an oral or victim impact statement and a right to protection 
from intimidation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2089"> 2089 </A></B>
<P>
	It also went beyond the existing statement that proposed a right 
to participate in plea bargain discussions, a right to have police 
lay charges in domestic violence cases and a right to know if an 
offender has a sexually transmitted disease. These are certainly 
controversial issues but they are probably incapable of a remedy 
in the event of a breach. Moreover, they impact on areas that only 
the provinces can address.
<P>
	I emphasize again that I strongly believe that victims of crime 
have a role to play in our criminal justice system and as such we 
must do whatever is feasible to ensure their participation does not 
result in revictimization. Ideally we would like to prevent crime 
and in consequence prevent victimization.
<P>
	While we are making significant inroads in crime prevention, we 
know there will always be victims of crime. That is a sad but true 
fact. Therefore we must be responsive to their concerns. I believe 
the government has shown leadership and we know the work is not 
done. It still requires improvement in a variety of ways, all of 
which will in turn benefit the victims.
<P>
	I am also aware the provinces continue to pursue initiatives to 
improve the administration of justice to benefit victims. I am aware 
the issue will be discussed at next week's meeting of federal, 
provincial and territorial ministers responsible for criminal justice. 
I am sure the provinces will be keenly interested in the hon. 
member's motion and in today's debate.
<P>
	While I have no problem supporting a bill of rights for victims, I 
do not believe it is a cure-all remedy.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
kind of sad to hear the things we hear. Sometimes when we are 
debating with the lawyers in the House, the legal industry, that is 
the very group which has provided a lot of the problems as far as 
victims' rights go.
<P>
	To stand in the House, as the justice minister did this morning, 
and riddle off all these statements of principles the United Nations 
and others have dealt with is nice. However, the reason this is 
before the House today is virtually all of that is not done. It is nice 
to ascribe to a set of principles but when we do nothing about it, 
that is the problem.
<P>
	There was the suggestion that it is only the Reform Party looking 
at some of these issues. Every victims' right group, virtually every 
one in the country, has had input into these legislative ideals we 
have tabled and agrees with them. I see a big difference in that we 
are not here to talk about only a statement of principles. We are 
here to have victims' rights somewhere in legislation.
<P>
	I would like to hear the non-legalese version of my hon. 
colleague on whether is it better to have a statement of principles 
which no one is buying into in the legal  industry or to have some 
form of legislation for victims and victims' rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it amusing if not ironic that 
we talk about the justice industry in this country. I have to turn it 
back and ask if the Reform Party is interested in doing away with 
those who represent people before the courts, if it would do away 
with their right to counsel, if it would do away with their right to a 
proper defence, if it willingly and wilfully eliminate people's 
access to knowledge of the law, and if it would say a person is 
going to go into court, not be represented, be accused by the full 
force of the state and be left to fly by the seat of their pants.
<P>
	The hon. member wants to know if it is better to have a statement 
of principles or to have a bill of rights. I will give as an example 
witnesses who appeared before the justice committee two weeks 
ago. The hon. member was not at that meeting. There appeared 
before the justice committee two weeks ago-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The policy in the House is not to refer to 
the fact that a member was not in the House or was not in the 
committee. I ask the member not to do that again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway:</B> Mr. Speaker, a couple of weeks ago before the 
justice committee appeared victims' rights groups. The sole point 
raised in this testimony was that as victims they felt intimidated by 
certain gangs within a community. There is no question these 
people were the victims of a horrendous crime.
<P>
	If the federal government had two years ago enacted victims' 
rights legislation there would be nothing the victims in this case 
could do to enforce those rights because, as we know, policing falls 
within the jurisdiction of the provinces. As a result, if the police do 
not respond to a call, if the police do or do not intervene, a federal 
bill giving them some sort of a right cannot be enforced 
provincially. It can be enforced only with respect to the jurisdiction 
of the federal government. We may not like this, but that is a fact of 
Canadian life.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Therefore I would suggest that in this case a statement of 
principles which becomes policy within the respective federal and 
provincial jurisdictions is just as effective as a bill of rights 
attempting to effect provincial jurisdiction but which will have no 
effect whatsoever on provincial authorities.
<P>
	We can have a bill of rights but unless we are legislating within 
our purview the end result is that we are making a statement of 
principles. As we know, we cannot legislate, we cannot dictate to 
police forces how many officers they will have. Only the solicitor 
general of a province can do that.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time has expired for 
questions and answers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2090"> 2090 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
be sharing my time with the hon. member for Comox-Alberni.
<P>
	When you are in your constituency you hear from people who 
manage to listen to the parliamentary channel every once in a while 
and what goes on in the Chamber. They are sick and tired of 
hearing this legal jargon. Over and over we hear all of these 
lawyers talking and illustrating all the good things they know and 
all the wonderful things they are to do. Let us not confuse things. 
Let us talk about this or that. They have people's minds totally 
confused.
<P>
	What is it they stand for? What are they trying to do? What do 
they mean by doing this and that? I think everybody out there is 
coming to the conclusion I came to a long time ago that the more 
you keep the people confused, the public, the better it is for the 
people in the House of Commons, particularly the Liberals.
<P>
	We came out with a document, a victims' bill of rights. We get 
all this rhetoric that they can support it, but. Certainly they can 
support it. They had better support it. It does not make sense that 
they constantly come up with this whole idea of all these wonderful 
things they have been doing for two and half years are the answer to 
victims. They are not. They are not listening at all.
<P>
	There are eight points on this list. The reason they are on this list, 
the reason they are on our agenda is that they are on the people's 
agenda throughout the land. If anybody in the House thinks the 
majority of Canadians are really happy with our justice system, for 
heaven's sake let us all go home and ask them one more time how 
happy they are.
<P>
	These eight items are on this list because they are on the people's 
list. That is what they want to see happen. Look at point eight, that 
victims have a right to now if a person convicted of a sexual 
offence has a sexually transmitted disease. I cannot believe all the 
lawyer rhetoric in the House trying to tell us what is wrong with 
that statement when it is pure and simple.
<P>
	It is based on several cases, one in particular in Quebec, which is 
supposed to be doing all the right things, of a woman working in a 
church office, a secretary, on a Saturday, when she was raped, not 
sexually assaulted, raped, beaten by an individual on a day pass 
from prison. After all the trauma of being beaten and raped and 
humiliated and scarred for life, she simply wanted to know if this 
perpetrator had a sexually transmitted disease or HIV. She wanted 
to eliminate that possibility.
<P>
	For goodness sake, if that does not make just plain old ordinary 
horse sense, I do not know what does. We heard this kind of 
rhetoric a dozen times from a couple of speakers.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	Once again this is on our agenda because it is on the agenda of 
Canadians. It is on the agenda of the people from FACT, CAVEAT, 
CRY, Move the Rock, Remove the Rock, the Kid Brother 
campaign. More and more a whole pile of individuals are signing 
up to the victims groups across the land.
<P>
	Why is it that in two and one-half years membership in the 
victims organizations is growing probably 10 to 100 times faster 
than the membership in the Liberal Party? Why is it when victims 
of crime are invited to a convention in Hamilton that come 
thousands come? It is because we are not doing our job.
<P>
	We are now asking that we provide something which represents 
what they would like to have. We are listening to the people. These 
are the things the police are calling for. These are the things the 
public is calling for. It is not just the Reform Party. It is on our 
agenda because it is on the people's agenda. I am really tired of 
hearing about these wonderful bills the Liberals have passed in two 
and one-half years, C-37, C-68, C-41, all the wonderful things they 
are doing for the victims.
<P>
	It is really amazing that in January 1994 all these things were 
supposed to be submitted to the justice minister in order for him to 
come up with some new ideas on the Young Offenders Act. He 
came up with Bill C-37. If C-37 was such a hot and wonderful bill, 
will somebody please explain why the justice minister has the 
justice committee going all across the country asking people what 
they want to do about young offenders? It is because he knows it is 
not even close to being solved. Yet three, four or five times today in 
the House I heard the Liberals saying what a wonderful thing they 
have done for victims.
<P>
	Nobody talks about the fact that in Bill C-41 the Liberals wanted 
to put dangerous offenders in alternative programs which we 
opposed. Nobody even mentioned the legislation where if a 
member of this place or some other elected place commits a crime, 
as long as their sentence was not longer than five years-until we 
had it amended-they could still draw their pay and be a member 
of the government they were elected into. Nobody even mentions 
that. We had it reduced to two years. Is it not wonderful to know 
that if you are a parliamentarian you can go out and break the law 
and as long as your sentence is not longer than two years you can 
still get your pay and be happy?
<P>
	All we are saying is to address the victims. These are some of the 
things we can do. These are some of the things that will give hope 
to the people from those organizations in our constituencies.
<P>
	With Bill C-68, the same old rhetoric flies on and on. Nobody 
mentions the 150 pages that address the law-abiding people and the 
very little that addresses the criminal. Nobody mentions all the 
flaws that were in that  legislation. Thank goodness we have our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2091"> 2091 </A></B>
<P>
member for Calgary North who has a little bit of law experience. 
He sat with me for a day or two and explained all the flaws that 
were in that law and what made it such a bad piece of legislation. It 
was not the principle of making certain that people are not hurt 
with guns. This was wise. However, C-68 certainly did not take 
care of that.
<P>
	What a tragedy that case was in Vernon, but the law was 
followed to the letter when it came to C-68. All the right paperwork 
was in place, registration and everything. The only thing they failed 
to say was that the person had victimized people in the past. With a 
little bit of time and effort they would have realized that we cannot 
issue a gun to a person like that. That is all it would have taken. 
Now C-68 certainly did not do a lot of good in that case. Stop all 
that nonsense. It is not doing that much good and it will not do any 
good.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	Think of the people who got out on bail. People are arrested at 
breakfast and bailed out at noon. There are over a dozen cases now 
involving serious offences where the person was arrested and 
bailed out. They then went on to finish the act before the day was 
over. They committed murder and sexual assault.
<P>
	We should do something about protecting victims in those 
situations, but we do not do anything. We come out with thick 
documents which are flawed to no end and then brag about them. 
We get a bunch of lawyer talk to make people out there in the land 
think we know what we are doing. And they wonder what we are 
doing because they do not understand.
<P>
	I am beginning to understand more and more. There is one thing 
I believe with all my heart. I was told this by an individual some 
time ago. I am beginning to see what he meant. He said that when 
the government fears the people we have a democracy and when 
the people start fearing the government we have tyranny. He said 
we had better watch what is happening in Canada and I believe him 
now more than ever.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Mr. Speaker, in terms of government legislation, 
the hon. member for Calgary Centre made some of the same points. 
Interestingly enough, the hon. member for Calgary Centre who 
spoke against the government's gun legislation today, supported 
the government when the legislation was before the House. I guess 
that is rehabilitation Reform style. The two members who 
supported the government have been rehabilitated. They have been 
taken to the woodshed.
<P>
	I have in my hand the victims services pamphlet which is put out 
by the Waterloo regional police. It says that victims of crime need 
not suffer physical injuries to experience severe effects for weeks 
or months after the crime. They may feel anger, fear, guilt and 
helplessness. To assist victims in dealing with the effects of crime 
the Waterloo regional police established a victims services  unit. 
Civilian counsellors in the unit provide assistance to victims of 
domestic violence, sexual assault and other crimes. Actually, a fair 
number of the services it offers fit in with the Reform Party's 
victims bill of rights.
<P>
	Would the hon. member for Wild Rose and his party support the 
idea of letting the Progressive Conservative government in the 
province of Ontario know that the victims services as operated by 
the Waterloo regional police force are services which they support 
and that the provincial government should not be slashing funding 
to that organization as well as other victims organizations?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, first I will defend my colleague 
for Calgary Centre. He votes with his nose once in a while; he votes 
one way and holds his nose.
<P>
	People are attempting to do a number of things across the land. A 
lot of good volunteer organizations are trying their best to help the 
victims. That is why we have all of these victims groups.
<P>
	Of course there are a lot of things we would like to support 
financially. However, we all know from the record of Liberal and 
Conservative governments in the last few years that we are broke. 
The provinces are struggling. It is a real battle. We continue to 
waste money.
<P>
	I really do not know what the situation is in the Ontario 
government, but I have a better idea. I doubt if it costs a great deal 
of money to provide certain things. Maybe we should come up with 
it this way. Why does the hon. member and his colleagues not give 
up their pensions? We could steer that money into the cause. What 
about that for a change? Maybe we could get the front line people 
to give up their limousines. We could use that money. Maybe you 
could show some leadership in that area instead of give, give, give. 
In the meantime, you are trying to figure out how much money you 
can get, get, get. The attitude on that side of the House stinks.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The other member was corrected. I would 
ask the member and all members, to please put their remarks 
through the Chair and not across the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on this Reform motion 
concerning victims rights put forward by the member for Fraser 
Valley West.
<P>
	The point of the motion is very basic. We are asking the Liberal 
government to commit to draw up a victims bill of rights. The 
motion asks the government to direct the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs to draft a victims bill of rights. In areas of 
provincial jurisdiction the Minister of Justice should consult with 
the provinces to arrive at a national standard. It is long past time 
that victims rights be recognized.
<P>

<P>
	As a Reform member of Parliament I am proud to say that the 
Reform Party is the only party fighting for victims rights in the 
House. At the same time I am pleased that the Minister of Justice 
has agreed to support the motion. However, it is not enough to 
support the motion in principle. Policies must be followed up with 
actions. The government has been notorious for its promises, but 
its ability to follow through on the promises has left a lot to be 
desired. The GST comes to mind.
<P>
	This is the third debate on victims rights in the House since the 
last election and Canadians are still waiting for a bill to come 
forward. We have heard a lot of rhetoric, but victims need far more 
than rhetoric. Principles carry little weight unless they are put into 
action. We need a victims bill of rights and I hope that the 
government will not keep victims waiting for much longer.
<P>
	Canadians want a system that is fair, just and compassionate. 
Canadians expect this from a justice system that currently 
recognizes the rights of the criminal but refuses to entrench the 
rights of the victim in legislation.
<P>
	Our justice system is meant to serve all in society. At present it 
serves just the criminals. There are three parts to a justice system: 
the law, the criminals and the victims. Somewhere along the line 
the victims have been left out of the equation. Victims have been 
neglected by the system to the point where they are the last ones to 
be consulted or considered and now they are going to be the last to 
be recognized legally.
<P>
	The focus of our justice system has been primarily on the 
criminal. The victim has been shoved to the side and it is time that 
we realigned our priorities so that victims rights are first and 
foremost. The victim simply must come first.
<P>
	In my constituency in Courtenay, B.C., on October 24, 1992 six 
year old Dawn Shaw was raped and then stomped to death by her 
babysitter, 16 year old Jason Gamache. Unknown to Dawn's 
parents, Jason Gamache had two previous convictions of sexual 
molestation. He had been convicted of two sexual assaults on four 
year old children, one a girl, the other a boy.
<P>
	In 1991 a year before the murder, Jason was convicted in 
Nanaimo. He moved to Courtenay with his mother to attend court 
ordered sex offender therapy through the John Howard Society. 
Jason Gamache's probation order clearly stated that he was to have 
no contact with children under the age of 12. Yet the only people 
who knew about his background were his mother, his probation 
officer and the John Howard Society. The RCMP were not notified 
when Jason moved to Courtenay. They were unaware of his record. 
Why? Because the criminal's rights were put ahead of those of 
everyone else.
<P>
	Jason Gamache was restricted from children under the age of 12, 
yet he was living right next door to an elementary school. On the 
same night that he murdered Dawn Shaw, he babysat Dawn Shaw's 
brother and sister because Dawn Shaw's parents did not know he 
was a convicted sex offender.
<P>
	Jason Gamache received the maximum penalty of life with no 
parole for 10 years. In 1999 when Jason Gamache is 23 he will be 
eligible for unescorted release from day prison and will be free to 
roam the streets. The greatest tragedy is that this and many other 
crimes could have been prevented. Yet our system puts the rights of 
the criminals, like Jason Gamache, ahead of the rights of society 
and the rights of Dawn Shaw. Criminals like Jason Gamache have 
all kinds of rights.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	What rights do the victims have? Surely six-year-old Dawn 
Shaw and her parents had the right to know their babysitter was a 
dangerous sexual offender. Convicted murderers demand their 
rights be respected, but rights of victims go unheard.
<P>
	What about the rights of those who suffer for a lifetime? What 
rights do the parents of murdered children have? The rights of 
families with small children like Dawn Shaw who are left 
vulnerable and oblivious to the dangers of their environment are 
secondary to the rights of her killer. We cannot put the rights of 
criminals ahead of our children.
<P>
	Canadians have the right to know the dangers that exist when 
there are violent offenders roaming the streets or living next door. 
Parents have the right to know when there is a child molester in 
their backyard.
<P>
	There is a need for a victims' bill of rights. There are a number 
of rights victims should have yet they do not. Either they are not on 
the books or there is no mechanism to enforce them. Too often 
victims are not informed when there is an investigation and this 
should not be happening in our justice system.
<P>
	Victims should be fully informed about the progress and 
outcome of the investigation and the charges to be laid against the 
offender. If charges are not laid, the victims should be informed 
why not. The victim must have the right to be informed of the 
offender's status throughout the process, including, but not 
restricted to, notification of any arrests, upcoming court dates, 
sentencing dates, plans to release the offender from custody, 
including notification of what community the parolee is being 
released into, conditions of release and parole dates. Victims 
should also be aware of the criminal's whereabouts at all times.
<P>
	Victims' rights should also be extended to protect victims of 
domestic violence. If a victim files a complaint of domestic 
violence the police must have the authority to follow through tothe end.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2093"> 2093 </A></B>
<P>
	The rights of the victim and compensation for the victim's 
losses should also be a priority consideration. The government 
must hold the criminal accountable for the crime. Restitution 
orders should be mandatory, not at the discretion of the courts. 
It is not enough to give victims their rights. Victims need to know 
what their rights are. Victims must be informed of their rights at 
every stage and all information should be made available on 
request.
<P>
	Some provinces have taken the initiative to put forward 
legislation that protects the rights of victims of crime. In British 
Columbia the victim of crime act gives victims legal rights to 
information and rights to compensation. However, it only applies 
to those serving terms of less than two years who fall under 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Ontario victims' right bill allows victims to be provided with 
information, yet the problem remains. Many of these measures 
apply only to provincial institutions and will not help victims of 
crimes under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	Provincial legislation is a move in the right direction but it is 
only a beginning. Provincial laws to protect victims will only apply 
to provincial violations.
<P>
	Under the Constitution Act of 1867, Parliament has jurisdiction 
over the management of penitentiaries, so anything related to 
prisoners or parole are federal responsibilities. Yet victims have 
fallen through the cracks because neither the federal government 
nor the provincial governments have exclusive jurisdiction. 
Victims fall into both federal and provincial jurisdiction and it is 
the responsibility of both to work together to establish a national 
standard for victims' rights.
<P>
	Why is it that we have a national standard for the environment, a 
national standard for health, a national standard for parks and a 
national standard for broadcasting? Is it asking too much to 
establish national standards for victims' rights? I think not.
<P>
	It is time for the government to set things straight. It is time for 
us to show compassion and respect for the victim, that is at the very 
least equal to that which we give the criminal.
<P>
	In conclusion, we are asking that the government look into a 
victims' bill of rights. It is not a huge commitment but it is a small 
but significant step in the right direction. I hope government 
members will support this motion, not only with their vote but also 
with their actions.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to part of the member's speech and I wonder if I 
understood and if the member has really analyzed the situation in 
certain provinces. I will  not speak about British Columbia, the 
example used by the member, I will speak about Quebec.
<P>
	In Quebec we have the Crime Victims Compensation Act. It is 
not true that this act compensates victims or covers their rights only 
when the offence is punishable by imprisonment of more than two 
years. It applies to all crimes, as its name indicates. Therefore 
whenever anyone suffers damages as the result of a murder, theft or 
bodily harm, regardless of whether the crime is punishable by 
imprisonment for two, five or ten years or six months or a fine, the 
Crime Victim's Compensation Act applies.
<P>
	Provinces without such legislation may be provinces where 
interest is lacking. It is not up to the federal government to 
establish it. This legislation is provincial. It is a provincial matter. 
In Quebec we created this legislation with the Crime Victims 
Compensation Act.
<P>
	I would like to know from the member, with speeches being 
made, things proposed and people accused, whether the members 
of the Reform Party have at least done an analysis? Could the 
member who just spoke tell us whether, from his research in certain 
provinces, the legislation he has just quoted applied to all victims 
of crime or just some? I would like to know whether he really 
seriously analyzed the situation in British Columbia and Quebec.
<P>
	I think he will conclude that it is not a matter of federal 
jurisdiction and he will follow our example of advocating each 
province's passing legislation to compensate victims of crime and 
to enshrine victims' rights. We in the Bloc say that victims' rights 
must be protected, but the right legislature must do the job, and I 
think the Reform Party is once again mistaken.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the question, the 
member for Fraser Valley East checked victims rights' bills across 
Canada. The problem is that they are all over the board.
<P>
	That is why a national standard is necessary. The standard should 
apply right across the country. Otherwise, people will move from 
province to province to get into jurisdictions where they may not 
have to pay or may have a lesser penalty.
<P>
	We need a national standard. It is not in place at the moment. It is 
definitely required.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask the hon. member a question. The gun control 
legislation gives police authority in cases where an individual has 
threatened violence against a spouse, another person or has 
committed an act of violence, under certain circumstances, to 
remove the firearms from that offender.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2094"> 2094 </A></B>
<P>
	I wonder if the member is in support of leaving those firearms 
in the hands of the offender.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, the law may be on the books all 
right, but my understanding is that the police do not enforce it. That 
is a major problem.
<P>
	Speaking of the gun bill, we are going back to registration and 
the government's folly that people who are going to register their 
guns will not commit crimes. A criminal does not take a long gun 
to rob a jewellery store. Criminals use illegal weapons.
<P>
	That was the problem with the gun bill right from the beginning. 
There was never a gun lobby in Canada. There is now, and the 
Liberals are going to pay for it in the next election.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to support of the motion of my colleague, a motion I will 
read one more time for the benefit of the members. The motion is 
to introduce a bill for victims' rights:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House urge the government to direct the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs to proceed with the drafting of a Victim's Bill of 
Rights, and that, in such areas where the Committee determines a right to be 
more properly a provincial concern, the Minister of Justice initiate 
consultations with the provinces aimed at arriving at a national standard for a 
Victims' Bill of Rights.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is a very well constructed motion because it takes into account 
some of the points that were raised by a member a moment ago that 
the jurisdiction of the federal government does not extend to all 
areas. Some are under provincial control. It really requires 
provincial co-operation in order to make this work. I am pleased to 
note that a lot of Liberal members support this type of action. We 
certainly do need a victims' bill of right.
<P>
	As I listened today to the speeches and I heard the reasons why 
we need this victims' bill of rights it really started to make me 
think about what has led us to this point where we have to talk 
about this victims' bill of rights.
<P>
	What is the root cause of all this crime that has us so concerned 
about our safety and the type of environment that we are in that we 
have to go to this point of protecting so many victims? What is it 
that has led us to this point where we have the ``Stop the Rock,'' 
``Get Rid of the Rock'' and the CUSJ, CAVEAT and other groups? 
Why are they there? What has caused it?
<P>
	Why is there graffiti all down the Sparks Street Mall that was not 
there just a year ago? I see graffiti on my office building in North 
Vancouver that was not there a year ago. Why is it that my parents 
felt safe walking the streets at night when they were my age? It was 
perfectly safe for them to let me out as child to play in the park or 
to go with my friends to the local forest to play games without 
having to be concerned?
<P>
	Why was it safe for me to walk to school instead of the situation 
you see today where every morning hundreds of thousands of 
parents across Canada feel obliged to put their children in the car to 
drive them maybe half a kilometre or a kilometre to their school 
because they do not feel confident of the safety of their children?
<P>
	How come there are drive-by shootings in Vancouver? There was 
at least one here in Ottawa in the last year. There were not drive-by 
shootings even five years ago. What is going on here?
<P>
	Why does my wife have to be accompanied to her car in the car 
park in the evening when she leaves the office when she did not 
have to do that five years ago? There is something dreadfully 
wrong.
<P>
	The more I thought about it today as I was listening to these 
speeches the more I could see that the root cause of the problem, 
the reason that we are standing here today working on this victims' 
bill of rights is that something terrible has happened over the last 
two decades that has brought us to this point.
<P>
	I challenge every member in the House to ask themselves what 
has changed and they will soon come to same conclusion that I did. 
It has all happened because we do not treat criminals like criminals 
anymore. We have sent a message to the criminals, to the young 
offenders, to all of those people out there who are destroying our 
society that we owe them a living, that what they are doing is okay.
<P>
	When the police come to my office building because young 
people are spray painting on the side of the building they stand 
back and they try to have some discussion with these young people, 
these young punks just tell the police to F-off. I cannot say the 
words here in the House but I think we are all familiar with the type 
of contempt with which the police are treated from these types of 
punks.
<P>
	We have told these people by our actions is that it is okay to 
spray paint on buildings. It is okay to do all these petty crimes that 
increase our tolerance of crime.
<P>
	Over the past 20 years or so the justice system has tended to 
concentrate on this theory of rehabilitation, claiming that we really 
need to get to the root cause of the crime. If we can just say to 
people we love you, please be good, that they will be good. Twenty 
years has shown us it does not work. With all of the examples that I 
have just given, I challenge members to think of their own 
examples. I hear a member on the other side saying nonsense, but 
of course he does not have a wife he has to worry about going to the 
car park to get to her car every day.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	I invite members to think about that. I would also like them to 
think about the aggressive policing that has been taking place in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2095"> 2095 </A></B>
<P>
New York over the last little while and the  effect that longer prison 
terms have had on the crime rate in that city.
<P>
	It seems that perhaps a more punishment oriented system will 
actually get control of the type of crime that has led us to this point 
where we are asking for a victims' bill of rights.
<P>
	I remind members about a police commissioner of New York, 
William Bratton, who said the root of crime is criminals. If we start 
to recognize that it is criminals who cause crimes and begin 
addressing that problem we will reduce the number of victims 
dramatically and we will not need all of the extra money, hundreds 
of millions, that we a pouring into victims' rights groups to help all 
the people who have become victims of these criminals.
<P>
	In 1990 when Mr. Bratton was the security director for the New 
York subway system, he took a hardline approach in terms of the 
graffiti, loud radio playing and spitting on the sidewalk. He told his 
security people that he wanted to clamp down hard on all of these 
minor crimes and send a message of zero tolerance. There was an 
impressive drop in serious crimes. Robberies within one year were 
down 75 per cent and serious felonies were down 64 per cent in just 
five years.
<P>
	Mr. Bratton so impressed the people of New York that he was 
subsequently elected police commissioner of New York where his 
methods have resulted in a 31 per cent drop in murders, a 25 per 
cent drop in car theft and a 22 per cent drop in robberies. These 
improvements appear to come directly from an increased 
concentration by police on minor crimes, the sorts of things that we 
have come to tolerate, the graffiti, the foul language in public, all of 
those minor crimes. If we would just send the message that we do 
not tolerate that, we could restore some sense to our system.
<P>
	Like many other members in the House, I have visited high 
schools from time to time. Any time I ask high school students if 
they think the Young Offenders Act needs changing, at least 99 out 
of 100 students put their hands up and say the Young Offenders Act 
needs changing.
<P>
	When I asked them if they think they are being influenced by the 
hype in the newspaper, the crimes that are reported, and really the 
problem is not that bad, that they are really being influenced 
emotionally and have not really thought about it, 99 out of 100 still 
thought it was wrong, that it badly needs changing.
<P>
	I have an article which appeared in the north shore news. It is in 
the youth views section. It was written by a grade 12 student in my 
riding, Sarah Duro: ``Get out of jail free is basically what the 
Young Offenders Act does for youth today. Children between the 
ages of 12 and 19 are protected for crimes that rank from 
shoplifting to murder. The consequences for the more major crimes 
are a mere slap on the wrist. It appears that young people have 
special needs since they are not fully mature and  should not suffer 
the same consequences as adults. But surely if a child is mature 
enough to take someone's life, they are mature enough to pay the 
price''.
<P>
	That is the sort of feeling I hear regularly in the schools. I again 
challenge members across the House to think about the times they 
have asked questions about justice issues in high schools. They will 
know I am telling the truth about the reactions.
<P>
	Sarah wrote: ``If you are committing an adult crime you should 
be treated the way an adult would be treated instead of being 
treated as a helpless child''. She goes on to say how they had a 
discussion in her class all about the Young Offenders Act and how 
the penalties should be increase.
<P>
	It is my experience that students in high schools would be a lot 
more harsh on their piers than we would ever be as 
parliamentarians in the sorts of punishments we would propose.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	Sarah finishes by saying: ``Here is a small suggestion. Maybe 
our government should start issuing a licence to kill for youths 
today. Wait a minute, they already have. It's called the Young 
Offenders Act''.
<P>
	That is the sort of attitude youth have. The adults in my riding 
are also extremely upset about the way the justice system is 
operating.
<P>
	In the August 29, 1995 edition of <I>Investor's Business Daily</I> there 
was close to a full page of statistical information in an article by 
John Barnes on the effects of punishment on crime rates. He headed 
the piece: ``Does crime pay? Not if criminals do hard time''. I urge 
members to get a copy of this article.
<P>
	Mr. Barnes wrote that in 1994 University of Arizona economist 
Michael Block and researcher Steven Twist compared some 
victimization rates with imprisonment rates from 1960 to 1992, a 
period of 32 years. They found that the ten states which had the 
highest imprisonment rates experienced an 8 per cent drop in 
violent crime during the period under study. In contrast, the ten 
states with the lowest imprisonment rates saw their violent crime 
rates jump by 51 per cent in the same period.
<P>
	Very clearly incarceration does work to reduce crime. That does 
not mean, as members opposite keep claiming, we need to lock up 
everybody. Obviously we need to use common sense. If a person 
who commits a minor crime or a robbery could be put on electronic 
surveillance and be permitted to stay at work, supporting his or her 
family, that would be much better than locking up that person. 
However, if a person is a danger to society they really should spend 
a little time behind bars, away from society.
<P>
	In 20 minutes or so we will know for certain whether victims' 
rights will become a reality in Canada. At that time the bells will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2096"> 2096 </A></B>
<P>
ring, we will have a vote and the  members who support victims' 
rights will be on the record.
<P>
	I hope the Minister of Justice takes the issue seriously. When he 
votes in favour of the motion, as he said he would, I hope he takes it 
seriously. When the issues goes to the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs to draft the victims' bill of rights I hope 
he will enthusiastically put his weight behind the bill. I hope he 
will enthusiastically contact the appropriate people in the provinces 
and work with them to put together a workable victims' bill of 
rights.
<P>
	I congratulate my colleague for bringing this subject to the 
House today. I support the victims' bill of rights. I hope members 
of the House will consider what I have said about the cause of 
crime and how, if we would place a little concentration on that 
aspect, we could probably reduce the need for the victims' bill of 
rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the greatest 
things that occurs in our country are these debates. It is always 
good to have points of view from all sides and not simply a narrow 
point of view.
<P>
	How does the member explain the demographics? I understand 
that a lot of the reduction in crime in New York state is because 
many of the young people who were committing crime are now 
much older and when there are population shifts crime decreases. I 
do not know if we can attribute that to putting a lot of people in jail.
<P>
	Who does he think are the people who put graffiti on walls? As I 
understand it, they often come from upper and middle class 
families. It is a highly sophisticated operation. They get away from 
their parents and they play games with the police. The kinds of 
people my friend is talking about are not necessarily the kinds the 
general population thinks.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
mentioned that maybe the reduction in crime in New York was due 
to the fact that the criminals got older. That is a very amusing way 
of looking at it.
<P>
	Actually, if were just people getting older, it would be a bit 
difficult to explain because on the subway the drop in crime rate 
occurred in one year. In New York in five years robberies were 
down 75 per cent, serious felonies were down 64 per cent. Over a 
one year period in New York there was a 31 per cent drop in 
murders. I do not know whether these criminals are aging at 10 
times the rate of everybody else, but I am surprised they were 
reformed so quickly in one year.
<P>
	Another point the member raised was who puts graffiti on walls. 
I do not know why he said it is the children of wealthy families who 
do this. What difference does it make who the criminals are? I 
could not care less and I  am sure most people in Canada could not 
care less whether criminals come from wealthy or poor families. If 
they are criminals, they are criminals. Saying we will not touch 
them because they are from a wealthy home or because they are 
from a poor home is a ridiculous way to approach crime.
<P>
	If someone is putting graffiti on a wall they should be 
appropriately treated. That means taking action which discourages 
them from ever putting graffiti on a wall again.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, under cover of a motion that is, after all, fairly ordinary, 
we immediately recognize the hon. members' pet themes: young 
offenders; licence to kill-it is rather odd to hear that in Canada; 
violent crime; shocking statistics; example setting sentences; 
jailing people is never enough; the length of sentences, lock them 
up for as long as possible, get rid of them.
<P>
	I think the discourse of the Reformers is rather difficult to 
follow. These are the same Reformers who voted against firearms 
registration, when we know that the most violent crimes, the most 
odious crimes, the ones most often reported in the sort of 
sensational newspapers the Reformers read, are crimes committed 
with firearms. It is rather odd coming from members of Parliament, 
but it is par for the course from Reformers. They are hard to 
understand.
<P>
	I would like to say to the Reformers that we, in Quebec, looked 
at these questions at least thirty years ago, and again last year 
during the hearings on the future of Quebec. People from 
throughout Quebec came to tell us that in a sovereign Quebec there 
should be a charter on the rights and responsibilities of taxpayers. It 
was good for criminals, victims, youth, seniors, taxpayers, the 
unemployed and workers. We needed a charter that would lay it all 
out.
<P>
	It is true that, in addition to rights, citizens also have obligations. 
This must be recognized, and perhaps put down in writing, if 
necessary, but it must be done. The first step is to reflect on the 
question, give the problem some thought. What is not needed is 
inflammatory speeches and statistics out of context.
<P>
	That being said, if the hon. member wishes to give it the time, 
and that is the question, should he not be thinking about prevention 
and rehabilitation, with due regard for jurisdiction?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member is 
obviously completely satisfied that there are no crime problems in 
Canada today, no crime problems in his riding. His wife, his 
children, his friends and family are completely safe on the streets at 
night. There is no graffiti in his riding. It sounds like he should start  
advertising a big tourist trade there: come to the safest place in 
Canada, no graffiti, no crime, nothing to worry about, we are in
