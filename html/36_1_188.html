</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
has often been said that Canada's future is only as bright as its 
youth.  With teenagers like Stittsville's Kristin Willemsen in 
our communities it makes the nation's outlook for the new 
millennium that much better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Willemsen was recently honoured with the 1998 Ontario Junior 
Citizen of the Year Award by the Ontario Community Newspaper 
Association for her outstanding contribution to her community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kristin is not your average teen.  At just 15 she is an 
inspiration to us all.  She maintains an amazing 94.5% average in 
her grade 10 studies at St. Paul's High School while being an 
active member in a number of varsity sports and doubling as a 
peer helper.  She also volunteers at the local library, with the 
community choir and she enjoys precision skating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, Kristin's efforts enhance her school, her home and of 
course our community.  In the words of her nominator, “Kristin 
is committed to the community and an excellent role model for all 
youngsters”.  That is one very good reason to be optimistic 
about our future.

</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
expected that this spring the environment minister will finally, 
after many delays, be introducing legislation that will give our 
endangered species the protection they so desperately need. 
Before the minister tables this legislation I want to make one 
thing crystal clear so she does not make the same mistakes that 
her predecessors made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operation, not confrontation, is what will ensure the 
prosperity of our threatened wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government must work together with provinces and 
landowners.  It must recognize the responsible stewardship 
practices of landowners and create an environment where these 
practices are rewarded.  It must respect private property rights 
and provide fair compensation for those landowners affected by 
endangered species recovery plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wildlife is not protected by top-down command and control 
government regulations.  Wildlife is protected when the 
government works with landowners through voluntary 
incentive-based legislation.  It is protected when all members of 
society work together.  It is time for our endangered species to 
be given the kind of co-operation and protection they deserve.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on Friday, March 5, I will be hosting a breakfast in my 
riding to commemorate International Women's Day and to celebrate 
the accomplishments of the women of Parkdale—High Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International Women's Day in Canada was born in the 1900s. 
Women in large urban centres began fighting unsafe working 
conditions, contesting low wages and the lack of job security. 
In 1907 International Women's Day was first celebrated in 
Copenhagen, Denmark, where thousands of women rallied and marched 
in the streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parkdale—High Park will celebrate the success of local women, 
including Connie Dejak, Vice-President of the Runnymede Chronic 
Care Hospital; Susan D'Olivera, of the Parkdale Community Watch; 
Dorothy Grey from the Parkdale Community Station; Mary Jo Leddy, 
a professor and refugee activist; award winning and critically 
acclaimed actor Fiona Reid; and film and television producer Mary 
Young-Leckie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International Women's Day is a wonderful occasion to acknowledge 
the progress made by women from all walks of life in the 
advancement of gender equality, as well as an opportunity to 
honour all women in our communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
March 7, 1999 the great riding of Hamilton West will once again 
host the Juno Awards.  I cannot think of a better place to honour 
our performers and to show our appreciation for Canada's best 
musical talent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian music has never enjoyed more success at home and abroad 
than right now.  Canadian International Music Week, the week 
leading up to the Junos, allows us to acknowledge Canadian talent 
in an increasingly competitive world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tidal wave of sales and success for Alanis Morissette, 
Céline Dion, Bryan Adams, Shania Twain, Sarah McLachlan and, dare 
I say, the True Grit Band certainly have international music 
industry observers wondering if there is something magical here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There really is magic on the Canadian music scene.  This week we 
pay tribute not only to those artists who are currently reaching 
the high notes, but also to hall of famers like Anne Murray, 
Gordon Lightfoot, Glenn Gould, Buffy Ste. Marie, Maureen 
Forester—there are just too many to list—and this year's 
inductee, Luc Plamondon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We don't need a million dollars to hear the rock, jazz and 
Canadian folk music live on stage in Hamilton next week.

development of official language minority communities throughout 
the country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This money will go to direct support for official language 
minority community groups as well as to encouraging the delivery 
of essential services such as health and job training and will 
also be used to reinforce minority language education and second 
language education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This support helps more than 260,000 young people study in their 
first language, while 2.7 million are learning their second 
language.  It ensures the further development of a network of 19 
French language colleges and universities outside Quebec as well 
as 8 English colleges and universities in Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, British Columbia broadcasting 
legend Jack Webster passed away.  Friends have said that Jack 
probably would have wanted his obituary to state that he died on 
Tuesday, March 2, at 10.18 a.m. precisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jack Webster was born in Glasgow, Scotland in 1918 and 
immigrated to Canada in 1947.  He spent his life in reporting and 
broadcast journalism.  Canada remembers his face on CBC <I>Front 
Page Challenge</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jack was a pioneer of open line radio on New Westminster's CKNW. 
He was notorious for finding a molehill at 9 a.m. and building it 
into a mountain by noon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One story that separated Webster from the others was the 1963 
riot at the B.C. Penitentiary.  The prisoners demanded to speak 
to either Prime Minister Lester Pearson or Webster.  What 
followed was an all-night negotiation session between Webster and 
the inmates, a story that changed the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jack Webster was never one to avoid a challenge or succumb to 
political correctness.  There is now a journalism award in his 
honour.  Canada will miss him.  His irascible voice of courage 
defined him as a great Canadian.

a prestigious prize, le prix Rideau, in the initiative category, 
by the independent network of special event organizers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This award goes to the organizers of an original event that has 
attracted and developed a new audience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, two particular productions within the 1998 festival 
also attracted the attention of the provincial jury at the 
Soirée des masques, <I>Les enrobantes</I>, presented by Populus 
Mordicus, and the Théâtre de l'Oeil's <I>Le Porteur</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world puppetry festival was a great success for the city of 
Jonquière and the region of Saguenay-Lac Saint-Jean.  My 
congratulations to the organizers, and wishes for continuing 
success for many years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I extend an invitation to everyone to attend the 
next edition of the festival, which will be held at Jonquière in 
the year 2000.

February 24, the Government of Canada announced that it will 
give $110 million to Quebec farmers to ensure their financial 
security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers in my riding of Brome—Missisquoi are very pleased about 
this news. The program will be administered by the Quebec 
government, through its own aid program for farmers hit by the 
farm income crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in December, the Canadian government had announced the 
creation of a new program designed specifically to help those 
affected by the international financial crisis, particularly on 
the Asian market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec Minister of Agriculture has joined the national 
program. 
This, in our view, is a fine example of co-operation between 
Ottawa and Quebec City, something that will serve first and 
foremost the interests of Quebec farmers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>About 5,000 jobs in the Okanagan Valley are directly linked to

immediate relief.

growers have said enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 15 the sound of chainsaws will ring through the 
Okanagan Valley.  Growers, who have nothing to lose, will cut 
down their apple trees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Financial relief is needed now, not in the summer, and long term 
solutions like reduced taxation must be a priority.  This is just 
another example of Canadians paying more in taxes and getting 
less in services.  Will the Liberal government stop the March 15 
Okanagan chainsaw massacre?

</I></B></P><P align=left>This feature film is the result of a pan-Canadian effort 
involving Toronto based production company Film Works, as well as

of the demands of striking federal public servants in my riding 
is that they should be paid the same in all regions of the 
country.  However, at this very moment a federal electrician in 
Newfoundland, doing exactly the same job as his counterpart in 
British Columbia, gets $4 an hour less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the policy of the same government that recently changed 
our health transfers to a per capita basis, saying it wanted to 
make all Canadians equal no matter where they lived.  If the cost 
is the same per capita in all regions of the country to build and 
equip hospitals, to hire nurses and doctors, why does it not cost 
the same all over the country to hire an electrician? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support pay equity.  Glaring pay inequities, be they gender

Speaker, yesterday the Secretary of State for International 
Financial Institutions took a swipe at parents who stay home with

work outside the home, that their expenses are smaller, and that 
is why the Liberal government discriminates against them in the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, obviously the Prime Minister was not listening 
yesterday.  His minister was asked why government tax policy 
discriminates against stay at home parents and he did not deny 
the discrimination.  Instead he justified it by saying “Well, 
they don't work as hard as parents outside the home”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this the reason the government continues to discriminate 
against stay at home parents in its tax policies and in its 
budget?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

a great appreciation for the work of Canadians, whether their 
workplace be in the home or outside the home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who has any doubt of that only has to look at the

real agenda is that next week it is going to the UN in New York 
City to argue the tax discrimination against stay at home parents 
is really okay.  The Prime Minister's lawyers will be arguing 
that tax fairness for stay at home parents would reduce their 
incentive to work.  Maybe he did give the government's position 
yesterday.

work.  This was never my intention.  This is not what I meant and

possible and hypothetical recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Minister of Finance say that surpluses must be 
accumulated for rainy days, when the Minister of Human Resources 
Development said last week that there was no surplus, that they 
had been spent and that the money did not exist any more? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
we must look at what this government has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came to office, employment insurance contributions were 
$3.07.  Today, they are $2.55.  That represents over $3.5 
billion we are giving to employers, employees and SMBs in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we have to look at the employment figures. 
The level of unemployment in Canada is 7.8%.  That is why things

has just told me has nothing to do with the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is no more money, if the fund is empty, if the 
employment insurance surpluses have been spent, what does the 
Minister of Finance propose to do in the event of a recession? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will he return to a deficit situation?  Will he again cut 
benefits to the unemployed or will he increase employers' and

</I></B></P><P align=left>Deficit and recession were mentioned.  Let us look at job 
creation: over 1.5 million new jobs, including over 525,000 new

will not be a recession, that everything is fine in Canada, that 
unemployment is going down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his last budget, on page 64, the Minister predicts a $1.3 
billion increase in employment insurance benefits in 1999-2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Minister of Finance is telling us that unemployment is 
going down, how can he explain such an increase in benefits for 
this year?  Is he going to enhance the program, or is he going 
to hide surpluses from us once again? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
because salaries are increasing, which is the best thing that

he is not telling us is that, according to the chief actuary, 
there will be a 2.5% increase in earnings, while he is 
increasing employment insurance benefits by 11%.  His answer 
does not hold up.

as salaries increase, as the economy grows, as the work force 
increases by 1.5 million, inevitably we will also see benefits 
increase, as there will be far more people in the workforce who 
could lose their jobs.

Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as my colleague should understand, because I have said it a 
number of times and I will say it again, public sector pension 
plans are legislated that the outcome, which is the payout to 
employees, is guaranteed by law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past when there were deficits, for instance when the plan 
was indexed and the liabilities suddenly increased by close to $8 
billion, it was the government and the taxpayers who paid for it. 
Because it is a legislated plan and a guaranteed outcome, every 
cent of that surplus belongs to taxpayers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the surplus 
in the employment insurance fund has disappeared.  One-third of 
the federal employees' pension fund has been spent.  The surplus 
in the Canada pension plan is going up.  From whom will the 
government take money next, after the workers?

responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I have 
said on numerous occasions, but will say again, the government 
pension plan is covered by legislation, and public sector 
employees have their pension plan benefits guaranteed by law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the risks are assumed by the government, and hence by the 
taxpayers.  Every time there has been a deficit in the public 
service pension plan, the government has made it up.  For 
example, when the plan was indexed, there was an $8 billion 
deficit and the government was the one that made it up.  The 
surplus therefore belongs to the taxpayers.

yesterday Canadians were appalled to hear the Secretary of State 
for International Financial Institutions say that two income 
families are putting in twice the amount of work of single earner 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Finance genuinely disagrees with the 
statement yesterday of the Secretary of State or International 
Financial Institutions that two income families deserve special 
tax treatment, why does he not give the tax relief that Canadians 
deserve to all Canadians families?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member knows that is not what I said, but let 
me repeat it for his benefit.  What I said was that I have known 
the secretary of state for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member would like to go back and look at the 
transcripts when the secretary of state was the chairman of the 
House of Commons finance committee, what he will see is a member 
of parliament, a member of the House and a member of the 
government who consistently fought for Canadian families, who 
consistently fought for Canadian children.  He did not do it with 
any help from the hon. member or any of his ilk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
secretary of state probably also said he would abolish the GST 
when he was in opposition.  The fact is that the C. D. Howe 
Institute has calculated that a two income family with two 
children will pay $14,000 more in tax than a single earner family 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister agrees that stay at home parenting is real work, 
why does he not eliminate his discriminatory tax policy that 
punishes stay at home parents?

Speaker, if my word was unparliamentary, I apologize.  It is very 
hard to figure out what to say about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence we have a progressive tax system.  If the hon. member 
does not agree with a progressive tax system, let him stand in 
the House and say it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we make sure that Canadian children are taken care of and 
are best protected?  That is what the government has worked on. 
That is why we brought in the child tax credit.  That is why we 
brought in the other measures. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
can assure the finance minister that this tax system is 
regressive for single income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is more than just about the junior minister's foot in mouth 
disease.  The senior minister is not blameless in this whole 
episode either.  Two weeks ago he brought in a budget and 
entrenched the discrimination against single income families.  It 
actually got worse in the last budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the minister's excuse?  He cannot blame this simply on a 
slip of the tongue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, our tax system is based on two principles, progressivity 
and individual taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member opposite does not agree with progressivity 
and believes in fact that higher income Canadians should be taxed 
at a lower rate than lower income Canadians, let him stand in the 
House and say so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member believes that in fact we should be taxing not 
on an individual basis but on a family income basis, that a lower 
income spouse should be taxed at his or her higher income 
spouse's tax rate, let him stand in the House and say that.  What 
is their agenda? 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
believe the government has an obligation to show that it values 
parenting.  It has an obligation to treat single income families 
like they have some value when they stay home to look after their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the matter with that?  Why can Canadians not be treated 
fairly so that when they stay home and look after their children 
the government shows through the tax system that is a good thing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In budget after budget the government has chosen to discriminate 
against those families.  How can it do that?  How can it justify 
that? 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is almost obscene to hear the Reform Party cry 
crocodile tears about children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister gave a list.  Let us just go on.  Why then is 
the Reform Party seeking to dismantle the maternity benefits and 
the paternity benefits in the Canada pension plan?  Why did 
members of the Reform Party vote against the way in which we 
reversed the taxation of child support payments to benefit 
children?   Why do they want to cut welfare payments?  Why do 
they want to cut equalization payments?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, is it not time to remove the employment insurance fund

that comes from the employment insurance fund, as stipulated in 
1986 by the auditor general.

question is for the finance minister.  While the Liberal and

work outside the home or parents who work inside the home, the 
real story is the kids get the short end of the stick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents who stay home with their children get no help from this

<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, that is precisely the point we have been trying to make 
to the Reform Party, that what is really important here are 
Canadian children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why as a government we brought in the child tax benefit. 
That is why we brought in increased funding for the community 
action program for children. That is why we brought in the 
prenatal nutrition program, all these items.  That is why we 
protected maternity and paternity benefits in the Canada pension 
plan against the onslaught of the Reform Party, precisely because 
the end game here is the welfare of Canadian children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
fact is the child tax benefit does not even begin to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last month Tom Kent, one of the architects of Canadian social 
programs, issued a study on how we can support children and 
families.  He called on the government to introduce a universally

the national child benefit our government had conducted extensive 
consultations across the land and many experts advised us on the 
very way that has been chosen by this government to help 
children.  There is $2 billion invested in it per year on top of 
what we were doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the member that all provincial governments are

<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK170">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 2 consideration of the motion that 
this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to add my thoughts 
on the federal budget that was tabled a couple of weeks ago in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A budget sometimes seems like a boring document, but it is 
really a statement of how much of our earnings the government 
intends to take.  It touches each one of us, the work we do and 
the money we have in our pockets.  It is a statement of how much 
money the government intends to spend, remembering that the 
government does not have money of its own.  It only has our 
money.  It is also a statement of what the government is to spend 
our money on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some very strong criticisms of the government in all 
those three areas in terms of how much it intends to take from 
our earnings, the way it is managing the spending of our 
earnings, and what it is spending our earnings on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have reversed the enormous tax hit and the slashing of 
dollars from medical care, which we were told when the government 
was elected was necessary to eliminate having to borrow to meet 
government obligations.  We did not want to live on borrowed 
money.  The government said it would have to tax us more and cut 
support for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We took that, some of us perhaps more willingly than others. 
Some of us were astonished that it was the Liberals, who had 
always stood up with their hands on their hearts saying that they 
would protect the Canada Health Act against the fires of hell if 
they had to.  However, when push came to shove, their words meant 
nothing as so often happens with Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are today with no deficit.  In fact we have a healthy 
and growing surplus.  Yet there is still extra taxation and there 
are still cuts to the former support that we had for our health 
care services.  Why do these continue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal revenues are an astonishing $42 billion between March 
31, 1994 and March 31, 2000.  On average each taxpayer is paying 
over $2,000 more a year in taxes than they did when these 
Liberals came to power.  The government is taking $2,000 more 
from each taxpayer's pocket.  That is a lot of money to most 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Globe and Mail</I> on February 23 made this cogent 
statement: “A real tax cut doesn't just slow the growth in 
government's revenue.  It leaves the government with less 
revenue”.   We have not really had a tax cut if government is 
still taking in more this year than it did last year, which the 
government is doing.  There has not been a tax cut at all.  There 
is less of an increase than there might have been.  When the 
Liberals talk about tax cuts they are simply not being accurate 
with their words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government is confiscating billions more of the income 
we worked so hard to earn, what wonderful things is the Liberal 
government doing for us with our own money?  I might add that $1 
billion would be like winning a million dollar lottery three 
times every day for an entire year.  That is how much $1 billion 
is. 
The government is taking $42 billion out of the economy, out of 
the pockets of the hardworking people of the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the most critical area of meeting our medical and health care 
needs, especially as we get older and we know that the population 
is getting older as the baby boomers retire, very little is being 
done by the government to meet our health care needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the 10 year period from the time the Liberals were elected 
in 1993 to 2003, they will have slashed $33.3 billion from 
support for health care and education.  During the same period of 
time, 1993 to 2003, they will put back $11.5 billion into health 
care.  They slashed over $33 billion in this 10 year period. 
There was an outcry, which there might well have been, and they 
grudgingly put one-third of it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the Liberals only made two-thirds of the raid on 
health care that they intended to make.  We are supposed to thank 
them and feel that they are a wonderful, wonderful governing 
party because they only raided our health care funds by 
two-thirds of what they really would like to have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact each and every Canadian will have nearly $500 less 
available to care for their medical needs this year than when the 
government took office, and that is not all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the enormous and punishing tax grab Canadians 
have staggered under with the government, the government uses a 
sneaky device to ratchet up its tax take year by year called 
bracket creep.  According to the Caledon Institute, this device 
has pushed 1.9 million taxpayers from the lowest to the middle 
tax bracket and 600,000 taxpayers from the middle to the top 
bracket.  It has also added more than a million low income people 
to the tax rolls in the last 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government brags about the few people that its little 
tax cuts pushed off the tax rolls, hon. members might want to 
just balance that with all the people who are pushed on to the 
tax rolls and pushed into paying more taxes because of these 
sneaky stealth taxes which the Liberals have had over five years 
and six budgets to fix and have done absolutely nothing about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1980 a single wage earner would be able to keep $10,500 
before paying tax.  Guess what it is now under the Liberal 
government.  Last year taxes were due after only $7,000 of 
income.  The Liberals in their generosity will now let that 
taxpayer keep an extra $175 before the tax man comes knocking. 
Think of the generosity of allowing a single taxpayer to keep 
$175 more before starting to pay tax.  Even that paltry sum will 
quickly be eroded by the stealth tax that I spoke of before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the child tax benefit.  The Liberals make a great 
deal of this so I think we should spend a minute talking about 
it.  The child tax benefit system is a program which the official 
opposition supports.  It represents the best of co-operation 
between federal and provincial agreements.  It is targeted to 
those families that have modest incomes from work.  It is 
designed to encourage families and allow families to stay in the 
workforce.  Regrettably it is not as generous as it first 
appears.  The child tax benefit system was subject to this 
stealth tax, this partial deindexing in 1985, and 14 years later, 
six of them under a Liberal government, this regressive measure 
is still in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each year the value of the child tax benefit declines at the 
rate of inflation and the value of the threshold at which the 
benefit is clawed back declines by the rate of inflation. A 
family with an income of between $20,000 and $30,000 a year faces 
a clawback of up to 27% of the benefit on any additional earnings 
under the Liberal government.  What a nasty and insidious tax 
burden.  It is heaviest on those with low incomes.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, the government announced increases in this child tax 
benefit in the 1997 budget.  These measures were announced again 
in the 1998 budget.  Some adjustments have been announced in the 
1999 budget.  However, the full benefits of the program will not 
be in place until 2000, a delay of over three years.  Too many 
announcements; too little action.  It is so typical of this 
government.  Could the government not speed up this program and 
put money in the hands of families sooner? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government would have Canadians believe it is using 
our tax contributions to ease the load on low income parents to 
help them.  This is simply not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to the purple prose of the finance minister and other 
Liberal misrepresentations, we in the Reform Party, the official 
opposition, support the national child benefit and have 
repeatedly offered and called for measures to make it a real 
benefit, not just Liberal lip service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, although Canada is a wealthy and prosperous 
country, an increasing number of our citizens appear not to have 
an opportunity to share in this wealth and prosperity.  I refer 
to the many homeless people, as well as those families on very 
low incomes for whatever reason.  We know much more about the 
problem of homelessness in our large cities following a major 
study released by the city of Toronto in January. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Homelessness has many causes and governments at all levels have 
responsibilities to take action.  Homelessness is not a partisan 
issue, but one on which politicians of all stripes and at all 
levels must work to solve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes and one of our principles is that 
Canadians have a personal and collective responsibility to care 
and provide for the basic needs of people who are unable to care 
and provide for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit that in this budget the government has failed. 
Not only is it taking far more from the pockets of hard-working 
Canadians than is necessary, but it is also putting too much of a 
burden on those least able to afford it and giving too little and 
too poorly managed programs in return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason I will vote against this budget.  I urge members 
of this House to get the government to clean up its act before 
they support this budget. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member made a number of statements in which she suggested 
that somehow taxes have been increased for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quickly looked back over the last two budgets and I saw an 
increase in the child care expense deduction which went from 
$5,000 to $7,000.  I saw the total elimination of the 3% surtax. 
I saw the non-refundable tax credit increased by $675 for each 
and every taxpayer.  I saw an investment of $1.7 billion in the 
national child benefit.  There were no increases in tax rates. We 
introduced the RESP, government grants worth up to $400 a year 
for parents.  There were EI reductions worth $2.8 billion in 
savings to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If those are the facts, I would ask the member directly, could 
she explain exactly what tax increases she is talking about?  If 
it is bracket creep, and if she wants to index the $6,542 
personal exemption by inflation, which is 1% or a $65 increase in 
the bracket level, at the tax rate of the non-refundable tax 
credit that would mean $16 a year to a taxpayer.  I therefore do 
not accept bracket creep as the explanation.  I want to know the 
real explanation from the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, is this not a little 
ironic, considering that this is a member of the government which 
made the budget?  Surely if they cannot explain their own budget 
we are in some pretty big trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply refer the member to his own government's budget 
where it states very clearly that tax revenue is going up by the 
amount I mentioned, $42 billion since this government took 
office.  These are the government's own figures, not a figure I 
pulled out of thin air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This member, as Liberals so often do, reels off all of these 
supposed wonderful tax cuts that the government brought in, even 
though of course, in spite of these cuts, it is still taking in 
more revenue than when it began. 
It is taking in more revenue next year than this year.  Its own 
budget figures say that.  All we have to do is look at the 
budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member to listen not just to me, although I know he 
has a high respect for anything I would tell him.  The Business 
Council of British Columbia said that the tax cuts which the 
member speaks of will amount to 0.17% of GDP in the first year 
and perhaps 0.25% of GDP by the year 2000-2001.  It concluded 
that the cuts are like “throwing a golf ball into Lake 
Superior”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to try once more to see if we can get 
clarification about where the Reform Party really stands on 
health care.  In the last few days during this debate some 
members of Reform actually suggested that they truly do believe 
in a universally accessible, publicly administered health system. 
However, we know from the past that their health critic has said 
that core services of health care could be provided outside of 
medicare.  We know from the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca 
that the party stands for a parallel, private, two tier health 
care system.  We know from the member for North Vancouver that he 
praises the system in Florida and condemns what he would call 
socialist medicine in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the recent United Alternative conference Reformers had a 
chance to clarify.  A motion was put and there was a debate. 
There was a chance to add an amendment calling upon delegates to 
uphold national standards for a health care system.  The 
delegates, which I assume included Reformers who were all 
present, roundly defeated this amendment, especially after one 
participant defended the right of the provinces to introduce user 
fees.  Where did the member who is speaking stand on this issue? 
What is truly the position of the Reform Party on health care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this member should be 
asking questions of her sister governments in B.C. and 
Saskatchewan which have put a two tier health care system into 
place in those NDP provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me clarify where the Reform Party stands on support for our 
health care system.  First I will discuss 1993.  This is 
verifiable.  The member can look at our campaign literature. Even 
though we had more than a $42 billion deficit in this country and 
there was overspending, our party campaigned on zero cuts to 
health care and education.  Zero cuts.  It is in our literature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, after this Liberal government had slashed support for 
health care, our campaign was on restoring funding to health care 
to the tune of $4 billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know where this member gets the idea that there is 
anything less than the strongest support for health care from 
this party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the UA convention is concerned, that was not a Reform 
exercise.  What those people did vote on were some strong 
principles in support of strong social programs which they said 
would be fleshed out in policy making sessions later on.  I am 
sure this member would be welcome to participate in those united 
discussions to make sure good policies come out of them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am not all that happy to talk about this budget because it is 
about propaganda, not priorities.  It is about brainwashing, not 
budgeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all the government spins to the contrary, this budget 
leaves Canadians paying more in taxes and receiving less in 
health care.  In 1999 the average Canadian will pay over $2,000 
more in taxes than they paid in 1993.  At the same time total 
cuts to health care over the last three years amounted to $1,500 
per person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that we had to eliminate the deficit.  There 
is no doubt that Canadians wanted the federal government to 
balance the books.  Before the 1995 budget a wave of protest ran 
across this country.  Rallies were held in over 20 Canadian 
cities where thousands of overburdened taxpayers demanded an end 
to the era of chronic deficits.  But they were also very clear 
about one thing: “Don't you dare raise our taxes”.  After 
decades of constant tax hikes the anger of Canadians was growing. 
The rally cries were around no more taxes and, more importantly, 
they continued to tell the Canadian government “It's the 
spending, stupid”.  Canadians gave the finance minister clear 
instructions:  Balance the books on the spending side of the 
ledger, attack waste, inefficiency and lower-priority programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister appeared to hear these concerns.  However, 
appearances can be deceiving.  Instead of no more taxes, 
Canadians were hit with the single largest tax hike in the 
history of Canada.  CPP payroll taxes were increased 73% and 
bracket creep continues to take a growing bite out of our 
wallets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it seems the finance minister took “It's the 
spending, stupid” to mean keep up the stupid spending.  Instead 
of cutting waste and inefficiency, the government ravaged 
transfers for health and education.  Instead of funding hip 
replacement surgery, taxpayers are paying $100,000 in government 
grants for a book on dumb blond jokes.  The government slashes 
university funding while protecting $4 billion in pork-barrel 
regional development grants over the last four years.  Students 
get less while there is plenty of money for a very questionable 
hotel deal in the Prime Minister's very own riding.  RCMP 
services are cut while this government continues to give millions 
of dollars in illegal trade subsidies to profitable corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims it was forced to cut health care spending. 
The government claims its hands were tied on real tax relief. It 
claims it had to make tough decisions so it could balance the 
budget.  The government has no right to claim any credit for 
balancing the budget because it did nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The credit goes entirely to Canadians— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I believe I heard the member say that the government gave 
millions of dollars of illegal subsidies to businesses.  If that 
is the case, I would ask that the member withdraw that remark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Perhaps the hon. member can clarify 
the position.  I did not hear that remark myself, but perhaps the 
hon. member can clarify it if he did say that.  I know he would 
not want to suggest such a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what I said was that this 
government continues to give subsidies to foreign businesses, 
which in our view—and there are a lot of ways to characterize 
them—is illegal, not that the government is committing illegal 
actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has no right to take any credit for balancing 
this budget because it did nothing.  The credit goes entirely to 
the Canadians who have been forced to pay $2,000 more in taxes 
each and every year.  The credit goes to those who have lingered 
and died on hospital waiting lists, while waiting lists have 
grown longer because this government slashed $20 billion out of 
health care over the past few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, it was not the Liberal government which made tough fiscal 
decisions, it was Canadian families.  They were the ones who were 
forced to priorize their spending.  They were the ones who were 
forced to pay more for less health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time that Canadian taxpayers received the recognition 
they deserve.  It is high time they got the tax relief they 
deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this budget offer them?  Guess what?  More tax 
increases.  While this government offers $7.7 billion in tax 
cuts it will raise CPP premiums by $7.2 billion over the next 
three years.  Bracket creep will take another $2.7 billion.  I 
think it is absolutely shameful that this government tries to 
spin a $2.2 billion tax hike and then tells Canadians they should 
be grateful for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It comes as no surprise that Canadian families are not grateful. 
Why should they be grateful for a government that continues to 
ratchet up the tax burden faster than income growth?  Why should 
they be grateful for a government that treats stay at home 
parents as second class citizens? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a family of four, with an income of $50,000, with 
one of those parents staying at home to raise the children.  That 
family pays $4,000 more in taxes each year than the same family 
with both parents working outside the home.  This government has 
deliberately penalized stay at home parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this budget put an end to this inequity?  No.

in the face by the Secretary of State for International Financial 
Institutions.  Instead of tax fairness we see discriminatory 
taxes and more shell games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget reminds me of George Orwell's <I>1984</I>.  In that 
novel the government announced that chocolate rations would be 
reduced from 20 grams to 10 grams.  There was a second 
announcement the next day.  There was all kinds of fanfare.  The 
government with excitement announced it was increasing the 
chocolate rations from 10 grams to 15 grams.  In that society 
citizens were brainwashed into believing that was an 
improvement.  Canadian society is not so easily fooled.  It is 
tired of the big brother from Shawinigan and his Liberal speak, 
Liberal speak like the finance minister's warning that Canadians 
must wait another two decades before they will see real tax 
relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guarantee Canadians will not have to wait that long. 
Overburdened taxpayers do not have to wait another 20 years for 
something they have been demanding for decades. No, Canadians 
need only have to wait a year or two.  Soon Canadians will take 
matters into their own hands in the next election.  They will 
toss out big brother and his big taxes. They will vote for a 
party that is united in its resolve to give Canadians real 
immediate tax relief. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member talked about tax increases, as did the member from 
Nose Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figures members referred to are the estimated total revenues 
from personal income taxation from all Canadian taxpayers.  They 
suggest that since that number is going up Canadians are paying 
more taxes.  The fact is that since the government took power 
there are over 1.5 million more Canadians who have jobs, 1.5 
million more taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member very directly that when he considers all the 
changes that have taken place in the last series of budgets, all 
of which reduced taxes like the 3% surtax, the $675 on the 
non-refundable tax credit and all the other improvements that 
were made, is he saying to the House that the government has 
introduced any changes which increase an individual's income 
taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is an exact example of 
what comes from this government, a bunch of numbers and figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every Canadian will be able to show their paycheque stub in two 
months or six months from now.  Let us see if there is any real 
tax relief.  Look at paycheque stubs for the last five years 
since this government has been in power.  It goes down and down. 
We have less and less to take home every single time.  That will 
continue to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can put out all the rhetoric and fancy numbers it 
wants but at the end of the day Canadians will look at their 
paycheques and there will be less and less to take home to 
provide for their families.  There will be more and more 
deductions. The story will be told on the paycheque stubs of 
every working Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will see that this is a shell game by this government. They 
will see there is no real tax relief.  The government can tell us 
all the numbers it wants but Canadians will know the truth when 
they have less to pay their bills at the end of the month, less 
to provide for their families, less to give their children. 
Those are the facts.  They can look at their stubs today and ask 
where the tax relief is and where are the hundreds and thousands 
of dollars this government promises. They are not there.  It is a 
shell game. It is empty government rhetoric.  The numbers will 
not add up on the paycheque stubs.  I challenge the member to 
that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in his speech the Reform member failed to address 
the most important message Canadians are sending to Liberals and 
to Reformers.  To use the words from the member's speech, they 
are saying “Don't you dare bring in user fees into our health 
care system.  Don't you dare take our system any step further 
toward a two tier, for profit Americanized health care system”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet that is exactly what Reformers did only two weeks ago at 
their united alternative conference.  That is what they voted 
for.  They had a chance to vote for national standards for a 
health care system but they voted that down.  They voted instead 
to leave the door open for user fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about a united voice for Canadians.  How did 
the member vote on that resolution?  Where does his party stand 
on user fees?  When will he join us in preserving medicare and 
going forward? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me tell the member where 
I stand in the party.  I spent five years in the province of 
British Columbia as a paramedic and nobody believes stronger in a 
national health care system available to every single Canadian 
than this party does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic government in British Columbia, my home 
province, has forced Canadians into a two tier health system 
where tens of thousands of British Columbians are forced to go 
down to the States to get health care treatment.  That is an 
absolute disgrace.  The Premier of British Columbia's home was 
raided today by the RCMP because of the questionable way he 
governs the province.  It has led to a two tier health care 
system.  That is what we have from NDP governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes in a strong national health care 
system available to every single Canadian.  That is what people 
would get from this party.  We campaigned in 1997 on putting $4 
billion immediately back into health care.  We are committed to 
that, not like the current Liberal government which slashed $7 
billion and then gave back a mere $1.5 billion or $2.5 billion, 
and it wants us to thank it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine if a criminal came into your home and stole $10,000 and 
came back and gave you $1,000 and asked to be thanked. I do not 
think it adds up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be splitting my time. It is an honour to rise in the House 
today to speak to the 1999 budget.  This year's budget is a 
Canadian budget.  It invests in community, the community of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government does not do is often as important as what it 
does do.  What we have not done with this budget is jeopardize 
our sound fiscal base, a base that has enabled us to withstand 
international fluctuation in economic trends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget does not buy our way to prosperity as the authors of 
the alternative federal budget, the Canadian Centre for Policy 
Alternatives and Choices, would have us do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are investing in our national social system because this is 
what Canadians have stated they want.  This is what our 
government is providing.  It is the Canadian way, it is the 
Liberal way. This budget does not abandon sound fiscal 
principles.  We will balance the books through to the year 2001. 
We are not setting unrealistic targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years ago when the debt to GDP ratio was at its peak, 36 
cents out of every revenue dollar, more than one-third, went to 
debt interest.  This was money Canadians could not use to prepare 
for the future because their governments were too busy paying for 
the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year with the debt ratio dropping, the portion of each 
revenue dollar servicing the debt also dropped to 27 cents.  We 
have not returned to the old ways of the old days.  We will 
continue to invest and build on last year's focus of research, 
job creation and knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget does not use borrowed money to invest in the future 
of Canada and the welfare of Canadians.  We are in a position to 
reinvest Canadian dollars in the priority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is impossible to cover everything contained in the budget in 
this 10 minute speech.  However, in my opinion there are four 
main themes I would like to cover: fundamentals, framework, 
fairness and the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the fundamentals. Our economy is in excellent shape.  Our 
unemployment rates are at all time lows.  Interest rates are 
down.  The deficit has been paid off.  It is through the efforts 
of all Canadians that we are in a position to invest in our 
nation's social system.  This budget does just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debt reduction is a priority for this government but it is not 
its only priority.  Of course we must pay down our debt. Step one 
is our commitment to not overspend annually on our budget. We 
will not borrow to buy the groceries.  This government will not 
put all our resources into debt reduction alone.  It is like 
paying off the mortgage on the house but allowing the children to 
go hungry and leaving the roof leaking without repair. 
This scenario does not strike a balance.  It lacks vision for 
long term health and it is not what Canadians have said they 
want. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a survey my constituents of Kitchener Centre responded that 
80% of them wanted some debt reduction.  They said it should be a 
priority.  The government is making that a reality with the $3 
billion contingency fund which will go annually to paying down 
the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can stand in the House and firmly state that I believe this 
government will pay down the debt.  As a matter of fact, we will 
eliminate the debt.  But it will be by continually acting in a 
prudent fashion.  We will meet the expectations of my 
constituents and all Canadians with sound fiscal management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax policy of the federal government is based on three 
fundamental principles.  I would like to take a moment to outline 
these.  The first is that our tax system must be fair.  Tax 
reductions must benefit those who need them the most, low and 
middle income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, broad based tax relief should focus initially on 
personal income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, because of our debt burden, broad based tax relief 
should not be financed with borrowed money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, this year's budget builds on last year's budget.  On 
budget day I had a hard time going through it trying to find some 
kind of surprise that I could share with the local media.  This 
speaks to the transparency and the broad based consultation that 
the government has been involved with to find out truly what 
Canadians want to see and the vision that we will share as a 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has begun the process of providing broad based 
tax relief for all Canadians.  Together the 1998 and 1999 budgets 
provide the largest proportion in tax reductions at the lowest 
income level.  This is good news.  We have removed 600,000 
Canadians from the tax rolls.  I am pleased that the government 
has continued to reduce the 3% surtax for those earning between 
$50,000 and $65,000.  Fourteen million Canadians will receive tax 
reduction as a result of this measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second theme to be addressed is framework.  Through the 
social union, the government has provided true leadership. 
Canadians are tired of different levels of government pointing 
fingers at each other.  The social framework allows all 
governments to move toward solutions that benefit Canadians.  As 
a society we have shared responsibilities on issues such as 
homelessness, affordable housing and lack of skilled workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is looking to forge partnerships as well with 
labour and industry so together we can address these important 
social issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faith communities in my riding of Kitchener Centre are planning 
a forum with members of parliament and our provincial 
counterparts as well as leaders at the regional and municipal 
level because they acknowledge there is a shared responsibility 
and are looking for solutions, not excuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are fundamental issues of health care delivery that must 
be addressed.  We must look at how we pay for health care, how we 
structure it in our communities and how we meet the evolving 
demographic needs and the changing roles of health care 
providers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there is a strong desire by Canadians to see the 
development of key indicators for measuring health care delivery. 
Our investments in research will help develop these important 
research measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has gone beyond just transferring larger funds of 
money for health care to the provinces.  We are setting a path 
for a clear vision for our health care system.  We are building a 
system that is responsive and reflects the changing needs of 
Canadians.  We are committed to working with our provincial and 
territorial colleagues on innovative health care programs, 
programs that meet the needs of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only the most partisan individual can criticize the health care 
investments the government has made.  We have invested according 
to the priorities of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next five years the provinces and territories will 
receive an additional $11.5 billion specifically for health care. 
This represents the largest single new investment the government 
has ever made.  For my province of Ontario this is good news.  I 
know that constituents of Kitchener Centre are pleased to hear 
that Ontario will receive $4.4 billion in health transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A well rounded health care system must have a framework based on 
a number of key areas: research, home care, pharmacare and 
leadership within the medical community.  This Liberal government 
has invested in all these areas.  I am pleased that the 
government has committed to investing in projects such as the 
nurse fund.  A $25 million endowment announced in this budget 
will enable nurses to find solutions to systemic challenges which 
face them.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address my third theme, framework.  The 
government has an important role to play in promoting access to 
knowledge and skills. The budget demonstrates our commitment by 
the allocation of $1.8 billion for the creation, dissemination 
and commercialization of knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Kitchener Centre we have seen a great surge of 
knowledge based companies open their doors.  These businesses are 
always looking for talented individuals capable of functioning in 
a high tech environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are committed to providing the necessary funds to ensure that 
our youth can meet the needs of high tech knowledge based 
companies, whether it be through the Canadian opportunities 
strategy or the Canada Foundation for Innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that the budget makes $150 million available 
through technology partnerships Canada to partner with the 
private sector to commercialize innovative processes and 
products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the nation's program spending in 
relation to the GDP is only at 12.5%.  This is the lowest level 
since 1950.  This government has only increased spending in a 
minimal way, yet what we have done is reallocate existing funds 
and solidified a framework from which to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is a federal transfer program that goes to the 
heart of what it means to be a Canadian.  It is about fairness. 
This budget fully restores per capita entitlements for all 
provinces in three years time.  The government's increases to the 
equalization program will make resources available to most of the 
less prosperous provinces for public services, including health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am extremely proud that not only have we 
addressed the queries that have been expressed by Canadians but 
we will be able to build on the gains of yesterday in order to 
create a bright future for tomorrow for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the member for Kitchener Centre will know that 
although I am from Winnipeg, I am fairly familiar with the 
Kitchener area.  I was born and raised in a small village near 
Kitchener called Winterbourne, and I check in fairly regularly 
with my parents, Harry and Klazina Wasylycia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the member will agree with me when I say that my sense 
from that community is that the number one concern for all 
citizens in the area is health care.  They are reeling from a 
double whammy, the effects of both cutbacks and regressive 
measures by the Harris Conservatives in Ontario and the cutbacks 
of the federal Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the member intend to deal with those concerns in that 
area?  In particular how does she feel about any of this new 
federal money going to Premier Harris?  He has opened up the 
whole home care program in that province to competitive bidding. 
This means that companies like Olsten, large American based 
profit making companies, are winning contracts to provide 
services at low cost while longstanding non-profit organizations 
like the Victorian Order of Nurses are fearing for their 
survival.  It is really the patients who are at risk and people 
who need home care who are suffering because of this whole 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the member feel about money going to for-profit health 
care instead of non-profit delivery of home care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the hon. 
member's question.  She really has put her finger on one of the 
large concerns in my community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This federal budget is very good news for the people of Ontario. 
One of the things the social union framework acknowledges and 
legitimizes is the partnership we have with the province. This is 
a good news budget for the people in Winterbourne, for the people 
in Kitchener, for the people in all of Ontario because we are 
releasing resources and $3.5 billion can be accessed immediately. 
What the Harris government decides to do with that will be 
something he will have to be accountable to the people of Ontario 
for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have 
enjoyed working on the finance committee with the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took note of one thing she said with respect to debt.  I 
suppose nothing concerns me more than the fact that the 
governments of the last 30 years have driven us into debt to the 
point where, as she mentioned in her speech, at one stage some 31 
cents of every $1 collected in income tax went toward interest. 
Just think of what we could do if we did not have the debt to 
service.  The amount of money that would be available for 
programs would be immense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She then talked about this $3 billion contingency fund which, if 
not needed, will go toward reducing the debt.  She said she was 
sure the debt would be repaid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I taught mathematics for a number of years and have these math 
and finance formulas in my head.  I did a quick calculation. To 
get rid of the debt, $580 billion, over the next 25 years, by the 
time I am 85, would require the posting of a surplus every year 
in those 25 years of some $50 billion a year. Here we are paying 
a puny little $3 billion if we happen to not need it at the end 
of each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether she would comment on a greater urgency to 
reducing the debt so that we could reduce the amount of interest 
payments and have more of the taxpayers' money available for 
programs or to give them a tax break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Madam Speaker, there are two halves to 
the equation.  I really support the fact that we are looking at 
our debt through our GDP ratio.  As the hon. member opposite 
points out, even with a $50 billion investment, which would leave 
us no money to reinvest in the programs we hear Canadians asking 
for and the kind of social structure Canadians are demanding, it 
would still take a long time to pay the debt off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see this government having a single focus on merely 
paying down debt.  As we went across Canada, people said health 
care was up here and their second priority was down here.  I 
believe that this budget and this government have achieved the 
balance that will give a quality of life to Canadians as well as 
help to retire the debt. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I did not think I was going to have an 
opportunity to speak this afternoon but it has availed itself.  I 
am pleased to make a couple of observations during the budget 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, which is a 
west end riding of the city of Winnipeg, I was naturally 
interested in how my constituents would react to the February 16, 
1999 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to say that the budget is going over extremely well, 
in fact, so well that very often it is difficult to find reaction 
out there.  When voters, constituents, are generally happy with 
an initiative by government, they do not say a lot.  It is when 
government is seen to be doing something negative, something that 
is a mistake that we hear it from voters.  I have not been 
getting an earful from constituents in the past week or so; in 
fact it has been quite the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are they saying?  First of all, they are very happy with 
our health care initiative.  Most Canadians, and I think I can 
speak for most of my constituents—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B> I know the member for Winnipeg North 
Centre finds the budget very difficult, but then I am not too 
sure whether there is anything we could do that would make the 
hon. member happy.  However, those are the things we have to put 
up with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about health care, which is a real passion for 
the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.  It is also one of my 
passions.  I am very proud of the fact that the government has 
restored health care funding to the tune of $11.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite sure that if we asked any of the hon. member's New 
Democratic friends whether we would have come back with $11.5 
billion, they would have said no. 
I am sure most New Democratic Party members, if they were honest 
and straightforward, would say thank you very much to the 
Minister of Finance and to the government.  That is what 
Manitobans are saying.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote a woman the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre 
might even know, Lynda Kushnir Pekrul of the Canadian Nurses 
Association.  I am sure the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre 
would love to hear what this woman said. She said:  “This budget 
is a victory for nurses”. Shall I repeat it again in case the 
hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre did not hear? This budget 
is a victory for nurses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Did you talk to the nurses on 
the ward? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  If the hon. member for Winnipeg North 
Centre is not satisfied with that, I can find another quote to 
settle her down.  “They have no excuses left.  There is every 
reason why the Manitoba government must take immediate action. 
Hospital and home care services in Manitoba have deteriorated too 
far”.  Who said that?  Dr. George Kelly, president of the 
Manitoba Medical Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice that the New Democratic member for Winnipeg North 
Centre has suddenly fallen silent. I hear nothing but silence 
from that side.  The testimony hurts does it not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is in the budget we provided health care dollars to the 
tune of $11.5 billion.  Most people in my province of Manitoba 
are very pleased.  I got a letter today from a constituent who 
said that he hoped this money would be well spent.  Just a few 
minutes ago I was in the process of replying to that constituent 
pointing out the fact that the spending of that money falls 
within the ambit of the provincial government.  It is up to the 
provincial government to spend that money wisely.  I trust the 
provincial government will do that because it is answerable to 
the people of Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre does not like the 
message on health care, maybe I could please her a little on the 
question of taxes.  Again we had some good news regarding taxes. 
In the last two budgets, the finance minister, who probably will 
go down as the finest finance minister in this century, the 
finance minister, with the support of the Prime Minister, with 
the support of cabinet and with the support of the entire Liberal 
caucus, has been able to provide in a gradual incremental way tax 
relief of over $16 billion.  Is it enough?  I suppose it is never 
enough but we are on track and we are on track toward further tax 
cuts. Relief last year, more relief this year.  If everything 
goes according to Hoyle, if everything goes well, there will be 
more tax relief next year which is exactly what Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that because we got into this deficit and financial pickle 
over a long period of time.  Most Canadians understand that if it 
takes a long time to get into it, it will probably take some time 
to get out of it.  The finance minister knows that; we on this 
side know it.  We cannot do it overnight, but we are doing it. 
We are doing it with purpose and the job will be done.  I know it 
will be very hard to convince the people on that side of the 
House, especially the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre, but 
we are going to get the job done.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote another Manitoban.  This was on health care.  It 
is by Dr. Gary Glavin, associate vice-president of research at 
the University of Manitoba.  By the way, he is a constituent.  He 
stated “This is the first time that I have been excited about a 
federal budget”.  How do you like those apples?  That is coming 
from people who normally do not say great things about federal 
budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. Harold Gillishammer who is the new minister of finance 
for Manitoba spoke very highly of the budget when he said “This 
budget was billed as one with tax reductions and increased 
expenditures in health care.  Certainly the federal government 
came through”.   Those are the operative words, “came 
through”.  He went on to say “They have balanced the budget, 
they have reduced taxes, and we believe in that to make this 
country more competitive”.  Imagine, that was said by a 
Conservative, who is hardly a Liberal flag waver.  These are not 
bad comments from opponents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I will quote one more individual.  This is certainly not 
from a normal Liberal flag waver.  The fellow's name is Victor 
Vrsnik of the Manitoba taxpayers association.  They are usually 
very critical of anything that Ottawa does.  This is what he said 
about the budget:  “The Canadian Taxpayers Association is 
delighted the finance minister is tuning into the message of tax 
relief.  He is eliminating the 3% surtax and he is raising the 
basic personal exemption, which will mean that poorer or lower 
income Canadians will only start paying income tax now after 
$7,200 as opposed to $6,500”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There we have it.  I think that is pretty good testimony.  But 
we are not going to stop at that.  Even if we have silenced many 
of our critics, even if many of our opponents are saying good 
things, we are going to continue to do a good job because 
Canadians want better health care and they want lower taxes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to address a question to the hon. member, who 
reportedly is my shadow in the riding of Halifax West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noted that the hon. member spoke about health care and he 
spoke about taxes.  But I notice he did not address the issue of 
employment insurance with respect to the budget.  The member who 
spoke previously indicated that the unemployment rates are at an 
all time low.  The government seems to take a great deal of 
comfort in throwing out that statement.  But I am sure that 
statement does not give a lot of comfort to the many people who 
remain unemployed and, in particular, to those who find 
themselves ineligible for EI benefits because of the many changes 
that have taken place:  the intensity rule, the clawback, the 
change from weekly to hourly qualifications and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be a great significance in the fact that as the 
number of people who are eligible for EI benefits goes down we 
also notice that child poverty and homelessness is going up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member feel that this budget in fact has dealt 
adequately with the question of homelessness, child poverty and 
EI? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Madam Speaker, first I would like to 
point out to the hon. member that I am not his shadow.  I think 
we do have an arrangement.  It is called twinning.  I am sure he 
understands what twinning is in political jargon, but I am not 
his shadow.  I am not going to watch him very closely.  But if I 
can help my fellow Liberals in his riding, one way or the other, 
I will do exactly that.  That is what twinning is all about.  It 
has nothing to do with shadowing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the question on the budget, was Rome built in a 
night or a day?  I do not think so.  Was the economy rebuilt in a 
day?  Did the budget cover every possible avenue?  Did it cover 
every possible issue?  No.  There is always work to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very aware of how controversial EI is, particularly in his 
part of the country. 
I know the intensity rule is under question, as are many aspects 
of EI.  What do I say to my hon. friend?  Keep on raising those 
questions.  If we do not hear those questions from the member and 
his colleagues, we hear them all the time from Liberal members 
from Atlantic Canada.  There is genuine concern about EI, as 
there is about a lot of the issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member wants to throw this into the budget process, we 
have done something that no other government has done in the 
past, which is to have very wide open budget consultations.  In 
fact we are into the pre-budget consultations for 2000 right now. 
If the member has something to submit, I am sure the finance 
minister and the rest of us will be all ears. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I suppose 
I should not be asking the member this question because I think 
it is unfair.  I think that he, like most Liberal backbenchers, 
like most Canadians, does not really understand the implications 
of the numbers as announced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this budget was talked about as being a health care budget, 
the number which they chose to use was $11.5 billion.  If we look 
at what the budget is, it is an annual budget.  The auditor 
general and other accounting experts have said that annual 
budgets should have their annual numbers stated.  In smaller 
print, it says $2 billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond that, $2 billion this year is mentioned, $2 billion next 
year, $2.5 billion, $2.5 billion and $2.5 billion.  They project 
five years in advance and use the big number of $11.5 billion 
after taking $20 billion out of the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding—and I would like the member to correct 
me if I am wrong, if he knows, and I do not think he will 
know—that when they say $2 billion this year and $2 billion 
next, it means $4 billion more and then $6.5 billion more and so 
on as an accumulation.  Or is it simply that next year there will 
be no increase at all, but rather just $2 billion more than we 
had in the past?  Then it would be $2 billion and no increase and 
then another $2 billion.  Which is the right answer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Madam Speaker, the way I read the 
budget, it is pretty simple.  It is $11.5 billion over five 
years, but upfront, the very first year, it is a payment of $3.5 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, provinces can access not only the $2 billion 
over each of the next five years, but they can get an advance of 
$3.5 billion upfront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For my province of Manitoba, that means a total of $425 million, 
which is not bad.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today, not because this 
budget pleases me, but to give the people in my riding an 
opportunity to speak through me.  I will be sharing my time with 
my colleague from Rimouski—Mitis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may, I will pick up the thread of what has been said this 
afternoon.  The member speaking before me mentioned that the 
Minister of Finance would go down in history as one of the 
greatest ministers of finance. 
The people of the Gaspé will remember the Minister of Finance as 
the greatest conjurer, that is, he has a talent for juggling 
figures, making believe a cut is no longer effective and having 
us believe that what he is giving us is coming immediately, when 
it can take three or four years, as the Reform MP mentioned.  It 
is time to set things straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I must mention is that this conjurer opposite 
got his deficit to disappear by having the provinces and the 
unemployed pay first.  I will elaborate on these two points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us talk about the unemployed.  Everyone knows now 
that there is over $20 billion accumulated in the employment 
insurance fund. 
I am entitled to speak to this subject today, because the 
Minister of Finance included the employment insurance revenues 
in his consolidated budget. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year, he is telling us that he thinks he will have revenues 
of about $18.8 billion, of which he expects to spend about $17 
billion. But everyone knows that he will once again save at 
least $6 billion. The magician that he is comes up with various 
expenditures, but he never thinks about the well-being of the 
unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a moment to mention the excellent information 
work being done in the Gaspé region by the Mouvement action 
chômage Pabok and by its coalition, whose two co-chairmen, Mr. 
Cousineau and Mr. Blais, do a great job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go back to the manifest released by the coalition in New 
Richmond, two weeks ago. 
These people are asking three things from the government: first, 
to establish an independent employment insurance fund run by 
representatives of the contributors; second, to improve the 
employment insurance program; third, to put the surplus back 
into the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These three issues are important to regions such as ours. I see 
that some Liberal members are listening carefully. Why is it so 
important? Because, in January 1999—I do not have the current 
figure—the actual unemployment rate was 20.8%. The average for 
1998 was 22.8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, in the riding of 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, a paper mill may close 
and 300 jobs will be lost if one of the two machines is shut 
down, or 600 jobs will be lost if both machines are shut down. 
We are told “perhaps work can be done for other companies during 
down times”. But this requires maintaining the social security 
net, that is the employment insurance program, even though I 
would much rather see the paper mill operating year round with 
the two machines and the qualified workers who are already 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members opposite that our riding must also face the 
closing of a copper mine in Murdochville. This means that 300 
jobs will be lost. This time, it is not the federal government's 
fault; it is because the mine is depleted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these job losses are added to the existing unemployment 
rate, members can see the how important the transition measure, 
the social net provided by the EI program really is. The 
Liberals did not say much about that. 
The minister of regional development will perhaps be able to 
confirm this, but my reading of the budget is that there is 
actually less money available for regional development.  I would 
like him to respond to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I would like to make is that the Minister of 
Finance magically transferred the deficit onto the backs of the 
provinces.  Wearing three jurisdictional hats at once, he 
slashed the health, post-secondary education and social 
assistance envelopes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this time, he is saying that, with the situation bad in 
the provinces and problems in the hospitals, the government will 
come up with some money and pretend to alleviate matters but 
will impose a medical police force to keep tabs on how it is 
spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is disgraceful. 
Hospital management comes under provincial jurisdiction and the 
money is now in Ottawa, but it is always the same taxpayer 
footing the bill.  The public will not be fooled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to the following point.  The sectors I have just 
mentioned come under provincial jurisdiction.  But what about 
the fishery and the catch, which really do come under federal 
jurisdiction?  Do members recall that there is a groundfish 
moratorium, that it is still in place, and that experts agree 
that the commercial fishery will not resume on its former scale 
any time in the next five years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for TAGS, the Atlantic groundfish strategy, the last lump sum 
payments will be made in May 1999. 
Nowhere in this budget is there any mention of what will become 
of fishery workers after May 1999.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the people approaching retirement age?  What can we 
do in a devastated region such as ours, where fishing is no 
longer possible, when we get to be 50?  What new job direction 
are we supposed to take, and where are the energies and 
catalysts for recharging our economy?  There are none!  Yet, 
they have jurisdiction over this, and it is easily enough 
understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use the other official language to pass the following 
message to my friends in the other maritime provinces, and I 
want the Liberals over there to listen carefully. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of hope could this budget deliver to the fishing 
worker? There is nothing in this budget to cover the end of the 
TAGS program which will stop at the end of May 1999.  This budget 
gives only dividends to people who have a chance to work, mainly 
Ontario workers.  I am glad for them but nothing is done in this 
budget for the people from the maritimes and the Gaspésie. The 
people from Newfoundland and elsewhere in the maritimes should 
raise this question with their members, if the members have the 
courage to go back to these ridings after the last vote on this 
budget. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to stay calm, but this is becoming increasingly 
hard to do.  In mid-January I was present at four or five 
different demonstrations.  The people are taking to the streets 
of the Gaspé to voice their despair and confusion.  At the 
moment they are doing so peacefully, but I am afraid, and I want 
the cries of the people to be heard all the way to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the Minister of Human Resources Development, or 
rather the Minister of Finance, to stop fiddling with the 
figures and to understand that the people need dignity, a social 
security safety net, and catalysts for a diversified economy. 
This is what they want the government to know. 
They do not want to be on employment insurance for the rest of 
their lives; they just want help in getting through some bad 
times, and unfortunately there is nothing in this budget that 
allows them any hope.

crisis in our fishing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do he and his constituents think of a government that 
writes a letter in 1994 promising income support until May 1999 
and then a year before this literally rips up that contract with 
thousands of fishermen and plant workers and say here is the new 
deal, completely destroying their hope and faith in the Canadian 
federal government system? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member for 
Sackville—Eastern Shore raises a very good point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government made promises to get elected, but it was just a 
smokescreen because, as soon as they took office, the Liberals 
started governing like a right wing party and making cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Close 
to $1.9 billion was invested in the Atlantic groundfish strategy 
but, unfortunately—and the hon. member is right—the very first 
year cuts were made to all transition and economic 
diversification programs, under the pretext that the number of 
potential clients had been miscalculated. These people still 
exist. There were close to 45,000 of them and they will still be 
there at the end of May 1999. What will happen to them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who work in the fishing industry, including fishers and 
the women who work in plants, will not disappear like the cod, 
because it is the federal government that now manages that 
program. These people are still there. They are human beings.

Stay home and keep quiet. We are not giving you another penny”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an insult. It is pure contempt on the part of people who 
claim that Canada is a wonderful country, full of life and full 
of compassion for all its inhabitants, including those who live 
in the regions that were the first ones to become part of 
Canada. I do not know how the Minister of Finance can tell them

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
to the remarks by my colleague, and I would add my voice to his 
indignation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A budget is supposed to provide for the welfare of a society, 
and this is not the case here.  For fishers and those working in 
the fishing industry or on its fringes in the Atlantic region, 
the situation is extremely precarious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the Minister of Finance is using our tax money 
to pay off the debt, but in doing so he is putting people in 
debt.  Our collective wealth is not really improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening is that the Minister of Finance is paying off 
government debt by putting people in fishing in debt. That is 
the drama. 
The real drama is that there are families sinking into poverty 
and debt, whose heritage is being ruined, who are losing their 
house, their boat, their possessions, and who see no future for 
their children.  That is the real tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleague if he does not agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Madam Speaker, the member for Portneuf is 
absolutely right.  The government's behaviour makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude with the following statement: great magician 
that he is, the Minister of Finance, he tried to make his 
deficit disappear.  This time he tried to make people in fishing 
disappear, and that makes no sense.

the budget in minute detail, nor is that my responsibility.  I 
will merely point out a few items that strike me as important.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Yes indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one looks at the Minister of Finance's five budgets, one 
realizes that he has never been able to forecast good sources of 
revenue, to know whether there would be a deficit or surplus, to 
anticipate anything that actually happened.  He has always 
managed to play with the figures, take a little from here, cover 
up a little there, so that only he knows exactly where he is

the Liberal Party of Canada, to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> He hopes so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> This is certainly high on his wish list. 
He is therefore planning on having the budgets and the surpluses 
he needs to be able to announce a huge tax cut for the public, 
to pass himself off as the greatest finance minister this 
country has ever known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bulk of revenues have come from the pockets of middle income 
workers and the unemployed, yet the budget contains nothing for 
them.  The budget does, however, announce one thing: a new 
employment insurance fund surplus. 
It had already accumulated some $20 billion or $25 billion in 
recent years, but the Minister of Human Resources Development 
confirmed to us this week that all that money has been wasted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For five years, the Minister of Finance has been telling us “I 
need reserves, in case a bad economic situation develops”.  Now, 
all of a sudden, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
tells us the surplus the Minister of Finance wanted to save is 
all gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are told of a new surplus, $4.9 billion.  Once again, 
this money will be used for something other than operating the 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now for the Minister of Canadian Heritage, the one who interests 
me the most. 
During the prebudget study and debate here in this House, we had 
reminded the government of the 40% assimilation rate across 
Canada and pointed out that, if it was a responsible government 
capable of doing more than just talk, one that wanted to 
actually do something, it ought to restore the budget envelopes 
for francophones to their 1993 level, at least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the situation a bit more closely.  In 1993-94, the 
budget allocated for official languages was $310 million.  In 
reality, it was $232 million, $78 million less.  Then in 1994-95, 
the budget was $240 million, $70 million less than the forecast 
figure. 
In 1995-96, it was $210 million; this time $100 million less than 
what was forecast.  So, in all, the government will have spent 
for official languages $248 million less in these three years, 
almost as much as he will be spending this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $70 million announced live on television on RDI by the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage in fact represents small 
compensation for the losses incurred by the official languages 
program since the Liberals arrived in office in 1993.  However, 
during this time, the minister found pots of money for all sorts 
of other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She found $60 million over three years to spend on propaganda 
with the Canada information office, the CIO.  Such a fine thing. 
It is too bad she chose such a name for her propaganda service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then for her “million flags” operation, she found at least $15 
million.  For the council on Canadian unity, she spent tens of 
millions of dollars from the official languages budget, 
including the $4.8 million wasted by option Canada in one 
month's time during the referendum, without anyone knowing where 
the money went. And then she hiked the Canada day budget by 
500%, 60% of which was spent in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is certainly not celebrating today, because 
the government is giving $70 million back to francophone 
communities. 
The minister should never have allowed francophone communities, 
like workers and the unemployed, to bear the brunt of reducing 
the deficit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been here since 1993. Every day, we get surprises 
concerning the official languages. When it is not a crown 
corporation that submits a report in one language only, it is an 
organization such as Katimavik that sends an invitation to 
members of parliament in English only. When we contacted 
Katimavik, we were told “Well, we thought everyone could speak 
or read English”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People everywhere forget that there are two official languages. 
The member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies did not even bother to 
check—after all he chairs that UNESCO organization—to see that 
this organization could submit to us, right here, in a place not 
far from Parliament, a— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We are talking about an organization for parliamentarians. I 
remind this House that when the incident took place, we postponed 
the event until a later date, to make sure that the whole thing 
would be bilingual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> This is not a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, I am very glad to hear 
this event will be held.  I heard it from the minister herself 
this afternoon, when I went to see her after Oral Question 
Period.  The failure to make the necessary arrangements, whether 
in this chamber or in adjacent rooms, is unacceptable. 
Naturally, I am aware that people decided to come back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is to say that we must be constantly on the lookout to 
protect our language, to defend it at every opportunity, when it 
should be sufficiently well known that this is a bilingual 
country.  That should be common knowledge by now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this government is tooting its own horn, francophone 
communities are in decline. 
According to the terminology used by the man responsible for 
language demography at Statistics Canada, Réjean Lachapelle, 
francophone communities are in the process of disappearing in 
six provinces out of nine.  This is not the Bloc Quebecois 
saying this, but Mr. Lachapelle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, in a report for Heritage Canada, Donald Savoie pointed 
out that the challenge for francophones outside Quebec is 
clearly to survive, to resist assimilation and to promote the 
development of strong and vibrant communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had many other criticisms, but as my time is running out I 
simply wish to say to members that I think that the increased 
funding to the CBC mentioned in the budget is good news for the 
Department of Canadian Heritage, for now, anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the $50 million earmarked for the CBC will mean that 
it can open a television station serving eastern Quebec, the 
North Shore and the Magdalen Islands.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
appalled at the level of poverty that still exists in the 
country.  We have more poor children in Canada today than we had 
during the great depression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The children are poor because their parents are poor.  The 
Progressive Conservative Party in its last platform suggested 
that the basic personal exemption should be raised to $10,000. 
This would put much needed money in the pockets of those 
Canadians who really need our help, be it those who are 
negatively impacted by the downturn in the east coast fishery or 
Canadian farmers who are negatively impacted by the lack of 
support given to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my hon. colleague agree that with the federal budget the 
government has let down Canadian people who really need our help? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
this highly pertinent and interesting question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been an MP since 1993, and we were discussing that just 
last evening at a committee we had struck precisely for the 
purpose of looking further into poverty in Canada, the poverty I 
see every time I am in my riding, every time people ask to meet 
with me.  The needs that they list have changed over time, and 
it is most unpleasant to see this.  Basically, the government 
has surpluses.  What the President of Treasury Board tabled 
yesterday, or the day before, represents a $6 billion increase 
in expenditures.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going through it, one notes such items as a $1 billion addition 
to the National Defence budget.   Why was that not allocated to 
poor children?  With 1.5 million Quebec and Canadian children 
going to school hungry, it is no wonder that the illiteracy and 
dropout rates are on the rise.  How can children learn anything 
on an empty stomach? 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened to the remarks by 
the member for Rimouski—Mitis. She said that I had said 
recently in the House that all the employment insurance funds 
within the consolidated fund have been wasted.  That is indeed 
the word I heard—that all the money was wasted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore ask the hon. member from Rimouski—Mitis what 
she considers wastage in the latest budget.  Is it the 
equalization payments, $1.4 billion of which will go to Bernard 
Landry for his upcoming budget?  What about the $2 billion we 
are adding each year to the national child tax benefit, which 
combine with the $5 billion we have already invested and which, 
obviously, will enable the Quebec government to make breakfast 
for children?  The member for Rimouski—Mitis talks about 
breakfasts for children. 
I must also point out that this is provincial and not federal 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the job strategy, which helps young people find jobs, is it 
wastage?  Or the Canada jobs fund?  What does she consider 
wastage in all that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, I said that the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage had found the heritage fund a useful source 
of money to waste on all sorts of things, such as the CIO, 
flags, and whatnot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is grandstanding a little more than he usually 
does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> A little more than he usually does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> That is right, when he answers questions 
in the afternoon, during oral question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government told us that it needed to keep the money for five 
years as a contingency fund.  It needed the money and there was 
a fund.  Suddenly, we hear that there is no longer a fund, that 
the money has been spent on all sorts of other things.  We do 
not even know why, we are unable to find out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the legislation requires the minister to monitor the 
use to which money in the EI fund is put. 
That is his ministerial responsibility.  He took an oath that he 
would perform his duties as minister to the best of his ability. 
Yet he allows the Minister of Finance to pillage the fund, to 
empty it out and divert it to other uses while, in my riding, 
there are people starving because they no longer qualify for EI 
benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London—Fanshawe, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
as the member of parliament for London—Fanshawe I am pleased to 
join the debate on behalf of my constituents as we speak about a 
very important budget and a very successful budget.  Let me first 
indicate that I will be splitting my time with my colleague from 
Nepean—Carleton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many positive things to comment on in the budget 
that one could use more than 10 minutes.  However, as the 
chairman of SCONDVA, the House of Commons Standing Committee on 
National Defence and Veterans Affairs, let me first turn to the 
matter of defence in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time in 12 years the Minister of Finance has given 
additional moneys to the department of defence, some $175 million 
in each of the next three years.  This is in direct response to 
the SCONDVA report which was tabled in the House last October. 
It was an all party committee which had the endorsement of most 
members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It called on some reinvestment in the men and women in our 
Canadian forces to help address their low level of pay and the 
very unacceptable quality of life that many of them found 
themselves facing as it related to housing, support for families, 
pay, and several other factors.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote the minister's comment on defence in the 
budget speech: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are improving the compensation and benefits of the 
men and women of the Canadian forces, Canadians who put their 
lives at risk every day around the world and who have 
demonstrated uncommon dedication here at home helping their 
country cope with a series of natural disasters. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of finance minister that I am very proud to 
serve with.  For the first time in 12 years a government has seen 
the need to begin to reinvest in the Canadian forces.  Is it 
enough?  No.  Candidly speaking probably it is not enough of an 
investment, but it is a major step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a major turn in the road as far as ending the cuts that 
have been repeatedly foisted on defence which the defence 
department has had to accept and now, for the first time in 12 
years, the start of a reinvestment in defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been the reaction to the budget?  I have listened to a 
party of avowed separatists today standing up for Atlantic 
Canada.  That is an interesting reaction.  I have heard members 
of the Reform Party decry the budget as the worst thing that has 
ever happened to the country.  I have heard them calling for more 
tax cuts.  I have heard my NDP colleagues calling for more 
spending as if nothing has been done at all to try to help low 
and middle income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Low income families in my riding know that is nonsense.  One Roy 
Romanow, the NDP Premier of Saskatchewan, very candidly gave his 
full endorsement to the budget.  How about Mike Harris, the 
Premier of Ontario?  Admittedly he is facing the polls in the 
near future, but Mike Harris is trying to hitch his star to the 
Minister of Finance.  He is now going around talking about “The 
Harris-Martin tax cuts”.  It is interesting to see the reaction 
of these two premiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about the lead speaker at the Reform convention—sorry, a 
Freudian slip—at the united alternative convention last weekend 
in Ottawa?  One Ralph Klein, Premier of Alberta, said “I think 
the feds did the right thing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reaction to the budget is fascinating.  We have premiers 
from the left supporting it and premiers from the right 
supporting it, but those are people in elected office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about my constituents in London, Ontario?  Each year my 
colleagues and I in London, Ontario hold a budget round table in 
early September.  We invite a wide cross-section of groups and 
individuals to come and present their ideas on the budget.  Those 
ideas are directly reported back to the Minister of Finance.  We 
go out of our way in London, Ontario, in my riding of 
London—Fanshawe, to seek as wide as possible an input.  The 
reaction in London, Ontario, to the budget is quite positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reactions of my constituents on the whole through calls and 
through the mail are running about 70% to 75% in support of the 
budget.  I will take that report card any day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Admittedly London, Ontario, is a major centre for health with 
several hospitals.  The absolute glee that reigns in London, 
Ontario, over the reinvestment in health care can be imagined. 
There is a considerable amount of research done in my community 
in the health sector and in several other sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experts in London were very quick recently to come to a function 
where I was in attendance along with my local MPs, one after 
another to thank us for taking the message to Ottawa which they 
have been giving us repeatedly for several years and to ask us 
if— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  If the NDP members will not heckle me, I 
will not heckle them.  I know they may not like these truths. 
The fact is I was asked to carry back the message to this House 
which I am doing now and to the minister of how pleased the 
medical community was in London and across Canada at the 
reinvestment in research and development, particularly in the 
field of health.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, one only has to reflect on the words of Michael Smith, 
our Nobel Prize winner, who said that in terms of reinvestment in 
health, this is probably the best budget ever by a federal 
government in this country.  To my knowledge, Mr. Smith is not a 
Liberal member of parliament.  He is a highly respected 
international figure in the medical community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is there such a positive response?  It is obvious.  For the 
second year in a row there is a balanced budget and a commitment 
by this government that we will balance budgets over the next two 
years as well.  Therefore there will have been four consecutive 
balanced budgets under this government, and that when we faced 
the situation of a $42.5 billion deficit which we inherited when 
we came to power in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recently met with a wide cross-section of labour leaders in 
London, Ontario.  They had a concern about unemployment, as I do. 
But they could not deny the fact that we inherited 11.5% 
unemployment and today it stands at 7.8%.  It is not good enough, 
but it is a lot better than it was in 1993, and the lowest level 
since 1990. Youth unemployment is decreasing.  In the last 12 
months youth employment has had its strongest yearly growth rate 
in over 25 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a Liberal government and we see a Liberal balanced budget 
which is trying to reinvest the surplus that we have been able to 
realize through the efforts of Canadians and the leadership of 
this government and at the same time continue the tax cuts which 
were begun in past budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One only needs to reflect on the fact that 200,000 more 
Canadians are removed from the tax rolls this year.  They are low 
and middle income Canadians.  Those are my constituents who live 
in co-op housing in my riding whom I just met with the other 
night.  They praised that fact as well as they praised the 
government's stand on not transferring federal co-op housing to 
the province of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting to hear the champions of these issues. 
Let them come to London—Fanshawe.  I welcome them to come to 
London, Ontario.  I welcome them to a debate any time.  I even 
welcome their heckling now because it is a sign that these truths 
do not sit well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I say that we have had an excellent budget from 
an excellent minister.  It has been very well received in London, 
Ontario.  It has been very well received in my riding of 
London—Fanshawe.  Yes, there are suggestions for future budgets. 
I intend to pursue them on behalf of my constituents but I am 
proud to support this budget wholeheartedly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have two comments that might lead into questions with regard to 
co-op housing.  The federal government has decided not to shirk 
responsibility in the province of Ontario.  How does the member 
explain that we got rid of co-op housing for Manitoba and other 
provinces but what we do in Ontario I guess is a little bit 
different from what we do anywhere else in Canada. If it was okay 
in Ontario, why was it not okay somewhere else? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the singing and praising of the budget and how 
things are so much better and we do not have a problem with the 
EI or anything like this, I wonder how the member feels about 
moneys for employment insurance.  People who are working pay 
money into employment insurance expecting that should they be out 
of a job that money is going to be there for employment 
insurance.  Then they find out that the government thinks it is 
a-okay, correcto, to spend it on this, that and something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the trust the government has broken with the people 
who have put that money in?  Whether it be employers or employees 
they expect that that money is there for employment insurance. 
The surplus the government is dealing with is dollars that it 
took irresponsibly and, for lack of a better word, misrepresented 
why it was taking that money from Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would be happy to 
answer the member's questions.  I hope she will not heckle the 
answer because I did not heckle the question, although she was 
pretty aggressive during my comments but that is okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fascinating to hear an NDP member talk about “trust 
broken”.  Come to Ontario.  Tell the people of Ontario who 
trusted Bob Rae one time, who trusted an NDP government in 
Ontario one time and then saw the tricks that were pulled on 
them.  Ask the CAW— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  I guess she cannot resist the heckling. 
Ask the CAW why it is not supporting the NDP in the upcoming 
Ontario election.  It is fascinating to hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The CAW has come out very vocally that there is no rift— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  That is not a point 
of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Madam Speaker, she is a new member but 
she is not going to intimidate me with that kind of nonsense. 
Maybe that would please her, I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She speaks about the problem with EI.  Let me address that.  We 
do not need any lectures from the NDP on the fact that we 
understand there are some valid concerns about EI.  We on this 
side share them as well.  We have a concern about the intensity 
rule.  We have a concern about the clawback. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Come to London—Fanshawe, come and meet with me and the labour 
leaders in London, Ontario.  They know we have those concerns. 
They know we are fighting for them on those issues. We have no 
lessons to learn from the NDP on that score.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, having 
heard my colleague praise the Minister of Finance and his budget 
to the skies, I have a very short question to ask him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can it be that the number of food banks in the country has 
tripled since 1989, and that the number of those who go to the 
food banks has doubled?  How can he accept that people with 
incomes of $250,000 or more are going to pay $8,000 less in 
income tax?  How can these things be reconciled? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is really quite simple 
for the member.  The first tax cuts this government brought in 
since being in power were aimed at low and middle income 
Canadians.  Four hundred thousand low income Canadians were 
removed from the tax rolls in the 1998 budget.  Two hundred 
thousand more low income Canadians were removed from the tax 
rolls this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government understands that to be a Liberal is to help 
those who cannot help themselves.  We are not the Reform Party. 
We believe in targeted tax cuts, which is exactly what we will 
continue to do in future budgets. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise in the House today to speak on the 
budget and what I would describe as a fiscal prescription for a 
healthy Canada as we enter the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberal Party came to power in 1993, Canada's fiscal 
house was crumbling at its very foundation.  The previous 
government had let the debt skyrocket out of control for years 
and was operating with a $42 billion deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This party, unlike others in this chamber, learned the lessons 
of history.  This Liberal Party understood that if Canada was to 
be an economic force to be reckoned with in the new millennium, 
we absolutely had to get the country back on track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians wanted a government that would actually take a 
leadership role and devise a new economic plan for this country, 
one that actually worked.  Sustained by our political courage and 
armed with the knowledge that Canadians supported our policies, 
we eliminated the deficit in four years and recorded a budgetary 
surplus in 1998 of $3.5 billion, the first such surplus in 28 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put Canada's fiscal house in order.  We delivered on our 
promise.  However, we do not hear the opposition members 
recognizing the major strides this government has made over the 
last five or six years.  No, they are much too busy trying to 
draft catchy sound bytes while we are developing sound economic 
policy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts speak for themselves.  Our record has shown that we 
have delivered the goods when it comes to fiscal responsibility. 
When the history of Canada is written in the years and decades 
ahead, I have absolutely no doubt that the historians and 
economists of the future will say that the last half decade of 
the 20th century was absolutely critical in terms of rebuilding 
Canada's economic foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also supremely confident that history will record the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Finance as being the people 
responsible for what the <I>Economist</I> magazine called Canada's 
economic miracle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is part of an overall plan, one which did not begin 
last year and one which will not end next year.  It is part of a 
building process which eliminated the deficit and began producing 
surpluses which have allowed us to make major investments, last 
year in education and this year in health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Finance has so eloquently said on several 
occasions, budgets are more than entries in the books of a 
government, they are chapters in the progress of a people.  So 
true, so true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, budget '99 focuses on health.  Over the next five years 
this government will inject $11.5 billion into health into this 
country so that the provinces have the proper tools to address 
concerns about hospital waiting lists, crowded emergency rooms 
and shortages of diagnostic services. This will ultimately result 
in a stronger health care system that reflects and meets the 
changing needs of Canadians.  I believe that this is good news 
for every Canadian and I am not alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Nepean—Carleton is located in the national capital 
region.  This is an area that has felt the sharp edge of the 
Harris Tory cutting sword.  The premature Tory tax cut put us 
face to face with the Ontario government's vision of better 
health care which was less hospitals, longer waiting lists and 
poorer service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the additional federal dollars, the health care situation 
in Ontario is starting to move in the right direction.  This is 
recognized by people who are close to the issue.  For instance, 
hospital and municipal officials in Ottawa-Carleton are labelling 
our commitment to health care as good medicine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Local heart surgeon and Conservative senator Dr. Wilbert Keon 
said that the infusion of money into health care is “very good 
news”.  The mayor of Ottawa, Jim Watson, was even more 
optimistic.  He said, “We could learn a lesson from this budget, 
that you can have more money to invest in social programs when 
you rein in your spending”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully the Ontario government learns from this budget, learns 
that our government's commitment to health care is just what the 
doctor ordered. However, there is much more good news in the 
budget than an investment in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether one lives in Nanaimo or Nepean, the budget provides tax 
relief without borrowing money to pay for it.  This is something 
that Canadians have not enjoyed since 1965. Building upon the 
initiatives in last year's budget, budget '99 prescribes $16.5 
billion in tax relief over the next three years for the 15.7 
million taxpayers in the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government understands the tax burden on lower income 
Canadians.  That is why we have removed 200,000 taxpayers from 
the tax roll this year.  Over the past two years our initiatives 
have resulted in a total of 600,000 Canadians escaping the usual 
financial pain that comes with a T-4 slip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together the 1998 and 1999 budgets provide the largest income 
tax reductions to the lowest income levels.  This translates into 
a 10% reduction for single taxpayers earning $20,000 or less, and 
a 10% reduction for families with annual incomes of $45,000 or 
less.  Families with two children and an annual income of $30,000 
or less will pay no net federal income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year we have also removed the 3% surtax for all taxpayers. 
That is good news again for every Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One very important issue this budget addresses is that of 
productivity, the key to achieving sustained increases in our 
standard of living.  Over the past few months the media has 
focused on what it calls Canada's decreasing level of 
productivity.  Budget '99 has a plan to promote productivity 
growth to improve the standard of living and the quality of life 
for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already taken steps to foster this important initiative, 
including the elimination of the deficit as has already been 
mentioned, putting the debt to GDP ratio on a strong downward 
track, and the tax cuts that have already been mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, knowledge and innovation are the real keys for 
advancing productivity growth.  That is why we have decided to 
invest in creating, disseminating and commercializing knowledge. 
We are building on the 1999 Canadian opportunities strategy 
with an additional $1.8 billion for various programs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As members will know, my riding contains part of the city of 
Nepean and borders the city of Kanata.  Both these west end 
municipalities in the Ottawa-Carleton region are the home of what 
has been referred to as Silicon Valley north.  In fact, they are 
probably the most vibrant concentration of high tech companies 
anywhere in Canada.  To say that they are enjoying explosive 
growth is almost an understatement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past couple of years and with the help of farsighted 
policies like the SR and ED tax credit and the Technology 
Partnerships Canada program, our high technology industry has 
blossomed.  The TPC program alone is a $250 million per year 
program aimed at keeping Canada at the forefront of technological 
innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically there have been more applications, unfortunately, 
than there have been resources available.  Budget '99 adds 
another $50 million per year for this initiative and that is good 
news.  It is also the catalyst to give businesses a competitive 
edge in terms of getting their products to market faster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Programs like the two I have just mentioned are making Canadian 
high tech companies world beaters.  That is why when we travel 
abroad we hear more and more of companies like Nortel, Newbridge 
and JDS Fitel.  These companies are showing our flag and making 
sales in places as diverse as Munich, Sao Paulo, Taipei, San 
Francisco and Johannesburg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The allocation of $550 million as well in another area, medical 
research, is extremely important, as is the creation of the 
Canadian institutes for health research.  It marks a new and 
important federal commitment to medical research for scientists 
and researchers across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past our researchers have spent much of their time 
chasing grants and wondering where their next research dollar is 
coming from.  This new initiative will enable these scientists 
and researchers to spend more time in the labs doing research 
extending the frontiers of human knowledge and increasing 
business opportunities related to scientific discovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again this budget is good for Canada.  It is also providing 
more fuel for the growth of our local economy here in 
Ottawa-Carleton.  This is what the regional chair of 
Ottawa-Carleton had to say about budget '99:  “It will help 
create jobs and new spinoff companies that will continue to make 
this region the success story that it already is”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Locally this funding will help benefit some major players in the 
medical research industry, including the Ottawa General Hospital 
Research Institute, the Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre, the Heart 
Institute, the Loeb Institute and the faculty of medicine at the 
University of Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also mention a few comments about what budget '99 does 
in terms of the national defence budget.  As vice-chair of the 
SCONDVA committee I am very pleased that the government has 
provided additional dollars to help implement some of the 89 
recommendations contained in our report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now past the era when governments promise more than they 
can deliver and, as the Minister of Finance has said, delivered 
more than they could afford.  This is responsible budget making, 
future oriented budget making and affordable budget making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From improved health care to tax relief, investing in technology 
to improving the quality of life for our Canadian forces 
personnel, this budget has all the right ingredients for a recipe 
to build a better Canada.  This is the type of leadership that 
the Liberal Party of Canada was known for throughout the 20th 
century and the type of leadership that we will continue to 
provide into the 21st.  This is the leadership that has made 
Canada a leader among nations.

for Winnipeg North Centre, Health Care.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>   Madam 
Speaker, I would like to talk a bit and then ask the hon. member 
a question about the health component of this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the budget came down I had an opportunity in my own 
riding to sit down with a number of health care professionals.  I 
try to do this on a regular basis with focus groups within my 
riding to get a sense of where they are coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anybody knows the state of the health care system in Canada 
right now it is surely those people who are on the front lines, 
the doctors, the nurses, the people who run our hospitals 
particularly. 
One of the questions I asked was if in the next budget the 
government puts a lot of money back into the system would this 
necessarily fix the system.  I have to say that those people were 
very skeptical about an infusion of money going back into the 
system that would in some way, shape or form fix the sad state of 
health care in this country.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went back to those same people after the budget and I asked 
would this $11.5 billion that the Liberal government intends to 
put back into this budget over the next five years do what we 
hope it will do, fix the health care system. These people had not 
changed their minds. I do not think they are fooled by the 
rhetoric of the government in trying to make it appear that 
somehow it is now the saviour of health care by putting this kind 
of money back into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member think that putting this kind of money back into 
the health care system will fix the system when indeed his 
government is responsible for taking $20.4 billion out of the 
health care system in the last five years and creating the 
problem we are in today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is clear that when the 
government took office in 1993 we were facing some very daunting 
challenges.  Part of those challenges was the $42 billion deficit 
that had been left by the previous government and it was 
absolutely essential that we get our program spending down which 
also meant reducing the transfers to provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some provinces, as in my home province of Ontario, we face a 
situation where there were cutbacks in transfer payments but the 
situation was significantly aggravated by a premature tax cut, 
something the party across the aisle seems to espouse as the be 
all and end all of what is good for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation in Ontario has pointed out fairly graphically how 
much in error that approach is and was.  I think the government, 
in terms of increasing the amount of money for health care, the 
$11.5 billion, is taking steps in the right direction.  There is 
absolutely no doubt in my mind about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in touch with people in the medical community on a fairly 
regular basis.  Just last Saturday night I was talking to a nurse 
who was complaining about the situation at the Queensway-Carleton 
Hospital which is just outside my riding but which serves a good 
portion of my riding.  This nurse was very concerned about people 
lined up in the hallways of the hospital because there are not 
enough beds in the emergency department. This is something that 
obviously has to be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important not just in terms of the infusion of health 
care dollars is the future oriented spending in terms of medical 
health research.  In that regard I should tell members that I 
have a sister who is a cancer researcher here in the 
Ottawa-Carleton region who is absolutely delighted with the 
foresight the government has shown in terms of investing more in 
medical research and the money going into it. It will have great 
benefits for the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will 
be dividing my time with my colleague from Sackville—Eastern 
Shore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to talk about health care and agriculture in this 
budget.  I also intend to talk about some things that are not in 
this budget, the unemployed, the homeless and the poor in Canada 
and beyond our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister announced on February 16 that the 
government will put $11.5 billion into health care.  The money is 
needed urgently for more nurses, for more cancer treatment and 
for more home care.  I am sure we are all grateful for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to know that $11.5 billion spread out over 
five years will take until the year 2003 before federal spending 
on health care reaches the level it was just four years ago.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that Ottawa and the provinces share health care 
costs but in 1995 without warning the Liberals began a round of 
devastating cuts under the CHST, the Canada health and social 
transfer, that reduced Ottawa's contributions for said transfers 
by a whopping $21 billion.  That is <I>b</I> as in billions, 
<I>b</I> as in big booboo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When medicare began in the 1960s, Saskatchewan's gift to Canada, 
it was the federal government putting up 50 cents and the 
provinces putting up 50 cents.  Now the federal share is down to 
just 11 cents on the dollar and the budget will bring it only up 
less than 2 cents to about 12.5 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cuts have been felt everywhere but nowhere more than in the 
province of Saskatchewan.  Our provincial government was forced 
to make very tough choices after 1995.  It could either pass 
Ottawa's health care cuts on to its citizens and the district 
health boards or it could find scarce dollars to replace that 
money.  Saskatchewan chose to replace the money and has increased 
spending on health care over and above what was cut by the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Replacing lost federal dollars on health care has meant that 
other pressing needs could not be met.  It would be useful to 
have had that money to move more quickly on twinning our major 
highways and improving our roads.  That is why the Premier of 
Saskatchewan, to respond to member for London—Fanshawe, was so 
pleased that finally the government woke up and was putting some 
real money back into health care so that he in turn can do some 
things that desperately need to be done in the province of 
Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are extremely concerned about the future of our health 
care system, notwithstanding this infusion of money.  We in the 
NDP caucus are committed to repairing existing health care 
services and increasing the emphasis on health promotions.  We 
are determined to add home care and pharmacare to the health 
system and ensure that two tier American style health system 
never comes to this side of the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking briefly at the agricultural situation, in December after 
much prodding the agriculture minister promised $900 million in 
federal funds for an income disaster relief program. Farmers have 
had to wait almost 80 days for the minister to announce any 
details.  If the devil is in the details there is much devilry in 
this set of details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In agriculture, like health care, it is important not to listen 
simply to the government spin doctors but rather to read the fine 
print. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December the minister of agriculture was promising $900 
million for a farm disaster relief program, as the member for 
Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia knows, but now there are clear 
indications that the minister and his bureaucrats, or someone 
over there, have fiddled with the program design to ensure that 
Ottawa will pay far less than it originally promised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, when the program was announced last week the 
minister acknowledged that the program would not cover negative 
margins.  That means if farmers lost money, as they certainly did 
in northwest Saskatchewan because of drought last year and in 
previous years, those losses are simply not covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am receiving calls from farmers who have lost money in the 
past few years and who fear, having looked at the details, that 
this program will do absolutely nothing for them.  In addition to 
not covering negative margins, the minister also announced his 
intention to deduct from his payments any contributions the 
government has made to the net income stabilization account, 
NISA, so it can pay farmers less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will pay out $600 million or less, not the $900 
million he promised as recently as last December.  As an aside, 
at $600 million it is no longer a 60:40 program in terms of 
federal-provincial.  It is more like 50:50.  The bottom line is 
that an agricultural manager for a Manitoba-Saskatchewan lending 
institution believes that under the rejigged rules announced last 
week so few farmers will qualify that very little of the $1.5 
billion will actually ever be paid out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces are also being forced to pay the 40%, and that is 
not fair, as the Minister of Natural Resources would know. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1730"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT43"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT43"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1730

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He would know that is not what happened in North Dakota.  That 
is not what happened in South Dakota or Minnesota.  It was 
Washington that paid in that case and it should be Ottawa in this 
case.  Small population provinces like Manitoba, Saskatchewan and 
Nova Scotia are footing the bill to help our farmers through a 
trade war.  Our small provinces cannot afford to take on the 
treasuries of the United States and Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa used to take responsibility for safety net and disaster 
programs, but this Liberal government has walked away from its 
responsibilities.  Since 1993 it has slashed spending on 
agriculture by 60%.  The money it announced for the disaster 
relief program is a two year blip.  By the year 2000 it will 
again be spending less than it did last year.  That, in turn, is 
much less than it spent in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister the other day said that the announcement was a 
great day for Canadian farmers.  It does not explain why farmers 
are still holding and planning to hold rallies as early as this 
Saturday in Regina or why provincial governments on the prairies 
are saying to Ottawa “You administrate this turkey because we do 
not want any part of it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers have played a key role in deficit reduction and the 
restoration of a balanced budget.  It is time for Ottawa to put 
money back into agriculture.  We in this party believe that 
Canadian farmers need sustainable incomes.  Our federal caucus 
intends to keep the pressure on the agriculture minister so that 
a solid, sustainable farm income disaster program will be there, 
not for just one or two years but for the long haul. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is new money for health care.  There is some new money for 
agriculture disaster relief.  However, in both cases we are just 
beginning to recover from years of devastating cuts.  At best we 
are running to stand still. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues have talked about unemployment.  I will not go 
into that in any detail except to note that in Saskatchewan only 
one unemployed person in three is now eligible for employment 
insurance.  If we look back 10 years ago to 1989 we find that two 
out of every three unemployed persons actually received some 
benefits.  This is a deliberate policy again by the federal 
Liberal government and it takes some $10 million annually out of 
the Palliser constituency, which affects small businesses, but 
more importantly, it affects families who cannot afford some of 
life's basic necessities.  These policies are callous and 
unacceptable.  People matter most.  They pay into unemployment 
insurance and when they lose their jobs EI must be there for 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, this budget has done absolutely nothing for the 
homeless in our country and very little for the poor.  The United 
Nations published an in-depth study earlier this year which is 
not at all flattering to Canada.  This is not the one that 
members opposite use when they stand to say the UN says that 
Canada is number one in the world.  This is the UNESCO study 
which says that amongst industrialized countries Canada is number 
ten in the industrialized world when it comes to the human 
poverty index. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addressing budget deficits the UN document notes that the 
Canadian government has not paid attention to adverse effects for 
the population in general.  In other words, the Liberal 
government has balanced its books on the backs of ordinary 
families.  Those hurt most were those most at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee says that homelessness in Canada is an area of 
grave concern.  The report states that it is of grave concern 
that little or no progress has been made to improve the lot of 
aboriginal people, especially in the areas of housing, 
unemployment and safe drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by noting that there is absolutely no new money 
in this budget for underdeveloped countries.  I was particularly 
disappointed that the finance minister was silent in his budget 
about any commitment to forgive the debt owed to our government 
by some of the world's poorest countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of Canadians are involved in the Jubilee 2000 campaign 
to cancel debts owed to Canada by 50 of the world's poorest 
countries.  Leaders of the Jubilee 2000 campaign met with the 
finance minister last fall.  They felt at that point that he was 
empathetic, but they and the poorest of the world's poor came 
away without any crumbs from the finance minister's table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side of the House we hearken back to what J. S. 
Woodsworth said:  “What we wish for ourselves we desire for 
all”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I would like to make a brief comment and then ask the member a 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will know that the Canada health and social transfer 
is made up of two components, the cash component as well as the 
tax points. 
The sum of those two equals the total entitlement of a province. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT44"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT44"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1735

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will also know that as the economy grows and more 
people are working and provinces earn additional revenue, the 
amount of cash does go down, all of which is subject to a floor 
which is going to be set at $15 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to raise that with the member because the cuts are not 
simply the cuts that otherwise would not have been made.  As 
other members have already pointed out, some provinces like 
Ontario gave $4.3 billion in tax cuts and the cut from the 
federal government was only $1.2 billion.  Clearly the provinces 
have priorities and clearly the province of Ontario showed that 
health care was not its priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the member regards his final comments on 
homelessness.  The Golden report in Toronto identified that 17% 
of the homeless in Toronto were aboriginals.  The member will 
well know the amount of dollars invested in aboriginal health and 
wellness issues by the government, as well as in the last budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will also know that transfers to the provinces have 
increased because of these health transfers and that about 30% of 
homelessness has to do with mental and physical disabilities, and 
that money is addressing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also knows that 28% of the homeless in the Toronto survey 
were youths.  He knows how much money has been spent on youth 
employment initiatives and youth programs to ensure that our 
youth have the training and the education they are going to need 
to participate in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those few statistics, I would ask the member whether he 
agrees that homelessness has been addressed directly by this 
budget and by other policies of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would absolutely not 
agree with that comment from the member for Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a gentleman who is usually parked in front of the House 
of Commons at the East Block entrance, about 200 yards from the 
entrance to this building.  He is there virtually every morning. 
I asked him the day after the budget how he had been affected as 
I dropped a few coins into his outstretched hand.  He said “Not 
at all”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the question on tax transfers, it is simply 
unrealistic to suggest that the provinces can make up the 
difference.  The taxpayer is feeling the burden enormously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the homelessness issue, I thought it was particularly 
offensive the other day when the Deputy Prime Minister suggested 
to the member for Halifax that it was simply a photo opportunity. 
What this federal government needs to do is to convene a round 
table or a discussion on homelessness.  I agree that it is more 
than one level of government, but there has to be some leadership 
shown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mayors of the 10 largest cities in Canada have asked for a 
meeting to discuss homelessness.  So far this government has not 
acceded to that request and I think it should with alacrity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds—Grenville, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
just want to ask the member a quick question.  He talked about 
the need for sustainable incomes in farming.  I think if the farm 
crisis shows us anything in this country, it is the value of 
supply management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if he would see this as an appropriate time to 
bring the hog producers under the supply management umbrella. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree that supply 
management has made the farm crisis far less significant in some 
parts of the country than in others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was part of the agriculture committee that was in Washington 
last week.  I can assure the hon. member that there is a 
deep-seated concern about supply management on the American side 
of the border.  The Americans would like to see it done away 
with.  The only thing they would probably put up on the same 
level is the Canadian Wheat Board, what they refer to as the 
state trading enterprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would think in the great scheme of things that the government 
was making a choice.  Knowing where their seats are, it would be 
that the Canadian Wheat Board would be offered up first, followed 
in the next round by supply management.

we will wait and see.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I found it interesting that the member referred to 
the fact that the trick the Minister of Human Resources 
Development had discovered was to make the unemployed disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially, about two thirds of the unemployed in his province 
were entitled to unemployment insurance. Now the figure is no 
more than one third.  Does he agree with the following 
statement.  Just as the great magician David Copperfield always 
has an assistant, does the Minister of Finance have an assistant 
too—that is, the Minister of Human Resources Development—to make 
the unemployed disappear and to create the illusion that there 
is no more deficit? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think that 23% of 
eligible people in Regina actually receive some employment 
insurance benefits, the lowest in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear the minister of human resources on a daily basis say 
“There is no problem here.  It is simply that there are more 
people working”.  There is a huge problem in this country.  Our 
constituency offices are being overwhelmed by claimants who are 
on employment insurance, demanding some relief.  They are being 
told that they have no alternative but to go to welfare in order 
to seek relief for themselves and their families.  The government 
knows it has a large problem and it is becoming more evident with 
each passing day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, every time it snows outside this beautiful hallowed hall 
we call the House of Commons, the Liberal government gives us a 
snow job on the budget which we are discussing right now.  It 
just goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to talk about the hallowed budget surplus. 
The facts are the facts.  Seven billion dollars has been taken 
out of the pockets of employers and employees in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question, which I have asked time and time again, is:  Where 
is the money?  We have heard from the minister of human resources 
that the money has already been spent on other programs.  This 
government has no right to that money.  It belongs to employers 
and employees.  That is the first fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals really wanted to do something about tax 
reduction, which all Canadians would like to see, why did they 
not do the simplest thing, which would have benefited the 
majority of Canadians, and reduce the GST, even by 1%?  That 
would have put money in many people's pockets and it would have 
put money back where it belongs, into the economy and job 
creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unbelievable that the government could do this while food 
bank usage is on the rise, while the environment of our nation is 
being “degregated” at a rapid rate and while public service 
workers are not getting the equity and equality they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government turned around in its recent budget and gave John 
Cleghorn of the Royal Bank and Al Flood of the CIBC a $32,000 tax 
break.  That is what they will get for 1999-2000.  Yet the 
chairman of the committee for SCONDVA and the vice-chair were 
both in here a moment ago bragging about how great this budget 
was for defence.  The fact is that there was not one single word 
about compensation benefits for the merchant marines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like these two to come back to the House and tell Ossie 
MacLean, in public, exactly what this budget does for them.  It 
does absolutely nothing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do not think my hon. colleague intended to, but he referred to 
the absence of a member from the House.  I think he has been here 
long enough to know that is not appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I did not hear that particular part.  We all 
know that members cannot mention whether or not someone is here. 
I am very confident the hon. member knows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member, 
for whom I have great respect, for pointing that out.  The fact 
is I would like him to mention in future debates what the budget 
does for our beloved merchant marines who sacrificed so much and 
to whom the government gives so little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unbelievable.  The government talks about job creation. 
What about the garment workers of Levi Strauss who just realized 
they will be losing their jobs in Cornwall?  What about the Volvo 
workers of Halifax who have lost their jobs?  What about the 
thousands and thousands of fishermen and plant workers from coast 
to coast to coast who have lost their jobs?  What about the 
Boeing workers in Toronto who in November will be losing their 
jobs?  What about the 2,400 Bell Canada operators who will losing 
their jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was not a single mention from the Liberals about those 
workers.  All they talk about is tax breaks and health care 
concerns.  I admit putting $2.5 billion back into health care is 
a good first step.  The fact is that spread over five years it 
will only match 1995 levels by 2003.  It is an absolute disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tommy Douglas, J. S. Woodsworth and all those beautiful New 
Democrats of before stood up and fought for health care.  They 
were Saskatchewan's gift to Canada.  My hon. friend from Palliser 
is absolutely correct.  The premise of health care was 50% in 
dollars from the federal government and 50% in dollars from the 
provincial governments.  After five years the government even 
admits that the grand percentage will be around 13% to 15% of 
federal contributions.  It is no wonder that we are going to a 
two tier system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An incredible amount of small business absolutely despises the 
budget.  If members do not believe me, they can listen to 
Catherine Swift.  I may not be a great fan of Catherine Swift but 
she is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  I love the heckling.  I have got them 
going.  This is great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding there are 14 small business operators on my street 
alone.  Every one of them complain about the underground economy 
because of the GST and HST rules.  The GST-HST was shoved down 
the throats of Atlantic Canadians.  It ended up that the 
underground economy grew to over $4 billion in the country.  It 
is an utter disgrace that competent, well meaning and honest 
small businesses have to compete with the underground economy. 
The government did not address that problem in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the greatest concerns of our country—it is a national 
disgrace—is what we are doing to hepatitis C victims.  I know 
Joey Haché is watching us right now and wants to know why the 
government completely ignored the constant concerns of hepatitis 
C victims.  The government ignored those people just like it 
ignored the fishermen on the east and west coasts and in our 
inland provinces, just like it will ignore the miners of Cape 
Breton, just like it ignored the miners of Kamloops and just like 
it will let go the Volvo workers, the garment workers, the Bell 
workers and everyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolute disgrace.  The government sits here and I noticed 
that not one member of the Liberal Party stood and spoke off the 
cuff.  They all had to read prepared speeches, obviously done by 
bureaucrats in the finance department.  They sound like a broken 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  I am glad to see the debate livened up 
a bit.  That is the way it should be.  The government has 
completely ignored the future of our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote for everyone an article which is hot off the press, 
from Internet.  Statistics Canada released information on family 
incomes today.  This is dated March 3 at 4.40 this afternoon.  It 
supports the old saying about the rich getting richer and the 
poor getting poorer. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1970 and 1995 average family incomes in Canada rose by 
32% but that affected only the richest 30% of families.  For the 
rest there was a slight decline.  Hardest hit are families with a 
single female parent.  Such families have almost doubled in the 
past 25 years and about 40% of them are in the bottom 10% of 
income earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This information is from Statistics Canada.  I took it off 
Internet about an hour and a half ago.  Those people are 
seriously affected by what is not in the budget.  The federal 
government can talk about the budget benefiting its friends like 
John Cleghorn and Al Flood, but the fact is that it does 
absolutely nothing for single parent families and working people. 
It is a sin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Palliser did not get the opportunity to 
mention the fact that family farmers across the country are 
devastated and hurt terribly by what the budget has done.  There 
is a lack of commitment by the government to help them in their 
time of need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The European Economic Community came up with $60 billion and the 
United States came up with $7 billion in aid for their farmers. 
What does our government do?  It hems and haws.  It even comes to 
the point where it denies its promise of a few months ago and 
reduces it by almost $300 million.  It is an absolute disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like government members to speak to Mr. Ray Martin of 
Flin Flon, Manitoba; Carol Ferguson of Louisbourg; and Alex 
Handyside of Porters Lake.  Government members are bragging; they 
are proud of the budget.  I can give them phone numbers so they 
can call these people and tell them how proud they are of the 
budget.  These are only three people from across the country who 
have called me to say that they are very disgusted with the 
budget and very disappointed in the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It is not usual for me to intervene, but I 
thank the hon. member for giving me a new word, “degregated”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  No, that is fine.  I appreciate it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member's comments with regard to tax impacts on or benefits 
to single parent families are important.  He said that the budget 
did nothing, but when I looked back over what happened in this 
budget and in the prior budget I saw that the child care expense 
deduction was increased from $5,000 to $7,000 for those who have 
preschool children.  I saw that the basic personal amount under 
the non-refundable tax credits was increased by $675.  I also saw 
the announcement of another $1.7 billion to the Canada child tax 
benefit, which benefits primarily low income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member try to reconcile all of those direct benefits 
to low income parents, in particular single income parents, with 
his statement that the budget did nothing for them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the question.  He knows very well that the provinces claw 
back some of that money.  He knows darn well that is exactly what 
happens.  He is shaking his head but those are the facts. 
Francine Cosman, community services minister of the Liberal Nova 
Scotia government, stated quite clearly that it claws back some 
of that money.  That is exactly what it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are very proud of the national child benefit.  I admit it 
was a good first start to helping low income families but it is 
nowhere near enough.  If that money went directly to the families 
and not through the provinces, it would have a much greater 
effect. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
intrigued with the member's speech.  We share one thing.  I am 
sure there will be some heckling immediately, but we share a 
genuine concern about the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I expressed that earlier in the House when I talked about my 
dear aunt who just died.  She got very poor care and had to be 
moved to a private health care facility, an extended care centre 
run by a religious organization, so she would get decent care. He 
talked a little about the restoration of health care dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals want us to believe that they are putting in $11.5 
billion. 
I look at that as simply a very small amount.  It is a $2 billion 
increase per year.  The next year there will be no further 
increase and they are still calling that $2 billion.  The next 
year there will be a $.5 billion increase and they are calling 
that $2.5 billion and so on for the next three years.  They come 
up with this grand total of $11.5 billion when in fact it is an 
increase of either $2 billion or $2.5 billion per year over the 
next five years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to take this opportunity to rip into the 
Liberals because of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his statement.  One of my favourite pastimes is ripping into 
the Liberal government.  Although I have some personal friends on 
the other side and I respect a lot of them greatly, fact is fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is absolutely correct.  When it comes to health care 
spending, the $11.5 billion over five years, they did not take 
into account inflation or the fact that we have an aging 
population.  They certainly did not take into account the needs 
of rural Canada when it came to the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they talk about the major urban centres and the health care 
crisis of downtown Toronto, Montreal, Halifax or Vancouver, they 
certainly forget areas like Medicine Hat, Sheet Harbour, 
Whitehorse, Yellowknife, et cetera.  The government should not be 
very pleased with what it has been doing to rural health care. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to join in the 
debate on the 1999 budget.  I will be sharing my time with one of 
my colleagues, the member for Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the hon. Minister of Finance for putting forward 
a budget that addresses the needs of Canadians.  This is a budget 
we can all be proud of.  Today I will use my time to speak 
briefly to three themes in the budget.  I want to make sure my 
constituents who are watching this debate get some facts directly 
from the budget.  I will address the issues of health care, 
knowledge, innovation and tax relief as outlined in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the support of strategies to enhance quality health 
care for Canadians and the support to families and individuals in 
our tax system are essential for the growth of 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore and for all communities across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget '99 is not an end in itself.  It is a continuation of the 
federal government's commitment to building a strong, secure 
future for all Canadians.  My constituents are pleased with 
budget '99 and agree that the government has taken yet another 
step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past year my constituents have been saying to me that 
they would like to see the budget surplus used for deficit 
reduction, health, research and development, and tax relief among 
other things.  In my consultations with them, those were the 
issues that kept coming to the top. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the budget the federal government has delivered on their 
priorities without borrowing a single penny.  I was pleased to 
share that with my constituents.  Despite new investments in 
social and economic priorities, the federal government has not 
swerved in staying the course in sustaining sound fiscal 
management.  This is what all of us in the House want our 
government to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 when the government took office the budgetary deficit 
stood at $42 billion.  The state of Canada's fiscal house was in 
poor shape.  The federal government had a major task in balancing 
the books and restoring the confidence of Canadians in our 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents were concerned.  The phone calls and the round 
table discussions we held all expressed their concern about the 
deficit.  In 1998, when we delivered a budget that eliminated the 
deficit and balanced the books for the first time in 28 years, we 
were pleased and proud to share that with every individual who 
sat around the table and moaned with us about the $42 billion 
deficit we were in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the policy of sound, prudent fiscal management pursued by 
the federal government has put our economy on the right track for 
the benefit of all Canadians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget '99 continues the course.  It continues to build on this 
comprehensive plan for creating a strong economy and a secure 
society.  On this side of the House we believe that our young 
people deserve to inherit a country that is fiscally robust and 
capable of meeting the challenges of the next century.  As we 
head into that next century the fiscal outlook of Canada is 
positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we listened to our finance minister on budget day, all 
Canadians got the sense of renewed optimism about the economic 
viability of our country.  In budget '99 the federal government 
will again balance our books.  For the first time since 1951-52, 
the government has been deficit free for two consecutive years. 
The federal government will remain committed.  We heard our 
Minister of Finance speak to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999-2000 budget and the 2000-01 budget are again recording 
consecutive balanced budgets. The fiscal policy of the government 
continues to put the debt to GDP ratio on a permanent downward 
track.  Again, this pleased my constituents.  This is of 
tremendous significance to them simply because balanced budgets 
and a decline in the debt to GDP ratio means that the government 
can free up resources to strengthen our health care system, 
provide tax relief, invest in a more productive economy and a 
higher standard of living by promoting access to knowledge, 
research and innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget '99 also preserved our health care system by securing 
high quality, equitable health care for all Canadians.  The 
budget sets us on a course that speaks to the highest possible 
quality of health care and other tools that will make healthy 
lifestyles and healthy lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health agreement reached in last month's first ministers 
conference and the new social union framework shows Canadians 
that the federal and provincial governments will pursue a common 
vision that puts health and quality of life first.  We know that 
the prosperity of any nation depends on the health of its 
citizens.  It has a direct bearing on how well Canada is situated 
in the global economy and ultimately the future of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In budget '99 the federal government reaffirmed to all Canadians 
that sustaining and strengthening health care is one of its key 
priorities. My constituents know the total number is $11.5 
billion and they are very much aware of the $3.5 billion that 
will be provided immediately as a one time supplement which the 
provinces will have the flexibility to draw upon according to 
their needs and priorities.  In the province of Ontario we know 
the importance of that immediate $3.5 billion and what it will 
create for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the weeks leading up to the budget, my constituents asked me 
over and over to ensure that the federal government addressed the 
problems of crowded emergency rooms, long waiting lists, shortage 
of diagnostic services, et cetera.  As the media portrayed the 
upcoming budget as a health budget, there was more and more 
anxiety by constituents to ensure that these issues were 
addressed.  This health budget is welcome news for the people of 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore.  Ontario will also be receiving other 
moneys.  It will receive a $4.4 billion investment in health care 
to encourage the government to make fundamental improvements to 
Ontario's health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Making decisions about one's health requires one to be given the 
information and the tools to make positive decisions and choices. 
I want to ensure that my constituents understand where some of 
the dollars will go in terms of initiatives to enhance the flow 
of health information.  A national health surveillance network 
will be built which will electronically link laboratories and 
public health offices across the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents also need to know that we are establishing the 
Canada health network, accessible by computer and telephone and 
enabling Canadians everywhere to have direct access to objective, 
reliable, up to date information on a range of health issues and 
providing better reports on the health of Canadians and the 
functioning of the health system.  Those initiatives are 
consistent with the government's commitment on health and are a 
concrete step to strengthening medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget '99 takes action on many fronts.  It builds on the 
Canadian opportunities strategy by investing more than $1.8 
billion over the remainder of this fiscal year and the next three 
years in the creation, the assimilation, the commercialization of 
knowledge and in support of employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is just so much this budget has addressed that it would 
take minutes more to delineate the many positive items in this 
budget.  I call on all of my colleagues as they debate this 1999 
budget that they recognize the issues, that they recognize the 
measures which are in there and that they recognize the way in 
which this budget has addressed the concerns of Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
a comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been taken aback at the praising of the budget and the 
praising of how great it is that this money is going back and 
everybody is cheering the government.  I have sat here and 
thought that of course everybody is happy because there is money 
going back into health care. The government has cut $20 billion 
out of health care.  It is finally putting something back in.  Of 
course we are going to be happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as if there has been a war going on.  This is a war.  The 
Liberal government has attacked and waged war on social programs 
in Canada with all the cuts. We had the Korean war, the first 
world war and the second world war.  The war ends and of course 
we are all going to cheer and be excited.  But that does not mean 
we are going to sing the praises of Hitler, our enemy, or anybody 
else who has been attacking those programs.  We are going to make 
darn sure we keep fighting for what is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think I will comment 
on the comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not want to use the analogy of war.  I tend to be a 
peaceful person and therefore I would like to see the positives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tried to speak to my constituents about what budget '99 has in 
it for them.  We know that cuts had to be made.  We know that we 
started in 1993 with a $42 billion deficit and some things had to 
be done.  What we have done at this point in time is we have 
tried to address some issues and to move forward.  Budget '99 has 
indeed moved the agenda forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the hon. member for Etobicoke—Lakeshore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget the fundamental problem with the government's 
approach is that it ignores the best approach to increase the 
business investment needed to improve productivity:  lower 
business taxes and a lower regulatory burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Liberals took office in 1993, corporate income tax 
revenue has more than doubled.  Many of these taxes do not even 
depend on whether or not a corporation is profitable.  The 
federal Department of Finance estimates that 70% of taxes that 
business pays are not related to any profit.  Meanwhile, 
according to the Conference Board of Canada, of every single 
dollar in extra profit made by corporations over the past 30 
years, a full 62 cents is clawed back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member, if the government were truly concerned with 
productivity and jobs, would it not address the heavy tax burden 
that discourages needed business investment in this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy that I was 
able to give the member the opportunity to read into this debate 
the concerns that he has in the books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we are addressing some issues that we have advanced from 
the 1998 budget into the 1999 budget.  If the member did spend 
the time to go through the documentation, he would see the 
progress that we have made from 1993 until now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to comment on a couple of issues that have come up in this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one has to do with personal income taxes.  Some 
members have suggested that there have been increases in taxes 
and that Canadians are paying more taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked back from 1993 and found that personal income tax 
revenue to the Government of Canada was $51.4 billion.  In the 
current year ended March 31, 1999, personal income tax revenue 
will rise to $73.7 billion.  Next year it is expected that it 
will further rise another $1.3 billion to $75 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that personal income tax revenue is 
increasing in Canada, but since the time that the government took 
office in 1993, there are 1.5 million more employed Canadians 
paying income tax.  There have been no increases in personal 
income tax rates.  There have been no increases in personal 
taxes.  In fact, there have been decreases and I will mention a 
couple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child care expense deduction was increased from $5,000 to 
$7,000.  It is a direct savings for families with children.  The 
federal 3% surtax has been totally eliminated for all Canadians. 
It is a savings in taxes to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic amount, the non-refundable tax credit, has been 
increased by $675 for all Canadians, a significant increase.  It 
deals directly with the issue of bracket creep and indeed will 
cover any impact of bracket creep for an additional three years. 
If the member would like to know what bracket creep is, it is 
basically inflate that exemption portion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic exemption for a Canadian is about $6,500.  Inflation 
in Canada last year was at a rate of 1%.  One per cent of $6,500 
is $65.  At the tax credit rate it means the member is talking 
about an impact of $16. That is not a significant amount.  It is 
not the number the members are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition there are non-taxable benefits that Canadians have 
received.  The $1.7 billion invested in the Canadian child tax 
benefit is directly related to low income Canadians who need help 
with their children. Important changes were also made to things 
like RESPs. A government grant of up to $400 per year, per child 
was available to invest in the education of our children.  These 
are very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance premiums were reduced.  They were going 
up to $3.30.  Today they are $2.70.  It was a $2.8 billion 
decrease in employment insurance revenue to the government 
because of the reduction in those rates to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains that 600,000 Canadians no longer pay tax as a 
result of the tax deductions delivered by the Government of 
Canada, by the Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there is program spending on matters such as 
prenatal nutrition to deal with fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal 
alcohol effects, programs such as CAPC that help children who are 
at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud of the government's budget.  I am very proud of 
the benefits and the programs it has bought, particularly for 
families with children.  I look forward to the debate tomorrow 
when this comes up because I think Canadians will understand that 
the Liberal Government of Canada has children in mind first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the member 
whether he would answer one question.  There is one minute for 
that.  Could I do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The answer is no, the time is up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 6.15 p.m., it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings 
and put forthwith every question necessary to dispose of ways and 
means motion No. 19.

the Minister of National Defence stated that the federal 
government would bring about an outcome where the lands would be 
used for the benefit of the people of the province and to create 
economic development opportunities so that jobs can be created. 
That is what the minister said in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, our government remains 
committed to making the most of the surplus property and the 
associated potential economic benefits at Shearwater Canadian 
forces base.  The transfer of the surplus property has begun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since reducing its activities on the airfield, the department 
has done its best to maintain the property's viability, pending 
an official transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a local development agency, Shearwater Development 
Corporation has had some successes, including the Fisherman's 
Cove project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shearwater Development Corporation is no longer in the picture, 
but the tenants, which are still operating commercially on the 
property, are being accommodated to the extent possible by the 
base commander. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Province of Nova Scotia is interested in acquiring the 
surplus property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Province of Nova Scotia and Public Works and Government 
Services Canada, representing the Department of National 
Defence, are now negotiating the transfer of the surplus 
property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the request of the Nova Scotia government, negotiations are 
taking place behind closed doors.  Information on the 
transaction will, however, be released when an agreement has 
been signed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic impact of the Shearwater transfer has always been 
the prime concern of national defence.  As the Minister of 
National Defence previously stated in the House, our main 
objective with these negotiations is to use lands that are no 
longer required by the department for the benefit of the people 
of that province and that community and to create economic 
development opportunities so that jobs can be created there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to remember that the Canadian forces still have 
a strong operational requirement for the land we are retaining. 
Moreover, there are some 1,000 military and civilian personnel 
who operate out of the site and the resulting economic benefits 
cannot be overlooked.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on February 8, I raised in the House some critical 
health care situations.  I asked the Minister of Health to inform 
Canadians how he was prepared to address the growing crisis in 
our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised the issue of a Windsor individual who was asked to 
leave the hospital after tonsil surgery, bleeding and vomiting. 
He wanted to know why he had to be discharged that first day.  I 
asked the minister why cancer patients in Ontario were being 
shipped to the United States for treatment.  At that time the 
Minister of Health suggested that these were provincial issues 
and that he could not interfere with those decisions.  In fact, 
he abdicated full responsibility for those critical situations. 
That was before the budget.  That was on February 8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question for us all today, especially since the government 
has just approved its so-called health care budget, is has the 
situation changed at all.  Will people facing these horrific 
situations be any better off?  It would seem to me that the 
answer to all these questions is essentially no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government took office in 1993 it slashed and froze 
money for health care.  Every day now we see the results of those 
health care cutbacks.  Emergency room line-ups still exist today. 
We see pressure and stress on our nurses who are overworked and 
overburdened.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see delayed surgical procedures and we see growing 
privatization of medical services.  Will the health budget undo 
the damage?  It does not appear so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question for us all today is what steps will this government 
now take to ensure that all Canadians regardless of where they 
live are able to enjoy quality of health services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that question, the minister also suggested that the solution 
was not with the Reform Party which is promoting a two tier 
privatized health care system.  On that point I will agree, 
having just a few weeks ago been in Windsor, Ontario where the 
Reform candidate actually stood up in a public debate and said we 
must end the public monopoly on health care.  That says it all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of weeks ago at the united alternative conference, 
Reformers refused to allow for a resolution that would ensure 
national standards and raise the desire to allow provinces to 
implement user fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the solution is not with Reform's Americanized version 
of health care.  I ask the parliamentary secretary today how they 
intend to pursue ending privatization of our health care and 
pursue their ideas for a national home care plan and a national 
drug plan. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this government stands committed 
to the principles of the Canada Health Act, as I have stated on 
numerous occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that access to necessary services should be based on 
health need and not on one's ability to pay.  There is very 
clearly a constitutional responsibility for the provinces to 
deliver services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a responsibility for the provinces to do the 
planning and the managing of the resources in their provinces. 
The problems the member has identified are a result of stresses 
and strains the provinces have had over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the budget of February 16 we have seen the biggest single 
investment this government has ever made, some $11.5 billion over 
the next five years.  The budget clearly demonstrates this 
government's commitment to defending medicare.  We are also 
defending access to quality care and ensuring that care is given 
to all those who need it regardless of their ability to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the hon. member that over the next five years 
$11.5 billion will be available.  What is needed is more than 
money.  What is needed is a more accountable, more integrated way 
of delivering services.  The federal government has shown a 
leadership role in bringing together all the provinces, arriving 
at a health agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the member who has raised the principle of public 
administration that the NDP would have government run everything 
under the mandate of public administration. What we have in 
Canada today is a publicly funded but not government run method 
of delivery.  The provinces have stewardship but they determine 
what partnerships they will engage, the corporate structures of 
their hospitals and their providers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people are dissatisfied with the way their health system has 
evolved, they must go to their provincial governments and say 
they are dissatisfied.  Each province has done it differently and 
that is appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role for the federal government is one, an important funding 
partner and two, the guardian of the Canada Health Act. We want 
to ensure that health services and the outcomes therefore are 
more accountable and the provinces develop a real system, more 
integrated models where people work together to ensure that when 
the people of Canada need care, they will get the care they need 
without having to pay for it.

have been adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
