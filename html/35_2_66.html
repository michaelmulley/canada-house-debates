	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-320, an act to amend the Merchant Navy 
Veteran and Civilian War-related Benefits Act and the War 
Veterans Allowance Act.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this bill is introduced to ensure that 
wartime Canadian merchant navy veterans will henceforth receive 
equal standing, rights, privileges and benefits to those afforded to 
all Canadian navy, army and air force war veterans.
<P>
	Current legislation limits recognition of merchant navy service 
benefits to service on a high seas voyage. This bill will address this 
injustice by amending the definition of ``high seas voyage'' under 
the Merchant Navy Veteran and Civilian War-related Benefits Act 
to include all areas where actual attacks by the enemy occurred.
<P>
	The bill will also clarify the measurement criteria for time of 
commencement and termination of service for the eligibility of 
merchant navy war veterans.
<P>
	Current legislation excludes merchant navy service benefit 
eligibility from time of capture or the involuntary termination of 
duty travel assignment which left them stranded overseas. For 
example, half of the merchant navy prisoners of war held in the Far 
East who were captured after landfall fell into this category.
<P>
	Further, this bill will amend the War Veterans Allowance Act to 
include merchant navy war veterans, thus ensuring them the same 
recognition and benefits provided to navy, army and air force war 
veterans.
<P>
	Time marches on and it is vital that Parliament moves now to 
correct these long overdue inequities before it is too late; the 
average age of merchant navy veterans is 76 years.

	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Mississauga East, Lib.)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-321, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (cumulative 
sentences).
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I stand again for those victims of multiple 
murderers and rapists who have been dismissed as irrelevant by 
Canada's justice system. My bill, seconded by the hon. member for 
Mississauga South, is a re-submission of Bill C-274 and calls for 
consecutive sentencing for serial and multiple murderers and 
rapists.
<P>
	I re-submit this bill today encouraged by the words of the 
Minister of Justice on Monday night in committee. He said: ``It 
seems to me that when we are dealing with someone who has taken 
more than one life we are entitled to take that into account''. He 
continued: ``I do not know why it is difficult to perceive the 
difference between a single offence and multiple offences. In terms 
of whether I would support consecutive terms for murderers, I 
might well''. So says the Minister of Justice, who indicated that he 
has encouraged policy work on the subject and who said it should 
be looked at.
<P>
	This bill offers the Minister of Justice and this Parliament the 
opportunity to defy the predator protection industry by ending 
volume discounts for rapists and murderers.

	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
believe if you were to seek it you would find unanimous consent 
for the following motion. I move that the House concur in the 23rd 
report of the Standing  Committee on Procedure and House Affairs 
tabled on June 19.
<P>

consent of the House to move the motion?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.)</B> moved that the 
22nd report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs, presented to the House on Tuesday, June 18, be concurred 
in.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I will be dividing my time with the 
member for Lethbridge.
<P>
	I have mixed emotions about bringing this motion forward to the 
House today. I feel it is necessary that it be done. On the one hand, I 
am very proud and happy to do it. It is an issue that has been 
verballing around now since the last referendum in Quebec. It is 
something that should have been brought to a head with the report 
from the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs and 
it was not.
<P>
	By not bringing this issue to a conclusion in the report, the 
Liberal majority in the House has allowed this to continue to 
percolate. The feeling of sadness I have about this is that this will 
come back to haunt us in the days and years to come.
<P>
	What happened is now a matter of public record. The member 
for Charlesbourg sent around a communique, now known as the 
Jacob communique. It asked members of the Canadian Armed 
Forces to consider joining up with the Quebec armed forces in the 
event of a yes vote. It was brought forward at a very tense time in 
Canada's history when, as members know, we came within a per 
cent of losing a very important vote to keep the country together.
<P>
	It is a matter of record that the communique was sent out 
indiscriminately to Canadian Armed Forces members. It asked 
them, I think, to contradict their oath of allegiance to Canada. It 
asked them to consider their position in a new Quebec army, an 
army that had not yet even been formed.
<P>
	Due to the diligence of the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, he brought this to the attention 
of the House and to the attention of the Speaker. You ruled, Mr. 
Speaker, this was a very serious matter and should be referred to 
the committee on procedure and House affairs to deal with.
<P>
	The reason I have mixed emotions about this is that I had hoped 
it would have been dealt with and that a contempt of Parliament 
would have been rendered. The reason I say this is that we will be 
dealing with this again in the next referendum campaign. No action 
has been taken by the House and by the committee. No action has  
been recommended against the member for Charlesbourg and no 
one here has found it necessary, now that the crisis is over, to give 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4145"> 4145 </A></B>
<P>
advice to the Canadian Armed Forces on how to handle its affairs in 
the future.
<P>
	When the crisis was on, it was called by the government whip 
``dangerously close to inciting mutiny in a moment of crisis''. It is 
now being sloughed off as ``it may be a mistake, but just let it go''. 
The Minister of National Defence said this was a serious matter 
and that we could not have members of the House saying those 
kinds of things. Those were the minister's own words. However, a 
few months later he says ``well, it is over now, let's just forget it''. 
That is unacceptable.
<P>
	It is unacceptable for the House to brush aside something that 
was dangerously close to mutiny and unacceptable behaviour, by 
the government's own admission, and then a few months later it 
says let us hope it does not happen again. It will happen again.
<P>
	The member for Charlesbourg says-
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have just heard my colleague 
accuse the member for Charlesbourg of treason, of breaking his 
oath of allegiance and of inciting mutiny. I would ask him to either 
withdraw his words or to make accusations right here in this House 
so that the case can be referred, as was the previous one, to the 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. Otherwise, there is a 
double standard here.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I did not hear the word traitor. I did not hear the 
word sedition. I heard that the minister said he was dangerously 
close to mutiny. I do not find these words to be unparliamentary.
<P>
	However, we are in a very emotional debate today and I caution 
all hon. members who are to take part in this debate to be very 
judicious in their choice of words. This applies to all members.
<P>
	I will not tolerate the word traitor in the House. I will not tolerate 
the word liar in the House. But I will give as much latitude as I can 
to all intervenors in this debate. As long as the terms are 
parliamentary and they are not offensive to the House, I will permit 
the debate to continue.
<P>
	This is not a point of order. I return to the hon. member for 
Fraser Valley East.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, you did not hear the word 
``treason''. The expression ``breaking the oath of allegiance'' was 
translated, in French, by ``trahison''. That is what we heard on this 
side. We therefore have a problem.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will review the blues when this is over. There are 
no blues right now and I do not intend at this point to take a break in 
the House. If those words were used I will come back to the House. 
I am listening to every word that is being said here today. I know 
the importance of this debate. I will proceed calmly and with the 
co-operation of all members. I now go to the member for Fraser 
Valley East.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize that emotions are high. I 
would like to set a couple of things straight for the members of the 
Bloc Quebecois as well.
<P>
	In their press conference yesterday there was talk that we had 
asked for the resignation of the member for Charlesbourg, that we 
had charged him with treason. That is not true. We have never 
asked for his resignation.
<P>
	We did ask, however, that Parliament find the member in 
contempt in committee. We did say that contempt does not mean he 
has to resign but that he could have a censure or that he could be in 
some way disciplined by the House of Commons. Certainly that is 
true, but we have never asked for his resignation, nor would we.
<P>
	There are things that happened in this committee that 
contributed to the headlines we see in the paper today. The 
headlines today say the report on this incident is a cop-out.
<P>
	I called it, in my press release, a whitewash. It is because we 
were not allowed to invite members of the armed forces to come in 
and testify on the impact this communique had on the armed 
forces. We were not allowed to bring expert witnesses like the 
advocate general from the armed forces to say in his opinion what 
could be done, what should be done in the future. That was 
disallowed by the Liberal majority.
<P>
	We heard from five people, from only House of Commons 
procedural people. Then this thing was dismissed.
<P>
	That is not an in depth study. It is not like we were charged to do 
by the House of Commons when we were given this communique 
originally. That is why this has turned into a cop-out, as the papers 
say, and a whitewash.
<P>
	We have come up with conclusions we think are obvious, given 
the testimony we heard. We would have been grateful to hear more 
testimony from the military personnel that we gave an extensive 
list to the committee.
<P>
	We have said, and we stand by our record, that the House should 
have found the member for Charlesbourg in contempt. It should 
have taken some action. It does not mean, as some members have 
interpreted, that he should resign his seat. I am not saying that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4146"> 4146 </A></B>
<P>
	However, some action should be taken or else this will happen 
again. The member for Charlesbourg says indeed it will happen 
again. He will do it again. That is what is wrong.
<P>
	There are no guidelines given to members. Next time there will 
not be one. I expect there will be 50 or 52 memos sent out from all 
members of the separatist group because why not? They got away 
with it last time so ``let us proceed and go with gangbusters''.
<P>
	It says in the Toronto <I>Star</I> again today: ``The defiant Bloc MP 
says he would send a memo to the soldiers again''. In other words, 
we will face this again. That is what is wrong here.
<P>
	The government has shirked its duty. It has allowed this thing to 
fester. It will fester to the next referendum. Will there be another 
referendum? Of course there will be. They said that. Mr. Bouchard 
has said that. We will face this again.
<P>
	We will ask our armed forces to go into this without any 
guidelines. They will be saying ``if we get 50 memos from 
separatist MPs on official letterhead, asking who knows what, we 
will have to accept it, I guess''.
<P>
	We do not have to accept it. We can say no to this. We could 
have. We could establish guidelines and we could ask the armed 
forces to put guidelines in place as well. It should have been done. 
It was not. That is what is wrong with the report. That is why it is a 
whitewash.
<P>
	We said he should have been found in contempt and that some 
action should have been taken. We were not even specific. It should 
have been done on a contempt charge. Then it could be anything 
from a censure, a slap on the wrist to apologizing for whatever 
happened. It could be anything, but he should have been found in 
contempt.
<P>
	We should have said there are guidelines now for members of 
Parliament in the future. The guidelines are necessary for members 
of Parliament. The guidelines are necessary because it is not like 
the member for Kingston and the Islands said, that this thing was 
just a joke. He said ``when I get this thing, I throw it in the garbage, 
it is just a joke''. We came within one per cent of losing the country 
last time. What kind of joke is that? It is no joke at all. It is serious.
<P>
	The people over here say let us forget about it, sweep it under the 
table and maybe it will not come back. We came to the edge of the 
cliff last time, one per cent away from the abyss. They are willing 
to say let us take our chances again. It is not acceptable.
<P>
	That is what is wrong with the whole plan over there on this 
national unity thing. The government does not have a plan. Because 
there is no plan, we will do this same thing again, only worse. That 
is the problem.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	They have not helped our Department of National Defence. 
There are no guidelines given to national defence. They are going 
to be asked to head into this next referendum campaign blind and 
handcuffed, pointed to the edge of the cliff and told: ``I hope you do 
not fall over''.
<P>
	It is not acceptable to ask armed forces personnel who have 
sworn an oath of allegiance to Canada to go into the next 
referendum campaign and hope they make it through okay. Our 
people in the armed forces deserve better, they deserve to be given 
help and guidance and we should have done that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to know not only if our colleague considers 
that the member for Charlesbourg has broken his oath of allegiance 
and has therefore betrayed his commitments to Parliament and 
Canada but if he also accuses him of those crimes? Is he accusing 
the member for Charlesbourg, or is what we are witnessing here a 
battle between federalists from both sides of this House?
<P>
	Are accusations being made or not?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> As I said earlier in the debate, I would not permit 
an accusation using the word traitor and I will not. This is a 
question and I am going to permit it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer to the member's question is 
no. I have not questioned the oath of allegiance of the member for 
Charlesbourg. I never did that in my initial presentation. We have 
never done that.
<P>
	The oath of allegiance I was talking about and which we have 
discussed at times is the oath of allegiance taken by members of the 
Canadian Armed Forces. That oath of allegiance states that they are 
to be loyal to Canada. In their guidelines it states they are not to 
entertain anybody approaching them to join other armed forces or 
to consider leaving their post.
<P>
	In other words, the oath of allegiance I was talking about is not 
the member's oath of allegiance, although I think that oath of 
allegiance is a bit of a lark in here. I am not questioning that at all. 
The oath of allegiance I am talking about is that of the Canadian 
Armed Forces, a solemn declaration to defend Canada. That is their 
oath of allegiance. That is what I was talking about and that is the 
issue which I think has been called into question here.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to hear that no 
accusations of treason and breaking the oath of allegiance are being 
made. I therefore conclude, and I fail to see how my colleague 
could conclude otherwise, that the Reform member was mistaken 
when he made accusations of sedition. I have difficulty imagining 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4147"> 4147 </A></B>
<P>
how someone could be seditious, and act accordingly without 
breaking his oath of allegiance and committing treason against his 
country. It is either one or the other. One cannot simultaneously 
commit treason, be seditious and abide by his oath.
<P>
	Our colleague having just said that the oath was not broken, will 
he admit today that his collegue was mistaken when he made 
accusations of sedition, unless of course he prefers to ignore logic? 
The people will judge; not only those in the House, not those in 
only in Quebec, but those in the rest of Canada. And they will come 
to the conclusion that Reform Party members make unfounded 
accusations without following rather elementary rules of logic.
<P>
	How can there be sedition if the oath of allegiance has not 
broken?
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are two issues here.
<P>
	One is the issue of sedition that the member brought forward. 
That issue of course was not given to the committee on procedure 
and House affairs to deal with. It was continually brought up by the 
Bloc but on the terms of reference that the House passed, and which 
you referred to us, we had to deal with the issue of contempt. I 
believe the member should have been found in contempt. I do not 
apologize for that. I believe that.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Contempt as brought to us by our legal counsel is anything that 
brings Parliament into shame, ridicule or disrepute, plus some 
other things. There are about seven categories. The communique 
does that and without a doubt it is, in my opinion and the opinion of 
our party, a contemptuous thing. That is why we disagree with the 
whitewash report.
<P>
	On the issue of sedition, the member's right has been dealt with 
in the courts and it could still be appealed through the courts. If 
they choose to do that I am not opposed to it. They may choose to 
appeal it but that is up to the courts. The sedition issue was never 
dealt with in our committee and I have never brought that specific 
charge because that is not what we were charged with.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope to 
speak to this motion as eloquently as my colleague did just now. I 
will be moving an amendment at the end of my speech.
<P>
	The Reform Party has expressed its opinion in its minority 
report. It feels very strongly, as my hon. colleague has stated here 
today, that the member for Charlesbourg is clearly in contempt of 
Parliament because he breached his privileges as a member of 
Parliament by sending a communique on the letterhead of the 
Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition to Quebec born 
members of the Canadian forces which  directly conflicted with the 
oath of allegiance to Canada sworn by the Canadian Armed Forces 
members.
<P>
	According to what constitutes a contempt of Parliament 
provided by Diane Davidson, general legal counsel for the House 
of Commons, who was a witness, the communique satisfies the 
requirement on eight counts. The communique, by contradicting 
the oath of allegiance and carrying the authenticity and legitimacy 
of the Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, violated the 
integrity of this House.
<P>
	The Reform Party maintains that the communique brought the 
House into disgrace, shame and ridicule. The latter are the first 
three categories enumerated by Davidson and meeting the 
requirement of any one of them amounts to a contempt of 
Parliament.
<P>
	The next two means of contempt cited are from Erskine May's 
definition: ``any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either 
House of Parliament in the discharge of its functions''.
<P>
	The Reform Party maintains that the discharge of the function of 
Parliament has been obstructed and impeded by the communique 
because it contradicted the oath of allegiance to Canada which 
came from Parliament and as sworn by the members of the 
Canadian Armed Forces. The communique impeded and obstructed 
the discharge of the function of the House to control the Canadian 
Armed Forces.
<P>
	The sixth means of contempt is achieved by so-called 
constructive contempt. It is ``misconduct of an indirect nature such 
as the publication of writings reflecting on the House''. The 
Reform Party believes that the communique reflected on the 
House, given the letterhead used of the Leader of the Official 
Opposition, and was a misconduct because it contradicted the oath 
of allegiance.
<P>
	Davidson cited the seventh way contempt is committed as that 
which is ``an affront to the House''. The Reform Party believes it 
was an affront to the House for members of the House to answer for 
this communique which the House as a whole was not provided the 
opportunity to prevent and would not have supported, given its 
contradictions to that oath of allegiance of the Canadian Armed 
Forces.
<P>
	The member for Charlesbourg took it upon himself to release a 
document which contradicted another document originating in this 
House, the oath of allegiance. He released the communique with all 
the authority of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition.
<P>
	Finally, the Reform Party believes that the communique has 
specifically undermined the institution of Parliament and brought it 
into disrepute, to use Davidson's words.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	The institution of Parliament was brought into disrepute because 
the Canadian Armed Forces members  were forced to compare the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4148"> 4148 </A></B>
<P>
communique to the oath of allegiance which it contradicted. Both 
documents came from the institution of Parliament, yet they 
conflict.
<P>
	The Reform Party agrees with Joseph Maingot, an expert witness 
on parliamentary privilege, who testified: ``The making of an 
informal charge by the member of the House does not constitute a 
breach of privilege''. He also said: ``The freedom of speech that 
you have in the House is a freedom which the Supreme Court of 
Canada has set out for over 100 years. The freedom is to bring forth 
any abuses''.
<P>
	The hon. member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt was 
exercising his right of free speech when he presented his 
substantive motion containing a specific charge as required in the 
House according to Maingot's testimony. You, Mr. Speaker, 
acknowledged the correct manner in which the matter was brought 
forth and proceeded to allow the House to deal with the matter. 
Further, Maingot underlined that the House collectively decided 
the matter was serious enough and forwarded it to the respective 
committee.
<P>
	Finally, Maingot assured the committee that the House of 
Commons has the power to determine contempt of Parliament. We 
have the power to freely interpret the terms of reference the 
committee was given and decide what level of contempt of 
Parliament has been committed.
<P>
	The Speaker of the House of Commons ruled that the question of 
the timing of the point of privilege raising this matter was moot. 
Matters relating to the timing of the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt's point of privilege were not a 
consideration as per the terms of reference for the committee.
<P>
	The committee has not accomplished the work that it had to do, 
as we see it. The problem we have here is that we are not preparing 
our country for the next secession debate. The committee has the 
duty and the responsibility to work toward making it very clear 
what the privileges of members of this House are in terms of 
enticing the Canadian Armed Forces during a secession debate.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is overjoyed with the work of the committee 
thus far. The committee has shirked its responsibility and skirted 
the issues in terms of addressing the issues that need to be 
addressed. Members of this House could very easily be provided by 
the committee with guidelines which would make it very clear 
what the proper conduct of members should be in terms of their 
communications with members of the Canadian Armed Forces as 
they relate to secession debates.
<P>
	The committee through the power of this House has the means to 
direct the defence department to provide our troops with policy 
guidelines that would assist them during the next secession debate.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois and the Liberals have tried to obfuscate the 
business and the work the committee has to do. The Bloc has tried 
to label this work into some kind of separatism on trial. Nothing 
could be further from the truth. There can be good work done by 
the committee.
<P>
	The government and the Bloc should be working toward 
preparing Canada for that next secession debate and taking a very 
responsible stand on the issue. In light of that, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That all the words after the word ``that'' be deleting and the following 
substituted therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>the 22nd report be not now concurred in but that it be recommitted to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs with instruction that 
they amend the same so as to recommend that, at a minimum, the House find 
the member for Charlesbourg in contempt of Parliament, and determine 
appropriate sanctions against the Member; and that in any secession 
referendum or negotiation the House shall be guided by the principle that any 
interference with the allegiance of members of the Canadian Armed Forces 
shall be considered behaviour unacceptable and a contempt of Parliament; 
and that the government instruct the Department of National Defence to draft 
policies and regulations to guide its members during any secession 
referendum or negotiation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The paper I have in my hand requires one very 
small correction. Does the hon. member have a copy of this in front 
of him?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would like to read to you the first ten words. I 
want to know if these are the words you want to use. I am quoting 
from this paper: ``That all the words after the word `that' be 
deleting-''.
<P>
	Do you mean ``be deleted'' or ``by deleting''? Would you please 
clarify that for me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would say ``be 
deleted''.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We will make that change. With that change I find 
the form of the amendment acceptable to the Chair. It will be 
received.
<P>
	It is to be noted this amendment is seconded by the hon. member 
for Saanich-Gulf Islands.
<P>
	We now have five minutes for comments and questions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened to my colleague mention a few times that 
the communique and the behaviour of the member for 
Charlesbourg who wrote that communique were contrary to his 
oath of allegiance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4149"> 4149 </A></B>
<P>
	Throughout the history of British parliamentary government, I 
believe there is a custom, at the beginning of each session, 
whereby some members in Westminster question the very 
existence of the monarchy. Up until now, this has been defeated. 
To a certain extent, this is tantamount to breaking one's oath of 
allegiance, but our institutions have never been looked at it that 
way until now. They have viewed it that way because, when one 
takes the oath of allegiance, one makes a commitment to abide 
by the laws of the land and carry out the mandate received from 
one's constituents.
<P>
	I would therefore ask my colleague if he thinks the member for 
Charlesbourg's behaviour is contrary to the oath of allegiance he 
has taken. If it is, it means he has not honoured his commitments. 
The oath of allegiance has therefore been broken, which clearly 
means that he is a traitor and an insurgent. If this is the case, let it 
be said unequivocally.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	Let everyone show their true colours. Let them tell Canadians: 
``See how the Reform Party is standing up, how it dares to say what 
you think''. That is what Reformers are constantly saying. Let them 
say it. It is not a problem for me. We will see what it leads to.
<P>
	Still, in politics, when you have beliefs, when you have 
convictions, these must be voiced. That is what we do, on this side 
of the House. We are not afraid to state our opinions or to act 
according to our principles. We say what we think and we act 
according to our convictions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, the House leader for 
the Bloc Quebecois would certainly like to lead me down that road 
and lay those kinds of charges.
<P>
	If the hon. member was listening he will know that it was very 
clearly stated in my remarks that the oath of allegiance was 
referring to the oath of allegiance by members of the Canadian 
Armed Forces. Those members of the Canadian Armed Forces in 
their oath of allegiance make a commitment to Canada and to serve 
Canada and not to leave their duties or responsibilities during that 
service and to protect us as citizens.
<P>
	It is the basic function of the federal government to ensure 
Canada has security with in the nation and security internationally. 
That is a basic function of the federal government. We expect the 
members of the armed forces to live up to that oath, commit to it 
and not to deviate from it.
<P>
	The communique that was sent by the 
loyal-supposedly-official opposition, in our opinion, said to 
members of the Canadian Armed Forces that they could leave the 
armed forces. At that time it created a conflict in the minds of 
members of armed forces, those who were Quebec born and others.
<P>
	They asked ``who am I loyal to?'' There was a conflict between 
the communique and the oath of allegiance of the Canadian Armed 
Forces. It was very obvious. There are many young men and 
women who are committed to serving the country. When they are 
presented with an order, edict or a communique from the House of 
Commons, the formal government of the country, the last appeal 
for Canadian people, can we not see their minds would be put into 
conflict? We feel that because of that there was a contempt of 
Parliament and certainly a conflict between the oath of allegiance 
of our people in the armed forces and that communique.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
be splitting my time with the member for Berthier-Montcalm.
<P>
	I am pleased to finally be able to express my views freely. For 
over three months now, I have been hearing all kinds of things and I 
have to say that I have sometimes heard falsehoods and rather poor 
interpretations of the facts.
<P>
	Let me state at the outset, particularly to the Reform members 
and to the member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, that if 
they believe a simple communique is capable of influencing 
members of the Canadian military to the point where they would 
actually desert and take their weapons with them, as the member 
suggested in this House, then they truly believe that members of 
the military are weak-minded. When the hon. member served in the 
armed forces, would he have been so weak-minded as to have been 
taken in by a mere communique? I do not think that we share the 
same opinion of members of the Canadian military, or of 
Quebecers who serve in Canada's armed forces.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	I find it odd as well when people like General John de Chastelain 
say that when constitutional change comes-therefore, when the 
yes side emerges victorious in the next referendum-members of 
the military will have to chose their allegiance. These are not my 
words, but those of the Chief of the Defence Staff.
<P>
	Even General Roméo Dallaire mentioned that, in the military, 
Quebecers were a true reflection of the rest of the population of 
Quebec, that there were even some sovereigntists. The member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands also said that there were separatists, as he 
put it, in the military.
<P>
	Yet, when a Bloc Quebecois member sends out a communique, 
the people in English Canada who consider themselves as being 
beyond reproach take umbrage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I just heard the 
member for Beaver River shout out ``treason, traitor'' in reference 
to the member for Charlesbourg. I ask that she withdraw her 
remarks.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4150"> 4150 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I did not hear these words 
uttered.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I repeat that neither I nor my table officers heard this word. 
However, the hon. member for Beaver River is in the House now. 
There have been remarks made toward what she said or did not say. 
If the hon. member for Beaver River would like to clarify the 
situation I invite her to do so.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did use the word and I withdraw.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jacob:</B> Mr. Speaker, regrettable things are said in the heat of 
the moment, and this is one such moment. However, when in the 
course of a debate, a person does not share the views of someone 
else, there is no need for him or her to sling insults at the other 
person, as we have seen happen.
<P>
	Let me give you an example of how easily Reformers are 
offended, in particular the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt. In 1994, the members of the 
defence committee visited several military bases, including two in 
Quebec, namely Saint-Hubert and Valcartier. In all of the bases that 
we visited in Canada, the briefings were conducted in English. As a 
francophone, I did not have the benefit of simultaneous 
interpretation, although someone was on hand to translate for us.
<P>
	The briefing in Saint-Hubert, near Montreal, was in English. 
Only at Valcartier was the briefing conducted in French. Let me 
quote to you the words of the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, as reported in the Pentiction 
<I>Herald</I>, to illustrate how easily offended one is if one is an 
anglophone. The paper reported that he had received a briefing in 
French.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``You can bet that if the situation were reversed there would have 
been screams of outrage''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	He was referring to us, and to how we would react to receiving 
briefings in English. That has always been the case and we have 
never complained. We are tolerant, but when we outline our 
position clearly, we are accused of all sorts of things.
<P>
	I could also quote several things the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt said in the course of the March 
12 debate. He referred to Diane Francis of the <I>Financial Post</I> and to 
the fact that Quebec anglophones have filed charges of slander 
against her, the guru of the Reform Party. Yet, she has called 
francophones racist, intolerant and traitorous and she has said that 
they should be either extradited or banished.
<P>
	The other Reform Party supporter, former General Louis 
Mac-Kenzie, compared Canada to Iran.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	Imagine making a comparison like that. If a Bloc Quebecois 
member had said such a thing, we would not have heard the end of 
it, but there is no problem when the words come from someone 
else's lips.
<P>
	In my opinion, and based on the findings of the procedure and 
House affairs committee, what took place here was essentially a 
political debate at the expense of a member, the aim being to pass 
judgment on the sovereignty program of my colleagues. 
Unfortunately, it was raised as a question of privilege, but could not 
be proved in committee.
<P>
	The Procedure and House Affairs Committee, with its Liberal 
majority, concluded that there was no evidence the privileges of the 
member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt had been 
breached. As for contempt or breach of privilege, I have to say that 
I was the one on the receiving end, as a result of the outrageous and 
false accusations brought against me by the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt. I saw my name splashed 
across the headlines: ``Jacob Headed for Jail'', ``Jacob To Lose His 
Seat'' and ``Jacob In Hot Water''. I will spare you some of the 
headlines in the English newspapers that were even worse.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me say that it is unfortunate Reformers have 
such selective memories. They claim that they never made any 
charges of sedition or issued a call to arms or violence. Just check 
in the March 12 issue of <I>Hansard</I>. The member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt did make all of these 
accusations. He was never able to back them up, which means that 
any member of this House is free to accuse a colleague, whether he 
is a member of the Liberal or of one of the other parties, without 
impunity.
<P>
	This is a serious violation of the freedom of expression of 
parliamentarians. As far as I know, I was democratically elected in 
my riding, just as they were, and the majority of people in my 
riding and in the province of Quebec accepted the communique at 
face value. After the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt made his outrageous remarks, 
I received insulting letters from anglophones and letters of support 
and encouragement from Quebecers.
<P>
	The explanation for this is that Reformers have never understood 
what happened in Quebec during the referendum. As the Bible 
says: ``Forgive them, for they know not what they do''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with keen interest to the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Not to mention astonishment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Yes, and astonishment. I have a couple of comments 
and maybe a couple of questions. I would like to answer to the 
charge by the hon. member that I presented this motion in a 
partisan or political fashion. I would like to say right here and now 
that this is one issue that crossed political party lines.
<P>
	I acted because I was asked to act on behalf of Canadians from 
coast to coast to coast who phoned, faxed and wrote me letters. 
They asked me at meetings to do something about this because the 
government would do nothing about it. That is why I acted and it 
crossed political boundaries. It went further than that.
<P>
	Joseph Maingot, who is undoubtedly the expert in Canada on 
parliamentary procedure, said in his testimony that I did things 
properly. The reason it went to committee is because I followed the 
rules given to an opposition member in this House of Commons. I 
followed the rules on behalf of Canadians and presented the motion 
in a proper fashion. There was nothing wrong in the way that 
motion was presented.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	I would also like to ask the member for Charlesbourg to explain 
to this House and to Canadians exactly what the oath of allegiance 
that our Canadian Armed Forces personnel take means to him. I 
would like him to keep in mind that 11 Canadian Armed Forces 
personnel serving in Bosnia were killed. I would like him to be 
cautious in his answer because there are people who have laid down 
their lives for this country on the oath of allegiance.
<P>
	Maybe he could explain why he dared to use the letterhead of the 
official opposition, Her Majesty's loyal and official opposition, to 
bring this House into disrepute. He used that letterhead to ask them 
to consider changing their allegiance.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to ask the member for Charlesbourg, if it 
was a normal press release, if it was a normal communique in the 
course of a member of Parliament's actions, why it did not follow 
the normal course, which would be to the media? It did not follow 
that course. It went directly to Canadian Armed Forces bases in the 
province of Quebec. That is not the normal route for a press release 
coming from a member of Parliament-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am loathe to cut off any member, but that was 
two and a half minutes and I want to give an equal amount of time 
to the member for Charlesbourg to answer, if he so wishes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jacob:</B> Mr. Speaker, the two questions raised by the member 
for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt were put to the Procedure 
and House Affairs Committee. I refuse to explain myself once 
again. If he hasn't understood by now, he never will.
<P>
	Secondly, to my knowledge, the communique makes no mention 
of the oath of allegiance and moreover, when questioned about this 
by committee members, the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt was vague. When a member of 
the armed forces swears an oath of allegiance, he stands by that 
oath for as long as he remains a member of the Canadian military 
and I don't believe anyone defected.
<P>
	I also find it odd that during one of his outbursts, he informed us 
that thousands of Canadians had called him and had come to the 
defence of Canadians. I mean no disrespect, but five months passed 
before he woke up. I don't know if these calls were late in coming 
or if he needed time to understand. I'm sorry, but the referendum 
took place last October 30. I worked with the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt for two months on the National 
Defence and Veterans Affairs Committee. There was never any 
mention made of the communique. Was he merely slow to come to 
this realization all by himself, or did someone put ideas in his 
head? I have to wonder.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find the members of the Reform Party have quite some 
nerve, this morning, to once again raise the issue of this report in 
the House when it has already been tabled, when minority reports 
have been tabled. How can they raise this matter in the House now, 
when we have been discussing it for three months. There were 25 
hearings on the subject.
<P>
	Why? Because, on March 12, a member of the Reform Party rose 
to convince you, Mr. Speaker, of the great importance of this issue. 
He rose on a question of privilege and said: ``I have a specific 
charge and a substantive motion''. What was his question? What 
was his charge? He said: ``In the opinion of the House, is the hon. 
member for Charlesbourg guilty of sedition?'' This was what gave 
rise to the debate on March 12.
<P>
	What prima facie evidence did the member have? He said in this 
House that the member for Charlesbourg had sent a call to desert 
the Canadian military, that this communique was sent to 
francophones, that it was a call to arms and that it asked men and 
women who have pledged allegiance to this country to desert the 
Canadian Armed Forces with their weapons. These are serious 
charges.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	They are so serious that, in a ruling on March 12, you said, and I

Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to put his motion before the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This was your ruling, Mr. Speaker. Could you have decided 
otherwise at the time? Probably not, because you had prima facie 
evidence, through accusations that we could now call unfounded 
but could not be verified at the time. You therefore said the 
question of privilege was in order and that is why a committee 
looked into this matter.
<P>
	Why do I find they have quite some nerve today? Because after 
three months, we should conclude that the member deliberately and 
knowingly misled the House.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, in three months-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please.
<P>
	I think I heard in French the words ``induit'' and ``sciemment'', 
which in English mean ``deliberately, knowingly and in error''.
<P>
	I would ask my colleague to withdraw what he said and to use 
others words. Would the hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm 
please withdraw what he said?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I have a lot of respect for the 
Chair, I take back what I said. So I come to the conclusion that the 
member made these allegations unwittingly.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The member took back what he said, and this is 
enough for me. I invite him to go on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, before I was interrupted, I was 
quoting the very precise charges the member laid, unwittingly, 
before the House. These charges are extremely serious and you 
ruled that they were in order.
<P>
	However, after three months and 25 days of hearings, and after 
hearing the testimony of experts and of the member who laid the 
charges, who came before the committee to explain during two 
days of hearings, what did we learn? We learned that the charges 
were unfounded, that there was not one shred of evidence, that 
these were unwarranted charges. That is all. Two whole days.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur: </B>He had two days to prove his case, but he did 
not. However, we learned a few things during those two days, while 
the member who laid the charges was appearing before the 
committee. We learned that in November, after the famous 
seditious communique, the member sat five times with the member 
for Charlesbourg on the defence committee without ever raising 
that  question. If this was seditious on March 12, why was it not 
seditious in November 1995? Why did he accept to sit beside 
somebody who had been seditious in Parliament? Because his 
charges were unfounded, that is why.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	We also learned something else. On November 21, 1995, when 
for the first time, the Deputy Speaker of the House heard charges 
brought against the member for Charlesbourg, in a statement that 
was not directly related to that matter, but which charged the 
member for Charlesbourg with having issued a seditious 
communique, do you know what he did? He wrote to him. Mr. 
Kilgour, the Deputy Speaker of the House, wrote him a note telling 
him to be careful, that the charges he was bringing against the 
member for Charlesbourg were extremely serious, that he should 
consult the clerk of the House as well as legal counsel.
<P>
	Guess what we learned. The member never consulted anybody, 
no counsel whatsoever, before laying those charges. Why did he lay 
those charges on March 12? It was two weeks before a byelection, 
that is why.
<P>
	He was unable to prove a single allegation. He neglected to 
obtain legal counsel, to consult professionals in this House who 
could have advised him, guided him correctly so that he would not 
breach the privileges of one of his colleagues, a man 
democratically elected to defend the interests of Quebec.
<P>
	Quebecers want to get all the information that is available. 
Quebecers too are members of the Canadian Armed Forces, they 
are not only francophones, they are not only anglophones. Within 
the ranks of the Canadian Forces based in Quebec, there are 
francophones as well as anglophones.
<P>
	He even admitted that he had been careless when he said that the 
communique was intended for francophones only. I think he did not 
even take the time to examine the communique sent on October 26 
by the member for Charlesbourg.
<P>
	We also learned that the member knew practically nothing about 
the referendum context, that he had not even read Bill No. 1, the 
Act concerning Quebec's future where it is clearly written that a 
sovereign Quebec would have its own armed forces. He had 
neglected to read the tripartite agreement signed by Mr. Bouchard, 
Jacques Parizeau, then Quebec's premier, and Mario Dumont. He 
forgot to read it. He did not know-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Mario who?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mario who, he asked. See, Mr. Speaker, three 
months after the fact, they still do not know who Mario Dumont is 
and what is meant by tripartite agreement concerning the future of 
Quebec. As if Reform members had not already wasted enough of 
Canadians' and Quebecers' time, they continue to raise the Jacob 
issue in the House whereas, for us, the matter is closed. We are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4153"> 4153 </A></B>
<P>
turning a new leaf. It is true that they do not know what they are 
doing, that they are making extremely rash accusations.
<P>
	But one thing is sure. One of us has been wronged. As you were 
saying on March 12, the accusations made were of an extremely 
grave nature. Today, we know, since the Liberals' majority report 
says so, that there was no contempt of Parliament, there was no 
question of privilege. However, we all know that the member's 
partisan accusations have undermined the parliamentary privilege 
of the hon. member for Charlesbourg.
<P>
	And what happens today? The government is making itself the 
accomplice of Reformers by refusing to tell the member that he 
was not careful in establishing his proof before making 
accusations, that he made accusations without checking the facts.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	At least, and that is what we ask for in our conclusion, in the 
recommendations, the member should apologize publicly not only 
to the member for Charlesbourg but also to all his parliamentary 
colleagues, because what he has done on March 12 to the member 
for Charlesbourg, he could do again tomorrow to the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell; the next day, it could be the 
member for Outremont or the member for Québec-Est. Will we 
allow such things to take place in this House?
<P>
	Freedom of expression, freedom of speech, is sacred. We asked 
that the member apologize to my colleague for Charlesbourg, to all 
the parliamentarians, but also to the people of Quebec and the 
Canadian people.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member who just spoke did some very emotional finger pointing 
on this whole issue.
<P>
	The issue that the member for Macleod and myself are really 
concerned about is this. There was a referendum. A question was 
posed during the referendum. That question was ambiguous. It 
indicated or implied that if it was a yes that the Quebec government 
would negotiate for a year for some kind of association and give the 
federal government a year's time in which to do everything. Yet the 
letter written by the member, which is what this whole motion is all 
about said, implied, indicated that the day after a yes vote, it was 
time to move on over; the day after switch your allegiance.
<P>
	Was the question in the referendum misleading and was it all 
along the intent of the Bloc Quebecois to declared Quebec 
sovereign the day after a yes vote?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, concerning the referendum question, I  would like to say 
to the House that because the Reform members did not understand 
the referendum question, that does not mean that it is necessarily 
complicated. I think Quebecers have understood very well the 
referendum question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> And 50 per cent said no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Yes, that is true, there are people who said no 
but they did not do so because they did not understand the question. 
If that is the way you see it, that is your problem.
<P>
	The question was clear. In fact, it was so clear that we had a 
federalist wave of love on October 27 because everybody 
understood that if Quebecers said yes, Quebec would then be 
sovereign. Negotiations would start the very next day and the Act 
on Quebec's future would be taken into account. The tripartite 
agreement was very clear. The process was understood by 
everybody. It was very clear. There was talk of partnership. It was 
very clear.
<P>
	As for the communique, since it is what we are discussing today, 
the communique from the member for Charlesbourg was also very 
clear. They were trying so hard to find a hidden agenda and the 
action they took was so partisan, as the member for Charlesbourg 
said, that it took them about five months to decide do to something 
about the communique which was, according to them, so seditious.
<P>
	I know there is a time differential between the west and the 
province of Quebec but I do not think it is five months. I do not 
think I need to go on about this issue. It was extremely clear and the 
only people who understood nothing are at the far end of the House 
and will stay there a long time, I think, because they understand 
nothing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We have approximately two minutes. I will 
permit another question or commentary for one minute and then I 
will permit the rebuttal by the member.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to address three points. The member for 
Berthier-Montcalm indicated that in his opinion, the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt sent this matter to the 
committee. That is, in fact, incorrect.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you heard the charge and decided there was a prima 
facie case. The House debated it and it was sent to the committee 
by 295 members of Parliament, not by one man.
<P>
	Second, ostensibly the reason the member for Charlesbourg sent 
that communique to the Canadian forces bases was to advise 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4154"> 4154 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec members of the armed  forces that if there was a yes vote, 
there would be a job waiting for them in the Quebec army.
<P>
	The member also clearly mentioned that Bill 1 spells out the fact 
that there was going to be a Quebec army if Quebec became a 
separate country. Why then was it necessary to send that 
communique?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is at least one person who 
seems to have understood certain things. And coming from a 
Reform Party member, that is not so bad.
<P>
	Indeed, the House made a decision and referred the motion to a 
committee. However, the accuser is a Reform member. The one 
who made the accusations is a Reform member and if I use that 
word to describe him, it is because in my mind someone who 
makes accusations is an accuser. But I will not tell you what I call 
someone who is unable to produce evidence.
<P>
	If Reform members had read the tripartite agreement and the Act 
on Quebec's future, they would not have asked the questions they 
are asking today because it was clear. I say again: following a yes 
vote, we would have an army in Quebec. But in French, ``au 
lendemain de'' does not mean ``the day after''.
<P>
	That is an example of Canada's duality. It is another proof. We 
are two solitudes. We say something in French and it is interpreted 
by anglophones in a way that suits them. It has always been like 
that in Canada. Next time, in the next referendum, if there is a 
lesson to be learned from all this, it is that if we write that kind of 
communique, we will send it with explanatory notes just for the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have no intention of debating this issue at length.
<P>
	First of all, we know that a charge was brought before this 
House. Subsequently, a motion was introduced and amended 
because it led to a charge and dealt essentially with the lack of 
authority of the House. Some of those responsible for bringing 
these charges even recognized this later. The resolution or motion 
as amended was examined by a parliamentary committee. A total 
of 25 public hearings were held and, by the way, most of them were 
televised. Canadians were able to hear both, or should I say all 
three, sides of the story.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We sometimes say that there are three sides to every story, yours, 
mine and the facts. In this case, yours, mine and the facts can really 
express what occurred quite well.
<P>
	This morning we heard comments from Reformers on the report 
prepared by the committee. They say that government members 
were in complicity with the Bloc.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	We heard the Bloc members say the Liberal members on the 
committee were in complicity with the Reform. As I said, Mr. 
Speaker, the two parties across could be described as yours, mine 
and this side, the facts, because that is what we provided in our 
answer.
<P>
	Having listened to the debate this morning on this concurrence 
motion, I cannot help but marvel at our rules of Parliament and the 
over 1,000 years it took to develop these rules, both at Westminster 
and here. These rules date back even prior to 1066, to the witans 
and others who preceded the parliamentary system of democracy 
that we have and the evolution of that process which made it such 
that throughout the years we have felt, although not my wisdom nor 
that of members who are here, although some have been here far 
longer than I and have far greater wisdom, and throughout the years 
we have developed processes whereby these issues are dealt with in 
a parliamentary committee in a more detached way than they are 
here in the House of Commons.
<P>
	As the member for Lethbridge said, in dealing with those issues 
in that parliamentary committee they are dealt with in a more 
civilized manner, and I agree with him. He is a former speaker of a 
legislative assembly, no pun on the name, although there perhaps 
have been in many cases in the past. We have also all agreed that 
was the way to do it. I congratulate those who had the wisdom to 
develop that and I marvel at our system which has made it that way.
<P>
	Today we see why this kind of issue cannot be resolved on the 
floor of the House and why it has to be detached one notch into the 
parliamentary committee with a narrower term of reference. We 
took the original motion which, admitted later, was inappropriate, 
and narrowed it. We brought it to committee and listened to all the 
experts.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> All the experts?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Yes, all the experts. We had 25 hearings on the 
issue. We had more hearings on this one issue than we had on the 
combination of dealing with the throne speech, the budget, the 
privatization of our railroads and half a dozen other things put 
together.
<P>
	What, in its wisdom, did the committee conclude? It concluded 
there was not a case of contempt of Parliament.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
That the actions of the member for Charlesbourg did not constitute 
a breach of parliamentary privilege.
<P>
	But that does not mean the hon. member should be congratulated 
for what he did. Quite the contrary. Many, myself included, 
disapproved of the content of the press release. I feel that the 
member acted imprudently in sending out a press release like this, 
but this is not to say that his actions constituted a breach of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4155"> 4155 </A></B>
<P>
privilege, something which has a very specific meaning. We all 
approached the matter from this perspective.
<P>
	Certain Reform Party members even asked some highly relevant 
questions in committee.
<P>
	For example, I am thinking about the colonel, the member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands, who himself asked some questions. He also 
spoke to the committee about what was relevant, and what was not. 
Some Reform Party members even told us that they were not 
talking about sedition or about a call to arms. I heard some Reform 
members say this. We saw that, at some point, the focus shifted.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> There was no basis for such a 
charge.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Correct. The charge may not have been founded, 
but that does not mean the release was OK, justifiable. Nothing of 
the sort.
<P>
	I for one did not like it and I think it should not have been sent 
out.
<P>
	Earlier on, mention was made of the fact that the French and 
English versions of the communique were given different 
interpretations.
<P>
	I did not write the communique in either language. The member 
for Charlesbourg or the people acting on his behalf are the ones 
responsible for drafting it. The two versions of the press release 
were not identical. The committee agreed that the two versions 
were not identical and that one version was worse than the other. 
The English version was the more pointed of the two.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	The committee agreed that the English version contained a 
reference to ``the day after'', meaning the very next day, whereas 
the exact words used in the French version were ``au lendemain'', 
meaning at some time in the future. That is what the two versions 
say, not the versions translated by the Liberals or by Reformers, but 
those produced by the member himself.
<P>
	The committee spent many hours reviewing this matter. I truly 
feel that members on all sides of the House did a reasonable job.
<P>
	That being said, Reform members concluded that the Liberal 
members, the majority on the committee, who helped write the 
report were in cahoots with the Bloc Quebecois, while the Bloc 
members felt the Liberals were in league with the Reform Party.
<P>
	That is ridiculous. As my colleague for Simcoe North said, what 
the two parties have hinted at is impossible. We cannot be in 
cahoots with both of them. Nothing of the kind happened. We gave 
our honest opinion and, Mr. Speaker, if you read our report you will 
see that we did our work conscientiously, and all Canadians can see 
this as well.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is no point in the people exercising themselves on the Bloc 
side of the House, pretending that one if not all are kind of modern 
day Louis Riels, and the people over there pretending they are 
Perry Masons of the 1990s in their accusations. Both these 
propositions are wrong. That is not was occurred and our report is 
clear as to what happened.
<P>
	There was not, in the opinion of the majority of the committee, a 
case of privilege. Neither was there a totally neutral and likeable 
press release. That is also wrong. I did not like it and I am one of 
the people, contrary to the Reform Party, who fought against the 
Bloc Quebecois and its option during the referendum campaign. I 
was there on October 27, my colleagues were there and the Reform 
Party was not.
<P>
	Canada came calling, Canada knocked at the door of the Reform 
Party and it was not even there. The lessons to take from it on my 
side are rather remote.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And I say the same thing to Bloc Quebecois members. The 
matter is closed, the referendum is over. Let us turn the page and 
get on with other things. We have presented our findings. The 
majority responsible for the report chose to side neither with the 
Reform Party nor with the Bloc Quebecois. It chose to make a fair, 
honest finding and that is what it did.
<P>
	Therefore, I consider the matter closed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the debate be now adjourned.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> When a motion for adjournment is put before the 
house we deal immediately with the motion for adjournment.
<P>
	On June 18, I received notice of a point of either privilege or 
order, however the member wants to put it, of an incident which 
allegedly occurred. I will hear more about it. I would propose to 
hear that point of privilege or order after three o'clock.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the motion will please say

Interparliamentary Group. The meeting was held in Alaska from

<P>
	The Canada-U.S. relationship is the most significant in the 
world. Daily two-way trade exceeds $1 billion and makes the 
Canada-U.S. trade relationship the largest in the world. Eighty-two 
per cent of all Canadian merchandise exports go south of the border 
and into the United States. The trade in goods and services between 
the two countries supports more than 1.5 million jobs in Canada 
and directly generates 25 per cent of Canada's GDP.
<P>
	Even with our strong and friendly relationship, there are still 
some irritants between our two countries. The Pacific salmon 
agreement, the Helms-Burton legislation, the split run magazines 
are just a few examples of where we differ in opinion and approach. 
Nevertheless, our annual meetings go a long way in helping both 
sides understand each other's point of view and may therefore lead 
to mutually acceptable resolutions.

	The 37th annual meeting was held with 55 delegates from the 
U.S. Congress and the Parliament of Canada. Twelve per cent of

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

early payments under the Advance Payments for Crop Act, APCA, 
for maple syrup and not the Department of National Revenue Act.
<P>
	For 1994, no applications for maple syrup were made under the 
APCA.
<P>
	In 1995, three organizations applied for and received guarantees 
under APCA: les Producteurs de sucre d'érable du Québec; la 
Fédération des producteurs acéricoles du Québec; and la 
Coopérative des producteurs de sirop d'érable du 
Nouveau-Brunswick.
<P>
	Les Producteurs de sucre d'érable du Québec was the only 
organization of the three to issue advances under the program. Its 
1995 guarantee on maple syrup was $6,000,000; to date advances 
for maple syrup have been issued only in Quebec.

<P>
	c) The APCA provides a loan guarantee to producer 
organizations to facilitate a loan from a financial institution for the 
purpose of making advance payments to individual producers for 
their crop in storage. This provides the producer with cash for the 
loan negotiated by the producer organization with the financial 
institution soon after harvest on the basis of crop in storage to allow 
the producer flexibility in marketing. The advances are repaid from 
sales as the crop is sold. There is no federal program expenditures 
under the act.

	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (for the Minister of Health, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendments proposed by the Senate to Bill C-8, an act respecting the 
control of certain drugs, their precursors and other substances and to amend certain 
other acts and repeal the Narcotic Control Act in consequence thereof, be read the 
second time and concurred in.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-8, the 
controlled drugs and substances act.
<P>
	This legislation was first introduced into the House of Commons 
in February 1994 with a view to respond to the need for 
consolidation and modernization of the existing drug control 
legislation, the Narcotics Control Act and parts III and IV of the 
Food and Drug Act.
<P>
	Bill C-8 will allow for better controls over drugs covered under 
these acts while listing new drugs and substances that are required 
under the three international conventions of the United Nations.
<P>
	Bill C-8 is an important component of Canada's drug strategy, a 
strategy based on the recognition that we must favour a balanced 
approach of both demand and supply reduction when dealing with 
substance abuse and misuse. In fact, 70 per cent of the funding 
under this drug strategy is dedicated toward education, prevention, 
treatment and rehabilitation. The remaining 30 per cent goes to law 
enforcement.
<P>
	The drug strategy aims to reduce the harm caused by drugs to 
individuals, to families and to communities. It is an effort by many 
partners to co-operate in dealing with Canada's problems of 
substance abuse. These partners include all levels of government, 
law enforcement agencies, professionals, voluntary organizations 
and community groups. Health Canada plays a leading role in the 
strategy.
<P>
	There is no simple solution to Canada's substance abuse 
problem. There are many programs in place, both inside and 
outside of government. Communities, provinces and territories 
have been working hard for a long time to reduce the demand on 
drugs and for drugs.
<P>
	Many professional and volunteer groups have played an 
important role in helping people learn about drugs. They also help 
people cope with problems caused by drugs and abuse thereof.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4163"> 4163 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Federal programs have also begun to stress even more the new 
drug law enforcement and crime prevention. A balance between 
reducing both demand for drugs and their supply in this regard is 
crucial.
<P>
	When Bill C-8 was referred to the subcommittee of the Standing 
Committee on Health all members of the subcommittee worked 
closely together to ensure the views of all were carefully 
considered. The subcommittee heard many witnesses and clearly 
examined the complexities of the legislation. There were 
representations from a broad spectrum of groups, organizations and 
individuals having an interest in the controlled drugs issues and 
legislation.
<P>
	The Senate committee on legal and constitutional affairs also 
took the necessary time to listen to a wide diversity of views.
<P>
	The government has taken very seriously the concerns expressed 
by witnesses at the hearings of the subcommittee of the House of 
Commons on the bill, as well as those put forward by hon. 
members from all parties in the House.
<P>
	Hon. members knows the consultative process is inherent in the 
parliamentary system. One of the strengths of that process is that it 
brings forward a range of opinions and perspectives.
<P>
	Some witnesses who appeared before the House of Commons 
committee were not only addressing the proposed legislation 
specifically but wanted to put broader issues on the agenda. That is 
why the subcommittee recommended in a separate report that the 
Standing Committee on Health undertake a comprehensive review 
of Canada's drug policy to examine those broader issues. This 
review will no doubt give members an opportunity to explore the 
many facets of drug issues, namely scientific, political, social, 
legal and economic influences of drug use and abuse.
<P>
	At the committee's hearings members of the Senate committee 
on legal and constitutional affairs also took note of the 
opportunities for the commercial cultivation of hemp in Canada. 
Hemp can be cultivated from varieties of cannabis sativa that 
contain a very low level of THC, tetrahydrocannabinol, the main 
psychoactive active ingredient in the plant.
<P>
	The committee was of the opinion that this plant should be 
considered by government for its potential commercial 
applications. For example, it noted that hemp can be used in 
textiles, paper production or sometimes as a wood substitute. 
Research authorizations have been granted in recent years to 
examine the issue of the viable commercial cultivation of hemp. 
The research is still ongoing. The analysis, as well, is continuing.
<P>
	Canada is learning more and more about hemp. One might 
conclude that Bill C-8 opens the door for future  products such as 
commercial hemp because it allows the government to create 
regulations for scientific, medical and industrial applications of 
listed controlled substances.
<P>
	The Senate committee made important amendments which will 
pave the way for the commercial activities involving hemp by 
facilitating its handling. Consequently, Schedule II to Bill C-8 has 
been amended to exclude cannabis stalks and fibre derived from 
such stalks from the application of the act. Although a licence will 
still be required to cultivate hemp, once harvested the stalks and 
fibre will not be subject to any form of control under the act.
<P>
	I will come back to the general aim of Bill C-8. We have to keep 
in mind the overall intent of Bill C-8 is the protection of Canadians 
against risks to their health. Illegally obtained and unsafe drugs are 
among the greatest risks to health. Substance abuse too often 
contributes to isolate an important segment of our population. We 
must equip law enforcement professionals with the tools and 
techniques needed to deal effectively with those who prey on the 
addicted. This bill, I believe, provides those tools. We must 
promote sound law enforcement if we are ever to advance the 
broader social goal of maintaining safe and peaceful communities. 
This bill provides the means for accomplishing that goal.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	As Canadians we believe children are entitled to grow up and to 
develop in a supportive and caring environment, one that spawns 
honest, healthy and productive lifestyles. The bill before us and the 
amendments with it in one way can help us to create such a climate 
for the children of Canada.
<P>
	Drug dependence is a complex issue requiring comprehensive 
medical, psychological and sociological approaches. There is clear 
benefit in treatment. However, the element of motivation on the 
part of the patient is essential successful treatment.
<P>
	Bill C-8 recognizes that drug dependence is also a health and 
social issue. It recognizes a positive approach to treatment 
programs for those affected by drug addiction. It supports the 
availability of help and appropriate treatment for those who want to 
get back their health and to resume a productive lifestyle.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Many people, at one time or another, develop a serious 
dependency on medication or drugs sold illegally. Moreover, many 
run the risk of becoming victims of drug-related crimes, such as 
break-ins or gangland violence. This situation does little to help the 
plight of individuals in general. It is unfortunately the cause of 
tremendous suffering. Many are likely to become frequent users of 
medication designed to treat or to temporarily alleviate anxiety 
attacks or some condition. There is no doubt that the efforts made 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4164"> 4164 </A></B>
<P>
by the government to fight the abuse or ill-advised use of drugs 
must be maintained.
<P>
	Another aspect which must be pointed out is that the bill 
promotes the rational use, for medical purposes, of several 
controlled substances, while prohibiting their illicit distribution. It 
recognizes that these controlled drugs are indispensable for 
medical purposes. Doctors, pharmacists and authorized distributors 
are all allowed to handle such substances, or to use them in the 
fulfilment of their duties. These substances must not be unduly 
restricted. They must be available when required, given the 
medical condition of patients, so that these patients do not suffer a 
drastic change in their quality of life.
<P>
	Bill C-8 advocates the judicious use of medication by indicating 
how controlled substances can be handled, distributed and used. 
These substances are mentioned in the act to protect the health and 
safety of the public, by striking a fair balance between people's 
needs and the dangers of illicit use.
<P>
	Bill C-8 covers other situations as well. It allows cancer patients, 
people suffering from debilitating diseases and those who have 
reached terminal phase to relieve their pain with prescription drugs 
such as morphine. A patient who is hospitalized, or who is under 
strict medical supervision, can even be prescribed heroin to relieve 
the pain.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	The bill means that preparations containing cocaine can safely 
be used during examinations and surgery. It also gives access to 
many other products for the treatment of less serious, but 
nonetheless debilitating, ailments, such as migraine. Medications 
containing codeine are regularly prescribed; their usefulness is not 
in question.
<P>
	This bill also mentions substances used to treat addictions. 
Methadone, for example, a substance covered by this legislation, is 
used to relieve pain, but also to treat heroin addicts. A number of 
treatment centres and hospitals use it. For a large number of 
patients, methadone maintenance therapy means that they can 
continue their regular activities and lead a constructive life. Some 
have jobs, others decide to pursue their education. They can thus 
lead a healthy family life and benefit from a stimulating social 
environment.
<P>
	I believe that, in this bill, we have found the balance necessary to 
the well-being of all Canadians. It is for this reason that I urge all 
members, and even our senator colleagues, to give it their support, 
as I myself am doing today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have just 
listened attentively to the speech by the member of the government 
party. In the bulk of his speech, he has indicated that the legitimate 
and normal use of drugs would continue to be possible in this 
country.
<P>
	That, however, was not the issue being addressed by Bill C-8, 
which replaced C-7, which in turn, I would remind you, replaced a 
Conservative government bill, Bill C-85.
<P>
	My hon. colleague made no mention of the work of the other 
place, which has confirmed the concerns I expressed on behalf of 
the Bloc Quebecois in this House in February 1994. In those first 
debates, on February 18 to be precise, the Bloc Quebecois 
acknowledged the obvious necessity of passing legislation in the 
drug field. The Bloc also expressed regrets, however, that Bill C-7 
had several significant flaws and not only ignored the parameters to 
be defined in effective drug control strategy, but also opened the 
door to some major adverse effects. Quoting from my speech at 
that time, the flaws could be grouped under four questions. First, 
are legitimate activities of physicians, pharmacists, vets and 
dentists properly protected against abusive application of the 
legislation and especially against regulations the scope of which we 
do not know at the moment?
<P>
	Second, would the significant powers granted to inspectors, to be 
designated directly by the minister, not possibly lead to some errors 
which could unduly penalize health professionals and their 
patients?
<P>
	Third, how would the confidentiality of medical records be 
ensured when the bill allows absolutely anyone designated as an 
inspector by the minister to reproduce documents found in a 
physician's office or in a pharmacy and to seize electronic data?
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Fourth and foremost, why are drug-dependent persons who need 
to be treated and not jailed considered criminals in this bill?
<P>
	What we are talking about here is the fact that the bill now before 
us, which has already been before us and which was before us at the 
time of the Conservative Party, talks of controlling supply and 
totally neglects the elements of controlling demand. Controlling 
supply involves cracking down on those involved in trafficking. 
Controlling demand involves prevention, detoxification and 
rehabilitation.
<P>
	This is why the Bloc voted against Bill C-7 at second reading on 
April 19, 1994 in this House. Subsequently, you will remember, the 
bill was sent to a sub-committee of the Standing Committee on 
Health, which met many times over a number of years. Most of the 
witnesses before the sub-committee, with the exception of federal 
officials, need I mention, opposed the bill, because they felt it 
would likely compound problems relating to drugs, rather than 
contribute to reducing them.
<P>
	As a result of the concerns expressed by the Bloc Quebecois, 
other members of the sub-committee were made aware and they in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4165"> 4165 </A></B>
<P>
turn made the members of their caucus aware. A period of 
reflection then followed,  between June 1994 and June 1995, during 
which the committee did not meet.
<P>
	In October 1995, the Bloc Quebecois proposed 14 amendments. 
Five were accepted by the sub-committee, four were rejected 
following explanation and five were similarly withdrawn. 
Furthermore, there were six amendments the Bloc Quebecois 
deliberately chose not to introduce, because the government tabled 
equivalent amendments, which had clearly been borrowed.
<P>
	Before the other House considered this bill, it was amended, 
thanks to the initiatives of the Bloc Quebecois, in order to reduce if 
not eliminate most of the major irritants I mentioned earlier. So, 
now a judge will have to take clause 11.1 into account. With your 
permission, I will read it, because it makes Bill C-8 much more 
sensitive to the interests of those affected by the consumption of 
drugs.
<P>
	This clause reads as follows: ``The fundamental purpose of any 
sentence for an offence under this Part is to contribute to the 
respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe 
society while encouraging rehabilitation, and treatment in 
appropriate circumstances, of offenders and acknowledging the 
harm done to victims and to the community''.
<P>
	This short clause in the bill is the only provision dealing with 
rehabilitation and detoxification but not, as you can see, with 
prevention. It is very little in a bill as comprehensive as the one 
before us today.
<P>
	In addition, the Bloc Quebecois succeeded in having the 
penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana reduced. 
We also succeeded in having medical records protected. Search and 
seizure will now be allowed only on reasonable grounds. The 
inspectors and analysts appointed by the minister must show that 
they have the necessary qualifications or they must acquire them.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Finally, on a related topic, the definition of practitioner has been 
sufficiently broadened to prevent people involved in the legitimate 
performance of their duties from being sued under the Criminal 
Code.
<P>
	As our distinguished colleague pointed out earlier, the 
subcommittee was also told by many witnesses that the debate 
should be broadened and include concerns that Bill C-8 does not 
address.
<P>
	In fact, the subcommittee submitted three recommendations to 
the Standing Committee on Health, which included them in its 
report. First, that a task force be set up to define the relevant 
criteria in determining which substances should be listed in 
schedules I to VII of the bill. Second, Canada's drug policy should 
be implemented. Third, the regulations and orders issued under this 
bill should be reviewed by the Standing Committee on Health. I 
should point out that the last two  recommendations resulted from 
the comments made by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	I also want to thank the members of the subcommittee, who 
considered these issues and debated the validity of Bill C-8 with 
open-mindedness and honesty, before finally approving and 
drafting the recommendations I referred to.
<P>
	On October 25, 1995, the chairman of the Standing Committee 
on Health tabled the report on Bill C-7 in this House. On October 
30, 1995-need I remind the House that it was the day of the 
Quebec referendum and that, as a result, all the members of the 
Bloc Quebecois were away-the House passed Bill C-7 at third 
reading in the absence of Bloc members. The other place, which 
undertook the consideration of this bill on December 13 and 14, has 
recently submitted the amendments it wants this House to 
incorporate in the bill. In fact, that is the purpose of the motion 
before us. But I must tell you that these are only minors changes 
that the other place is requesting.
<P>
	Still, it is interesting to note that, following on remarks made 
first by Bloc Quebecois members, and then by government 
members, the other place is also recommending that the Canadian 
drug strategy be reviewed.
<P>
	This leads me to conclude that this bill still falls short of 
resolving the drug problem adequately. While the bill deals with 
the supply aspect, it fails miserably to address the demand aspect 
by providing for prevention, detoxification and rehabilitation. But 
the worst bugs of the bill had been ironed out before it was referred 
to the other place.
<P>
	I must say that, unless provisions pertaining to prevention, 
detoxification and rehabilitation are included, the bill before us 
will never have any real positive effect. In this respect, I should 
remind the House that the other place was told by the Canadian 
Foundation for Drug Policy that it was a shame that the legislators 
in this House and in the other place did not dare put in place a 
modern drug strategy.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	As a matter of fact, this foundation recommended that the other 
place not approve Bill C-8, but the other place realizes that 
defeating the bill would mean going back to square one and starting 
all over the debate on repression while sorely neglecting the real 
issues of prevention, detoxification and rehabilitation.
<P>
	To introduce legislation reflecting a modern approach to 
managing the drug problem, the legislator must feel he has public 
opinion behind him. It is precisely to allow the public to form an 
informed opinion on the issue that it becomes essential to have a 
national debate. Had the other place refused to approve Bill C-8, 
we would have faced a dead end.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4166"> 4166 </A></B>
<P>
	That is why the Bloc Quebecois supports this motion. But our 
support must be construed as a very strong expression of our 
demand that the government act on the recommendations of the 
Standing Committee on Health by opening as soon as possible a 
national debate on the drug issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-8 has been 
a complex and long lived bill in this House. It was the first bill I 
was the watchdog for, so I have watched the process very carefully.
<P>
	Reformers had one big concern with this bill in that the bill gave 
very broad powers to the minister and to the bureaucracy that 
would have affected the health food industry. The clause that 
caused us the most concern said that the minister could deem any 
depressant, stimulant or hallucinogenic and include those in the 
schedules.
<P>
	I am proud of Canadians on that issue. Canadians with a little bit 
of help decided that was not suitable. The health food industry has 
stimulants, depressants and hallucinogenics. Our office was a bit of 
a focus for what I consider to be a campaign against that clause in 
Bill C-8. There were petitions, faxes and a huge amount of interest 
on the bill and we were able to get that clause kicked out. Our 
efforts were rewarded.
<P>
	There is still a problem in the bill in that the regulatory powers of 
the governor in council still allow anything that is deemed to be in 
the public interest to be inserted in the bill. Although that is better 
than the minister deeming, it is not what I consider to be an open 
and democratic way to include things in a bill.
<P>
	I looked over the amendments. I found them to be pretty 
standard amendments, crossing <I>t</I>s and small changes, until I found 
a very significant amendment to the bill, an amendment that was 
spoken of in a press release yesterday. I received these amendments 
at 10 o'clock last night. It is difficult to look at amendments when 
one does not have the bill and the amendments, but there was 
something brand new in the bill which had not been debated in 
public.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary mentioned that hemp is now being 
facilitated by Bill C-8. I listened in the committee to testimony 
about whether or not hemp should be included. There were 
witnesses who talked about hemp as a product for agriculture in 
Canada. There was no significant approval at that point in time for 
this direction to be undertaken. A senator, along with other 
members of the other place, has inserted one very, very tiny 
sentence in the bill, that ``mature cannabis stocks that do not 
include leaves, flowers, seeds or branches and fibre derived from 
such stocks are not included in the schedule''.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I always thought that if we in Canada were going to have a 
change in direction it should have public scrutiny. This change in 
direction has not had public scrutiny. What possible problem would 
there be for a brand new agricultural product to come on the scene 
in Canada?
<P>
	Why do the people concerned with marijuana legalization want 
so badly to have hemp included? I have never had anybody admit 
this to me, but I believe and will state on the public record, the 
reason for this is that the normal cannabis plant can be hidden very 
easily with the hemp plant early on in the growth stage. Detection 
at the early stages of cannabis sativa of the inadmissible cannabis 
plant is very, very difficult. As mature plants they are very 
distinguishable, but the young plants are not.
<P>
	I have listened and discussed with those individuals who argue 
strenuously for hemp. I have tried to figure out whether their only 
motive was to have another good agricultural product in Canada. I 
do not find that argument persuasive, but if the argument were 
persuasive I would have loved to have had this debate publicly.
<P>
	I believe this was an attempt to sneak this clause past the 
Canadian public and I use the word sneak advisedly. I go back to 
my original opposition to the bill, which is that the regulators could 
very easily include things in the bill that might not get broad public 
Canadian support. There is no public scrutiny of possible problems.
<P>
	For the Canadian public who are watching, I say this amendment 
should have come before the health committee with broader public 
debate rather than the very quiet press release yesterday and 
presentation by the parliamentary secretary today. I am not happy 
at all.
<P>
	With that issue on the table, I want to mention one other very 
significant inconsistency in the government's policies. I am going 
to use a health product as an example of how inconsistent the 
policy is. Melatonin is the health product.
<P>
	Melatonin in the past few years has been used for a number of 
things. It was touted as a fabulous drug for aging, to keep us all 
young, the fountain of youth. It was touted as being very useful for 
jet lag, something parliamentarians have some problems with. 
Because melatonin is a natural product, it has not had the usual 
number of clinical trials.

	Our Department of Health determined that melatonin did not 
have proof of safety and so it should be banned in Canada. I am fine 
with that. If there is no proof of safety, do not use it. But then we 
allow the private individual in Canada to purchase a three months 
supply in the United States and bring it into the country which 
seems totally inconsistent to me. Melatonin, if it is not good for us 
should be banned. If it is okay for us, we should be able to buy it in 
Canada.

	The health food business is going to be impacted by Bill C-8. 
I am still opposed to the bill because of these broad regulatory 
powers. I am disappointed in the sneaky issue on hemp. I will now 
be quiet.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there were a couple of points raised 
which need to be addressed.
<P>
	First and foremost in the hon. member's presentation, we ought 
to be clear on the lines of communication and the lines of 
responsibility. If it is his intention to have the department report 
directly to the House of Commons, that is an innovative way for 
establishing lines of accountability.
<P>
	The reason the minister has been charged with certain 
responsibilities is that he is always accountable to this House and to 
the hon. member in debate. That is a mainstay of our democratic 
process. I do not think we can dismiss that as being somehow 
anti-democratic. It is a very important element in the lines of 
accountability. The Minister of Health is always accountable, not 
only to the House but to the electorate.
<P>
	Second, I am a little concerned that the member would take 
umbrage with the fact that there is an industrial application of 
hemp that the department is leaving open. It is a little bit of a 
problem because members of his party, members of the other 
opposition parties and the general public have been suggesting for 
quite some time that we ought to at least give it an opportunity to 
demonstrate its value.
<P>
	The member quite rightly reads the amendment. It is not sneaky 
nor is it some surreptitious, vague wording. It deals specifically 
with the stalk of hemp and with its fibres. It does not deal with 
anything else. It is the element that is the least likely to contain 
hallucinogenic qualities.
<P>
	If we open the door for the industrial use of a product that has 
been used by others in what many might suggest is a fashion not so 
far tolerated but at least proven to have some merit, that is 
consistent with what the Reform Party has been asking for all the 
way along. It is not an amendment that has been sneaked in. It is 
one that has been debated publicly for quite some time.
<P>
	In that regard as well, the House should know that what the 
members of the official opposition and the Reform Party have 
suggested, that there be a health committee review of Canada's 
drug policies, that is being undertaken. In fact, the health 
committee has already set in place a schedule for reviewing the 
entire process starting in September when the House resumes 
sitting.
<P>
	I take what the member has said in a positive fashion, but I do 
not think that members of the House should be confused as to the 
direction, purpose and openness of the bill as it is before the House. 
I encourage concurrence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, definitely I want to reply with 
vigour.
<P>
	The issue which the member has missed completely is whether 
there is some risk with hemp. There is a risk with hemp: detection 
of the illegal plant. This should not have come through the back 
door. It should not have come through the Senate. It should not 
have come through as an amendment. It should not have come 
through quietly. It should have come through openly. The member 
sitting across the way knows full well that did not happen. I am 
disappointed and I believe the Canadian public will be 
disappointed.

	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (for the Minister of Transport, Lib.)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment made by the Senate to Bill C-20, an act respecting the 
commercialization of civil air navigation services, be read the second time and 
concurred in.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this amendment is a technical 
amendment that does not affect any of the provisions in the bill. It 
is only a matter of timing.
<P>
	Prior to the amendment all sections of the bill were to become 
effective upon royal assent. The intent of the amendment is to make 
three sections, sections 11, 13 and 100, come into force on the 
transfer date, which is expected to be 60 days after royal assent.
<P>
	Section 11 pertains to the designation to the international civil 
aviation organization of Nav Canada as the Canadian authority for 
air traffic control services and aeronautical information services.
<P>
	Section 13 provides Nav Canada with the right to plan and 
manage the airspace subject to the governor in council's right to 
make regulations respecting the classification and use of that 
airspace.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4168"> 4168 </A></B>
<P>
	Section 100 is a consequential amendment to the Aeronautics 
Act which removes the authority of the Minister of Transport and 
the Minister of National Defence to impose charges for air 
navigation services.
<P>
	If this authority were to be removed prior to the transfer date, it 
would have implications for the revenue stream of Nav Canada in 
its first few days of operation. This would be the case because of 
section 33 of the bill, which states: ``The charges imposed by the 
corporation on or after the transfer date for air navigation services 
shall be the charges that were imposed by the minister immediately 
before the transfer date''.
<P>
	If the minister did not have the authority to impose the charges 
on the day before the transfer, Nav Canada would have no charges 
in place as it began operations. Nav Canada would be able to 
impose its own charges within two weeks, but the gap and the 
degree of uncertainty associated with the process would complicate 
its initial financing.
<P>
	The commercialization of the air navigation system will provide 
significant benefits to Canadians. I urge my colleagues in this place 
to support this amendment as a way of ensuring this initiative takes 
off to the best possible start.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the other place sent us back Bill C-20 with some rather 
technical amendments. I take this opportunity to say that, the day 
after the Pearson airport legislation was killed, we have yet another 
example of the uselessness of the other place, which can even be a 
nuisance. Yesterday, a House of unelected people blocked a very 
important government bill. We should reflect on this.
<P>
	As for Bill C-20, the proposed amendments are of a very 
technical nature. The government's excuse for not having moved 
these amendments earlier in this House, either at third reading or 
report stage, is that the Senate is there to do the work. How much 
did it cost to let the other place debate the issue, including the costs 
generated by the additional delays?
<P>
	Today, the session is coming to an end. We are forced to pass 
bills while taking into account many elements and deadlines. Had it 
not been forced to send the bill to the other place, the House could 
simply have passed it at the end of debate here, and the government 
would have been accountable for it.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	And had there been omissions such as the one corrected by the 
Senate, the government would have had to take responsibility for 
them. We should not rely on a House which is not accountable to 
Canadians to correct mistakes.
<P>
	This example, along with yesterday's much more catastrophic 
end of the Pearson bill, shows once again a lack of seriousness on 
the part of the government. Let me tell you that, regardless of one's 
opinion on the Pearson bill, it was neither flattering nor pleasant to 
see that an unelected house could kill a bill that had been debated 
and passed here. Even though we were against this legislation and 
felt that many changes were needed, including the establishment of 
a commission of inquiry, the fact remains that this is a rather telling 
episode.
<P>
	I think it is important to remember the reasons why the Bloc 
Quebecois will vote against Bill C-20. During the clause by clause 
examination in committee and the debate at third reading, we 
proposed amendments regarding safety that we thought were very 
constructive.
<P>
	These amendments were intended to ensure that the new agency 
responsible for managing air navigation would be required to give 
priority to ensuring the safety of carriers. The intention was to have 
this obligation included in the legislation in the form of a preamble 
that would have served as an interpretation clause. The government 
did not yield to our arguments in this regard. Neither did the 
Senate. There is no recommendation along these lines.
<P>
	We were not listened to. When the government does not listen, 
that may be what it chooses to do, it may think that this is not the 
right course of action. But as for the Senate, that is a concern they 
should have had. They could have presented us with something 
more useful than the three tiny amendments we have before us 
today.
<P>
	The other point the Bloc Quebecois emphasized, and which was 
ignored, concerned the representation of small carriers on the board 
of directors of Nav Canada. We think that a few years down the 
road, it will be realized that this decision will have significant 
negative economic effects on a number of outlying regions in 
Canada, where there are carriers specializing in chartered flights, 
tourist flights, and utilitarian flights, and not necessarily regular 
passenger flights.
<P>
	It is true that the composition of Nav Canada's board of directors 
includes almost all the stakeholders in the economic sector 
concerned, but we feel that large carriers are over-represented on 
the board, to the exclusion of small carriers. We think that will have 
an impact on charges. When it comes to deciding how charges will 
be levied, the voices that will be heard the loudest will be those of 
large carriers, and the small carriers will be lost in the shuffle.
<P>
	It must be borne in mind that there was a need to rationalize in 
this industrial sector, a need to organize so as to reduce costs, and a 
good many of these objectives will probably be met by Bill C-20. 
What we would have liked to see was the pendulum swinging in the 
other direction in order to guarantee safety, something not found in 
this bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4169"> 4169 </A></B>
<P>
	It seems to me that, at this final stage, that the Senate 
amendments do nothing to change the basic question. There has 
been no additional important element introduced by the Senate. 
The bill, in the opinion of the Bloc Quebecois, is identical to the 
way it was on third reading. For these reasons we will be voting 
against it, in order to let people know that the Bloc Quebecois feels 
safety ought to have more importance attached to it than the 
government has done in this bill.
<P>
	We hope there will be no unfortunate accidents to prove us right.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	We hope this will never happen, but we believe that, even when 
the bill is implemented, at least if there was no will to change it in 
the text, in connection with the administration of Nav Canada, 
there will be representations by the government to ensure that this 
is a concern in the day to day administration of Nav Canada, and 
that costs will not be the only concern.
<P>
	To conclude, after this debate at every stage, I believe a number 
of members of this House, those on the committee with which I 
was associated at the end of the process, have worked very hard. I 
feel they have produced good legislation. It is unfortunate that they 
have not heeded the arguments raised, for the most part about 
safety, for if they had we could have joined with the government. I 
feel it would have been worthwhile, and important, for there to 
have been unanimity in the House on a bill of this type.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr.

secretary.
<P>
	While I do not always agree with him, certainly this time it was 
both accurate and succinct. I hope he keeps those qualities in future 
debate as well, particularly on issues where we tend to differ.
<P>
	As seems to be the norm with this bill and several others, I find 
the few comments I want to make relating to the previous speaker 
from the Bloc Quebecois. He talks about the lack of safety in the air 
navigation system now with Nav Canada taking over.
<P>
	I have been a commercial pilot and also an air traffic controller 
for 22 years. The same people will be running the system after as 
before. We have in our system among the best in the world and it is 
safe.
<P>
	I find it an interesting contradiction that the hon. member who 
just spoke talks about how the Senate hinders the process of this 
House. Then in the same breath he turns around and says the Senate 
should have listened and made amendments according to what the 
Bloc was looking for. It is starting to sound like the government 
with regard to the Pearson deal where it said it had to cancel it 
because it is too rich and it does not want to pay any compensation 
because they would not have made any money anyway. I am still 
trying to figure that one out. I bet the liberals are too when they 
stop and actually listen to themselves.
<P>
	I found it very interesting that the Bloc is to vote against this 
legislation. This legislation is not being voted on today. The only 
thing that is being voted on is the amendment to the legislation 
which the Bloc said it would support. It is a bit confusing, the 
Liberals are a bit confusing. Thank God it is summer and we are all

that there is no simple answer to the Quebec issue.

	According to the poll results, 54.9 per cent of the 1,003 
respondents support Quebec sovereignty, while at the same time 
65.3 per cent of them hope that Quebec will remain in Canada.
<P>
	Beyond the impression of ambiguity created by these figures, 
one thing remains clear: a substantial majority-over 60 per 
cent-of the people are asking Lucien Bouchard to work with us at 
renewing the Canadian federation.
<P>
	Let us hope that the Quebec premier will hear their message and

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALDEFENCE">NATIONAL DEFENCE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the military police, having been forced to reopen the 
investigation after the appearance of documents implicating 
General Boyle in the cover-up operation, have just released their 
report.
<P>
	It concludes that the chief of defence staff not only made a false 
statement to his own military police, but also was aware of the 
cover-up, and categorically refused to reply to questions by the 
military police.
<P>
	My question is a straightforward one to the Acting Prime 
Minister. What credibility does the chief of staff of the Canadian 
Armed Forces have, when it is now known that he lied to his own 
military police, that he refuses to be cross-examined, that he was 
aware of the cover-up of the Somalia affair? Will the government 
insist on his resignation, or will it not?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister has covered this issue a number of times. The 
fact that I will not comment on any evidence to be presented to the 
commission of inquiry is firm.
<P>
	The commission was established to examine all aspects of the 
deployment to Somalia. Let the commission take its course.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we know that the Minister of National Defence has said 
the same thing very often, that he refuses to budge. That we know.
<P>
	If I understand the response correctly, the government tolerates 
its chief of defence staff lying with impunity to his own military 
police and, what is more, refusing to submit to any 
cross-examination. We also learned that he had the support of five 
officers-the Canadian Army camouflage brigade no doubt-in 
preparing his testimony before the inquiry, while the other 
witnesses had no such services available to them.
<P>
	Can the government tolerate such a practice? Is this not utterly 
shameful?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the commission of inquiry is the proper forum for this 
kind of debate, not the floor of the House of Commons. Let the 
commission do its job.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the commission is doing its job, despite every effort to 
block it from so doing by the chief of defence staff. The one not 
doing its job is the government, that is the problem. I had hoped for 
more than a pre-recorded message in response.
<P>
	The chief of defence staff will appear before the inquiry only in 
mid-August.

	Meanwhile, he has lost all credibility, not only in the eyes of 
Quebecers and Canadians, but also in the eyes of Canada's allies. 
Who can have any confidence in him when he meets with other 
chiefs of defence staff? Does the government not realize that it is 
the entire credibility of Canada that is at stake, the credibility of the 
Canadian Armed Forces as a whole, as long as this general is left in 
charge?

is presented to the commission of inquiry. Let the commission do

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	The other House definitively signed the death warrant for the bill 
on the Pearson airport yesterday. The government is now faced 
with damage suits, and the Liberals' blunders could cost taxpayers 
up to $662 million. All because the government has been refusing 
for the past two years to listen to the official opposition and to hold 
a public hearing to bring this whole political and financial scandal 
to light.
<P>
	Rather than submit yet again to another partisan study behind 
closed doors, and because the government is in a tight spot, is it the 
minister's intention, finally, to hold a real public hearing into this 
whole matter?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the contradiction between one member of the Bloc's not 
wanting to have a commission of inquiry proceed but to have it 
discussed on the floor of the House and the next question coming 
from a member who would prefer to have a commission rather than 
discuss it on the floor of the House is very striking.
<P>
	I agree with him that we have a concern here. The government 
will not allow the Conservative senators to put the Canadian 
taxpayer at risk to the tune of some $600 million of unearned and 
undeserved profits.
<P>
	That is why the bill was introduced in the first place. We are now 
examining our options for our next steps. We are looking at all 
options before us. None is ruled out. There is one consideration 
paramount, that we protect the Canadian taxpayer from this attempt 
of the Conservative senators to provide $600 million or more of 
unearned profits to the developers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister is just as irresponsible as the Senate. We have 
been calling for a commission of inquiry for two years, not since 
yesterday.
<P>
	The Government Leader in the Senate said, following the vote 
yesterday, that they would do everything in their power to ensure 
no Conservative interest group would benefit from the agreement.
<P>
	What assurance do we have from the minister that Liberal 
interest groups will not benefit from this agreement either?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government's position has been put many times in the 
House and elsewhere, not just since this government was formed 
but also during the election campaign when this infamous deal was 
signed by the previous government 10 days before the election 
date.
<P>
	We wish to protect the Canadian taxpayers by all the means we 
have available. I assure the hon. member we will make available to 
him and to other members of the House our decision in due course 
as to how we will proceed.
<P>
	All I can say further is that what happened last night by the 
Mulroney appointed senators, unelected members, was a vote in 
favour of granting hundreds of millions of dollars of unearned and 
undeserved profits in an unacceptable deal done in the dying days 
of a federal campaign.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, during the last election campaign the Liberals, not the 
Conservatives, made a number of ill conceived promises that are 
now costing taxpayers billions.
<P>
	First it was the GST, then it was the EH-101 helicopter 
cancellation and now it is the Pearson airport development deal.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	The Pearson deal cancellation was politically motivated in the 
first place. The attempt to keep it out of the courts was politically 
motivated, and now Canadian taxpayers could be on the hook for 
$662 million and counting.
<P>
	Who will take responsibility for this mess, the former transport 
minister, the present transport minister or the Prime Minister who 
made the wrong decision in the first place?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have heard a lot in recent days about the right getting 
together, but there is something thoroughly  unpleasant in the way 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4176"> 4176 </A></B>
<P>
the Reform Party is cosying up to a group of people in the other 
place trying to provide the developers of this proposal with money 
they have not earned.
<P>
	This party should recognize that in its efforts to get the right 
together, it is perhaps cosying up to the wrong people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hypocrisy of the minister pretending to protect 
taxpayers' interests. The way to protect taxpayers' interests would 
have been to have made the right decision in the first place, not to 
try to shield a wrong decision from the courts.
<P>
	Nothing the government says can change the fact that this 
government cancelled the Pearson deal in the first place, that this 
government compounded the problem by trying to deny access to 
the court to affected parties and that this government will leave 
taxpayers on the hook for $662 million or more.
<P>
	What will be done to undo the damage of this politically 
motivated decision and action?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the leader of the third party, the fourth party-Reformers 
must thank their lucky stars the Bloc Quebecois did not run a 
candidate in Hamilton or they would have been fifth.
<P>
	The position of the government is clear. The contracts were 
entered into in the middle of an election campaign when it was 
indicated by one of the major political parties that if we were 
elected the appropriateness of the contract would be reviewed. It is 
appropriate to compensate the parties for their out of pocket 
expenses but not for profits they have not earned. That is our 
position and we will do whatever we can in the future.
<P>
	The hon. member can stay tuned for our decision in the future 
and he will find we will be taking further steps to protect the 
Canadian taxpayer, whom he from time to time seems to have some 
concern for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what we have here is a huge infrastructure project of vital 
importance to Ontario and to Canada knocked completely off the 
rails by political interference.
<P>
	In the Airbus case we have the Liberals trying to use the justice 
department to go after a political opponent. In this case we have the 
Liberals trying to deny both their friends and their political 
opponents access to the courts. This is political corruption of the 
sleaziest kind, and Canadians want resignations-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Although no particular member was named, I find 
the words ``political corruption'' to be very strong. I wonder if the 
hon. leader of the Reform Party would consider withdrawing the 
words ``political corruption''. Following the withdrawal would he 
put his question directly.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will withdraw the words but we 
continue to worry about why the words offend the House but what 
they represent do not.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, a simple withdrawal. Would the 
hon. member please just make the withdrawal of the words?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> I withdraw the words, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Where are the resignations, not the excuses, that will convince 
Canadians that political interference in infrastructure development, 
in purchasing and in due process will stop and stop now?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the attempts to unify the right are reaching new lows. 
What groups should he be asking for resignations from, those 
attempting to protect taxpayers' interests or those that would assist 
the lobbyists and the developers get unearned income?
<P>
	I suggest the hon. member from Calgary read the May 15 
<I>Hansard</I> of the other place, read the changes that were made to the 
bill, read the statements made by the chief witness of the 
Conservative Party in that place, Professor Monahan, where we 
met all the objections with the exception of the issue of lobbyist 
fees and unearned profit.

<P>
	Earlier this week, the minister tried to convince the House that 
decisions by Atomic Energy of Canada did not involve her. It did 
not prevent her from claiming that this crown corporation would 
provide Quebec with $100 million in economic benefits with each 
sale of a CANDU-6, a figure strongly contested by those 
responsible for marketing this equipment.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that, if Atomic Energy of Canada

	Is the minister aware that Canatom, which she put at the top of 
the list of companies benefiting from AECL contracts in Quebec, 
did not get the contract to build the CANDU-6s that will be sold to 
China. It was in fact the American firm Bechtel that got this 
lucrative contract. Is she aware and is she asleep?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Let me explain to the hon. member that the CANDU reactor 
business in foreign markets is a highly competitive one.
<P>
	AECL puts together a consortium on the basis of partners who 
provide the most competitive bids in the circumstances. Canatom, 
like any other company in this country, has the right to bid, to 
participate. Canatom has a long and lengthy history in the nuclear 
business in this country and I am sure it will receive much work in

understand?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a party that managed to come dead last in a byelection 
should understand the word dead, dead in the water, dead last.
<P>
	As I have answered four times already, we are exploring our 
options because we believe the Canadian taxpayer should be 
protected from a major payout to the  tune of $600 million of plain, 
unearned profit on the punitive Pearson deal.
<P>
	To answer the other part of her question, we have arranged with 
another group for a not for profit management of the airport in local 
hands. I can assure her we are currently spending $250 million to 
bring Pearson up to where it should be, the number one gateway for 
North America, for the whole central heartland of the continent.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if that 
deal had gone ahead that whole process would have been finished 
by now and we would have had a class act airport, not simply 
talking about the possibility of it now.
<P>
	The minister talks about due process of law. I might remind you, 
Mr. Speaker, he used the due process of law some time ago to sue 
his own government, for heaven's sake. What credibility is that?
<P>
	Tory patronage may have been replaced by Liberal politics but 
Canadian taxpayers are still paying the price and that is what they 
are angry about.
<P>
	Instead of worrying about covering their own political assets, 
when will the Liberals come up with a plan that will benefit 
taxpayers, not Liberals, not Tories, but Canadian taxpayers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is extraordinary. We have explained how we are 
trying through various measures to protect Canadian taxpayers 
from $600 million of unearned profit. These are the people who are 
not protecting Canadian taxpayers, yet the member has the 
audacity to stand up and suggest we are not protecting Canadian 
taxpayers.
<P>
	It is about time they discovered who the Canadian taxpayers are. 
They are not just a small group of developers and Conservative 
members of the other place and lobbyists. They are more than that.

<P>
	Last year, the industry department cut the budget of CITI, the 
Centre for Information Technologies Innovation, located in Laval, 
from $13 to $9 million. Now there are rumours that the government 
is getting ready to close down this research centre in the Montreal

$9 to $3 million.

<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, as announced in the February 1995 budget, the first 
program review concluded that CITI's activities were not essential 
to the government's mandate and should be gradually excluded 
from it by April 1, 1998.
<P>
	After looking at the options that would best serve the interests of 
employees and of taxpayers, I asked my officials to try to privatize 
CITI. Following a transparent public process, MicroCell submitted 
a duly completed proposal to us last April 29.
<P>
	We responded with a counteroffer, and are now awaiting 
MicroCell's reply. We have informed the staff at CITI of the 
government's position in this matter.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr.

move of Atomic Energy of Canada from Montreal to Toronto, the 
awarding of CANDU-6 construction contracts to Americans, and 
now the pull-out from CITI.

	Does the Minister of Industry admit that his government has but 
one objective: to systematically reduce its investments in the 
greater Montreal area?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr.

ask such a question. Is she not ready to admit that we have a 
number of federal laboratories in Quebec, including the Food 
Research and Development Centre in Saint-Hyacinthe, the animal 
health and food safety laboratory in Saint-Hyacinthe, the research

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Transport seems confused. He keeps 
referring to the Tories. There are more Liberals involved in this 
than Tories.
<P>
	In two secret government documents, senior bureaucrats warned 
the government at the start of the Pearson process in 1993 that the 
contract was a better deal than trying to do it themselves and that 
cancelling the contract could leave the government and 
subsequently the taxpayers of Canada on the hook for up to $2 
billion.
<P>
	My question is simple and it is directed to the Minister of 
Transport. Why did the government not listen to its own advisors?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thought perhaps the hon. Reform Party critic would have 
the decency to simply sit quiet and let the others in his party speak.
<P>
	The reason I say that is that last night a group of Mulroney 
appointed senators, unelected people, voted in favour of granting 
hundreds of millions of dollars of unearned, undeserved profits to 
unaccountable developers in an unacceptable deal.
<P>
	The member in today's Vancouver <I>Sun</I> is quoted as saying: 
``This defeat is a victory for all Canadians''. This is a possible $600 
million liability to the Canadian taxpayers and the Reform Party 
critic has the unmitigated gall to get up and tell us that this is some 
sort of victory for the Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	It is time Reform members began to understand who taxpayers 
are. It is time for them to understand that they will never get 
themselves re-elected on the basis of Mulroney appointed-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Kootenay

<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadian taxpayers are not on the hook for $600 million 
because of Bill C-28. They are on the hook because of the bungling 
of the minister.
<P>
	The minister talks about the Tories and the Senate. It was a 
Liberal who cast the final ballot which shut down this bill.
<P>
	Those same government documents provided all the figures 
backed up by independent experts to show that the crown 
construction option would have cost the taxpayers more than 
letting the Pearson contract proceed, even without the cost of the 
lawsuit added in.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4179"> 4179 </A></B>
<P>
	My question is again directed to the Minister of Transport. If 
he was interested in saving the taxpayers money, why did his 
government not try to renegotiate or restructure the contract 
instead of ignoring the advice of his own experts and subsequently 
setting the taxpayers and this government up for a $600 million 
suit?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Remember, sparrows fly.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the member will cast his mind back to the period prior 
to the election of this government, he will recollect that in the 
dying days of the previous government, the Mulroney-Campbell 
regime, a deal was signed against all conventions of this House and 
the parliamentary system. It was a major contract which the 
opposition party at the time, now the government, claimed it would 
re-examine if it were elected and if it was found to be not in the 
public interest it would indeed get rid of it. That is precisely what 
has been done.
<P>
	Not only do Reformers not understand who their friends should 
be, they do not understand the workings of a democratic system 
where the people elected by the public of Canada have the right to 
determine how taxpayers' money will be spent.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Up until now, the federal government had always recognized the 
predominant role of the Montreal region as a major site for 
research and development in Canada. The Picard report and 
subsequent studies have always highlighted the importance of 
research and development for Montreal's future. Furthermore, 
during the last election campaign, the Minister of Finance 
reiterated, in his action plan for Montreal, the federal government's 
commitment to continue supporting these activities.
<P>
	After making this election promise, how can the Minister of 
Finance justify his inaction in the face of the federal government's 
systematic withdrawal from research and development activities in 
the Montreal region, in particular the Varennes Tokamak, the 
Atomic Energy offices, and now the Centre for Information 
Technologies Innovation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I do not have enough time to list all the federal 
government's substantial investments, which are very important 
for the future of Quebec, and for the future of research and 
development throughout Canada.
<P>
	Today, another Canadian astronaut working for the Canadian 
Space Agency in Saint-Hubert, Quebec, was launched into space.
<P>
	Last month, a Canadian astronaut from Quebec, Marc Garneau, 
who also works for the Canadian Space Agency in Saint-Hubert, 
Quebec, was launched into space for the second time. We continue 
to invest in federal laboratories in Quebec, in the area of 
biotechnology in particular.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, these 
investments are not presents from the federal government, but what 
we are owed in return for the taxes we pay to the federal 
government.
<P>
	In his June 1992 action plan, the finance minister promised that 
in the greater Montreal region, a Liberal government would 
maximize the benefits from its national research and development 
program.
<P>
	Does the minister admit that these promises were nothing but a 
smoke screen, as the federal government is systematically 
withdrawing from R and D investments in the Montreal region, 
with the minister's tacit approval? Where are the members from 
the Montreal region in this government?
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the 
opposition is giving us today a great opportunity to show how the 
federal government, the Canadian government, is omnipresent in 
Montreal's development. In fact, our government is the most 
actively involved of all levels of government.
<P>
	We are involved in cultural matters, in pharmaceuticals, in 
aeronautics, in biotechnology, in environmental matters. My 
colleague, the Minister of Industry, has announced a technological 
partnership that will produce outstanding benefits.
<P>
	Since the beginning of the year, and again recently, we have

<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Senate banking committee provided the government 
with a number of recommendations with respect to the functioning 
of the government's banks as well as the regional development 
agencies. I will be responding very fully to that report on behalf of 
the government in the Senate committee in the coming weeks.
<P>
	I would like to say to the hon. member as clearly as possible that 
the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency and the other regional 
development agencies continue to play an important role in this

the regions of the country to acquire the capital and the technology 
they need to build jobs and growth for people in their regions.

<P>
	I think it is fair to say that last night was a national 
embarrassment when the political hacks, flacks and bagmen in the 
Senate, including a Liberal senator, decided to call upon Canadian 
taxpayers to cough up about 600 million bucks to hand out to a 
bunch of land developers in Toronto.

Why does he not do just that?

responsibility of the Minister of Transport, but if he would like to

	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in my capacity as acting Prime Minister, I can say that the

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PEARSONINTERNATIONALAIRPORT">PEARSON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Pearson 
airport is a vital resource of the Ontario economy. Millions of

an advantage in the global marketplace.
<P>
	Under this government for two and one-half years the 
infrastructure at Pearson has continued to deteriorate. So much for 
infrastructure programs. For the sake of business confidence, we 
need to clear the air.

<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	Will the Minister of Transport tell this House if he has a plan for 
the long, overdue redevelopment of Pearson?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have already answered that question in response to an 
earlier question.
<P>
	We regard Pearson airport as an airport of tremendous potential 
not just for southern Ontario but for the entire heartland of North 
America. Just as Vancouver is becoming the gateway airport for the 
Asia-Pacific, we want to have Pearson as the gateway for all 
Atlantic flights going into central North America. That is our 
objective.
<P>
	To that end, three weeks ago we signed over letters of intent with 
a local airport authority, excellent people in the Toronto area who 
will be running the airport when we deal with the various items that 
have to be organized. We expect a final signing in January.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Transport knows the redevelopment of Pearson will 
cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Now that the government has 
put taxpayers at risk for hundreds of millions of dollars in 
compensation, where will the minister get the same amount of 
money for construction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I mentioned, we have undertaken a number of 
improvements in the Toronto Airport Authority which in total 
come to about $250 million despite the fact that we are handing it 
over to that local authority.
<P>
	I am interested in the question. Finally comes from Reformers an 
admission that oh yes, the government and the public are going to 
be stuck for $600 million. That has been behind their questions to 
this date. Now they admit they know full well what the result was 
of that decision last night.

open public inquiry for the Canadian public. The Canadian public 
would appreciate a straight answer from that side of the House.
<P>
	In the past, the Prime Minister has expressed his confidence in 
the chief of defence staff. Given the proof that we have seen today

the reduction in the current account deficit and the huge increase in

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think he is just trying to get extra sandwiches at your 
reception.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, my point of order pertains to comments made in 
this Chamber on Tuesday, June 18, 1996. The comments were 
recorded in <I>Hansard</I> on page 4031. The House leader for the 
separatist Bloc Quebecois, the member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie, 
then said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-for having misled the House by making false accusations that called into 
question the honesty and integrity of the member for Charlesbourg.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	The member then went on to demand an apology from me for 
having brought forth my point of privilege.
<P>
	It is my understanding that it is unparliamentary language for a 
member to suggest that another member has misled the House. 
This morning Mr. Speaker ruled out of order another such 
accusation from the separatist Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	The member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie has impugned my 
motives and this is reflected in the official record of the 
proceedings of the Chamber.
<P>
	I was not present in the House when these unparliamentary 
words were uttered. This is the first opportunity I have had to 
respond to bring the matter to your attention.
<P>
	I refuse to apologize for defending the interests of the country 
against the people whose sole purpose for being in Ottawa is to 
desecrate and destroy what Canadians hold so dearly.
<P>
	For his unparliamentary language, I believe the member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie should be required to withdraw his remarks 
and apologize for his accusations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I used the word ``intentionally'' in reference to my hon. 
colleague. Intentionally means consciously. Listening to him in the 
past few days, I recognize that this was a bad choice of words. I 
should not have used a word meaning consciously to refer to him. I 
withdraw the word. I have to admit that he is not conscious.
<P>

a withdrawal. That is it.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am now prepared to rule on the question or 
privilege raised on Tuesday afternoon by the hon. member for 
Lethbridge concerning the text of Motion No. 1 standing on the 
Order Paper in the name of the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for Lethbridge, the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell and the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley East for their participation in the discussion.
<P>
	For the benefit of all hon. members, I remind the House the 
motion in question contains a number of charges against the hon. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4184"> 4184 </A></B>
<P>
member for Lethbridge relating  to actions in which he participated 
at the beginning of this year.
<P>
	Having rendered my ruling on Tuesday on the procedural 
acceptability of this motion's being dealt with under Private 
Members' Business, I will now address the matter of what the hon. 
member contends is a breach of his rights.
<P>
	The member submitted that having this motion standing 
unresolved on the Order Paper has and will continue to seriously 
affect his reputation and his ability to function as a member. 
Further, the member argued that given my earlier ruling and that he 
felt he could seek no other remedy for the situation, he had no 
option but to bring this matter before the House as a question of 
privilege.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It has been repeatedly acknowledged by my predecessors that 
parliamentary privilege is narrowly defined as being limited to 
matters which affect members in the discharge of their 
parliamentary duties.
<P>
	For a breach of privilege to occur, a member must sufficiently 
demonstrate that something has obstructed or interfered with his or 
her ability to discharge duties as a member of the House.
<P>
	In ruling on a question of privilege, I, as Speaker, have to decide 
whether or not at first glance there has been a breach of privilege.
<P>
	In this instance, I must determine whether or not the motion 
sitting on the Order Paper violates the member's privileges by, in 
some way, impeding him from carrying out his duties.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the past motions regarding the conduct of members have been 
placed on the Order Paper under Private Members' Business and 
have been allowed to remain there, in some cases for the remainder 
of a session, without ever being brought to a decision by the House.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	I refer members to Motion No. 132, placed on notice on May 5, 
1986, Motion No. 459, placed on notice on May 24, 1989, and 
Motion No. 167, placed on notice on February 28, 1996. This last 
motion died on the Order Paper in the first session of this 
Parliament but, having been resubmitted under Private Members' 
Business in this session, was subsequently drawn and debated as a 
non-votable item of Private Members' Business on March 22, 
1996. It was then dropped from the Order Paper without a decision 
of the House.
<P>
	The motion now in question, Motion No. 1, was placed on notice 
on February 27, 1996. The hon. member for Lethbridge 
acknowledged he hesitated to bring this matter before the House 
until it had at least reached the point of debate.
<P>
	While I recognize the hon. member's concern that in the near 
future he will not be able to respond to the charges made against 
him, I do not find the member has demonstrated his abilities to 
function as a member have in any way been affected or impeded 
over the course of the months that this motion has been sitting on 
the Order Paper. As such, I cannot find that there has been a prima 
facie breach of privilege.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Lethbridge sought guidance on how he 
might be able to address his grievance were I to find this matter not 
to be a <I>prima facie</I> breach of privilege. In the case before us, while 
the House will not have to take a decision on the motion in 
question, the hon. member will have the opportunity to respond to 
the motion when it is brought up for debate in the House.
<P>
	In addition, let me reiterate what I said Tuesday: the rules of the 
House now in place allow for the proceedings on this motion to go 
forward. Should the House choose to re-examine these rules, the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs is 
empowered to undertake such an examination on its own initiative.
<P>
	Might I therefore suggest that the hon. member consider 
pursuing this matter with the committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Again, I thank all hon. members for their contributions to this 
discussion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. earlier today I 
did seek the unanimous consent of the House to debate at all stages 
Bill C-45. I thought I would seek this one last opportunity before 
we close to ask if the House would give unanimous consent to deal 
with all stages of Bill C-45 this afternoon.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There is not unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe you would probably find 
unanimous consent to now move to private members' hour.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Taking the look at the situation we have suddenly discovered the 
other place does have effect. It is effective. It can do things. In our 
parliamentary system where we have a government like the current 
government which attempts to run roughshod all over the 
opposition parties and the concerns of many Canadians, it is good 
to have a House of sober second thought that truly is effective. We 
have seen that the Senate can be effective.
<P>
	This motion, which calls for the abolition of the Senate, period, 
end of statement, is unacceptable. That is why the member for 
Vegreville moved the Reform amendment that after the word 
Senate, the words ``in its present form'' be added.
<P>
	It has been a longstanding position of the Reform Party that we 
require an effective Senate. We require a Senate that can take a look 
at bogus bills like Bill C-28.
<P>
	Bill C-28 was to come back before the House today for the fourth 
time, after passing through the other place, but even after all this 
juggling the bill was still flawed. There were a number of 
amendments to Bill C-28 which were passed by the Liberal 
majority in the other place in an attempt to water down some of the 
more odious aspects of the bill, but they still did not get it right, as 
was shown by virtue of the fact that Liberal Senate Sparrow 
decided he would do the right thing and join the other people in the 
other place to vote the bill down.
<P>
	Bill C-28 attempted to retroactively cancel a contract. It went 
directly into the teeth of the privileges and the rights we have as 
Canadians. Whether we are individuals or corporations, it makes 
no difference, we should have the right to have access to a court of 
law. What the Liberal government was attempting to do was shut 
down due process in Canada.
<P>
	We recognize there was a tremendous amount of money 
involved in this process. Because of the Prime Minister's promise 
during the 1993 election, he has placed the people of Canada 
directly in the way of at least a $600 million loss. This is 
unconscionable on the part of the Prime Minister. It was only the 
Liberals in the other place, with the exception of Senator Sparrow, 
who would put this through. They would not use their conscience. 
They would follow the direction of the former minister of 
transport.
<P>
	There is a process in Canada which we all understand. There is a 
process within the House of Commons. The legislation from the 
House of Commons, when passed, goes to the Senate. The Senate 
should be effective, and it has been shown to be effective. The other 
place is to be there as a place of sober second thought and also to 
represent the regions.
<P>
	We recognize there is some tremendous difficulty within the 
Senate at this moment. I speak as someone in business. The 
predecessors to this Liberal government, yet another Liberal 
government, brought us the great and wonderful national energy 
plan.
<P>
	We had in western Canada, based out of Calgary, our very own 
made in Canada depression. It was made right here in Ottawa with 
bogus thinking, with centrist thinking that Liberals consistently 
possess. Sixty-five billion dollars was sucked out of western 
Canada and brought back to Ontario.
<P>
	That would never have happened had there been an elected 
Senate. It is for that reason that we have put forth the amendment 
that yes, the Senate should be abolished, but in its present form. In 
other words, there is a place, there is a time, there is a function for 
the Senate and we must see that it remains. However, the problem 
is it is not elected and is totally unaccountable.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party has been attempting to bring some semblance 
of order, some accountability to the Senate, in spite of the fact that 
the Prime Minister has said he will appoint the Senators he wants, 
who will represent his party and just on and on. He is the past 
master at manipulating and controlling the parliamentary system.
<P>
	In addition, the Liberals will not let us make the Senate 
accountable for dollars and cents. They will not let members of the 
House of Commons, who are the duly elected representatives of the 
people of Canada, hold the Senate accountable for the $40 million 
plus that they are currently spending.
<P>
	From the executive summary of the auditor general:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We found that the Senate has neither formally nor informally delegated clear 
responsibility to management, nor has it made clear for what to hold 
management accountable. We recommend the Senate should more clearly 
define the mandate of the committee on internal economy and subcommittees, 
and establish clear accountability relationships with its senior staff.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is the most important part.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Senate does not adequately report on its administrative, financial or 
human resource management performance and does not possess sufficient 
information to enable it to do so systematically.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is the Liberal Party of Canada that wants to make sure that the 
Senators, its friends in the other place, are not going to be 
accountable to this place. Should we throw out the Senate? No, 
because as we have seen when there has been an odious bill such as 
Bill C-28, the other place from time to time will actually get it 
right.
<P>
	We saw what the Progressive Conservatives did when they were 
being thwarted in bringing in the GST, the gouge and screw tax. 
Former Prime Minister Mulroney ended up padding the Senate so 
that he could manage to get the GST through the House of 
Commons. The Senate just broke up into bedlam with kazoos and 
all sorts of other exciting things.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4186"> 4186 </A></B>
<P>
	The way the Senate is currently conducting itself, and 
occasionally showing itself to be effective, should give the people 
of Canada at least a glimmer of insight to how the parliamentary 
system in Canada should work. Why will it not work that way? 
Because the Prime Minister has made no less than 16 
appointments to the Senate, every one of them patronage 
appointments. In some cases, the people who have been appointed 
have directly and clearly admitted that they were appointed as a 
result of patronage.
<P>
	The second to last person appointed from the province of Alberta 
clearly stated: ``I recognize that I am being appointed to the Senate 
as a result of the longstanding service that I have done for the 
Liberal Party''. The Prime Minister was very happy to have him 
there.
<P>
	The last person who was appointed to the Senate admitted that 
she should have been elected, to which I say that if she would do 
the honourable thing she would resign.
<P>
	The Liberals are noted for half measures. I suggest to them that 
this might just fit. If Liberal members, in good conscience, were to 
vote in favour of this motion, as amended by the Reform Party, at 
least we could start along the process of seeing some changes 
happen to the other place because truly they must happen. The 
Reform Party stands for a Triple E Senate, elected, effective and 
equal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a 
citizen of Quebec, as a representative of a Quebec riding, and as a 
member of the Bloc Quebecois, I have absolutely no hesitation 
about taking part in the debate today in support of the motion by 
my colleague, the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, calling for the abolition of the 
Senate.
<P>
	The reason I have no hesitation is because I know that a large 
majority of Quebecers no longer want the Senate, and have not 
wanted it for some time now. We know that during the period 
surrounding the Charlottetown negotiations the consensus was 
generally in favour of abolishing the Senate.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	This consensus had been reached much earlier, however, in 
1980, the year of the referendum. At that time, the key federalist 
players, as represented by Claude Ryan in his beige paper, were 
calling for the abolition of the Upper House. So the nasty 
separatists were not the only ones to have had this idea.
<P>
	A little background is necessary. I would like to remind you of a 
speech given in this House over two years ago by my colleague, the 
member for Richelieu, in which he gave a very interesting history 
of the institution known as the Senate. It is worth repeating briefly.
<P>
	My colleague reminded members that the other House was a 
vestige of colonialism, that it had been created to protect rich 
landowners from the more populist sentiments of elected 
representatives. As proof of this, he mentioned the $15,000 one 
was required to have. Do we realize how large an amount this was 
in those days? Of course, only the rich had that much money. They 
protected the interests of their rich fellow citizens, a practice that 
has by no means been suspended, far from it.
<P>
	Of course, the role of the Senate has evolved. However, as with 
many other institutions, theory and practice are often poles apart. 
Rich landowners were replaced by faithful political servants. 
Abuses of all sorts have been abundantly recorded and publicized. 
There is no need to go over them all again. The work of members 
has more to do with the political agenda of the major parties than 
with pure research. The Senate has become the means the 
government uses to avoid contradicting itself publicly, to protect its 
reputation when it finds it has made a mistake. It has become a 
discreet but oh, so faithful, tool for the elected members of the 
major parties.
<P>
	A very good example of this is the process used for the bill on 
electoral boundaries readjustment. That time, the process was so 
flagrant that several members condemned it here in this House. As 
recently as yesterday, we were given proof of how undemocratic 
the very existence of the Senate is. All the newspapers reported that 
the Senate had refused to adopt the bill on Pearson airport. There 
can be no better example of the arrogance and power of the Senate.
<P>
	How can it be acceptable that people who are appointed, not 
elected, not answerable to the public, can decide on their own 
initiative that a bill which has been seriously examined and debated 
for a number of hours in the House of Commons can be shoved 
aside just like that?
<P>
	Even if I were opposed to the bill, I would still be disgusted to 
see that these people appointed for political services rendered, to 
either the Liberals or the Conservatives, and others who have no 
obligations to anyone, could take it upon themselves to decide the 
future of the biggest airport in Canada?
<P>
	How do the members of the party in power, the members of the 
same party which made sure it had a majority in the Senate, feel 
today, now that they know that even the people they appointed to 
carry their colours in the other place have contributed to the 
undoing of a bill the vast majority of them in this House were in 
favour of?
<P>
	How do they feel knowing that, instead of proposing 
amendments, the other House simply rejected the bill? That is not 
very flattering for the Liberal members, is it Mr. Speaker? This is 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4187"> 4187 </A></B>
<P>
best example of the absurdity of  the Senate and the best reason for 
calling for its immediate abolition.
<P>
	Despite their wishes Quebecers are paying the cost of an 
institution they no longer want. The cost is huge. In 1995-96, the 
budget is over $42 million. What about the unemployed whose 
benefits have been cut so the federal government can save money 
on their backs? What about women who are single parents living at 
the edge of poverty facing the possibility of having their welfare 
cut, because the provinces' money is being cut by the federal 
government?
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	What about young men and women looking for a first job and 
being hit with the repercussions of a lack of job creation policy. 
What about old people, whose pensions may well be cut. Imagine 
the frustration of all these people, who know that huge amounts of 
money are being spent each year to provide a sumptuous lifestyle 
for an institution that no longer fulfils its primary purpose and for 
which they have long had no use.
<P>
	And then we wonder why Canadians opt out? Why they have 
become so bitter toward their politicians? How can people not see 
that Canadians feel they are not being listened to? Canadians are 
right. That is why, in supporting the motion by my colleague 
calling for the abolition of the Senate, I want to have heard the 
voice of those not listened to.
<P>
	Power must be given back to those it belongs to-the 
voters-who, as my colleague for Kamouraska said, see the Senate 
as nothing more than the symbol of Parliament's inefficiency and 
ineffectiveness. I know the Liberal government has no intention of 
considering the abolition of the Senate, because we have been told 
there are other priorities.
<P>
	It should be one of the government's priorities if we are to end 
duplication. With an elected House, I see no need to pay for another 
House to do the same work. We were elected and we are 
accountable to the people. We must be accountable, whereas the 
other House can intercept a bill without being accountable to the 
public. This is why I strongly support the motion by my colleague 
from Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I wish to remind the 
hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup that, as members 
of Parliament, we have a responsibility to work for the common 
good of our country. We have a responsibility to adequately 
represent the public and to serve its interests as best as we can.
<P>
	The interests of Canadians have to do with economic prosperity, 
jobs, equality, justice, safety within their community and national 
reconciliation. The issue of whether or not the Senate should be 
abolished is not a priority for them right now.
<P>
	The government listens to Canadians. Its response is clearly 
reflected in the measures announced in the throne speech and in the 
budget. These measures seek to improve relations between 
governments and to meet the concerns of Canadians. According to 
a Gallup poll, unemployment has been at the top of the list of 
concerns for Canadians, including Quebecers, for 10 years already. 
This is the issue they want their government to tackle.
<P>
	During the first half of its mandate, our government took 
measures to create conditions promoting sustained economic 
growth and job creation. It launched a major administrative reform, 
reduced the deficit and took initiatives regarding trade and 
international investments.
<P>
	However, these achievements do not tell the whole story. They 
do not tell that over half a million jobs were created in the 
Canadian economy since we took office, that the unemployment 
rate went down 2 percentage points and is now under the 10 per 
cent mark for the first time in five years. Our government also 
undertook to put public finances on a healthy footing.
<P>
	As you know, since its election, our government has followed a 
pragmatic approach regarding the renewal of the federation. It 
remains focused, as always, on issues of interest for Canadians, 
namely the economy, jobs and social programs.
<P>
	However, it is hard to believe this is the case for the official 
opposition. Instead of making a constructive contribution to help 
Quebecers join their fellow Canadians from the other provinces, 
the Bloc Quebecois disregards Quebecers' true interests.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	It is clearly stated in both the speech from the throne and the 
budget that our focus will be on preparing Canada to meet the 
challenges of the 21st century.
<P>
	In fact, the first ministers' conference that will start in just a few 
hours fits in with our commitments, as a step toward renewing the 
federation.
<P>
	The first ministers will be discussing how governments could 
better work at creating jobs in Canada, preserving our social safety 
net and developing a joint program of changes aimed at renewing 
our federation. Those are the issues that concern the people of 
Canada. Those are this government's priorities. These should also 
be the official opposition's priorities, because what do Canadians 
from all provinces want if not for their governments to work in 
co-operation to bring in changes that will have a direct and positive 
impact.
<P>
	First of all, we have promised to limit the federal government's 
spending power in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. The 
government will no longer use its spending power to develop new 
shared-cost programs in areas of provincial jurisdiction. It is the 
first time in our history that the federal government offers to limit 
its own powers outside a formal constitutional negotiations setting. 
This is a milestone in the evolution of federalism. We believe that it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4188"> 4188 </A></B>
<P>
is through this spirit of co-operation with and respect for the 
provinces that we will promote Canadian unity.
<P>
	At the social level, the government promised to ensure that 
Canadians can continue to rely on a secure and sustainable social 
safety net. Again, we will work in co-operation with the provinces 
to preserve the kind of social programs Canada is famous for. That 
is what our government's commitment to social solidarity is all 
about.
<P>
	The government also made a commitment to clarify, in 
co-operation with the provinces, the respective responsibilities of 
the various levels of government. We are withdrawing from areas 
for which responsibility lies more appropriately with the provinces, 
the municipalities or other stakeholders, areas like occupational 
training, certain sectors of transportation, forestry, mining and 
recreation.
<P>
	Three weeks ago, our government announced it was completely 
withdrawing from the area of manpower training. This is a fine 
example of allowing the provinces to adapt programs to their 
specific needs. This is an important step toward a federalism that 
better meets the needs and aspirations of Canadians.
<P>
	At the economic level, the government will continue to work in 
co-operation with the provinces to reduce barriers to domestic 
trade and manpower mobility.
<P>
	This is how our government is renewing the Canadian 
federation: by proposing constructive and practical solutions to the 
issues concerning Canadians, moving step by step in a climate of 
dialogue and respect.
<P>
	I urge my colleagues in the official opposition to co-operate with 
our government in helping Canada, and especially Quebec, move 
forward.
<P>
	Ever since I started my speech, Bloc members have been asking 
me: What does this have to do with the motion before us? I would 
like to quote from an editorial by Pierre Gravel that appeared in the 
June 5 edition of <I>La Presse</I>. This editorial, headlined ``Temps 
perdu'', ends like this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the harshest critics of the Senate finally realized that attacking this institution 
is totally futile under the current Constitution, which requires unanimous 
approval for any change at that level, something that is not going to happen 
tomorrow in Canada. Any member who tries to revive this debate must have 
nothing better to do. But the most troubling in all this is that his leader is letting 
him go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is why I chose to use my time to show Canadians that we 
have a lot of work to do and that abolishing the Senate would not 
help us in any way to renew federalism. What Canadians really 
care about is employment and social security.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to say a few words about abolishing or 
not abolishing the Senate and the value of a Senate.
<P>
	I feel that the original motion which was to abolish the Senate is 
not good enough and we could not support it. However, I feel that 
by adding the amendment to the motion, in its present form, 
definitely has some merit. After having abolished the Senate in its 
present form, we replace the Senate with a representative body that 
is equal across the land from province to province, that is effective 
and that is elected.
<P>
	Imagine a Senate where the people of Canada get to vote for its 
members. Imagine a Senate where there are three representatives 
from each province, or the territories when they get in, and they are 
elected by the people. Imagine a Senate that is so equal that it could 
now concentrate on its effectiveness in representing the regions of 
the country. Imagine a Senate which is allowed to protect the 
interests of the Atlantic provinces. Imagine a Senate that is allowed 
to protect the west. Imagine a Senate that is allowed to protect 
Quebec. Imagine a Senate that is allowed to effectively represent 
the province of Ontario.
<P>
	Imagine if we elected senators who were effective and equal 
across the land, a Senate that could have some powers and truly be 
a chamber of sober second thought, that could send back to this 
House legislation which is ineffective or distorts the balance across 
the country or which unduly or unfairly, because it perhaps was 
overlooked by the House of Commons, hurts one region of the 
country too much while maybe helping another region of the 
country.
<P>
	We are a country with five or six distinctive and different 
regions. We have a House of Commons which is elected on the 
basis of representation by population. Sometimes we miss, distort 
and hurt certain parts of the country because of that. Representation 
by population is a sound and the basic fundamental of democracy. 
It is necessary, important and must always be upheld.
<P>
	However, there has to be a balance brought into rep by pop 
through regional representation. The only effective way that can be 
done is through the Senate. However, the Senate, in its present 
form, that is appointed by a Prime Minister who appoints only his 
political cronies and friends and then says ``your there to represent 
my party'', like this Prime Minister has said, is not the purpose of a 
Senate.
<P>
	I am not questioning the quality of some of the people in the 
Senate. I am questioning how they get there. I am questioning 
whether their loyalties are to the party that is in power or to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4189"> 4189 </A></B>
<P>
region and communities they come from, where they have grown 
up, made their living and  have many friends. Would it not be far 
more effective and reasonable to have senators representing the 
areas they come from because they know those people and 
understand them?
<P>
	It would enable them to send bills back to this House if they 
unduly affect the francophones outside of Quebec who are afraid of 
being assimilated. Could not those three senators from Quebec 
stand up and look at the Official Languages Act or an official 
languages bill and say: ``Look, this bill is not good enough for 
Quebec and this is why. We want to send this back until the House 
recognizes why this is not good enough for Quebec.'' Would that 
not have a better balance of power than we have right now?
<P>
	Our system is weak. It is weak that we freely elect a dictator 
every four years, somebody who, with his or her little cabinet, can 
do at will whatever he or she wants to do. That is democracy at its 
worse if it is abused. We have opposition members and 
backbenchers to keep them in line. However, we can swing the 
pendulum too far in one direction.
<P>
	What we need is systemic change. Imagine a democratic system 
where Canadians could finally have a system of government, which 
we are close to having now, that would truly be effective, one 
which would not only have the principles of representation by 
population, which is fine the way we have it now as our electoral 
system is good, but one that would contribute and add a Senate that 
would be equal, effective and elected across the land so that we also 
know that these people have some strength, some force and some 
say.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	What about effectiveness? What powers should senators have? 
The House of Commons should be supreme. Representation by 
population should be supreme. As a check or a control and a 
chamber of sober second thought, just in case, however 
inadvertently it may happen, something comes into the Senate 
which the senators know is wrong for the people whom they also 
represent, something that the masses of the House of Commons has 
ignored or overlooked, they then look into a bill.
<P>
	Hypothetically they say: ``On this bill, we say that this language 
act is unfair to Quebec and therefore we need to protect the 
francophones outside of Quebec a little better and this is how we 
recommend you do it''. They make an amendment. They send it 
back.
<P>
	Let us say that the Senate holds free votes. If two-thirds of the 
Senate says no a bill would come back here. We fix it. If the House 
then says: ``No, we disagree'', it goes back again. Then both houses 
will have listened to the debate and everyone understands everyone 
else.
<P>
	On money bills, however, the House of Commons should be 
supreme. Senators would not have the right to  deny the funds that 
the federal government needs to spend, which it thinks on behalf of 
Canadians is the way it wants it. The Senate could not affect money 
bills or money bills would need a higher percentage of votes to 
send them back in case the government is doing something that the 
Senate feels is unfairly hurting one region.
<P>
	On money bills the Senate should have no say or need a higher 
percentage of votes to send them back. However, the budget is 
another matter. Bills that affect an allocation of funds and on other 
bills like gun control, Pearson airport, Official Languages Act or 
anything like that, senators would have the right to improve them if 
they need improvement. What would be wrong with that kind of 
system?
<P>
	Imagine a system where we had a second check or control and 
that chamber of sober second thought said: ``This is a good bill. 
This helps everybody across the country''. Can you imagine the 
harmony, Mr. Speaker, and the unity and the national pride that we 
would create with a system where both houses work together as a 
team? I know, Mr. Speaker, your son knows a lot about teams and 
teamwork. That is what we have to do in this country.
<P>
	We are creating a system that is divisive. We are supporting and 
defending a system that pits region against region. The funds that 
we are trying to redistribute to help those people who need help are 
not being spent in a way that gathers and earns respect. Why do we 
not look at the system and change it?
<P>
	Here is an opportunity for people who believe in democracy to 
throw partisan politics aside and to think what is in the best 
interests of all Canadians. I would suggest it is a system that works. 
It is a system that Canadians could support. We need that. Even in 
the House of Commons we can do some systemic changes here to 
improve things. That is not the issue here today. It is the Senate.
<P>
	We need to have an equal, effective and elected Senate, have the 
best Constitution and have the best legal minds work together on a 
parliamentary system that would complement this House of 
Commons, not fight the House of Commons.
<P>
	I am sick and tired of making fun of the Senate. I should not have 
to make fun of the Senate. I do not want to make fun of the Senate. 
However, I will as long as we have a Prime Minister who abuses, 
misuses, misrepresents and openly, defiantly tells Canadians: ``I 
will select whomever I want to select and he will represent my 
party over there''. That is not what a senator is supposed to do.
<P>
	I would be embarrassed to be the senator so named. I would want 
to come from Alberta as a senator and say: ``I represent Alberta. I 
am glad the Prime Minister appointed me but I am going to 
represent Alberta, even  if, like Senator Sparrow, I have to vote 
against a Liberal bill''. That is effectiveness. If something is wrong 
with a bill, send it back here and we will look at it to see what is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4190"> 4190 </A></B>
<P>
wrong. Take this Pearson airport bill. It would be our job to fix it, 
get it through, so it is in the best interest of all Canadians.
<P>
	That is what democracy is all about. That is what we should be 
working toward instead of this strict, biased, prejudicial, 
narrow-minded, self-serving, democratic dictatorship that we elect 
freely every four years. We pretend that it is working but it is not. I 
challenge all of those in this House, the 295 members of 
Parliament, to look at our democratic system and put their best 
efforts, put their thoughts into how it can be improved.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to the motion of my colleague, the 
member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
	History has shown us that, from the very beginning of the 
Canadian federation, the need for the Senate has been constantly 
questioned. At the time of union, as I was mentioning the other day, 
the Fathers of Confederation could not agree on whether it should 
be elected or appointed, because, since 1856, they had had an 
elected legislative council.
<P>
	Therefore, the united Canada which came into being in 1840 was 
more advanced than the institutions we know today. We took a step 
backward in 1867, with an appointed Senate with responsibility for 
protecting the regions, minorities, and, although this was not 
spelled out, the general public against the abuses and excesses that 
might be committed from time to time by the House of Commons.
<P>
	It was perhaps justifiable in 1867 to think that the House of 
Commons might, in the heat of the moment, take measures 
requiring some control by the Senate. This is no longer true today, 
with the advent of universal suffrage. We must remember that 
women in Canada did not have the vote until 1919-20. Limitations 
on the right to vote were abolished and any Canadian citizen aged 
18 and over is now entitled to vote.
<P>
	Accordingly, the reasons set out in 1867 for having another 
House no longer obtain. Almost all Canadians are agreed that the 
Senate is no longer necessary, and that it should be reformed or 
abolished, but almost everyone agrees that that will not happen.
<P>
	I was listening to the speech by the member for Calgary Centre a 
little earlier, in which he gave a perspective of the Senate of Canada 
quite different from mine. Personally, as an elected representative 
from Quebec, I am not interested in having a stronger Senate, an 
elected Senate, in Ottawa. What would be the result?  This Senate, 
of course, would acquire legitimacy in the eyes of the public. If the 
24 senators from Quebec were elected by the public, it would 
strengthen the central institution. It would be one more House to 
reinforce the power of the federal government, to the detriment of 
provincial governments, and it would take up a position somewhere 
between the provincial first ministers and the Prime Minister of 
Canada. It would be just one more obstacle, not to the Reform party 
but to distribution, to the proper operation of the system.
<P>
	Some time ago we reached the conclusion that the Senate was 
not reformable, since everybody wants reform but nobody wants 
the same reform. The Reform members want one that is elected, 
equal and effective, suggesting six to ten senators per province, 
regardless of population, in a Senate that would have the same 
powers as the House of Commons and be elected by universal 
suffrage.
<P>
	Liberal members, or rather the Liberal Party, stated in the red 
book that the Senate would merely be elected, so already there is a 
divergence between the two. And what do we want? Basically, we 
are here to promote Quebec sovereignty. We are therefore not 
fighting to reinforce federal institutions, but to reform this 
institution, theoretically, in a way which might be desirable. If 
indeed we were here to reform federal institutions that might be 
possible, but that is not what we are here for. As well, any 
reinforcement of federal powers will take away from the powers of 
the provinces, Quebec in particular.
<P>
	Reform members have chosen to influence Ottawa by reforming 
institutions. They said: ``If the provinces were properly represented 
in an equal, elected and efficient Senate, that would be one way for 
them to exercise more power''. We take a different approach, 
knowing that we will never have a majority in this country, but that 
we will have a majority in our own space, which is: ``Let us 
withdraw from the Canadian federation''. It will probably be easier 
for Quebec to withdraw from the Canadian federation than it will 
be to reform the Senate.
<P>
	So I have a hard time with the amendment by the member for 
Vegreville, who proposes to abolish the Senate in its present form. 
In principle, I could say yes, knowing nothing would come of it.
<P>
	Earlier, the member for Vaudreuil said, getting back to the 
relevance of the debate, in his last two sentences, that an editorial 
had said the unanimity rule was required. It has not often been 
raised in the context of amending the Constitution to permit the 
abolition of the Senate.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	In my opinion, section 38 of the Constitution Act, 1982, the 
seven and fifty rule, would normally apply with, in my opinion, the 
mandatory approval of Quebec, since sections 23 <I>et sequentes</I> of 
the British North America Act of 1867 contain provisions on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4191"> 4191 </A></B>
<P>
senators with respect to Quebec specifically. I think Quebec should 
be one of the parties assenting to the abolition of the Senate.
<P>
	However, speeches in election campaigns and here in the House 
and perhaps the inability to do anything have prevented anyone 
from taking the initiative. Fortunately, the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup has taken this initiative, which 
will at least shed some light on things, following the latest events. 
Yesterday, for example, the bill on the Pearson airport was defeated 
by a House that is not accountable to anyone for its actions. Before 
that, there was Bill C-69 on electoral boundaries. A bill of this 
elected assembly which had been developed in committee for one 
of the first times in the history of Canada's Parliament was 
defeated by the Senate. It does tend to stop you in your tracks when 
people who have not been elected come and tell you how to get 
elected. Some things just do not work.
<P>
	My colleague, the member for Beauce, said the other day that, in 
his riding, three voters out of four favoured abolishing the Senate. 
In my riding, the proportion is probably slightly higher.
<P>
	In 1978, I was 30 years old and did not even have $4,000 worth 
of belongings-had I, though, and it does not take long to 
accumulate if you know you are headed for the Senate, you can get 
a loan-but had Prime Minister Trudeau been in my riding and said 
to me: ``My fine young man, you would be an asset to the Liberal 
Party of Canada, would you be interested in being a senator in 
Canada's Parliament?'', I might have said yes at the time. I would 
have been here for 45 years, because the Prime Minister liked my 
smile or enjoyed a brief conversation. There are no selection 
criteria, other than pleasing the prince of the moment.
<P>
	I prefer the more difficult, demanding and valid rule of going 
before the supreme court of the electorate every four or five years 
as we do. This is what makes you and me and the members of this 
House, wherever they sit, responsible for our actions. This is what 
we have in common.
<P>
	It is not just because our name appears on the ballot every four or 
five years, but it is generally because people reach us in the riding, 
because we see them. The calls come in, the letters come in and we 
are in constant contact with our electors, who judge us. However, 
98 per cent if not 99 per cent of the time our electors are unable to 
identify the senator representing them.
<P>
	So when it comes time to vote, I will see whether I will support 
the motion of the member for Vegreville, that is, the amendment. 
As for the motion by the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, I will certainly support it, 
particularly because the hon. member is currently circulating a 
petition addressed to the House of Commons in most ridings in 
Quebec seeking the abolition of the Senate.
<P>
	I would suggest that voters lucky enough to be represented by a 
member of the Bloc Quebecois sign this petition. Those who are 
not, whose member is from another party, should ask their member 
or another one to have it sent to them. We would be happy to send 
it. It will be no easy job abolishing the Senate, but we have always 
said that the first step in such an undertaking is particularly 
important.
<P>
	On this point, Mr. Speaker, I wish you a fine and restful summer. 
You look tired; come back refreshed in the fall.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief in my 
intervention.
<P>
	I think the motion presupposes that the government, by a stroke 
of a pen, would be able to abolish the other place. That speaks to 
the ignorance of the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	There is no system of law making in any country that is perfect, 
but before we belittle the other place let us remember that in the 
history of our Confederation, with the two Houses in place, we are 
still the number one nation in the world in which to live.
<P>
	With respect to the work that is done by the Senate, we have to 
recognize the thoroughness with which some special projects have 
been undertaken, the excellent research, the excellent reasoning 
and policy formulations which have made a great impact on the 
country. As well, we have seen some of its legislative work and 
even involvement in some of the diplomatic activities.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	It is very important to remember that today the Senate is still the 
forum for regional concerns. On that basis it has a lot of merit. It is 
indeed a Chamber of second thought and second mind. I believe 
there will be a time when we will have an effective, equal and 
elected Senate.
<P>
	The process of election of members to the other place is not the 
ultimate criterion for legitimacy. Let us recall that members of the 
Supreme Court of Canada are appointed to that body, yet nobody 
has questioned the legitimacy of the Supreme Court of Canada and 
the justices who sit in that highest court. It is fallacious to conclude 
that because the process is by appointment it is not legitimate. In 
other words, it does not make the process necessarily negative.
<P>
	I believe the challenge to all of us is to have quality in 
appointments. I am proud that the Prime Minister of Canada has 
seen to it that the quality of candidates is truly excellent. That they 
happen to be Liberal does not detract from that quality. The 
Canadian people in 1993 entrusted their confidence in the Liberal 
Party of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4192"> 4192 </A></B>
<P>
	And so we have to respect the other place. We have a sample 
of Canadian ingenuity and Canadian genius when one body is 
elected and the other body of Parliament is appointed. On that 
note, I would like to have an improved other place. However, we 
have to show continuing respect for that other place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to speak to Motion No. 221 which calls for 
the abolition of the Senate. I am particularly delighted today to 
speak to it because of what happened yesterday when the Senate 
rejected the Pearson airport bill.
<P>
	If this motion were a bill that would lead to the abolition of the 
Senate, if it were put before the House today and put to a free vote, 
I think the bill would pass. The general feeling in the House after 
what happened yesterday is that the Senate has walked on its own 
grave, it is time for the Senate to go. In the next general election I 
expect every major party to have a platform on the Senate because 
of what happened yesterday.
<P>
	Why is it so significant? The Senate has rejected a piece of 
legislation that was passed by this Chamber, a Chamber which 
represents the people of Canada. Every member in this Chamber 
was elected by the people of Canada. The bill went to the Senate 
and it was rejected by a House, another place, whose members are 
not elected but appointed.
<P>
	It is immaterial whether the senators are Liberal or Conservative 
or what their political affiliations are. The important point is the 
Senate interfered with a fundamental democratic process, which is 
that the House of Commons is supreme. When legislation leaves 
this place it cannot be rejected by the other place. It can be 
corrected, it can be amended. The Senate has an important role to 
examine legislation for flaws but it does not have the right to kill 
legislation, except in the most extraordinary circumstances.
<P>
	The Fathers of Confederation saw it as a Chamber of second 
thought that would step in should the elected assembly go 
completely out of control, but only in the most exceptional 
circumstances, a constitutional circumstance perhaps or a charter 
of rights circumstance, not in bread and butter legislation, which 
the Pearson bill was. It was totally inappropriate and the 
government is now in the position that it has to consider what its 
next move is to be.
<P>
	I am only a backbencher and so I fortunately do not have to 
speak for the government, but I can provide an idea of the types of 
choices the government is facing.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	We will obviously not back down on this. There is $600 million 
in taxpayer money at stake, so the government has to move on this. 
It has two choices, as I see it. It can redraft and make certain 
changes to the bill,  run it through the House of Commons process 
and then back to the Senate.
<P>
	The other option is to prorogue Parliament and have a new 
speech from the throne. Then the bill can be reintroduced exactly as 
it is.
<P>
	I suggest the government will probably be considering that very 
seriously as a point of principle. To change the bill even slightly as 
a result of what happened yesterday in the Senate would be a 
concession to the Senate in a way that I do not think the 
government should do.
<P>
	The government still has a problem. If the bill goes back through 
the process, it will cost countless thousands of dollars in the time of 
this Chamber, the clerks and all the people who are behind the 
preparation of the legislation. Even if it goes back through this 
House and to the Senate again, there is a risk of the same thing 
happening of a tie vote and the legislation being rejected.
<P>
	The government has to look ahead and consider how it can 
guarantee the bill will go through the Senate the next time around. 
It has the option, as did the previous government over another bill, 
to create eight more Senators. The Prime Minister has the power to 
go to the governor general and create eight more Senators.
<P>
	When the previous Prime Minister did that it caused quite an 
outcry. It was regarded as the Prime Minister's interfering in the 
Houses of Parliament. People did not see that the Prime Minister of 
the day had just cause, in my view. He was facing the problem of 
legislation which had gone through the entire democratic process 
and had been blocked by an unelected body.
<P>
	The perception of creating new Senators underscores even more 
the uselessness of the institution when it comes to interfering in the 
proper procedure of the House of Commons. I do not think that is a 
good option. I do not think it would go down well. The government 
has to make a very serious decision about what to do with the 
Senate. Obviously we cannot allow it to go forward to have this 
incident occur a second time.
<P>
	The motion put forward by the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup is a good motion, and the 
government should seriously consider it. We should abolish the 
Senate.
<P>
	One of the objections raised by some members who spoke on 
this issue is that the motion does not define what we replace it with. 
I certainly have some thoughts about that, and the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre had considerable thoughts.
<P>
	There is the suggestion of the three Es: elected, effective and 
equal. The problem with that scenario, an elected Senate, is we will 
have the same type of situation as in the United States of two 
democratically elected bodies. That would actually paralyse 
Parliament. It would not be effective at all.

	We already have an efficient system. What we have to do is 
return the Senate to the original idea of the Fathers of 
Confederation. As mentioned during the Meech Lake accord 
discussions, it should represent the regions of the country. We 
should find a formula where the Senators are appointed for a very 
short term but reflect regions of the country. That would be a big 
step toward addressing some of the concerns of my Bloc 
Quebecois colleagues.
<P>
	The motions simply says abolish the Senate. I agree. Let us do 
that first and then we can talk afterwards on the new formula for the 
Senate. I feel very strongly in light of what happened yesterday, the 
interference with the decision of the elected body, the House of 
Commons, that the other place should now become no place.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, time is going by 
rather quickly and I will probably be the last speaker on this topic. 
When there is discussion, things can change. The Liberal colleague 
who just spoke was shaken by the arguments of the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, but also by something that took 
place last night in the other House.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	In fact, it is quite strange and unexpected that we should be 
discussing this today of all days. What happened yesterday was 
very serious. For lack of one vote, the House has been brought to a 
halt. As the member just said, if nothing changes and the 
government wishes to maintain its position, it will have to present a 
new bill and the same thing may happen all over again.
<P>
	However, we should perhaps qualify this. It seems that what we 
saw yesterday was a certain laxity on the Liberal side of the Senate. 
Apparently a Conservative senator was not present at the start and 
would not have been able to vote, and that could have made all the 
difference. There was a lack of vigilance, such that the situation in 
which we find ourselves was avoidable. The system cannot bear the 
whole blame, but the situation is nonetheless amusing.
<P>
	Coming from Quebec, as I do, and having discussed this many 
times with the member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup-it is 
rather the opposite, the member for Bellechasse is right, we often 
alternate, particularly at the end of session. I think this is the 
ninetieth time I have risen to speak since the throne speech.
<P>
	I do not, however, agree with my other colleague, the member 
for Vaudreuil when he says there is no point in discussing the topic. 
We cannot accept the comments of the member who just spoke, 
whose riding I have forgotten, Hamilton-Wentworth I believe. In 
question period, I saw the Minister of Transport upset at what had 
happened yesterday, and he was right to be upset.
<P>
	The member for Vaudreuil spoke about everything under the sun. 
He seemed to be practising for the campaign trail. If his 
performance is any indication, we can expect an election this fall. 
He really seemed to be practicing a campaign speech. He said that 
it was useless to speak of it, that it cannot be changed, that 
unanimity would be necessary and cannot be obtained-a fine 
admission of powerlessness by a member of the House of 
Commons under the current federal system.
<P>
	I agree, it is true that it is hard to change. I would even say 
virtually impossible. It is impossible for us here to abolish the 
Senate, we cannot. It seems that some sort of stratagem will have to 
invented somewhere if it is to be done, for it has become frozen in 
time.
<P>
	Frozen in time since 1867, and this change cannot be made, 
although it translates the desires of many, in Quebec and elsewhere. 
No way of changing it. Talking Constitution or changes in Quebec, 
no way either, it requires unanimity. For the past 30 years, we have 
seen constitutional rounds come and go and we always end up in 
the same dead end. One day, something will have to be done.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois think that, as far as Quebec is 
concerned, what is needed is for the rest of Canada to accept 
Quebec's becoming sovereign and to discuss with it an offer of 
economic and, yes, political partnership. I think that would make a 
huge change and would be along the lines of the formula of Upper 
Canada and Lower Canada, which was in place before the Union 
Act. That formula is worth re-examining, not just copying, for 
times have changed. That could bring about a change.
<P>
	Along with the hon. member for Bellechasse, I am telling the 
people of Quebec and elsewhere who agree with us that the Senate 
should be abolished, because it costs $43 million a year and cannot 
be touched by the voting public, that they ought to sign a petition 
asking that the House of Commons abolish the Senate. This is an 
institution that is no longer of any use. I have nothing against the 
people individually, some of them are extremely decent people, but 
that is not the issue. When we do not have to be answerable to the 
voters for our actions, I think that the exercise of a modern 
democracy is not possible.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	I therefore support the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup in his undertaking, which I must 
say is far from pointless. If a lot of Quebecers and Canadians 
support this motion, one day it will bear fruit, and we will manage 
to abolish this system which costs us $43 million.
<P>
	In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me take my turn in wishing you, and 
all of my colleagues of all parties, a good vacation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. The hour 
provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business has

	Does the House give its unanimous consent to the motion put 
forward by the hon. parliamentary secretary?

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEVARENNESCENTREFORMAGNETICFUSION">THE VARENNES CENTRE FOR MAGNETIC FUSION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today in the adjournment debate. A number of 
questions have already been raised on the issue, but I am going to 
try once again to make the Liberal government listen to reason and 
review the decision by the Minister of Natural Resources to stop 
providing $7.2 million in funding annually to the tokamak project 
of the Canadian Centre for Magnetic Fusion in Varennes.
<P>
	I would first like point out that people were unanimous in 
condemning the minister's decision to make this cut. All those 
involved opposed her decision. Neither the minister nor her 
department consulted the public, the scientific community or even 
the financial partners in the project.
<P>
	The absurdity of the decision is so obvious that even the federal 
Liberal organization in the riding of Verchères where the Centre is 
located was opposed and asked the minister to go back to the 
drawing board.
<P>
	The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration along with the 
minister responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec apparently even met representatives of the 
local Liberal association to express their grave concerns over the 
withdrawal of federal funding for the Varennes tokamak project.
<P>
	Not only does the Liberal government not have any respect for 
its partners, it clearly shows a lack of vision for the future. The 
tokamak project of the Canadian Centre for Magnetic Fusion in 
Varennes is a future-oriented high-technology project since it 
concerns a new clean, abundant and job-creating form of energy. 
By withdrawing now from the international research effort in the 
area of fusion, we will deprive ourselves of the technology 
transfers associated with it and we will miss the boat when this new 
form of energy is finally implemented.
<P>
	It must be noted that, once again, figures show a shameless 
waste of public funds: not only will 20 years of research and 
development work in the area of nuclear fusion be sacrificed, but 
$70 million in infrastructures will be wasted, including $11 million 
in equipment that has never been used. On top of that, the 
dismantling of these facilities will cost $20 million.
<P>
	Besides these economic factors, we must consider the losses in 
terms of human resources. Without a job, these researchers, 
scientists and specialists will offer to other countries the expertise 
developed here with our taxpayers' money.
<P>
	But this is only the tip of the iceberg because this is becoming a 
general problem. In terms of the share of total research and 
development funding invested by the federal government, Quebec 
is once again the big loser in this federation. The figures speak for 
themselves.
<P>
	The minister tried to present figures in such way that it looked 
like Quebec was getting 25 per cent of the total research and 
development funding from her department. That is not the case at 
all. Not taking into account the regional concept invented by the 
minister and adding the expenditures correctly, we get a much 
different result.
<P>
	In actual fact, Quebec's total share of the R and D spending of 
the Department of Natural Resources now stands at 17 per cent, and 
the total share that Quebec would receive without the tokamak 
project would drop to only 12 per cent. This does not include the 
AECL budgets, because when they are added, we drop from 8 per 
cent to 6 cent.
<P>
	This withdrawal of the federal government is completely 
incomprehensible. Why cut the only long term energy research 
program, which is located in Quebec? What is the reason for this 
unjustifi-
<P>

<B><A NAME="4195"> 4195 </A></B>
<P>
able cut, the relevance of which is being questioned by all 
stakeholders?
<P>
	While it is maintaining funding for the neutrino project in 
Sudbury, Ontario, while it is increasing by $15 million the funding 
for the TRIUMF project in British Columbia, the Liberal 
government has the gall to axe one of the most important energy 
research projects located in Quebec. It is quite simply scandalous.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
opportunity to participate in this debate about federal government 
funding of the national fusion program.
<P>
	For a number of years the federal government has co-funded 
research and development of fusion, the national fusion program, 
in partnership with Hydro-Quebec and Ontario Hydro.
<P>
	The cost of the Quebec part of the national program, the 
Canadian Centre for Magnetic Fusion at Varennes, has been shared 
by the federal government, Hydro-Quebec and the University of 
Quebec. The federal government's contribution to the Quebec 
program is currently $7.2 million annually.
<P>
	Since 1981 the investment by the federal government in fusion 
research at Varennes has amounted to $90 million. This investment 
has helped to develop scientific expertise and industrial technology 
in Quebec and it will continue to pay dividends in the future.
<P>
	In nuclear energy the mandate of Atomic Energy of Canada 
Limited is to seek to maintain a viable, competitive business in 
supplying and servicing CANDU reactors at a reduced cost to the 
federal government. This will mean that AECL will no longer 
conduct non-CANDU related basic science. AECL is working with 
the federal government to wind up or transfer elements of its basic 
science programs to other facilities if possible.
<P>
	High technology industries in Quebec will continue to benefit 
from the nuclear industry through contracts developed from 
CANDU sales to Korea and through the good performance of the 
Gentilly 2 CANDU reactor.
<P>
	Consultants' studies show that a typical CANDU 6 sale overseas 
could bring over $100 million in contracts to Quebec and generate 
about 4,000 person years of employment. AECL expects to sign 
contracts for the sale of CANDU reactors to China in the near 
future and there are prospects for the sale of additional units to 
Korea.
<P>
	These two corporations, among the very largest in Canada, have 
received a year's notice of the federal government's intent to 
terminate funding for the national fusion program. The federal 
government will work with  them to ensure a smooth transition. We 
are continuing to fund the program in the current fiscal year.
<P>
	These are the principal reasons that have gone into the decision 
by the federal government to end funding for the national fusion 
program.
