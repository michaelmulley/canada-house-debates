</p>


	<A NAME="Int-169589"></A><a HREF="#Int-169604"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-169598"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings--Hants, PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will continue the speech that I commenced two days ago in this place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were terribly disappointed by the way the government handled the air security issue with the budget. Clearly all Canadians are concerned about the issue of air security. No one in the House and no Canadian would argue with the importance of that issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is putting a $2.2 billion tax on Canada's most vulnerable industry, the airline industry.  This is an industry that has seen a remarkable level of consolidation in the last couple of years, the disappearance of almost all competition to Air Canada, a reduction in the level of services and a commensurate increase in the price that Canadians must pay for those reduced services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen what has happened to the CanJets, the Canada 3000s and Royal Airlines. At a time when some of these entities are trying to finance a return to air spaces the government is putting a $2.2 billion tax on this industry and forcing airlines and airline passengers to bear the complete responsibility in terms of paying for the air security tax.   As many members have articulated on the floor of the House and in committee the benefit of secure air travel is received by society in general. There is a collective benefit to secure air travel. That is why in the U.S. there is only a $2.50 charge per flight as opposed to the $12 charge per flight that the government is putting on air travel.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a competitive disadvantage from a tax perspective for Canadian businesses and individuals compared with the U.S. The long term trend of the government relative to its management of the Canadian dollar may mean that at some point in the future $2.50 U.S. would be approximately equivalent to $12 Canadian, but we ought not to wait for that form of equalization to occur.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is the U.S.  recognized  there was a collective benefit and while user charges and fees would cover some of the cost, there was a recognition that these fees should not be used to cover all of the costs, particularly at a time of economic tumult that  impacted the airline industry more so than perhaps any other industry right now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be bad enough if the government  was simply charging Canadian air travellers and passengers to cover the complete cost of air security, but the government  is going one worse. The government  is charging $1 billion more over the next five years than that which would be required to cover the basic cost of security. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finance officials have provided their methodology for having come to the $24 round trip fee and it is based on highly specious data. It is based on data that reflects a passenger count that  is considered far lower than what would be the case over the next several years. This was based on an almost immediate post-September 11 passenger count and some extrapolation of that reduction which  occurred after September 11, but certainly does not reflect what most observers and analysts of the travel industry feel to be a more realistic assessment of air travel in Canada over the next several years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government seems to be exploiting fears around September 11 to create a $1 billion tax grab in order to pad the books to improve general revenues in other areas. Not only is this bad public policy, it is morally reprehensible that the government would take such a terrible tragedy and use it as another way or means by which to wring an increased surplus out of Canadians. It is clearly wrong.</p>


	<A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like EI surplus two which was an income security package or program designed to improve labour market flexibility and help unemployed Canadians by providing a cushion during bad times. The government used that program to pad the books of general revenue. Now it is taking an air security situation that emerged out of a tremendous tragedy and is using this situation to extract more tax revenues out of Canadians for general revenue and Liberal spending in other areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we think of that Liberal spending in other areas, nobody in the House would argue with increased levels of health care spending or transfers to the provinces for health care and education. Under the government we have seen a dramatic reduction in health care transfers and transfers to the provinces. In fact fiscal restraint for the government means tightening the belts of the provinces by cutting back on transfer payments. It rarely means tightening its own belt and its own program spending.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those cutbacks to transfers have resulted in a health care and education crisis in every province in Canada and a growing gap between have and have not provinces. Certainly some wealthier provinces, Alberta for instance, have the tax base to, in some cases, pick up the slack when the federal government makes such draconian cuts. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a  province like mine, Nova Scotia or, for instance, the province of British Columbia with the difficulties that province is undergoing from a budgetary perspective, we simply do not have the tax base to pick up the slack when the federal government makes such draconian and unilateral cuts. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the whole issue of fiscal imbalance between the provinces and the federal government is gaining such importance and why there is so much agreement across Canada by the premiers that this has to be addressed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a growing fiscal imbalance in Canada. The provincial governments have as their ultimate responsibility the providing of health care and education. The federal government has reduced its role in terms of the funding in those areas so the provincial governments in some ways have what Mark Twain would refer to as a bad job. They have all the responsibilities but no authority. The provinces increasingly lack the ability to have tax levers to raise the type of revenue necessary to cover growing costs in education and health care. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government, by pulling back, has created a situation whereby  it can then re-enter national programs like the millennium scholarship program or the Canadian foundation for innovation and some of these other programs and  appear like a hero. It provides the cheques with the maple leaves on them and takes credit for  returning with a teaspoon some of the money it previous took out with a backhoe. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is offensive to see this type of destructive federalism, this  brinksmanship  of provinces by the jurisdictional power grab of the federal government. There has been a trend by the government to again take over a lot of the traditional jurisdictional areas of the provinces by  starving the provinces of the revenue necessary to deliver the services and then reappearing like some sort of fiscal super hero with giant federal cheques.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  is bad politically for a country that depends on maintaining constructive federalism on an ongoing basis. It is also  bad public policy, because ultimately the provinces and municipalities, as the government levels closest to the people being served, are in many cases better able to assess the needs of those individuals and of those constituents to ultimately  deliver  services.</p>


	<A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medicare evolved out of a provincial experiment in Saskatchewan.  A visionary premier   saw a  way to approach health care in a more egalitarian  and thorough way and in a way that has come to define us as Canadians.  Over a period of time and working with the federal government and   with the support of parliament, medicare evolved to a national program. In some ways the provinces represent  the best laboratories to experiment with and  to develop  social policies which ultimately  will make better policies in other provinces as well as  nationally.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a province experiments with health care and is faced with significant federal cuts and  is put in a position where it has to do something to maintain some reasonable level of service delivery and tries to be creative about it, the federal government brings in politics by doing public polling.  Instead of working with the province to ensure that the principles and values  we treasure as Canadians are met in potentially new, creative and cost effective ways, the government fights the province.This is constitutional brinkmanship at its absolute worst.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many areas the government ought to  have focused on in its budget. In recent days we have read statements by the Deputy Prime Minister blaming Canadian businesses for not being competitive enough.  He is the same individual who as industry minister  said that high taxes were good for business because they make businesses work a little harder.  The only other person I can think of in the House who exemplifies economic buffoonery as much as the Deputy Prime Minister is the Prime Minister.  Perhaps that is why they are getting along so well these days.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of the government blaming the private sector for not doing enough, it should acknowledge its role in helping the private sector do more.  May I suggest a couple of modest initiatives  the government could undertake to help the private sector do more.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One initiative might be the elimination of   capital taxes in Canada.  We are one of the few industrialized nations that taxes companies simply for having capital, not for profit, but for capital.  When capital is taxed, it pummels investment.  When investment is pummeled,  initiative is pummeled and this defeats and destroys productivity.  That is one modest example of what the government ought to do and something I am offering constructively to members opposite.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another  initiative would be the elimination of the capital gains tax.   Canada did not have a capital gains tax before 1971.  There is no other tax that has a more pernicious impact on the growth of individual  and family capital in order to ensure  savings and growth of investment required for individuals and families, but also entrepreneurs,  many of whom have their entire net worth  tied up in a business.  Reducing further capital gains tax with the ultimate goal of eliminating it would make a great deal of sense.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard the government claim that our capital gains tax is lower than that of the U.S. This is a patently false statement.  The fact is  the inclusion rate and the ultimate effective capital gains tax is still significantly higher than that of the U.S.  It would be an affordable area of taxation. We could not only equalize our level of taxation with the U.S., but for once we could  be ahead of the U.S. if the government chose to eliminate personal capital gains tax in Canada.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect that very little in the way of revenue is collected from personal capital gains tax given the tumult in the capital markets over the last year.  Even during the bull markets the year before last,  only  about $3 billion was collected in capital gains tax.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government  can send $500 million worth of cheques to dead people, rich people, prisoners and students who do not heat homes with heating oil. If it can blow $500 million in a pre-election spending spree designed not at heating homes of Canadians but at trying to heat up Liberal prospects in ridings across Canada,  I would suggest it could go a little further. It could give Canadian investors, Canadian families, Canadian individuals and Canadian entrepreneurs an advantage over the U.S. by eliminating the capital gains tax.</p>


	<A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other statistic with which I suspect most members may not be familiar.  Over 60% of personal capital gains tax  in Canada are paid by individuals who make less than $50,000 per year.  The degree to which individuals in Canada from a wide range of income levels and socioeconomic areas now participate in the capital markets has never been as great.  Part of this is mutual funds as a vehicle through which to ensure diversification with fairly small levels of investment, but the long term trend is that more Canadians  than ever before from a wider range of income levels than ever before are investing.  Canadians are making these types of investments.  It would make a great deal of sense to assist Canadians a little more. A further capital gains tax reduction would make a great deal of sense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we hear the discussion of productivity, clearly it is not just tax levers and tax reform that  are  required.  It is  not just tax reduction that is required. I would argue that we need significant broad based tax reform in Canada focused on productivity.  We also need regulatory reform. We need   to work with the provinces across Canada on a national agenda addressing productivity issues in our tax system and in our regulatory system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond that we need to address issues of government spending.  Clearly when taxpayers' money is spent on items that do not necessarily reflect  the values of Canadians, the needs of Canadians or the long term best interests of Canadians, that money being wasted as such can actually have the perverse impact of reducing productivity. It  encourages individuals to pursue activities that may not only not be in their best interests, but also may actually foster worse productivity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier the issue of fiscal imbalance. We have to readdress the issue of equalization in Canada.  Equalization is an extraordinarily important social program.  It is the only constitutionally enshrined social program in Canada.  As it is now, our equalization system  is broken.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original goals of equalization in 1958 were to provide approximately equal levels of  taxation and services across Canada.  Clearly with the growing disparity between provinces both in services and in tax levels, that needs to be addressed.  We should address it by reconsidering our economic development strategy as well.  We should develop more effective tax based levers as other countries have utilized to develop more effective economic development strategies which would ultimately address some of the fiscal imbalance issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried to cover a fairly wide range of issues, those which  the government covered in the wrong way, but also those that the government ought to have covered but  failed to cover.  I hope that during questions and comments members of parliament will  ask questions that will allow us to discuss some of the other issues we  may share an interest in but which are difficult to cover in such a short period of time.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, probably my colleague  and I share the concern about the effectiveness of the committee on Bill C-49.  I would like to have the member state his position on this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee at some expense had a number of witnesses come before it, both in the prebudget consultations and also on Bill C-49 specifically.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the prebudget consultations there were numerous witnesses who said that the donations to private charities should receive the same tax treatment as those to public charities. The witnesses were unanimous in their  statements  on that. The committee recommended it to the finance minister, but it is nowhere to be seen in the budget implementation act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the discussion on Bill C-49  witnesses unanimously said that the structure of the security tax would  be devastating to the small carriers.  Again, the committee in this case chose to ignore it with highhandedness from the Prime Minister's Office. Other coercive tactics  were used as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the hon. member to comment on that.  I hope he is as angry about that as I am.</p>


	<A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. angry young man from Elk Island for his intervention. We all have effective ways of dealing with anger and I would be willing to sit down with him for counselling any time. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member  is an extremely effective member of the House of Commons finance committee. He shares with me a concern that the committee process is becoming less and less functional as we see  the executive branch of the government and the Prime Minister's Office exercise control. I would add  the cabinet as well but I do not think even the cabinet has much to say about how things are going on that side of the House any more.  I think   the Prime Minister's Office increasingly is exercising control over  members of parliament on that side.  It is also trying to exercise control over committees which by their nature are more effective and functional when they operate in a more co-operative non-partisan way. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very disappointed that the concerns about the air security tax which were raised by every single witness who appeared before the committee  were ignored.  They were not really ignored by the committee.  There were Liberal members of parliament, including the member for HIllsborough, who expressed concerns.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact the hon. member for Hillsborough had said at committee that he was not going to vote for the air security tax without amending it. He supported an opposition motion  to reduce the air security tax by 50%.   Of course the chairperson recognized that if a vote occurred at that particular moment,  the air security tax would have been reduced by 50% by the committee.  As such she recessed the committee briefly and miraculously 30 minutes later when the committee reconvened the member for Hillsborough was not there.  He had disappeared.  I moved at the committee that we send him a get well card.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member  came back about 20 minutes later looking like he had just lost his puppy, with a florid face after having been taken into the whip's torture chamber.  He expressed that he had changed his mind, that he saw the ways of the government on this one now. He said   that  he had received reassurances from the Minister of Finance that this issue would be revisited in the fall and the minister would reduce the tax if it was taking in more revenue than what was required.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not just fall off a turnip truck.  The Minister of Finance committed to scrap the GST and did not. The Minister of Finance  has benefited from building a surplus on the backs of workers and small businesses with the EI fund. Are we  supposed to take him seriously when he says he is going to reduce the air security tax if it takes in too much revenue?  The Minister of Finance  is a taxaholic. We do  not  expect the government or the Minister of Finance to make good on that commitment.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunate that we are seeing an increased level of control of committees by the Liberal whip as an extension of the Prime Minister's Office and the dysfunctionality which is inherent in that.  Committees need to work effectively for parliament to work effectively.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the hon. member for Elk Island and I will continue to go to those meetings and do our best to make the committee   functional and effective but it sure does get frustrating sometimes.  I know some of the Liberal members opposite are just as frustrated with it as we are.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  while the hon. member across the way outlined all sorts of issues, he failed to mention a few.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out   that we are the only G-7 state that is balancing its  books. This year we are paying down the national debt. We have paid $36 billion over the last four years on the national debt. We have had  five consecutive budgets in a row in terms of balancing the books. We have a stimulus package and a tax package that  will be greater than that in the United States given the size of our economy, and it is front end loaded. We have ended 28 years of deficit. Those are the things  the member did not point out. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also point out that under the strategic funding initiatives, $9 billion this year, $11 billion next year and $7.7 billion over five years will go toward enhancing personal economic security for Canadians. We will   spend   $2 billion on strategic infrastructure projects and $1.1 billion over three years to support skills and learning. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also point out that personal income taxes are down. I am sure   my colleague did not deliberately neglect these facts but   that he simply overlooked them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would seem that   the  member  on the  other side is not the best in terms of listening sometimes even though we were attentive to our colleague across the way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member  might want to comment on the fact that in terms of our party's record on the economy, it is much better than when his party was in power. Maybe he would like to comment on the fiscal situation that we inherited and how we have built upon that since 1993.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this will be  like shooting fish in a barrel. First, I thank the hon. member for his softball question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of  the deficit, according to   German, U.S. and U.K. accounting standards, Canada is in a deficit right now. By Canadian accounting standards, we are cruise controlling to deficit. The only way the government narrowly averted that was by deferring some corporate taxes to next year. It was not a tax break but a  deferral  to try to avoid that.   Don Drummond, the chief economist of TD Bank, referred to it as fancy bookkeeping.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rick Borotsik: </b> Arthur Andersen and the Canadian government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Scott Brison:</b>  Yes,  it is the Enron government accounting practices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the U.S. tax package, the hon. member is simply wrong. The fact is we have and, after the full implementation of our Canadian tax reduction, will  still have significantly higher personal income taxes, corporate taxes and capital taxes than in the U.S. That is one of the reasons   the U.S. continues to be a magnet for capital and this country under  his government continues to be a repellant. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has among the highest income taxes in the G-7 and  the second highest corporate taxes in the OECD. This  is hardly a record to boast about. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad the member  mentioned the previous government's record.       The government in 1984 inherited a $39 billion deficit, which, as a percentage of GDP, was    9%. Over a nine year period  that government reduced the deficit as a percentage of GDP from 9% to almost half of that, to around 4%. At the same time it had the courage to introduce a free trade policy and used political collateral to leap ahead of the Canadian public and actually take a political risk in the 1988 election to introduce a free trade policy. It  actually took the political risk of getting rid of a manufacturers' sales tax, which was pummeling investment and hurting productivity, and replaced it with the GST which was a more rational tax. It made more sense economically. Politically, it was about as popular as a skunk at a picnic, but it was the right thing to do. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where was his party on all those issues? His party was vociferously fighting against every single initiative of that government, not just to reduce the deficit as a percentage of GDP but also to implement the types of policies required to guide Canada through the nineties as those policies have to a period of greater prosperity and success for all Canadians. That government planted the seeds and this government picked the flowers.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I think some of the flowers they picked were obviously dead.   In any event, it is my pleasure to speak to  Bill C-49, the  budget implementation bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would implement several measures of the 2001 budget.  As hon. members will recall, the 2001 budget was introduced after the aftermath of the tragic events of September 11 in the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the budget builds on the government's long term plan for a stronger economy and a more secure society, it also addresses the immediate economic and security concerns of Canadians as a result of those events.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government initially responded, and swiftly I might add, to the events of September 11 with legislation that takes aim at terrorism and enhances Canada's ability to identify, prosecute and punish terrorists, and measures to cut off sources of financing for terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 budget builds on these initiatives through a comprehensive set of security measures designed to keep Canadians safe, terrorists out and our borders open.  It  provides $7.7 billion over the next five years to enhance security for Canadians and make Canadian borders more secure, open and efficient.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included in this amount is $2.2 billion in funding for air security and the creation of the Canadian air transport security authority which will deliver enhanced security services at airports and on board flights according to rigorous new national standards set up by Transport Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Established under Bill C-49, the new authority is to  be responsible for the certification of screening personnel and for providing pre-board screening of passengers and baggage, armed police on board aircraft and the acquisition and operation of screening equipment, including that used in searching for explosives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An air travellers security charge that comes into effect April 1, 2002, will fund these new security expenditures.  The charge will be paid by air travellers, the primary beneficiaries of these enhanced security measures, and will be collected by air carriers or their agents when airline tickets are purchased.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For travel in Canada, the charge will apply to flights connecting airports where the air transport security authority will be responsible for passenger screening.  The charge on domestic travel will be $12 for a one way trip and $24 for a round trip.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charge on a ticket to the continental U.S. will also be $12 and $24 for travel outside Canada in the continental U.S.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All proceeds from the charge will be used to fund the enhanced air travel security system and, if revenues exceed costs over time, the charge will be reduced.  The government, as the minister has indicated repeatedly in the House, will review the charge in the fall.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This enhanced security system will  assure air travellers that Canada's air transportation system remains one of the safest and most secure in the world.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with addressing the immediate security concerns of Canadians, the 2001 budget also addresses immediate needs through targeted investments designed to boost the confidence in the economy in a fiscally affordable way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By investing in strategic infrastructure, skills, learning, research, health, aboriginal children, the environment and international assistance, the 2001 budget reflects the government's long term plan while providing important support now for the economy</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way in which the budget achieves this is through the Canada strategic infrastructure fund which would be  implemented through Bill C-49.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modern economy of the 21st century requires a backbone of sound fiscal infrastructure to sustain the nation's growth and  our quality of life.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous budgets allocated funding to improve provincial and municipal infrastructure.  The 2000 budget, for example, introduced both the infrastructure Canada program and the strategic highway infrastructure program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government recognizes the need for additional support for large strategic infrastructure projects which can bring lasting economic and social benefits while providing both stimulus and long term productivity benefits.  To address this need and to implement other federal infrastructure initiatives, the government is creating the Canada strategic infrastructure fund with a minimum federal contribution of $2 billion in funding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working with provincial and municipal governments and the private sector, the fund will provide assistance for large infrastructure projects in areas like highways and rail, local transportation, tourism, urban development, and water and sewage treatment.</p>


	<A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment ago I mentioned international assistance as one of the strategic investments in the 2001 budget.  Canadians have not lost sight of their obligations to help less fortunate peoples of the world.  At the G-8 summit in Genoa last July, African leaders presented their proposal for  a new partnership for Africa's development and the G-8 leaders pledged to support this initiative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then the Prime Minister has restated his commitment that the development in Africa will be one of the main themes in the G-8 summit that Canada will host in June in Kananaskis.  In recognition of this commitment, the 2001 budget announced $500 million over three years for African development to help implement these objectives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Canada fund for Africa, which would be  created through Bill C-49, will establish a government program to provide funding for activities that  will help reduce poverty, provide primary education and set Africa on a sustainable path to a brighter future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is committed to providing every opportunity for Canadians to upgrade their skills. Whether through the education system, through on job training or through universities  and other centres of advanced research,  the government has long recognized the value of investing in people.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we introduced the Canadian opportunities strategy in the 1998 budget.  The 2001 budget further encourages the acquisition of skills and learning by Canadians.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Bill C-49   provides  tax assistance to help apprentice vehicle mechanics registered in a provincial program cope with extraordinary tool costs.  Beginning in 2002, they would be able to  deduct for income tax purposes the cost of buying new tools to the extent that these costs in a year exceed the greater of $1,000 and 5% of their apprenticeship income.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another measure provides  tax relief for adult students who receive government assistance for basic education at the primary or secondary school level.  Bill C-49 exempts from income tax any tuition assistance for adult basic education provided under certain government programs, including employment insurance.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also helps more students undertake lifelong learning by extending the education tax credit for people who receive taxable assistance for post-secondary education under certain government programs, including EI.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. members know, the quality of life of Canadians is closely tied to preserving and improving our natural environment.  The 2001 budget includes new spending and tax measures intended to ensure continued progress toward a cleaner and healthier environment.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these measures is included in Bill C-49 and concerns commercial woodlot owners who can currently be subject to income tax when transferring woodlots to their children.  As a result, woodlots may have to be harvested prematurely to generate the revenues required to pay the tax on the transfer, which can be detrimental to the sound management of this resource.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-49 extends the existing intergenerational tax deferred rollover for farm property to intergenerational transfers of woodlot operations that are farming businesses managed in accordance with the prescribed forest management plan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should mention too that the budget initiatives with respect to renewable energy and energy efficiency are being implemented through the amendments to the income tax regulations which have already been released in draft form.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 budget also contained a number of other tax measures, all of which are designed to improve fairness in the tax system.  The bill makes permanent the 1997 budget measure that provides special tax assistance for donations of certain securities to public charities, and the 2000 budget measure that reduces the tax on employment benefits for donations of eligible securities acquired through stock option plans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another measure improves the system for providing GST credits.  Beginning in July 2002, GST credit entitlements for a quarter will be based on the individual's family circumstances at the end of the preceding quarter not at the end of the previous calendar year.</p>


	<A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide a cash flow benefit for small businesses the federal corporate tax installment payments for January, February and March, 2002 would be deferred for at least six months without penalty.  To make it easier for foreign investors to use limited partnerships in structuring venture capital investments, Bill C-49 would ensure their non-resident partners were not considered to be carrying on business in Canada solely because investment management or administrative services were provided by Canadian residents. The final tax measure would allow full deductibility for the cost of meals provided to employees at construction work camps where the employees could be expected to return home each day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A remaining measure relates to improved parental benefits under the Employment Insurance program. The current 50 week cap on the combined amount of sickness, maternity and parental benefits an individual can receive under EI means women who become ill may not have full access to  extended benefits.  To enable a mother to receive her full entitlement to special benefits, effective March 3, 2002 the cap would increase by one week for each week of sickness benefits she took while pregnant or while receiving parental benefits. A second EI measure would improve   on the parental benefits that could be  claimed following the birth or adoption of a child.  It would provide parents  a window of up to two years within which they could claim.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given members a brief overview of some of the key measures of Bill C-49.  I remind the House that the events of September 11 have not changed the government's fiscal resolve.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, the 2001 budget builds on the government's long term plan for a stronger economy and more secure society.  It also responds to the short term concerns of Canadians. We will continue to invest in people, cut taxes, reduce debt and build a stronger economy. Above all, we will continue to pursue our long term plan to invest in the future without going back into deficit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude by paraphrasing the Minister of Finance who said the 2001 budget was about dealing with the present so we could seize the future. The measures of Bill C-49 would help us achieve that. I urge hon. members to pass Bill C-49.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-169623"></A><a HREF="#Int-169633"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-169614"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I pretty well knew everything the hon. member would say in advance because I have heard it from the other side over and over.  I will ask a question about one of the items. If no other members rise I will come back with a second question.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals seem to  be experts at maximizing the political spin from the announcement of  things which have little effect or in many cases no effect.  One of these is the tool tax exemption for mechanics.  As long as I have been here, which is more than eight years, we have had representations from  mechanics who in some cases are required to invest up to $40,000 or $50,000 in tools to do their work.  Other individuals who need to make investments to earn a  living are able to claim exemptions. Doctors, lawyers and dentists can do this. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member: </b>Liberals can do it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ken Epp:</b> Liberals can do it. However mechanics have not been able to.  The government says it is responding to this with a new exemption that would allow deductions for tools used by mechanics. Yet when we read the fine print we find it would only apply while they were in their apprentice year. That is  unrealistic.  First, in their early training and apprentice years mechanics have very low incomes and do not have enough money to fully fund the cache of tools they need.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, if we look at it we realize the exemption would only cover up to $1,000 worth of tools. If their income was greater than $20,000 that would be the cap.  If it was  less than $20,000 they could only claim 5% of their income.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of tools required by new mechanics is not related to how much money they  make.  They need the money.  Why the government would not give them at least a $1,000 deduction irrespective of their income is a mystery to me. It wants to milk the maximum out of an announcement that does very little for the people involved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the hon. member  stand and defend the government's answer as to why the exemption is so mediocre, inadequate and inept?  I would like the answer on the record because I will make sure it is duplicated and sent to the people who have made representations to me.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague across the way knows the Canadian Automobile Manufacturers Association  has sent a letter of support with regard to the announcement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not disagree that mechanical tools are expensive. I hope I do not have a conflict of interest  but my nephew happens to be a mechanic.  I can tell members firsthand that mechanics' tools are extremely expensive.  There is no question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hon. member knows, this is the step the government has taken on the issue. It is a positive step. I think the majority of members in the House would support it.  This does not preclude future initiatives in this regard.  Other trades have been indicated as well. However there is an interest in this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question a mechanic's tools can cost $30,000 or $40,000.  The reason, as many in the profession say, is that tools go walking.  The onus has been put on mechanics to buy their tools.  They do not get them all at once, as I am sure my hon. colleague knows.  They buy them over time because they are extremely expensive.  One piece can be extremely expensive.   I therefore think this is a good beginning.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put the issue in context, we want to ensure we do things responsibly and can balance our books. We and I am sure everyone in the House acknowledges that the measure was designed to deal with apprentices.  We have representations in support of that.  We have representations suggesting we should look at the issue further.  With the support of my hon. colleague on the finance committee I am sure this will be an issue  we can look at in the coming year.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-169635"></A><a HREF="#Int-169637"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-169633"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ken Epp: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope people watching us on television do not get the impression I am the only opposition member here. There are many others but  I guess they are not ready to engage the hon. member.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a second question about  the  topic. If we look at making rules that follow certain principles, which  is a good idea, it seems the Liberal government drafts so much hodgepodge legislation.  When an issue comes along they make up a rule. They have no principles to guide them.  The principle should be that a deduction, capital cost allowance or something like that should be available.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the principle for mechanics is that we give them a deduction while they are in training, why do we not do it for dentists?  Why do we not say dentists can deduct all the expenses they incur while buying equipment for their offices when they are in training but when the training is over we will end the deduction?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One principle should drive how we arrange deductions and capital cost allowances:  they should apply equally to all Canadians irrespective of how they earn their living. The hon. member  presumably created hope for the future by saying the government would go forward with the measure and possibly expand it. I must admit my expectations are not all that high.  However we will continue to push the measure and work on it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next question has  to do with the air travel tax.  The hon. member did not dwell on it a great deal but he said the security tax for air travellers would fill an important need.  I will pose a situation to him. I used to do a lot of my own mechanical work. I often worried while  working on the transmission or something that it would fall on me and I would not be able to breathe unless it were quickly taken off my chest.  I was always careful to use props and things that would prevent that from happening while I was under the vehicle.  I was a Saturday mechanic and did not have all the fancy tools people have.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is looking at the airline industry and saying “We will drop a transmission on this guy's chest.  We will come back tomorrow and if he is not breathing we will take it off.”  That is not the proper way to look at the issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have economists in the finance department  who are supposed to be able to look to the future and estimate the effects of different measures.  We were told in the finance committee that in this case it was not done.  No study was done on the effects of the air travel tax.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am  concerned that by the time the finance minister looked at the issue in the fall to see if the government was getting too much revenue the answer would be no because many small businesses which attracted air travellers and paid the tax would have gone belly up or stopped their services. Revenues would go down on that account.  The tax would not be reduced because there would be fewer people paying it.  In the meantime we would have lost many valuable services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the government not doing a study prior to implementing such a devastating tax?</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  with regard to tools used by mechanics and dentists, dentists are self-employed. There is a greater risk and therefore they get the capital cost allowance rollover because of depreciation versus  mechanics, particularly those who are employed by companies, who obviously have great expense as we pointed out earlier. This new measure in the budget would apply to those apprentices. One is a self-employed risk issue and one is employed by someone else. We are trying to address that issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the airport tax, I do not know that there is any definitive study that could be done on the initial devastating effects of September 11. We have seen changes in the market since then. We have seen Air Canada rehiring people. We have seen WestJet buy new planes and get new routes. All this has been since the budget was announced in December. They were aware back in December that the particular airport security tax was coming on board and yet they are rehiring, getting new planes and new routes. Obviously  the market is bounding back better than expected. We are pleased to see that.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverend MacKay, a renowned Presbyterian missionary hailing from Zorra township in my riding of Oxford, gave remarkable service to the people of northern Taiwan from 1872 until his death in 1901 and is now considered a national hero.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ingersoll Pipe Band and Warden Oliphant are in Tamsui, invited by the Presbyterian Church of Taiwan, in recognition of the official twinning relationship between Oxford county and Tamsui township. They will participate in the dedication of a park built to honour George William MacKay who carried on his father's work in that country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I extend best wishes to the Ingersoll Pipe Band and Warden Oliphant as they represent the people of Oxford county and  Canada at all of this week's events in Taiwan.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the old adage that there is nothing certain except death and taxes is something every one of us as Canadians has been able to say in equal measure. Now of course there will be a qualifier: unless one is a native.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again the courts are driving a wedge between native and non-native people of Canada with their questionable decision making. The recent federal court decision to exempt one group of people from paying any taxation, at any level, is bound to be rejected by all other Canadians. An exemption for natives covered by Treaty 8 will further alienate our aboriginal people from the mainstream of society and marginalize the natives themselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear thinking Canadians realize that reasonable levels of taxation are required to provide services to all citizens. Why does the government not realize that we can never build equality by dividing people?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we finally found the mystery document. The real mystery is not where it went. The real mystery is why  we spent $550,000 on a ragtag stack of random data sheets in only one language advising government of upcoming sporting and cultural events.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it a good tax?  No, there is no such thing.  Is it a necessary tax?  Again the answer is no.   It is far in excess of what aviation experts say is necessary.  It is far larger than what is being charged by the U.S. who the transport minister said was well behind us in airport security prior to September 11.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many initiatives the government can and must take before embarking on another Liberal spending spree.  It has no spending plan, no budget, no impact study on small and start up airlines and it has no plan on the implementation of the collection of the tax grab.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government should delay the new tax grab until studies are done, budgets are prepared and alternatives are developed and implemented.  This is the responsible thing to do.  To do otherwise is, well, Liberal.</p>

At the foot of Montreal's Victoria Bridge stands a monument in their honour.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday, at noon, the 178th St. Patrick's Day parade will set off in Montreal. It is with pride that we will join the Irish community to celebrate its roots.

	Mr. Speaker,  the Liberal government has a history of imposing high taxes in order to accumulate surpluses to make itself look good.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it was the EI fund and now it is the airport security tax. The government starts collecting this extreme tax on  April 1, even though it has  not yet hired any staff or bought any equipment and will not for many months.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that over the next five years this tax will accumulate at least $1 billion more than is actually required. How can the Canadian airline industry survive this unreasonable tax?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the finance minister reconsider this ill advised airport security tax immediately before it completely destroys the Canadian airline industry?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the split in the cabinet over the weak dollar is widening.  Yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister again blamed our lack of competitiveness on a lack of investment by Canadian business, but the finance minister said that Canadian firms can compete even if the dollar rises.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does  the Deputy Prime Minister believe that Canadian business could compete internationally if the dollar returned to the 76¢ level it was at before the Liberals were elected and started driving down the dollar?</p>

John Manley (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Infrastructure and Crown Corporations, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is not the policy of the government nor has it been the policy of the government to drive down the value of the dollar.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that Canadian firms can and do compete internationally, not just in the United States but in markets around the world, demonstrates their competitiveness.  Of course if the dollar were to increase in value then they would need to be that much more competitive. My belief is that they are making many of the efforts that are necessary to accomplish that.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister does not believe his government has been driving down the dollar, but just look at it from the time they were elected until now.  Who has been driving it down, the Canadian public?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Deputy Prime Minister now believes that firms can compete with a stronger dollar, then why will the Liberals not take steps to strengthen the dollar by cutting taxes, cutting debt and cutting wasteful spending?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it Canadian business that is uncompetitive or is it the Liberal government, which  has lazily relied on a low dollar rather than taking action to improve our productivity and our competitiveness?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, all the measures we have brought in over the years, including the creation of the Canada Foundation for Innovation, increased spending for research and development, support for the universities in doing research and development, investments in science and technology, that party has opposed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the things that governments have to do, including investing in education, support for post-secondary education and support for training and skills development.  These are the things that governments need to do. Likewise, businesses, as we know, have to make the investments that are necessary in technology, equipment, training and innovation.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this is amazing.  Those members  blame the Tories for everything that happened before they got elected and they  blame everything on us since they got elected, but it is the government that has increased the debt  by $34 billion, not  the opposition parties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991 there was what the Prime Minister called his weak dollar policy when he was finance minister, and  I will quote him.  He said he used it to “bring Canada back into a competitive position”.  The Prime Minister does believe in  a weak dollar position.  The Prime Minister and the finance minister have been making Canadians assume the position for the past nine years and we have not found it very competitive. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Deputy Prime Minister admit that the weak dollar policy of the Prime Minister and the finance minister has been a failure that has undermined Canadian competitiveness?</p>

We have seen an improvement  across the Canadian economy, sector by sector, over the last eight years. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, if the government calls that success I would hate to see its  failures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday  the Deputy Prime Minister claimed that Canadian industry was at fault for Canada's 30 year decline in productivity, but here are the facts.  Under the government's watch, we have seen decades of growth in program spending financed by increased taxes and deficits.  We have seen decades of decline in foreign investment in Canada, decades of growth in federal government debt and corresponding decades of decline of the Canadian dollar. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it that the Liberal government cannot see that its failed policies of high taxation and high government debt are the main reason for the dollar's decline?</p>

John Manley (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Infrastructure and Crown Corporations, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, we have the lowest level of government spending as a proportion of GDP that we have ever had, or at least in 50 or 60 years.  The changes we have brought about, including the reduction in government spending, particularly after the 1993 election, have been dramatic, with the largest reduction in program spending since demobilization after World War II.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where have these people been?  The achievements of the last eight years did not happen by accident.  The drop in the unemployment rate, the accomplishments  we have had in turning deficits into surpluses, the drop in interest rates and the boom in the construction industry:  these things  have not happened by accident.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, even alcoholics know that the first step to recovery is to admit that they have a problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of blaming others, the Liberal government must own up to its failed policies of the last 30 years.  For example, I want to quote  that famous economist, our Prime Minister. “I have said many times that the Canadian dollar has to float downwards” he  said  in February 1978.  In 1984 he said “I can personally live with a weaker dollar”.  Now the Deputy Prime Minister is trying to blame Canadian businesses for the Liberal government's failed policies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can the government not just take the first step to recovery and admit that the Prime Minister's policies were dead wrong?</p>

John Manley (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Infrastructure and Crown Corporations, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, he only wishes that our economic policies were a failure. He thinks by repeating the notion  they are that somehow or another he will make it so.  It does not work that way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I do not accept the characterization of my remarks in the least.  In fact, on the contrary, what I said was that as the Canadian dollar rises Canadian firms are going to need to make investments to ensure that they continue to be competitive.  That is consistent both with an innovation strategy and with a stronger currency.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the minister of fisheries denied the town of Canso quota needed to keep the Seafreez plant operating.  Without that plant the town may die. The decision by the minister was a devastating blow to one of the oldest fishing ports in Canada.  In his letter the minister said that  access to redfish “would be contrary to Canada's international stance that this stock is being overfished”.   Yet tonnes of that redfish are still in the water.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not be the same every year but, over a five year period, that is the policy. If, in the fall, it looks like revenues will exceed costs, the charge will be reduced.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the U.S. farm bill could have devastating effects on Canadian agriculture. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food was going to take our serious concerns to the lawmakers in the United States. Last month he was going to meet with the secretary of agriculture, Ann Veneman.  It did not happen. On March 4 he was going to meet with American congressmen. It did not happen. As a matter of fact, nobody seems to want to meet with the minister. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be heard on what I    encourage the Chair to adopt as an emergency debate application. As the Chair knows, this request is  pursuant to Standing Order 52.  In particular, I draw attention to paragraph 6(a) which refers to the criteria and which calls upon the House to consider “the matter proposed for discussion must relate to a genuine emergency, calling for immediate and urgent consideration”.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the people of the small town of Canso, Nova Scotia in the riding of Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough, this is perhaps the gravest emergency they have faced in a long time.  That  town is not unaccustomed to these types of emergency situations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision taken yesterday by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to deny an application, a proposal for division 3O redfish, has left the town with very little hope.  Its citizens were clinging to some hope that the  federal, provincial and municipal governments would come to their assistance.  Without the plant operating, the majority of the population of the town has no income, none whatsoever, because of the lack of industry, the lack of opportunity that exists for the town today.  The people there have been struggling for generations to make a go of it in the fisheries.  There was a time when a very prosperous and lucrative fishery existed in the town.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor of the town, Frank Fraser, along with his counsel,  MLA Ron Chisholm, the Canso Trawlermen's Co-op headed up by Pat Fougere, the union, the plant workers and everyone in that vicinity are looking to the government for some solution, some ability to keep the town afloat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town is completely reliant on that one industry.  The people there are now entering a black hole, a period in time in  which they have not worked enough hours.  Their EI is running out.  They have no access to any other government program.  They literally have no means to support themselves and their families.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small businesses that have existed in that town have closed their doors.  Many citizens have already left for places where they can secure employment.  Over 30 houses in the small village have been put up for tax sales because of tax arrears. Bankruptcies are looming.  A majority of the children in town rely  on a breakfast program that is offered by the municipality.  It is truly a grave situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responses to questions in the House by the acting minister of fisheries are insulting.  It is pathetic to suggest that this is somehow a political issue.  Time and time again we have seen Canso in many cases  used as a political football.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a crisis situation for Canso and there appears to be no ability for the people to get out of it.  They are looking to the federal government and to the Parliament of Canada to offer some solutions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   suggest that by partaking in a debate on the situation it is also indicative of other communities in the Atlantic and Quebec regions, to which the minister referred in his letter.  He said that  there are other crises.  I suggest there is none as serious or as grave as the one facing the town of Canso and its citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker,  I   very much urge you to please accept this application.  If you need more consideration or more evidence to suggest that it be supported, I   hope that at the very least you would hold your decision in abeyance until Monday.  There is a town meeting scheduled for  Sunday at which all citizens and all representatives will be present.  I   hope that the Chair will take this consideration very seriously.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The House resumed  consideration of the motion that Bill C-49, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in parliament on December 10, 2001, be read the third time and passed.
</p>


	<A NAME="Int-170017"></A><a HREF="#Int-170024"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-170011"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise I suppose on the bill.  I am displeased that the bill represents the 75th time that the government has invoked closure or time allocation since it came to power in 1993, abusing that very significant power to limit and shut down debate in this place more than any other government in Canadian history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is parliament.  Parliament is derived from the French word “parler” which means to speak.   It is the place where the representatives of the common people speak to issues that affect the common good.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the government to, for the 75th time,   prohibit members from speaking on behalf of their constituents and to the national interest on matters of grave concern, such as the budget implementation bill, is yet more unfortunate evidence of the government's growing arrogance and contempt for our conventions of parliamentary democracy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-49 seeks to implement the provisions announced in the budget of last fall.  First, I will direct my comments to that budget, then to the bill and then specifically   address the air transportation tax which I   raised in question period moments ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government seems to have no limit in its ability to pat itself on the back for its alleged self-proclaimed success in fiscal policy.  However, as we see from even yesterday's contentious remarks of the Deputy Prime Minister, Canada's economy and our standard of living has not in fact made progress under the government in the past 18 months, nor indeed in the past nine years. Canada's productivity and standard of living, its tax rates and  its public debt have all taken a turn for the worse.  Taxes  are up and  productivity is down; debt is higher and  our competitiveness is down; unemployment is twice the rate here as it is in the United Kingdom; labour productivity grows here at half the rate as it does in the United States.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 15 years we have lost 20% of our standard of living and the average Canadian family now has a standard of living one-third lower than that of an average American family.  We are becoming poorer as a nation as a result.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ultimately is reflected in the devaluation of our currency which has lost 25% of its value since the government took power in 1993, going from nearly 79¢ in 1992 to the current trading level of around 63¢.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does the government do?  Does it take responsibility?  Does it provide us with an action plan for reducing taxes and reducing debt to increase incentives for capital infusion and productivity?  Does it do those things?  No.  What it does do is blame the private sector, the very engine of economic growth in this mixed economy.  It blames the private sector for not investing enough.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the words of the Deputy Prime Minister, “It is up to them, it is up to the private sector, it is up to companies to increase Canadian productivity”.  He said  “They must make the investments”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a reason   Canadian companies are not making adequate investments to include productivity in areas of research and development.  It is because we have created an entire economic structure that mitigates against those kinds of investments. We have some of the highest corporate income taxes in the developed world. We have the highest marginal income tax rates among the seven largest economies of the world, the highest income tax to GDP ratio in the G-7. We have the second highest level of public indebtedness in the G-7, federal  and provincial debt, at about 80% of gross domestic product,    and the third highest in the OECD.   </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these things mean that it is harder to raise capital, which ultimately is the fuel that drives a free market economy, in Canada than it is in our major economic competitor, the United States and many other emerging economies, like the United Kingdom,  Ireland and  New Zealand, countries that used to be far down the list in terms of productivity and standard of living  but which have in the past decade leapfrogged Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not really think this is a partisan point because some of the senior members of the government opposite have admitted that  there is a problem.  The Deputy Prime Minister has been quite outspoken about this and even the Minister of Industry, in his recent innovation paper, has admitted there is a  problem, but they do not seem to have a grasp on the solution. The clearest evidence of that was the budget, which the  bill before us today would implement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remarkably, the government framed the budget at a time of  economic and security crisis, post-September 11, a time of recession and drag in the economy. Instead of making the difficult decision to get its priorities straight and re-allocate resources from wasteful and  low and falling priority areas to the urgently high priority areas of national security, defence and economic growth, the government did not do that. It failed when it came to getting its priorities straight. In fact it increased overall program spending in that budget by 10%, the largest program spending increase we have seen in the federal budget since the disastrous years of the mid-1970s, a government in which the Prime Minister was a senior minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe the government missed an enormous opportunity in that budget. It provided no plan for debt reduction over the next five years and eliminated the modest $3 billion to $5 billion contingency and prudence reserves it had originally established for debt reduction. It made minimal investments in national security, such that CSIS and the RCMP will not even be back up to their 1993 funding levels in real inflation adjusted terms after taking into account the cuts imposed on them in 1995. The defence department of course is left out in the cold while Canada will continue to have the second lowest defence expenditure as a percentage of national income in NATO, second only to the tiny duchy of Luxembourg.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every organization, from the Conference of Defence Associations all the way to the NDP and the Auditor General of Canada in between, have called for an immediate injection of at least $2 billion as an increase in the base budget of the Department of National Defence to bring our military up to a minimal level of operational effectiveness. The government failed the test in its budget to provide for that in the new security environment and,   unfortunately, missed the ball completely on tax reduction. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government implemented some modest tax cuts 18 months ago but   this year Canadians will be paying higher taxes than they did last year, particularly in payroll taxes  because of the massive 12% increase in CPP premiums which  far outstrip   the measly    5% reduction in employment insurance premiums. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decade of economic drift will continue because the government failed to get its priorities straight.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will  turn now to some of the specific provisions of Bill C-49 but    I will come back later to the air transportation tax and the air transportation authority. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, the official opposition supports the provisions of the bill that  deal with extending employment insurance benefits to parents of ill children.  We commend the government and the finance committee for having adopted our long standing recommendation   to change the provision surrounding the gifting of stock  shares to registered charities, and we support that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have very serious concerns about the Canada strategic infrastructure fund, a $2 billion potential pork barrel slush fund. We have seen in the past how the government has misadministered programs of this nature,  how it  has provided grants for bocce courts, canoe museums and luxury boxes in hockey stadiums that do not represent real, hard, meaningful infrastructure to improve our economy but rather represent pork barrel projects. </p>


	<A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	The infrastructure fund is a potential boondoggle of pork.  We are very concerned. The finance minister  had originally proposed a fund that would be arm's length from politicians but the Prime Minister's Office did not like it.  It grabbed it back and now the strategic infrastructure fund will be operating under the direct influence of the government in the person of the Deputy Prime Minister.  We have learned from the past that we should avoid politicizing funds of this nature.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Africa fund, there is very little in terms of scrutiny or accountability.  While we support in principle effective foreign aid, we do not support programs that are not properly accountable to parliament, which cannot be scrutinized by the auditor general and which do not fall under the aegis of the Access to Information Act.  We are very concerned about some of the enormous waste that has actually fuelled corruption in developing countries in Africa in the past.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   will now turn my attention to the most contentious element of the bill,   the $24 return trip tax on air travel.  Immediately following September 11, we in the official opposition  called for additional airport security measures, in addition to a whole suite of national security policies.  We applaud the government for adopting our recommendation   for air marshals.  Originally it was not going to do that, stating that  it   was not the Canadian way, but it listened to public opinion, and we appreciate that. We also understand there will be additional air security measures and costs associated to that.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the question is, what would be  the most efficient way of paying for those costs?  This is very serious.  It is quite clear to us and anybody who has looked at this, including the Air Transport Association of Canada, the Canadian Air Line Pilots Association, the travel agencies of Canada , the airlines themselves and the regional airport authorities,   that this policy was designed on the fly without regard for the impact it will have on the airline industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shockingly, at the finance committee,   government officials actually admitted that they had not done an economic impact analysis of the consequences of the $24 tax.  Imagine, a massive new tax on a specific industry already ailing, an industry without competition and an industry that has lost six airlines in the past seven years, is being assessed a new $24 tax which, according to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Air Transport  Association of Canada, could result in a reduction of air passenger loads by as much as 6%, and the government has not engaged in an economic impact analysis.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  is flagrant irresponsibility.  The government does not know how negative the effect will be.  It does not know whether or not short haul, low cost airlines, like WestJet, Canada's only profitable airline and its principal hope for long term competition in that industry, will survive this discriminatory prejudicial tax.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transport committee examined the issue at some considerable length and the government, in its typical arrogance, ignored the advice of those parliamentarians, including Liberal members,  when they recommended that additional airport costs be paid for by all stakeholders.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommendation 14 of the December 7 report of the Standing Committee on Transport   to the House stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>All stakeholders--including airports, air carriers, airline passengers and/or residents of Canada--contribute to the cost of improved aviation security. In particular, the amounts currently spent by airports and air carriers should be continued, with appropriate adjustments for inflation. A ticket surtax could also be implemented, and any funding shortfalls could be financed out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transport committee looked at this and said that the   only way  the  additional security costs could be financed would be through a blended approach with the airport authorities, the airlines, the passengers themselves and the government's general revenues because airline security was not just an issue for the     passengers on those flights.  As my colleague for Port Moody--Coquitlam--Port Coquitlam pointed out, most of the people who died tragically on September 11 were not aboard aircraft.</p>


	<A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are implementing these additional measures precisely because airplanes can be used as weapons of mass destruction against civil society.  We have a collective responsibility to increase security. We should finance it collectively.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every witness who appeared before the finance committee regarding Bill C-49 opposed vigorously its provision for a $24 air tax.  Neil Raynor, director of the Canadian Airports Council, said the council believes the “current fee structure will create disproportionate price increases on short haul and regional flights, unfairly penalizing smaller carriers who provide these services.” Raynor maintained that “acts of terrorism were acts against the state and government bears a major responsibility to fund the essential costs of policing and security.”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Chamber of Commerce said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The one-way cost of the Air Travellers Security Charge of $12, represents almost six per cent of the average price of a one-way domestic ticket sold in Canada in 1999...If a one per cent increase in ticket prices represents a one per cent decrease in passenger travel then the average air traveller security charge of six per cent will have a significant effect in terms of the number of air passengers.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Air Line Pilots Association said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The proposed legislation does little but create an expensive bureaucracy that will be unresponsive to the insights and interests of the people on the front lines of aviation security...it will be particularly crippling to short-haul domestic carriers such as Air Canada Regional and WestJet. We find it ironic, to say the least, that legislation intending to improve security of air travel in Canada could assist its very demise--</small></td>

<td><small>This tax will hurt an industry still recovering from the September 11 terrorist activities and the economic slowdown...The traveling public does not support this tax.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Hill, the vice-president of WestJet, said  it would be prejudicial to his airline.  He said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Once the tax is implemented, we believe the traffic will evaporate off the short-haul routes.

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Automobile Association said the current fee of $12 on a one way ticket appeared high when compared to the U.S. fee of $5.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Liberal member from  Prince Edward Island said he was not in favour of the $24 fee.  He said he invited the Department of Finance on two occasions to come forward with a detailed analysis justifying the fee and that on both occasions it failed to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $24 tax would be prejudicial.  It would not be sensitive to price.  If one flew  from Vancouver to Halifax on a $4,800 business class ticket the $24 fee would amount to a .5% tax.  If one flew on a $100 ticket from Edmonton to Calgary on, say, WestJet one would pay a total tax burden of 86% after all airlines taxes were factored in. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge my hon. colleagues opposite to listen to the facts, listen to the testimony and hear the concerns expressed by their own members about Bill C-49. It could be the death knell for airline competition in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the government to reconsider the bill.  It should look at the constructive amendments we have brought forward to amortize the costs of new infrastructure. It should bring in a pro rata fee to blend the costs the transport committee has proposed.  These are not partisan recommendations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the government  implements the tax  I hope it will seriously consider  the fact that even the junior finance minister was not properly briefed about elements of the bill which would be  prejudicial.</p>

	Madam Speaker, my hon. colleague from Calgary Southeast reminds me of when we used to have long playing 78 rpm records. We would put them on and they would skip and go over the same thing again and again like some kind of obsessive compulsive thinking.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point the member made was that the airport security fee in relation to, let us say, a $4,800 fare from Vancouver to Halifax  would have a different impact  compared to  a fare from Vancouver to Kelowna or Calgary to Edmonton.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member failed to mention that if we travelled from Vancouver to Halifax or from Vancouver to Kelowna and  went through security it would be a fixed cost. If we went through the machines it would be a fixed cost. To change the $24 fee and make it dependent on the price of the ticket would be cross subsidization. It would say to people travelling from Vancouver to Halifax “I am sorry folks but you must pay a disproportionate amount. The people going from Calgary to Edmonton will pay a disproportionate amount less”. It would amount to a cross subsidy. There is an argument for that. However the member opposite got so wound up in his own rhetoric he failed to mention  it would be a fixed cost. It would be the cost of going through security no matter where we were  travelling.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member knows full well  that WestJet has a robust business model. He has talked about it himself. Is he trying to tell the House a return trip from Calgary to Edmonton would decimate WestJet's volume of traffic because of a $24 airport security fee? I doubt it. I would like to hear his comments on that.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his questions. It is not me who is suggesting WestJet would be devastated on short haul routes like Calgary to Edmonton. WestJet is saying that. The hon. member should refer to the testimony of Mark Hill, the  vice-president of WestJet, at the finance committee. He clearly said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>On our super short-haul routes, that is, Calgary-Edmonton, Vancouver-Kelowna, Hamilton-Ottawa...the flat tax is an enormous percentage of our low fares...Once the tax is implemented, we believe the traffic will evaporate off the short-haul routes. Once the traffic goes, we'll have to back out of some of our short-haul flying, and once that begins, the genie is out of the bottle, and it's very hard to stuff the genie back into the bottle once that happens.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was  his testimony. I do not think it was an idle threat. People who work at WestJet  are concerned the tax could be devastating to them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not only assessing  a new $24 tax on the industry. On a  flight from Edmonton to Calgary with a base fare of $100 there is already a $26 Nav Can fee, a $22 airport improvement fee and $10.36 in GST. There would now also be a $24 flying tax. That would bring the total ticket price to $182.36, 86% of which would be taxes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member may not understand this, but if a couple going to Edmonton from Calgary to visit family were given a choice of driving three hours  or paying an extra $48 in taxes, which would easily buy a couple of tanks of gas, many people would opt to drive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member made a point that the security cost would be applied only once regardless of how far one was flying. That may be true. However the bill would also tax people who get little or no security. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People flying tiny six seat float planes from the south harbour terminal of the Vancouver International Airport Authority to, say, Salt Spring Island now pay $60 for a 12 minute flight. Because the south harbour terminal  falls under the aegis of the authority, with the new tax they would end up paying $24 for security even though there is no security at the airport and no need for security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not worried about terrorists hijacking six seater float planes on Salt Spring Island or the damage they could do to civilian infrastructure. Yet we would look in people's bags to satisfy the government  the fee was being applied to everyone whether on flights from Toronto to Tel Aviv or from Vancouver harbour to Salt Spring Island. They would all be affected. It is a stupid policy. I am surprised to hear the member supporting it.</p>

	Madam Speaker,  I think a few days ago a  minister from across commented that the reform alliance had pushed the government into putting in place user fees for different things that happen within our society.  My colleague just mentioned the numerous taxes on an airline flight.  We have airport improvement fees.  We have the NavCan fee.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister's comments would have indicated that these type of fees were in place because the reform alliance said that anybody who  used these services should pay.  Now what we have is a security fee or a security tax now being added on as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my perspective, I do not believe there should be any security tax in Canada, not for individual persons.  It just should not happen.  We are not just talking about the security of the airline itself, or the airport or those passengers.  We are talking about looking after our nation's security, not just those people who are on those flights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the member's comments in response to the minister's position the other day, that the government was doing these things in response to years of requests by the reform alliance to have  people pay a user fee for the use of specific facilities and industries.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I really would be  surprised if the government is doing things because we asked for it to do so.  I only wish that were the case.  We would all be paying much lower taxes in this country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, we support the idea that where an individual gets a direct benefit from a public service, there should be some user pay element in many instances.  I support in principle the idea of allowing tolls to be collected on major new infrastructure projects.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not comparable to that.  As I pointed out in my speech, this security is an advantage which redounds not only to the passenger but to all society.  The fact that we have safe airplanes is a benefit to us in this building right now.  We know we will not be attacked by a large civilian aircraft that has been hijacked.  It is not just a benefit to the passengers flying right now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of airline security  is a general social good which general society should contribute to proportionately.  That is what the transport committee recommended.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have user pay where the user benefits solely and directly, but not where society as a whole benefits.  I think a very compelling case has been made by all of the witnesses on this issue.</p>

	Madam Speaker, the member opposite in his question to my colleague for Calgary Southeast, the Alliance finance critic, used the fact that a round trip ticket from Vancouver to Halifax was  about $4,800 to defend his perspective that the air security tax was a legitimate one.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that a round trip ticket between Vancouver and Halifax costs $4,800 is a startling indictment of the government's air and transportation policy.  It speaks volumes about the government's failure to maintain competition in Canadian airspace and to oversee the greatest level of consolidation in the history of the Canadian air industry, with a resultant diminution of services and an increase in the price for ordinary Canadian consumers and traveller. Does the Alliance finance critic agree with me?</p>

	Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his leading question and I agree with his comments. Very briefly, the government has presided over the death of six airlines.  It may with this bill be about to preside over the death of a seventh and the only competitive airline in the country.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who take flights that cost $4,800 are on expense accounts, often government expense accounts.  They are insensitive to the price and the increase of this tax.  Average, ordinary, middle class families who fly on short haul low cost carriers are very price sensitive and they will scale back their demand.  This means a net benefit to Air Canada and an attack on competition in the airline industry here.</p>

	Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak to the legislation as part of the overall government budget and overall government agenda.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Minister of Finance presented his budget to the House it focused on two elements: the economic security of Canadians and  the personal security of Canadians.  They are the themes of the budget because they reflected the priorities of Canadians.  When Canadians were asked to define the two most important issues concerning them, they outlined the questions of economic security and personal security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to spend too much time talking about the economic front because today we are dealing mainly with the part of Bill C-49 that concerns the  security component of the budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government predicted  economic growth in  2001-02 in the vicinity of 1.1% to 1.3%.  If we look at the international and North American climates our forecasts are very objective and very well balanced. From all economic indicators we have seen so far we are not doing  that bad at all.  In fact we are doing a lot better than we forecasted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that after 28 years of deficit year after year and government after government missing their forecasts, this government  was able to end the  deficit.  We were able to post close to  $17 billion in surplus in the year 2001-02.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well we were able to pay in excess of $36 billion on the national debt.  We balanced our books.  We were able to free in excess of  $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion on an annual basis, money which otherwise would have gone to pay interest on the debt.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the government was able to do a tremendously positive thing with regard to  interest rates and  inflation.  Canada has the lowest interest rate and the lowest inflation rate in close to 40 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this came about without hurting the government's commitment to our social programs.   On top of what I have mentioned  the government has committed in excess of $100 billion in tax reductions. Canadians can see the benefits of good, sound government policies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have told us  they are exceptionally concerned about their personal security.  That is why one component of the budget dealt with this issue very directly.  The government has committed close to $7.7 billion over the next five years toward  enhancing security for Canadians.  Another  $6.5 billion has been dedicated   to securities and to the Canadian military. More than $1.2 billion were for initiatives designed to make Canada's borders more secure and efficient.</p>


	<A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	Let us look at some of the specific things the government has clearly stated. The approach of last year's budget was to ensure that security is paramount for Canadians and to ensure that the government has put more emphasis on increasing intelligence in policing,  enhancing screening of arrivals at Canada's airports and border points, and  to ensure that our people, both civilians and military, are better prepared for cases of emergencies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the intelligence and policing side the government has committed in excess of $1.6 billion over the next five years.  Some of that money will go toward equipping and deploying more intelligence officers and frontline investigative personnel.  This funding will go to federal departments and agencies including the RCMP and CSIS. The government has also provided resources  to improve co-ordination among different law enforcement agencies in different parts of the country including the territories and to ensure that there is more sharing of intelligence between national and local security agencies.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is ensuring that we have more resources for marine security through greater funding for coastal surveillance and to strengthen  the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada so we can deal with some of the offshore terrorist financing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other front, that of the screening of entrants to Canada, the government has invested close to $1 billion  to ensure better and more accurate screening of people who arrive on our shores.  We will have more resources for detention and removal of those who arrive illegally, a quicker determination of refugee claimants and a system that is fraud resistant when it comes to people wanting to obtain visas or those who arrive in Canada with fake visas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third front is emergency preparedness and support for our military. The government has invested, as I said before, close to $1.6 billion.  Some of that money will go to doubling the capacity of joint task force 2 which is doing a marvellous job right now in Afghanistan.  Part of that money will go toward military funding, including support for participating in the international war on terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have  put more emphasis on enhancing the different networks to improve on the types of equipment and infrastructure systems  our security agencies use. We have put more emphasis on protecting critical national  infrastructure such as highway and airport facilities for water treatment, hydro systems and other infrastructure systems across the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that the government came forward with in budget 2001 was a new approach to air security. That is where Bill C-41 comes into the picture.  The government has committed to allocate close to $2.2 billion over the next five years to make air travel more secure and to ensure security for Canadians who travel.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the money will go to new air security measures such as armed undercover police officers on Canadian aircraft.  The other day members of the opposition asked questions specifically to find out how many  armed personnel would be on aircraft.  The minister rightly said he would not tell them  because those operations were supposed to be undercover and would continue to be undercover in many situations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the money will go toward training personnel at airports, screening passengers and carry-on luggage, state of the art explosives detection systems at Canadian airports, enhancing policing in airports, replacing aircraft cockpit doors to make them more secure, and enhancing security zones at the aircraft handling facilities on the tarmac.</p>


	<A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1250)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures will be funded by a new air travel security charge to be paid by air travellers effective April 1, 2002, for travel in Canada.  The cost of that is $12.  That is what this whole debate seems to be about today.  It seems to be focusing on the issue of $12, not on the issue of the importance of having a system that responds to the needs of Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Canadians were asked whether or not as travellers they would mind paying the additional $12  for  peace of mind that they would arrive at their destination safely, the answer from the vast majority of Canadians would be an unequivocal yes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would provide key air transport security services that are consistent and wholly integrated across the country.  As well, it would provide  an enhanced security performance standard in services across the country.  Bill C-49  sets out a comprehensive strategy that responds to the needs of Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-49 would also see the establishment of an authority.  That authority would first be responsible for the effective and efficient screening of people and their belongings that access aircraft or restricted areas   through designated screening points at aerodromes and regulations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One  responsibility of the authority would be to ensure a highly visible role to reassure all Canadians of the Government of Canada's commitment to security in the air transportation system.  It would also be responsible for  screening duties which would  be carried out by a stable workforce of people with the right skills and equipment. Another part of its responsibility would be to ensure consistency and the seamless delivery of screening across Canada.   It would also  be responsible for carrying out other security functions as the Minister of Transport may assign on behalf of Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not really understand the fuss being made by my colleagues.  Is it the $12 issue or other issues that are bothersome to them?  Having heard what I had to say on this issue, it is my hope we will see unanimity in the House in order to pass this legislation as efficiently as possible so that it can go to the other house and become law.  Then Canadians would have the peace of mind  they have asked for and we would  respond to the priorities they have identified not only over the past few months but over the past year or  so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us make no mistake about it.  September 11 was a tragic event of great proportion.  Through this legislation the government is merely responding to what Canadians have asked it to do.  I am pleased to have added my voice to the voices of wisdom of my colleagues on both sides of the House and to support and congratulate the Minister of Transport on this wonderful initiative.  It is my hope that it will be passed through the House as quickly as possible and become law.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I  thank my hon. colleague for his thoughtful remarks and ask him to comment on the following. One  item he mentioned was  investment in infrastructure.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members know, in 1983 the Federation of Canadian Municipalities proposed a national infrastructure program.  That program laid dormant until this government came into office in 1993.  Under the leadership of the Prime Minister we have had a very successful national infrastructure program involving all three orders of government: federal, provincial and municipal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member might be able to comment on how that program has worked in his community and how effective it has been in terms of responding to very real needs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member also  mentioned the $2 billion plus strategic infrastructure fund which will deal with larger infrastructure programs.  Coming from the Ottawa area I know the member is well familiar with issues dealing with transit, one of the extremely important areas  the fund can deal with.  I would certainly appreciate any comments he could make in terms of how this initiative has benefited his community and indeed Canadians across the country.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-170089"></A><a HREF="#Int-170099"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-170084"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Mac Harb: </b>

	Madam Speaker, that is a very interesting question coming from a colleague who also has a municipal background. Sometimes I wonder whether it is an asset or a liability having that municipal background. I am sure in his case as well as in mine it is a wonderful background to have because we know firsthand what is important to our constituents, and that is  bricks and mortar: to have a proper transportation system that works; to have policing that provides us with security; to have social programs, whether it is housing or social services, that work; to have hospitals that work; to have  emergency rooms that work. All of that is almost like a micro type of arrangement of what we have at the national level. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member asked a question about infrastructure and the importance of specific programs. Members may recall that one of our colleagues from Nepean, Beryl Gaffney,  and I co-chaired the 1990 infrastructure task force  initiated by our caucus at that time. We were in opposition then. We criss-crossed the country and met with many mayors as well as councillors. We came back with a report that to a large extent formed the basis of our very first infrastructure program  the Liberal Government of Canada put to Canadians. That program has created thousands of jobs across the country, has responded to the needs of municipalities and has really acted as an economic stimulant at a time when not many economic stimulants were around, aside from those  that were in the works.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that not only has the government put in an additional $2 billion this year for strategic infrastructure, as my colleague has stated, but also as part of our new strategy on national security we have put in an additional $600 million that will go specifically to infrastructure around  border crossing points in terms of preparing highways, preparing bridges and other types of infrastructure activities that are required.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically for the $2 billion project that my colleague has spoken about, that will be absolutely marvellous for communities such as the one I represent. To cross from one end of this community to the next, it takes approximately 45 minutes at peak hours. That is a  long time. We have a highway of only four lanes at best. There are six lanes in the middle of the city, but really it is only two lanes in communities outside the city. We are a community of close to one million people when we take in the suburbs. On the other side of the river we have an additional 700,000 people at least. In total it would be about 1.8 million people. Our communities would benefit greatly from a light rail system that would connect  communities both east and west as well as north and south. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a wonderful thing it would be if the  communities on both sides of the river were to come together on this absolutely marvellous infrastructure program of $2 billion and submit one project for light rail in order to connect the communities east to west as well as north to south on both sides of the river, on the Outaouais side as well as the Ontario side. That would be a dream. I am sure that with the government commitment of $2 billion that dream could become a reality, therefore creating more jobs, responding to the needs of the community, protecting the environment and  preparing the city to go into   the next century fully equipped and energized in order to respond to the needs of its people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the kinds of projects we see being repeated across the country. These are the kinds of initiatives the government has put before us and before Canadians. That is why I am exceptionally honoured and proud to be a part of this government and this regime and seeing those initiatives being implemented and being put before Canadians.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I would like to ask a question of the member who defends this status quo budget.  It is not much more than the status quo of what the government has been doing over the years, which is not much of anything.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am curious as to how the member feels about the $200 million injection into the budget that is supposed to help our military when we have words from the auditor general saying that billions of dollars are needed and  a Senate committee insisting that we put a $3 billion to $4 billion injection into the military immediately. That $200 million sounds very small.  At the same time the government is prepared to inject $500 million into providing cottages for the criminals across our land to give them more comforts while they are incarcerated. People do not respond favourably to these kinds of things.  He has taken a lot of time on his high horse about the wonderful budget, but these specific things do not resonate with Canadians at all.  I am wondering how they resonate with him.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I hope the people who live in his riding will take some time to fax the member copies of their paycheque stubs of a year ago and paycheque stubs of today.  He will notice that there is quite a significant difference in the amount of take home pay, which is less now than it has ever been. The standard of living is going down.  The government is gouging and taking more taxes.   It is like a bunch of rats; it can smell out taxes from the most unbelievable places to make more revenue.  It absolutely is not resonating with Canadians.  The member may say it is, but it certainly is not.  I would like to hear the member respond to that.</p>

	Madam Speaker, in fairness I want to set the record straight.  The government has made an unprecedented commitment to our military that previous governments have not been able to do, for whatever reasons. In fact it was this government that recognized the need to modernize and to support the needs of our Canadian military.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me  run by my colleagues some of the things that were in the budget.  I am not sure my colleagues have read the budget properly.  I have a summary here of some of the items.  The member talked about $200 million and I am talking about $7.7 billion for security funding.  Let me tell my colleagues what we have put in specifically in order to support the military.  We have put  in $510 million to support the military.  I do not know if my colleague is aware of that. We also have expanded the anti-terrorist capacity of our military.  We invested an additional $119 million. In terms of supporting our military so it can combat issues such as chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats, there is an additional $513 million.  For emergency preparedness we have committed $396 million  as well as a contingency of $100 million. As far as we are concerned, that adds up to close  to $1.7 billion.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I have only a few minutes remaining in this debate but there is enough time for me to give you a number of reasons you can share with the government as to why it should step back and reconsider its new air travel  tax.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened with interest to the previous speeches made by the government members and I think it is far too easy to rely on the events of September 11 to justify this decision. The government says that it was forced after September 11 to hurry up and implement security measures. It is too easy to refer to a tragic event such as this to justify the quasi-insane government policy of levying a new tax in an industry that, even prior to the events of September 11, was already experiencing a downturn.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years ago it was clear that there was an obvious lack of competitiveness. To demonstrate this, since the mid-1980s until last year the cost of air travel in Canada has increased by approximately 10%. Some might say that over 15 years, this is not so bad. Yet while the cost of air travel in Canada jumped 10%, over the same period in the United States it dropped by 43%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already, due to this country's geography, population density and the populations requiring service in remote areas, the airline industry in Canada does not have the levels of profitability and operating costs that would allow it to be extremely profitable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tax such as this one would only adds to this situation. The government is saying to the industry “You are having problems being competitive, you are already experiencing problems maintaining service to remote areas, in particular, well, now we are going to saddle you with a new tax”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, members were saying that it was not that much, that is was not a heavy tax. Yes, but it is enough to jeopardize the profit margins of a number of airlines, especially small and mid-size air carriers. It is also enough of a tax to put an end to air service in remote areas. It will no longer be profitable. It is also enough to lead to several economic development projects being dropped. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government slaps on taxes  willy-nilly, without even carrying out impact assessment studies.  The general director of the Tax Policy Branch, in Ottawa, was candid in admitting to us that there were no studies carried out on the levying of such a tax. These people would do well to visit remote areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all very fine and well to ask small communities to take charge of their own lives, to develop tourist attractions using what is available to them and what they have but without an air link, which is often the most effective link and  the only link in certain areas, their development is threatened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can be told to take charge of their lives, to work together, to invest, but, without an air link which is maintained, or which in many cases could be improved upon, in terms  of the lack of frequency of flights, these communities are not being given a chance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cannot be that all the people who were with the opposition parties yesterday, the people representing  all aspects of the airline industry, are wrong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, at the initiative of the Bloc Quebecois, the Tourism Industry Association of Canada, the Canadian Air Line Pilots Association, the Air Transport Association of Canada, and the Association of Canadian Travel Agents, joined forces here in Ottawa. All these people stood behind the opposition parties, and behind the Bloc Quebecois' initiative calling on the government to cancel this new tax in Bill C-49.  All were unanimous that this tax made absolutely no sense and that it would not encourage economic development or  put the economy back on track. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rather outrageous to have a government that is juggling with surpluses, even during an economic slowdown. In a few days, the government will be announcing a net surplus of over $9 billion. While it is already squeezing out of the taxpayers' pockets more money than necessary, it has the nerve to introduce this new tax, which will not bring in $2.2 billion over a five year period, as the government claims, but $1 billion more than that. This tax will bring in more than $3 billion to the government, which is already juggling with surpluses. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are launching the debate on tax imbalance, the government is creating additional pressure regarding surpluses, by accumulating hundreds of millions of dollars more annually, under the pretence of improving security. Let us face it: this is outrageous. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are asking the federal government—and the coalition made it clear yesterday—is to use its surpluses to invest in security. It has enough money to do so. The Minister of Finance is juggling with surpluses. It is incredible. But the government is adding yet another tax.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the government must come to its senses and give up this idea of imposing a new tax. It is not true that this tax will be reviewed in six months. It may be reviewed in six months, but  Canada's tax history tells us that when a new tax is introduced, it is very hard to get rid of  afterwards. Once it is in effect, forget it. The personal income tax collected by Ottawa was supposed to be a temporary measure. It was meant to finance the war effort. We have been waiting 60 years to see it abolished. Obviously, once a tax is in place, it cannot be removed.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed from February 5 consideration of the motion.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-170160"></A><a HREF="#Int-170179"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-170150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey--White Rock--Langley, PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to my colleague's Motion No. 20.  My colleague from New Brunswick Southwest moved the motion in reaction to a situation he found himself in where he had put a question on the order paper that the government failed to answer over a period of a year.  That frustration has brought it to the point where it is now a debatable motion before the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern of my hon. colleague and all of us is that we are here representing the people of Canada to hold the government accountable.  That is our job in opposition.  It is to ensure that when the government makes decisions it is making the best decisions on behalf of Canadians.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way that a person can evaluate whether or not the government is doing its job, whether it is doing the best it can for Canadians, is to have access to information.  When the opposition asks for information from the government and is denied that information it prohibits us from doing that which we are here to do and that is to ensure that all the facts are on the table, that all the information is out there for perusal, so that we can question the government on how it interpreted information and how it reached the decisions it did. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in opposition are expressing great concern through the motion.  We are  trying to get the government members to understand that if parliament is to continue to hold the respect of Canadians   we must operate in a manner that earns that respect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was confronted this week in the transportation committee with regard to the report that the minister of government services lost.  I will not say that the minister lost it.  The department lost a report.  There was some concern that a good deal of money, half a million dollars, had been spent by government on behalf of Canadian taxpayers to have this report written.  After the expenditure of these dollars, lo and behold, this report was not to be seen.  One has to question how the government made the decision to hire  the company to write the report. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Groupaction was the company that was contracted to write the report for the government.  The contract was to propose ways to increase the federal government's visibility and was reviewing a number of programs the government was involved in.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In committee we asked the government representative who this company was, how it got the contract and what happened to the report that was the result of the work that it supposedly did.  We were told that there were nine companies that were authorized by the Government of Canada to do this work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is a pretty large nation and I am sure there are quite a few companies that could do the kind of work that this company was asked to do. We asked for information about how the government picks nine companies from all of those across the country to do the work.  We were told that it was the practice of government to  preselect and short list companies that will do contract work for the government, not only in this department but in other departments as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping that in mind, that it is a matter of practice for the government to short list or  preselect companies that   qualify to  apply for these government contracts, we asked a few more questions.</p>


	<A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It came to light, albeit through the media and the questions they were asking and the work they were doing, that three of the pre-selected companies were somewhat related to each other out of these nine. We are not talking about nine unrelated companies. We are talking about maybe six or seven unrelated companies. Three of them having the same president.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is some concern expressed about one of these pre-selected companies out of the nine, which really is down to six,  who got the contract and then found itself giving money back to the government, it is not unrealistic for the opposition to say that something does not seem quite right.    We need to see copies of the report and of the documentation around the report, and furthermore  we would like to see some evidence on what criteria the government authored or pre-approved these nine companies. What kind of clearance, security or investigation went on to see whether or not these companies were related to one another?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of incidents like this where Canadian taxpayers pay half a million for a report that gets lost, that was done in questionable circumstances by companies that were pre-selected by the government and that gave money back to the government,  that the opposition must have access to documentation and to those things upon which government makes its decision.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not have access to information, how is it possible for the  opposition, those of us on this side of the floor, to do our jobs on behalf of Canadians? That is our role. In order for us to be able to do that job we need access to information.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that was not bad enough, I just read something today, again in the media, where DND will not release the names of  visitors or the money spent on them because of their rights to privacy. We heard that Treasury Board did not want to release the expense accounts of ministers because of rights of privacy. It is pretty hard to hold ministers and the Department of National Defence to account as to where tax dollars are being spent if that information is withheld from those people who are here to hold the government to account.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that the government does not see the necessity of this function of parliament. Parliament is here, and the opposition is here, to check and question where the government is spending tax dollars. That is why we have estimates and  a budget. That is why we have that process. However if parliament is not allowed to have the information where we can question the estimates then we are being denied the facility of doing our jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PC/DR coalition introduced a new concept in relation to the whole national security issue and anti-terrorism legislation that has been discussed over the last couple of months. In coming up with how we felt government should do business differently and how it should co-ordinate functions and create a new ministry, we recognized the need for a parliamentary committee to be established so that we would have  access to highly sensitive information.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason we did that was because we saw the need to have parliament holding the government accountable. The only way we can do that is by access to information. We saw the need even in the  highly secure areas of anti-terrorism and national security to have a parliamentary committee</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not like it is not done anywhere else. In the United States information is shared and shared widely so that the opposition can do the job it is elected to do, that is, hold the government accountable.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like  the government to recognize that and support the motion.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-170179"></A><a HREF="#Int-170193"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-170160"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker,  the motion we are debating  is  crucial.  It is  one more symptom of what we  in the opposition no matter which  party we represent are trying to do.  There are times when the only way we can hold the government accountable is to request certain information.  Those of us who have been here any length of time recognize that  the government has used many vehicles to preempt our ability to obtain information. During   my career here a few examples  immediately come to mind. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my role as the critic for aboriginal affairs in the 1993-97 parliament, there were certainly times when the Privacy Act was invoked. There were obvious abuses of obligations that had been incurred by bands in contractual arrangements with people. The  original funding which  allowed the bands to enter into these arrangements was Canadian taxpayers' money.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a case in Atlantic Canada, the supreme court of that province  made a judgment against the band.  The band  and the department of Indian affairs were stonewalling.  The eventual resolution  I had to resort to was to take all the documentation to the auditor general. The auditor general exerted influence through the bureaucracy and, I am assuming, through the minister.  That was the only thing that cleared up this financial obligation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example  is when members on  the fisheries committee collectively wanted observer reports from Atlantic operations to be available from fishing operations out off the Grand Banks and so on.  After a monumental Herculean effort,  we were finally given access.  In  fact, had it not been  for   the amount of media attention  focused on that, the government still would have had the levers available to deny those observer reports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of time I have also  had to use the access to information provisions which Canadian citizens and we as members of parliament are allowed to use to extract information from the government.   That has not always been a happy exercise either.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I wanted to obtain information on what on earth Transport Canada  was doing in terms of devolution of west coast docks and wharf facilities, that exercise  from start to completion took  close to two years.   I met roadblock after roadblock and basically had to persevere. It should not have to be that way.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to  this current motion for the production of papers, it is  apparent that the member for New Brunswick Southwest has the correct motivations and has shown much persistence. He  has tried to do everything through the rules.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be most inappropriate if this votable  motion were not given serious consideration by all members of the House, not just on the opposition side but on the government side as well.  In many ways this  is a litmus test  for government accountability and government transparency. There is no earthly reason that  the request should be denied.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would hope that members of the House, when called upon to vote on the motion, will find it  is the right way to go.  I would urge them to do that.  </p>
