	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved 
that Bill C-14, an act to provide borrowing authority for the 
fiscal year beginning on April 1, 1994, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Finance and a brand new father, I might add.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, because of the birth of my second child, 
I have not had an opportunity to speak in the House at length, so 
I would like to congratulate you on your election as Speaker. I 
am probably the last member of the House to do this formally, 
sir, but I would like to congratulate you on your new position. I 
also congratulate your colleague, who has now taken the chair, 
and thank you for making things go so smoothly in the first 
weeks of this House. Thank you again.
<P>
	I welcome the opportunity to speak at second reading of Bill 
C-14, the borrowing authority bill. I urge the House to proceed 
with this legislation as quickly as possible so that new 
borrowing authority will be in place at the beginning of the new 
fiscal year.
<P>
<B>(1005 ) </B>
<P>
	Before speaking directly to the measures in the bill, I would 
like to put this legislation in its proper context. The amount of 
borrowing authority requested in the bill is directly connected to 
the financial requirements set out in the budget presented earlier 
this week by the Minister of Finance. The information required 
to deal with the financial aspects of the bill is set out in the 
budget.
<P>
	It is extremely important that this bill be passed as quickly as 
possible. Without borrowing authority early in the new fiscal 
year, there will be severe constraints placed on the government's 
financing program. Essentially the government would be 
limited to using section 47 of the Financial Administration Act 
which restricts funding to short-term funds.
<P>
	No bond issuance will be permitted except to funding 
maturing issues of which there are very few in the first quarter of 
1994 and 1995. Any delay in the passage of this important bill 
beyond the end of the current fiscal year therefore could prove 
costly to the government and Canadian taxpayers, and would 
expose the government to the additional interest rate risk 
implied by higher short-term funding.
<P>
	With the large financing program, delaying bond financing 
will also be potentially disruptive of the capital market which 
could result in higher debt servicing charges. It is critical that 
borrowing authority be secured as soon as possible after the 
budget.
<P>
	In granting the borrowing authority requested in this bill, hon. 
members should keep in mind that the budget takes strong action 
to bring government finances under control. The measures 
announced in the budget are an essential part of this 
government's action plan to revitalize Canada's economy.
<P>
	We do not put forward this request to borrow money lightly. 
We know there are real costs involved in adding to the country's 
debt burden. That is why we have taken real action by proposing 
the most substantial spending reductions by a government in the 
last 10 years.
<P>
	As well, in charting Canada's fiscal course in this budget we 
have relied on cautious, prudent projections of economic growth 
for this year and next. Consequently the deficit projections are 
much higher than those given to the House last April.
<P>
	The economic projections presented in the budget are based 
on a consensus of private sector forecasts and are in stark 
contrast to the overly optimistic, some might say unrealistic, 
expectations of growth presented in some previous budgets, 
expectations that have resulted in deficit forecasts that were 
wrong by tens of millions of dollars.
<P>
	For our part we have served notice that we are committed to 
changing the way government does business. One aspect of this 
is the use of prudent projections of economic growth to generate 
budget numbers that Canadians can trust.
<P>
	The 1994 budget actions, coupled with the moderate 
economic growth we are projecting, will reduce the deficit from 
$45.7 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1842"> 1842 </A></B>
<P>
billion in 1993-94 to $39.7 billion in the coming fiscal year. A 
further drop to $32.7 billion is expected in 1995-96. As a 
percentage of Canada's economy, the deficit will fall from 6.4 
per cent of gross domestic product for this year to 4.2 per cent of 
gross  domestic product in 1995-96. Looking further ahead, the 
budget sets the deficit on a path to meeting the government's 
interim deficit target for 1996-97: 3 per cent of GDP or some 
$25 billion.
<P>
	In setting this course of responsible deficit control, the 
government has put the emphasis on actions that will support 
economic renewal and confidence. Most important, we have 
emphasized reductions in government spending. Net 
expenditure cuts will total $17 billion over the next three years 
and while we have proposed some measures to increase 
revenues there are $5 in spending cuts for every $1 in new 
revenues.
<P>
	The 1994 budget sets in motion the most comprehensive 
fundamental change in decades. However, change is not always 
comfortable. It is not always easy and is tempting to attack. This 
change is vitally needed because it focuses on three essential 
goals that directly answer the priorities expressed by Canadians 
during our first ever series of public budget consultation 
conferences.
<P>
	Canadians said they wanted action to restore our country's 
economic vitality and to create the jobs so many people 
desperately need. This budget addresses those needs.
<P>
	We are accelerating regulatory reform and GST reform 
because Canadians told us they want government to get off their 
backs and relieve them of the dead weight of over-regulation 
and red tape. Canadians also told us they want a government 
committed to lowering taxes that stand in the way of hiring and 
growth. Therefore, we will roll back UI premium rates in 1995 
to their 1993 levels. This will save industry almost $300 million 
a year. Due to this action there should be some 40,000 more jobs 
in the economy than could otherwise be expected if premiums 
were allowed to rise.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	The budget also funds new strategies to promote small 
business and technological innovation, key engines of a 
successful economy in today's global arena.
<P>
	We are acting to get the banks working better to provide 
finances for small businesses. We are also reforming the way 
government approaches science and technology. We are taking 
steps to give small business access to technology and to allow it 
to afford dedicated engineering support. We will be developing 
a strategy for the information highway and we will be issuing a 
policy paper on science and technology so that we can work with 
Canadians to develop a clear statement of government priorities 
in this crucial sector.
<P>
	During our consultations, Canadians also said they want 
reform of our social security system to ensure it is fair, 
compassionate and affordable, a reform that delivers incentives 
for work and creates jobs and opportunities.
<P>
	That reform has been launched by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. The budget takes important steps to 
begin meeting this challenge. The link between the length of 
time a person works and UI benefits is being strengthened. 
Assistance is being enhanced for those with dependents. These 
and other actions will reduce the costs of the program by $2.4 
billion next year. This will allow us to bring UI premiums down.
<P>
	The consultations also delivered a third blunt message. 
People told us to get government finances under control and 
make government more effective, cost conscious, and less of a 
burden that undercuts job creation and entrepreneurship.
<P>
	The government understands that these are obligations we 
must accept, not options. The budget reduces the deficit with 
this in mind. Using prudent economic assumptions, the actions 
in the budget set the deficit on a clear path to bring it down to the 
target we set out in the red book of 3 per cent of Canada's 
economy in three years.
<P>
	The budget also includes freezing both public service and 
parliamentary salaries for a further two years. I must say as a 
personal aside that this is the first announcement I have given to 
my family, including my wife who is in the hospital and 
watching this, that in fact my salary has been frozen for another 
two years. I hope she takes it in good spirit.
<P>
	Defence spending will be cut by nearly $2 billion more. That 
is in addition to the $1.7 billion saved by cancelling the EH-101 
helicopters over the next three years. Subsidies for businesses 
and grants and contributions to interest groups will also be 
reduced.
<P>
	The government will reduce the operating budget of the 
government departments by $400 million in the next fiscal year 
with savings rising to $620 million annually in 1995-96 and 
beyond. Total savings and cuts in government operations will 
rise from $468 million in 1994 to $1.6 billion in 1996-1055 97.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Grants and contributions paid by the government, including 
international assistance and grants to small businesses, will also 
be reduced to achieve $253 million savings during the fiscal 
year starting next April. These savings will reach $409 million 
the following year.
<P>
	The government also undertook a vast restructuring of our 
social security system in order to improve it and make it better 
suited to the needs of the time, while making sure it remains 
affordable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1843"> 1843 </A></B>
<P>
	Within this framework, we have major objectives in two 
areas: unemployment insurance reform and social security 
transfers to the provinces.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The new rules will strengthen the link between work history 
and the ability to collect benefits, and will enhance benefits to 
those with lower incomes and those who are supporting 
dependents.
<P>
	Federal transfers to provinces currently total some $40 billion 
annually with some $14 billion of that related to social security 
programs. The budget calls for a two-year period of 
predictability and modest growth in these transfers.
<P>
	During this period the federal government will co-operate 
with the provinces in setting reforms and testing new 
approaches with extensive public consultations and input along 
the way.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	However, the budget makes it clear that social security 
transfers will be no higher in 1996-97 after reform than they are 
this year. This will save the federal government at least $1.5 
billion in 1996-97.
<P>
	The challenge of the deficit is not only one of spending, it is 
also one of revenues. The government knows that Canadians 
believe taxes are already too high and we agree with them. Our 
priority as a government is to stimulate the economy to create 
growth which will help curb the deficit and allow us to reduce 
taxes in the years ahead.
<P>
	The tax and deficit relationship is a two-way street. A higher 
deficit will lead to higher taxes, while a lower deficit will lead to 
lower taxes. To reduce the deficit now some revenue increases 
are necessary. The government has decided that the fairest way 
to raise revenue is to broaden the tax base and to bring greater 
equity and fairness to the tax system.
<P>
	The $100,000 lifetime capital gains exemption will no longer 
be available for gains realized after budget night. For 
individuals, the full value of employer paid life insurance 
premiums will be taxable. The income tax credit provided to 
persons over the age of 65 will be income tested. I should note 
that only one senior in four will be affected by this change.
<P>
	A number of changes are also being proposed to the corporate 
tax system to make it fairer and to better target the tax assistance 
made available to certain businesses. They include: a reduction 
in the GST tax credit and the business income tax deduction for 
meals and entertainment expenses; the elimination of certain tax 
preferences aimed at small business that are enjoyed by some 
large private corporations; a change in the tax treatment of 
certain security transactions by financial institutions; and the 
elimination or reduction of certain regionally based investment 
tax credits that have not been cost effective in attracting new 
investment. The proposed changes will add $575 million to 
federal  coffers in 1994 and almost $1.4 billion the following 
year.
<P>
	In bringing down this budget the government is pursuing a 
balanced approach, weighing a number of concerns and 
targeting a number of goals: to create jobs; to stimulate 
economic growth; to reduce the deficit; and to encourage the 
long-term financial viability of the social programs that define 
this country.
<P>
	There are some voices that might call for a different balance, 
some views which are focused on one issue or another instead of 
the complete picture. This government asks them to think again.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance put it during his address; for those 
who would have us spend more, Canadians deserve to know 
where the money would come from. And for those who demand 
we cut more, Canadians deserve to be told the extent to which 
that would hurt growth, hurt jobs, hurt the less fortunate. It is 
with this in mind that we have asked the House for authority to 
borrow the funds we require in Bill C-14.
<P>
	I would now like to go into some detail as to the elements of 
this bill. Like borrowing bills in recent years, this bill contains 
three basic elements: authority to cover financial requirements 
for 1994-95; exchange fund account profits; and a contingency 
reserve. In total, the government is requesting authority to 
borrow $34.3 billion for the 1994-95 fiscal year.
<P>
	In addition, there is a provision for an additional borrowing 
authority of $3 billion to provide for borrowings conducted in 
this fiscal year under section 47 of the Financial Administration 
Act.
<P>
	I would now like to touch briefly on the main provisions of 
this bill. First, there is the provision for $30.2 billion of 
authority to cover our anticipated requirements for borrowing to 
meet the net financial requirements set out in the budget.
<P>
	Second, there is provision in the bill to cover $1.1 billion of 
exchange fund account earnings which give rise to additional 
Canadian dollar borrowing requirements. This is because these 
earnings, although reported as budgetary revenues, are retained 
in the exchange fund account. They are not available to finance 
ongoing operations of the government.
<P>
	Third, there is a $3 billion reserve, the same amount requested 
in borrowing authority bills in the last six years. This reserve 
provides for unforeseen contingencies such as foreign exchange 
transactions, seasonal swings in borrowing requirements and 
delays in passing the future year Borrowing Authority Act.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	There is also a provision to cover the funding of bills issued in 
1993-94 under section 47 of the Financial Administration Act, 
up to a cap of $3 billion. Without this clause these refundings 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1844"> 1844 </A></B>
<P>
would be charged against regular 1994-95 borrowing authority, 
even though the money was raised in 1993-94 fiscal year.
<P>
	Members should note that the provision cannot be used to 
generate additional borrowing authority for 1994-95. Next 
year's borrowing authority is only increased by the amount of 
section 47 borrowings actually transacted in 1993 up to a 
maximum of $3 billion.
<P>
	There are some minor technical provisions in the bill that 
more clearly link fiscal year borrowing authority with fiscal 
year borrowing requirements. One provision provides that 
1994-95 borrowing authority may only be used after the 
1994-95 fiscal year begins. Another provision stipulates that 
the borrowing authority covers the full fiscal year beginning 
April 1, thereby ensuring refunding authority for the securities 
maturing in fiscal year 1994-95.
<P>
	Until this bill is passed we may continue to use any amount of 
the non-lapsing reserve provided for in the Borrowing 
Authority Act, 1993-94. This bill when passed will cancel all 
borrowing authority remaining from fiscal year 1993-94. Also, 
it will deduct from the basic amount of borrowing authority 
sought any borrowing authority for 1993-94 that is used in 
1994-95. This prevents any use of the 1993-94 non-lapsing 
reserve effectively adding to borrowing authority in 1994-95.
<P>
	As background information I would like to review the 
government's debt operation in the current fiscal year up to the 
end of January. At this point in the domestic debt program about 
$25 billion in new net market debt has been issued. Of this total, 
$21 billion was in the form of marketable bonds, $5.5 billion in 
treasury bills, and $925 million in real return bonds.
<P>
	The real return bond program was first announced in October 
1991 and is a modest and cost effective diversification of a debt 
program. The bonds offer investors a real rate plus an inflation 
compensation component.
<P>
	I would like to report to the House on last fall's Canada 
savings bond campaign. That campaign with bonds bearing an 
interest of 4.25 per cent had total sales of $5.4 billion. After 
taking into account the Canada savings bonds that matured or 
were redeemed in that period, net purchases of new bonds 
amounted to $842 million.
<P>
	Regarding foreign currency debt, outstanding Canadian bills 
increased by U.S. $2.7 billion to $4.7 billion at the end of 
January. These are short-term U.S. dollars denomination bills 
which are issued from time to time in the U.S. market to fund 
Canada's foreign exchange reserves. In addition, a yen 80 
billion bond issued in 1986 matured in July 1993.
<P>
	In January the government launched a U.S. $2 billion 
five-year floating rate note. This issue will be used to pay down 
outstanding Canada bills thereby diversifying the source of U.S. 
dollar funding of Canada's exchange reserve. It will not increase 
the level of reserves or Canada's overall indebtedness.
<P>
	In summary, the bill is straightforward and contains no 
unusual provisions. All the information needed to deal with it is 
before the House in the budget, the main estimates, and related 
documents.
<P>
	I therefore urge the House to proceed with this legislation as 
quickly as possible so that new borrowing authority will be in 
place at the beginning of the new fiscal year and the 
government's regular borrowing program can proceed as the 
fiscal year begins.
<P>
	Borrowing authority is a normal part of the operations of the 
government. I urge all members to support this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I suppose 
I should welcome this opportunity to speak to the Budget but I 
cannot say I approach this task with a lot of enthusiasm, because 
there is little to be satisfied with, especially when we have a 
situation whereby the end of the next fiscal year, we will have a 
deficit of at least $40 billion. I said at least, and I will get back to 
this later on.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	We now have a bill before the House to provide borrowing 
authority. I would like to take a few moments to discuss this, 
because a substantial part of the debt or the interest on the debt is 
paid abroad. That is the most problematic aspect of the debt, and 
it is something that is not always clearly understood. Interest 
paid to Canadians is fed into the economy, so this is a lesser evil. 
Not so in the case of interest paid abroad.
<P>
	Take, for instance, someone who borrows $1,000. Mr. 
Speaker, suppose you were to lend me $1,000. You can see my 
credit is good, and I pay back the loan as agreed, so you are 
satisfied. If I want to borrow another $1,000 next year, there will 
be no problem. However, if you notice I have trouble meeting 
my payments so that you are not sure you will be paid back, you 
will start having second thoughts about the matter.
<P>
	If later on, I want to borrow money again, you will say: Fine, 
but I want a better return on my investment. Interest increases 
according to the risk involved, according to a basic financial 
principle.
<P>
	That is what we are seeing today in the case of Canada, and 
that is why although interest rates on short-term loans are low, 
rates on long-term loans are not going down.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1845"> 1845 </A></B>
<P>
	We must borrow to service the debt. The financial markets 
want a certain yield, and that is why our long-term interest rates 
are not going down as much as we would wish, which prevents 
us from investing in a vigorous economic recovery.
<P>
	For all these reasons, the government will have to put its 
financial house in order, which is not the case in this budget. 
This year again, the government failed to act.
<P>
	I remember how I reacted to last year's budget. It was a 
disaster. The government postponed many important decisions 
for another year. Under the circumstances, it was decided to let 
the future leader of the Progressive Conservative Party and the 
government make these decisions. This year, with a new 
government, a newly-elected government with wonderful 
objectives and nice campaign speeches, we expected a more 
vigorous approach. It did not happen, and I will give some more 
details later on.
<P>
	I heard an analyst give a very good explanation of the 
situation this week on the Radio-Canada program <I>Le Point</I>. She 
said that the government must put its financial house in order as 
soon as it comes to power. During its first or second year. The 
government failed to do it the first year, and we can only hope it 
will not let us down next year. This is a serious matter.
<P>
	The longer a government is in power, the harder it gets to 
make budget cuts. I remember talking to someone who had been 
a member of the Quebec cabinet, and he told me: Pierre, when 
you are elected, you have about six months to do some real 
house cleaning, because after that it becomes extremely 
difficult. I found that illuminating.
<P>
	I hoped that in its first budget, the government would have 
done more. Spending cuts are not as significant as they would 
have us believe. The famous five-for-one rule, which says for 
each dollar of additional revenue, we cut five dollars in 
spending, should be changed to read: ``We will cut five dollars 
in our spending estimates''. This is not the same, because as we 
can see in the budget votes, expenditures are not going down. 
We are now at around $122 billion, and it will be like that for the 
next three years. Granted, in real terms-these figures are 
nominal values-there will be some reduction in real value.
<P>
	I will also mention a few positive aspects of the budget. I 
looked around and found one I want to mention particularly, 
which is the decision to introduce a permanent program that will 
allow first-time homebuyers to use RRSP funds to purchase a 
home. It is a positive measure that was supported by our party 
and the Reform Party and by Liberal members as well. In fact 
many people wanted to see this become a permanent measure, 
and that is now the case. Bravo! That was a good decision.
<P>
	Another good decision was to roll back unemployment 
insurance premium rates to $3, but not until 1995. It is a good 
decision for next year.
<P>
	That was the good news.
<P>
	I admire my Liberal colleagues who must spend 20 minutes 
discussing the positive aspects of the Budget. I admire them 
because personally, I could do it for only two or three minutes. 
That is quite an achievement, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Now, on to the deficit. I looked up a number of figures, not to 
give you a personal history, but to give you a history of the state 
of our public finances since the year of my birth. In fiscal year 
1971, the government recorded a deficit of $379 million.
<P>
	Let me quickly give you some figures. In 1972, the deficit 
stood at $614 million; 1973 was a positive year; in 1974, the 
deficit stood at $672 million and this is when things started to 
snowball. In 1975, the deficit increased to $1 billion. By 1978, it 
had surpassed the $10 billion mark. The situation improved 
slightly in 1979 and 1980, when the deficit fell from $16.2 
billion to $11.5 billion. One could have thought that we were on 
the right track, but no, the deficit continued to spiral upward.
<P>
	The deficit in 1982 was $14.9 billion. By 1983, it had 
increased to $29 billion, with no relief in sight. The situation 
improved slightly during the mid 1980s, but the upward spiral 
continued in 1992 and 1993. The extremely high deficit, which 
stood at $34 billion for the 1992 fiscal year, increased to $40 
billion for the 1993 fiscal year. This year, it will stand at $45 
billion, while projections for next year put the deficit at $40 
billion.
<P>
	It should be noted that the projected deficit for this year was 
not $45 billion, but rather $32 billion. Talk about a forecasting 
error! If a person in the private sector were to make this kind of 
mistake, he would certainly be out of a job. Of course, you will 
say that the government was indeed defeated and turfed out of 
office. However, I sincerely hope that my Liberal friends will 
deliver on their promises.
<P>
	I want to talk a little about this year's $45.7 billion deficit. 
After the elections, the Minister of Finance lost no time 
announcing to us that the deficit would be worse than 
anticipated. You may recall that during the election campaign, 
our leader, Mr. Bouchard, spoke of a $40 billion deficit for this 
year during a very lively debate on the CBC. His comments 
created quite a stir during the campaign.
<P>
	Once in office, the Minister of Finance announced that the 
deficit was larger still, around the $46 billion mark, somewhere 
between $44 billion and $46 billion. One has to understand that 
of these $46 billion, close to $4 billion are non-recurring 
expenditures, that is expenditures which the government will 
not have to incur next year. Therefore, we are really talking 
about a deficit of $41.7 billion or $42 billion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1846"> 1846 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition, I have not taken into account the fact that the 
government will be making more prepayments this year, which 
will allow it to post more expenditures to this year's budget. 
Since they are blaming the deficit on the Conservative 
government, they might as well make it as large as possible, 
while they are at it. Then they can say next year: ``See, we 
reduced the deficit from $45 or $46 billion to $39 billion''. 
Reality and the facts prove that this is not quite the case. This 
budget takes the deficit, which is hovering at about $42 billion 
tops, and reduces it to a projected $40 billion. And what are the 
real facts? Well, it is highly likely that the real deficit will not be 
much lower than last year. Given that the economy is expected to 
grow this year, this is cause for some concern.
<P>
	When I look 10, 15 or 20 years down the road, I try to imagine 
what the country's financial state will be and the outlook looks 
very gloomy. How much interest will we be paying on the debt? 
Will 50 cents of every tax dollar be going to pay the interest on 
the debt?
<P>
	It should come as no surprise to you that young people are 
very cynical about the political process and about the future. 
How can they be confident? Their future is being mortgaged big 
time! They wonder how we are going to get out of this mess and 
puts things right. It should come as no surprise to you either that 
a growing number of Quebecers have expressed doubts about the 
federal system which has created this unresolvable debt crisis.
<P>
	This year, in its budget, the government has shied away from 
making the hard choices, preferring to postpone matters for 
another year. It amazes me that budgets always seem to paint a 
rosier picture of the future.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	With the Tories, forecasts were always for five years and 
invariably, the graphs showed the deficit miraculously 
dropping, by the fourth or fifth year, to very reasonable levels. I 
do not know how they managed to do that, but they did.
<P>
	Now, the Liberals and their Minister of Finance are telling us 
that, for the sake of transparency, forecasts will be on a 
three-year basis. But again, things start to look up only in the 
second or the third year, never the first one.
<P>
	This budget should be telling us what is going to happen 
during the first year. We will see. So much is unpredictable or 
very hard to predict. How can the Minister of Finance make 
reliable forecasts over three years when major consultations are 
ongoing in areas such as human resources and the GST for 
instance? If financial guidelines are not in place, how can he 
predict with any accuracy what is going to happen in terms of the 
economy? One can wonder.
<P>
	Somehow I get the uneasy feeling that this alternative to or 
improvement on the GST could be used to generate additional 
revenues to even things up. As for consultations on human 
resources, financial criteria seem to have been clearly 
established already. What is the use of consulting then, if the 
goals of the reform have already  been set? Take unemployment 
insurance for example. This budget provides criteria and 
guidelines in that area. Is all the work done by this committee, 
all its distinguished members and all the people who will be 
consulted be for nothing? I am afraid that they might work hard 
for nothing, that decisions have been made already.
<P>
	About this year's deficit, I would like to add this: it is a 
record. Never in the history of this country has a higher deficit 
been forecasted, never. The past cannot vouch for the future and 
I certainly hope that it will be the case here because it would be 
catastrophic.
<P>
	In the past, the Department of Finance has had some difficulty 
forecasting economic performance, and that is putting it mildly. 
Now, the Minister of Finance is telling us: ``We are going to use 
much more realistic forecasts for a change''. Let me say a few 
words on these forecasts.
<P>
	In his financial forecast, he has announced more realistic 
growth rates and interest rates. One area where his forecast is 
questionable however is inflation. In that regard, he has failed to 
listen to all the economists who have provided him with 
forecasts. They were all around 2 per cent, but the Minister of 
Finance chose to use a rate of 0.8 because that was just what he 
needed. A 2 per cent rate is much more realistic, especially if 
slight economic growth is expected. Whether we like it or not, 
growth always causes some inflationary pressure, and 2 per cent 
inflation is not too terrible. But no, he chose to use 0.8 per cent. 
That particular figure is questionable.
<P>
	But there is one which is even more questionable. You know, 
when you make forecasts, you use a long mathematical 
equation, one perhaps as complex as for equalization. You put 
numbers in, then say: ``Let us change the figures to get more 
realistic results''. But there is a major mistake, a major flaw in 
this equation. The government expects a 1 per cent growth in the 
economy or economic activity to generate a 1.2 per cent increase 
in public revenue during the first year. I find that hard to believe.
<P>
	In the seventies, at a time when revenue did grow slightly, a 1 
per cent growth in the economy could make public revenue 
increase by as much as 1.5 per cent. Things changed drastically 
in the eighties. Now, when the economy grows by 1 per cent, 
public revenue increases by a mere 0.5 per cent. Last year, it 
actually decreased. Why would there be an increase this year, as 
the minister is announcing? I am having a very hard time 
figuring how and why the Minister of Finance, who is so 
concerned with transparency, can keep such a parameter in his 
mathematical model.
<P>
	He may have changed some figures, the figures for growth 
rates and interest rates and used more realistic figures in the 
model, but he did not change the basic figure.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1847"> 1847 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	That is why I can tell you right away that, if the Minister of 
Finance does not review this question, he will never achieve his 
objective of bringing the deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP 
within three years, because he overestimates revenue growth. 
We can see it in his approach, in the fact that there will be no 
major deficit reduction this year; he is banking on economic 
growth to do his job for him but it will not happen.
<P>
	A very simple explanation is to look at the size of the 
underground economy. We do not need to go very far. We only 
have to walk around in our ridings and look around us to realize 
the extent of people's involvement in the underground economy 
and how much this economy represents. According to the most 
conservative estimates, it is at least 8 to 10 per cent. But it is 
probably a lot closer to 15 to 20 per cent. If we put it at between 8 
and 20 per cent, Mr. Speaker, it is already enormous. The 
government loses billions of dollars to the underground 
economy every year.
<P>
	The minister includes these billions of dollars in his revenue 
growth forecasts as though this phenomenon did not exist. The 
underground economy is very difficult to estimate and very 
complex. One must work with aggregates such as the money 
supply and that is very difficult.
<P>
	It seems that the Department of Finance has done a study on 
the underground economy but it refuses to publish it. Why? 
Because it might have to include it in its forecasts, which would 
make this exercise much more difficult.
<P>
	I heard the Minister of Finance say that if things did not go the 
way he wanted, he would make every effort next year to bring 
the deficit down to the level he wants. I told the people around 
me to get ready for a budget statement sometime this year, 
because the minister will have to take this phenomenon into 
account and he will then have to redo his calculations and make 
new choices.
<P>
	The minister does not talk about it much but he did something 
that was rather wise. He kept much bigger reserves than his 
predecessors, about $2.5 billion, and that was wise. Last year, 
his predecessor kept reserves of only $300 million and he would 
have needed much more. The Minister of Finance is to be 
congratulated on that score, but even this reserve will not be 
enough to offset losses due to the underground economy, that he 
continues to include in his revenue growth forecasts.
<P>
	When they say they will cut spending, they go all out, Mr. 
Speaker. They were saying two for one at the beginning. The 
Minister of Finance told us before the holidays that, for every 
additional tax dollar collected, he would cut $2. He was told that 
it was not enough, that it would not make a big enough impact in 
the budget. Now he says that, for every additional tax dollar, 
they will cut $5. How come next year's expenditures will be 
slighter higher at around $122 billion, when at least hundreds of 
millions of dollars in extra taxes will be collected?
<P>
	I cannot figure out how they arrived at that figure. We should 
have been closer to $118 billion or $119 billion in expenditures. 
They did not make real cuts; they simply lowered the forecasts 
made by their predecessors. That is a rather complex but 
fascinating exercise. If we compare budgetary votes, which are 
the most significant measurement, with operating expenditures 
in nominal terms-even including inflation, which is hard to 
take out-, we can see that there are no major cuts.
<P>
	I was reading an article by Claude Picher of <I>La Presse</I>, who 
wrote on budget day, ``Tonight, when Mr. Martin will tell you 
that it is impossible to put government finances on a healthier 
footing without increasing taxes, you can quote some 
government expenditures,'' and he gave the following 
examples: National Capital Commission, $90 million; Canadian 
Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat, $7 million; Human 
Rights Commission, $18 million; Offices of the Information and 
Privacy Commissioners of Canada, $6 million; International 
Development Research Centre, $117 million, and so on. There is 
a whole bunch of them.
<P>
	This government never agreed with our proposal to 
systematically review all government spending, let alone the 
whole tax system.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	I feel like saying this to the Minister of Finance: It is funny, in 
the budget he said that he would refer the issue of family trusts 
to the Standing Committee on Finance, which is already 
overloaded, for consideration, at the suggestion of my 
colleague, the Official Opposition's finance critic. How come 
that is the only one of my colleague's suggestions that he took, 
and that he is trying to embarrass him by saying that it is his own 
suggestion?
<P>
	My colleague suggested much more; he suggested setting up a 
committee to examine all public spending, item by item, and to 
deal quickly with the matter of family trusts. He said so many 
times. But no, instead they choose one small element, family 
trusts, to refer to a committee for study. That is not what we 
wanted; we wanted to look into the whole tax system, the 
government's tax expenditures and its uncollected tax revenue.
<P>
	The minister had fun telling us that there was already a 
minimum corporate tax. I am eager to talk to him about it again 
so that he can explain to me how it works. I am not sure that his 
officials agree with him that it really exists, far from it. And then 
he listened to a suggestion from a fellow member. My colleague 
made several suggestions to him, and all have fallen into 
oblivion. He is trying to distort what he said by telling us that it 
is what the opposition wanted. We wanted much more than that, 
we wanted a lower deficit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1848"> 1848 </A></B>
<P>
	We wanted and expected-and that is my next point-the 
government to do much more for the economic recovery-much 
more. We expected more from a Liberal government which 
talked constantly about jobs, jobs, jobs during the election 
campaign. The Prime Minister repeated that everywhere he 
went.
<P>
	Let us look at the predicted unemployment rate. Even with the 
infrastructure program next year, it will go down only 0.1 per 
cent. How come? This infrastructure program will generate 
many temporary jobs, Mr. Speaker. We must not think that the 
municipalities will be able to continue doing the work at the 
same rate forever after. And there is a maintenance cost 
associated with it. But it will not be enough. Those people will 
not stay on the labour market. We must take additional action so 
that after a year or two or three, we have a sounder economic 
support structure.
<P>
	It is true that the government alone cannot create 
employment, but it must still at least create a more favorable 
climate and send a signal. Cutting its spending further would 
have been a clear signal and made people say, ``The government 
is doing its part, so we can give it a little more credibility. We 
will do more too''. But that is not the case, it is the status quo.
<P>
	They talked to us a lot about small and medium-sized 
businesses and the Bank Act during the election campaign, and 
where is it in the Budget? A series of words: the government will 
consider, a parliamentary committee will review, the banks are 
considering, means will be developed, etc., etc. We will study, 
analyze, recommend, we will see, we will analyze and probably 
nothing will be done. Nothing will be done.
<P>
	How is it that for unemployment insurance, they were able to 
put a reform on the table quickly and in other fields, they will 
have to analyze and consider? Clearly, the main point in the 
finance minister's budget is to get money from people on UI. It 
is very clear; that is the main point in his budget. He was not able 
to examine other spending more thoroughly, for lack of time and 
imagination. That is why many people have trouble 
distinguishing this government from its predecessor when it 
comes to their budgets. Except for the colour of the documents 
and of the book behind it, not much is different. It is very 
disappointing.
<P>
	I will come back to another cut that could almost be called 
savage which they made. I will quote a sentence from the red 
book: ``We will reduce public spending by abolishing 
unnecessary programs, tightening procedures and eliminating 
duplication, all in co-operation with the provincial 
governments''. ``Co-operation with the provincial 
governments'': that is something we can read in many places in 
the speech from the throne and the budget and the red book and 
many other statements.
<P>
	Where is the elimination of administrative overlap in this 
budget? We could even include inter-departmental overlap 
within the same level of government.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	When I say overlapping, I am referring to two different types: 
interdepartmental and intergovernmental. Nothing was done 
about this. Studies presented to the Bélanger-Campeau 
Commission in Quebec estimated that these overlappings cost 
$2 to $3 billion annually. Over a ten-year period, they amount to 
somewhere between $20 and $30 billion. Yet nothing was done. 
The government cuts $400 million in the operating expenditures 
of the federal administration. This is a very minor cut. It is like 
doing surgery for terminal cancer. This is very disappointing.
<P>
	Yet, this is what the red book said. Indeed, there is no mention 
of a timetable. But I doubt very much that the government will 
succeed. It should send a signal. Let us not forget that this 
government will probably soon have to deal with a referendum 
in Quebec. It will have to show that they can reduce this 
overlapping. They have not even started doing so. How very 
disappointing!
<P>
	As regards jobs, aside from the infrastructure program, the 
other major initiative announced to promote job creation is 
simply unbelievable and beyond logic. Indeed, the government 
says that the $3.07 rate for UI premiums is bad for the economy 
and will therefore lower that rate to $3.00 at the beginning of 
1995. But let us not forget one thing: who set the rate at $3.07 in 
the first place? The same government, last December, when it 
decided to take out $800 million to finance its infrastructure 
program. Now it is telling us that this rate is bad. The 
government is telling us that it will lower that rate and create 
40,000 jobs in the process. But using the same logic, it means 
that 40,000 jobs were lost this year because of the government's 
initial decision. The infrastructure program may create 60,000 
to 65,000 jobs, but there will only be a net gain of 20,000 to 
25,000 jobs, and not 100,000 as seems to be implied in various 
government documents.
<P>
	There is inflation. You do not hear much about it regarding the 
economy, but there is a lot of verbal inflation when it comes to 
quoting figures and numbers. So, this is the other major 
government initiative: next year it will correct this year's 
mistake. But the government will not admit its mistake. Rather, 
it says that the rate was bad for the economy, without ever taking 
the blame or even apologizing to Quebecers and Canadians by 
saying: Look, we made a major error in judgment when we 
decided to set that rate.
<P>
	In terms of helping small and medium-size businesses and 
promoting research and development, Quebec is not getting its 
fair share, while in Canada as a whole, we do much less than our 
major competitors to promote R and D. I thought the 
government would send a clear message that, from now on, this 
would be one of its priorities; that it would start investing a lot 
this year in these programs and that it would do even more in the 
future. But this sector is not even defined as a priority. If it is not 
considered as such in theory, how can it possibly be  perceived 
as a priority in reality? I heard someone say in this House that 
people should phone their bank managers and ask them to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1849"> 1849 </A></B>
<P>
more co-operative with small and medium-size businesses. I 
am not sure that this approach will bring about very good 
results.
<P>
	The government had said that it would amend the Bank Act to 
help those who have funds invested in small and medium-size 
businesses. But it did not do it. Instead, the joint committee on 
industry and finance will examine the issue. I do not feel lost 
here because I was studying before coming here and I feel I am 
still at school because we are always told that this or that issue 
will be looked at. In school, I sometimes felt that the work was 
useful, but I am not always convinced it is the case here. I feel 
that decisions are made before studies or reviews are 
undertaken.
<P>
	I want to point out another important issue. In their red book, 
the Liberals talked about tax fairness. In their budget, they say 
that all classes will be affected: the rich, the poor as well as the 
middle class. Everyone will have to make sacrifices. But it 
would be an understatement to say that I am outraged by the 
measure affecting senior people. I find it very hard to accept that 
a senior is considered a rich person if his or her annual income is 
$26,000 or more.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	Between $26,000 and $49,000, they gradually lose their age 
credit. These people are being told to contribute $490 million 
over the next three years, while during that time, according to a 
conservative estimate, we could get at least $350 million 
annually by taxing family trusts. That is one billion over three 
years, and twice the amount we will get from senior citizens.
<P>
	As you know, and as you will see in the weeks to come, they 
are very sensitive about this. Senior citizens who depend on 
their pension cheque for their income have so little that they 
want to keep the age credit. They spent all their lives working 
hard, and now they are under the gun. Did this generation of 
senior citizens put us in the financial situation we are in now? I 
doubt it. Pitting one generation against the other is certainly not 
my intention, but the odds are it was probably the generation 
between theirs and mine that put us in the financial mess we are 
in today.
<P>
	However, the generation that holds the reins of power, the 
so-called baby boomers, has decided to cut spending on senior 
citizens. I can only hope they will be just as eager to take these 
cuts when it is their turn. Quite frankly, I do not like this.
<P>
	This reminds me of another measure in the budget, which is 
about abolishing the capital gains exemption on the first 
$100,000. Many Canadians have taken advantage of this 
exemption. At one time it was $500,000. Today, people in my 
generation are being given a signal that they will not have this 
tax incentive to become part of the upper middle-class or the 
wealthy class.
<P>
	We are prepared to do our fair share to pay off the debt, in 
addition to whatever we will be asked to do in the future. 
However, it is just not true that today's wealthy Canadians are 
being affected by this measure. Many Canadians have already 
used the exemption, and in fact, capital gains that have accrued 
since 1985-86, for instance, will not be taxed. So this measure 
applies starting today or rather the day before yesterday. It will 
not produce a lot of revenue, and certainly not as much as the 
Minister of Finance indicated in his forecast, and we are going 
to monitor that very closely.
<P>
	People already expected this to be retroactive and were doing 
their transactions before the budget, because of all the advanced 
publicity. These types of mesures do not always identify the 
groups that are affected. About the fiscal fairness that will be 
needed to fight the underground economy, I think there is a false 
perception among members opposite that we can deal with the 
underground economy by modifying the GST. They keep 
harping on the GST, but the GST was merely the last straw and 
not what created the underground economy in the first place. 
There is a whole set of measures that make people feel they are 
not getting their money's worth, and that is what drives people 
into the underground economy. They have the impression they 
are getting a fair deal this way.
<P>
	The government keeps saying it will change the GST, and this 
may make matters even worse, depending on how they do it. We 
will watch this very closely, but they will have to take a much 
broader approach to this problem, an approach on tax reform 
that will cover the range of measures that provide the 
government with tax revenue.
<P>
	There is nothing in this budget to restore fiscal fairness. The 
government will not meet the objective of the Minister of 
Finance to bring the deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP, because it 
is not sending a clear signal that the issue is fiscal fairness. I find 
that very disappointing.
<P>
	In concluding, I want to evaluate the three objectives 
mentioned in the budget of the Minister of Finance. First: to 
build a framework for economic renewal to help business 
succeed and to turn innovation into a more effective engine of 
Canadian economic growth. That sounds wonderful, but I could 
find no indication of this in the budget. In the budget the 
government says it will evaluate, analyse, recommend, study, 
and so forth. That is it, Mr. Speaker. I am still looking. We may 
find it in future budgets. So that was the first objective in this 
year's budget.
<P>
	The second objective. To put in place a responsible social 
security system that is fair, affordable and dapted to the needs of 
Canadians. I thought this was more or less the mandate of the 
Human Resources Committee, but we can see that the budget 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1850"> 1850 </A></B>
<P>
defines the financial parameters. It says we must meet these 
objectives while working within current financial constraints. 
Here again  we can wonder to what extent the objectives will be 
reached, given the cuts in unemployment insurance.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	The third point, and this is a major one, is: improve public 
finances to allow the government to concentrate all its energies 
on helping Canadians adapt to a demanding and changing world. 
If improving public finances means ending the next fiscal year 
with a deficit of more than $40 billion, this is a failure. This 
point by itself deserves a zero mark.
<P>
	To conclude, the government is boasting that it is bringing to 
life the commitments of the red book. it says that this budget is 
the red book. Now, people say that there is nothing in this 
budget, and that makes us realize that the content of the red book 
was in effect zilch, nothing and no hope.
<P>
	I thank you for your patience, Mr. Speaker, and I will 
conclude by saying that I am deeply disappointed by this budget.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 11 o'clock a.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to statements by 
members, pursuant to Standing Order 31. The Chair recognizes

the economic traffic we have that is a very dangerous place to 
be. We have a budget that is long on rhetoric and short on

<P>
	Instead of attacking government spending with serious cuts it 
is actually increasing spending. If this increased spending only 
brings unemployment down one-tenth of 1 per cent in the first 
year, it confirms that previous governments by overspending 
$500 billion have put us at this rate of unemployment.
<P>
	This budget is very reminiscent of those of previous 
governments with rosy predictions and miscalculations that 
Canadians have never been able to rely on. With optimistic

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
economic reality in Canada today is such that in many cases both 
spouses of a family must work.
<P>
	However, when a spouse decides to enter the workforce where 
day care service is necessary, the net earnings of that spouse are 
materially depleted due to the cost of day care. In fact, the net 
income generated is often not reflective of the value of the work 
done. As such, many working spouses would not require much 
incentive to leave their jobs to work in the home.
<P>
	Today we need to address the acute shortage of affordable day 
care. We need to make it easier for a parent to personally care for 
young children. We need to create job opportunities. We need to 
provide opportunities for all Canadians to accumulate 
retirement income. We need to promote economic independence 
for all and we need to recognize the economic value of a spouse 
working in a home.
<P>
	Accordingly, I will be introducing a private member's bill 
which will permit a working spouse to pay a salary to the other 
spouse for managing the family home and caring for dependent 
children. This would allow that spouse to pay into CPP and buy 
RRSPs. We need to recognize the value of the woman in the 
home.

assimilated if young francophones opt for RMC in Kingston''. 
These words were spoken, not by a nasty Quebec separatist, but 
by Mr. Terry Liston, the former Commander of CFB Valcartier 
and the current Vice-President of MIL Davie.
<P>
	How can the Minister of National Defence, who says he is sick 
of Quebecers, claim to be the great defender of the French fact 
within the Canadian armed forces when according to those in the 
know, those who have been there, his plan to shut down the 
Collège militaire de Saint-Jean will unquestionably lead to the 
outright assimilation of francophones?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs): </B>Mr. Speaker, in the 
interview I gave to a Canadian Press reporter two days ago, I did 
not say that I was sick of Quebecers. What I said was that I was 
sick and tired of Quebecers like the Bloc Quebecois members 
sowing the seeds of dissension among Canadians during 
question period here in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, in light of the cuts to our defence budget, we can 
either choose to keep all three colleges, even though we do not 
need this many institutions to train officers, or we can choose to 
centralize operations in one institution and Kingston's Royal 
Military College has the best facilities for this purpose.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have been watching with some great alarm the remarks of 
people in Quebec, prodded by the members on the other side on 
this particular issue. They are not doing the people of Quebec 
and Canadians a great service by inflaming what is becoming an 
argument that is emotional and is not based in reality.

their education in English and French at Kingston because it is 
too expensive to have two or three courses in engineering.
<P>
	We already have in reality a bilingual college at Kingston. 
The facilities are much better. If the facilities had been better at 
CMR de Saint-Jean, we would have centralized everything 
there.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to inform the minister that if he is sick and tired now of Bloc 
Quebecois members, he is in for a rough ride. We have four 
years ahead of us to put questions to him and we will continue to 
do so until we get some answers from him. I am sorry, but we do 
not intend to stop.
<P>
	How can the minister seriously think that we will believe him 
when he says the French fact will be protected in Kingston, when 
according to Mr. Liston, who has firsthand knowledge of these 
matters, people have been saying for ten, maybe even twenty 
years now, that RMC in Kingston will become a bilingual 
institution. This is impossible, given that Kingston is located in 
the heart of traditional loyalist country. Does the minister really 
expect us to believe him?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member is discounting the changes that have taken place in 
Canada outside Quebec since the passage of the Official 
Languages Act twenty-five years ago.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There has been a great change in the rest of the country as a 
result of the passage of the Official Languages Act put forward 
by a Liberal government 25 years ago.
<P>
	When the hon. gentleman starts inciting those comments and 
starts talking about Kingston, I would ask when the last time was 
that he went to Kingston, Ontario. Kingston, Ontario is a very 
sophisticated urban centre that is very sensitive to the duality of 
languages in this country.
<P>
	I would invite him to go to RMC and see the French language 
instructors, see the French language students and ask them if 
they feel that Kingston, Ontario is inappropriate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again I 
feel I must reassure the minister. I did visit Kingston, Ontario, 
and the military college as well only three months ago.
<P>
	How can the minister justify his own statements and those of 
the Prime Minister to the effect that the problem of the 
integration of francophones in the Canadian forces has now been 
resolved and everything is fine, when someone like Mr. Liston, 
who is in the know and  has experienced the situation firsthand, 
states the following, in referring to former staff college 
colleagues: ``In the armed forces, they prefer francophones 
whose allegiance lies elsewhere than with Quebec''.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member is quoting one former officer. Perhaps after this 
one-week recess, I will have found 20 or 30 former officers who 
disagree with the comments of the officer who was quoted 
yesterday and again today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In other words, this is a typical case. I am not sick of the Bloc 
as individuals. Many of them are very nice. I am sick of their 
arguments. We have been listening for 25 years to these kinds of 
arguments. They can be selective. They can find one person to 
criticize this. I will find 30 who support us.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence. I 
will not quote an individual but an internal report of his 
department, National Defence.
<P>
	This report of which we obtained a copy and which was 
quoted in <I>Le Devoir</I> this morning shows us that merging the 
military colleges into a single institution will attract fewer 
students from the nine provinces and the territories, reduce the 
intake of francophone officers and reduce the level of 
bilingualism in the officer corps.
<P>
	How can the minister seriously believe that he can protect the 
French fact in the armed forces when a study by his own 
department shows the exact opposite?
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, 
this is a report of the former minister, Marcel Masse.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> This is not a report of the Department of 
National Defence; it is a political report directed by the former 
minister.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member forgot to quote one thing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	He forgot to quote, again selective quotes, from the report. I 
will quote the first section dealing with the question of one of 
three colleges. The committee states that it believes that the one 
college system is the most likely alternative to the three college 
system. Does the member know why? It is because it is the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1855"> 1855 </A></B>
<P>
cheapest, the most effective and because of the facilities we 
have at Kingston. He conveniently forgot that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would ask the Minister of National Defence how he 
can explain that between 1990 and 1994, the percentage of 
bilingual francophone officers rose from 60 to 67 per 
cent-these are not separatists' figures, figures are the same in 
French as in English-while among anglophones during the 
same period, the proportion of bilingual officers declined from 
18 to 17 per cent.
<P>
	Does the minister still agree with the Prime Minister, who 
said yesterday that the situation had changed a lot in recent 
years, while studies from his own department show the exact 
opposite once again?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
has been some discrepancy in the last few years because of the 
massive downsizing of the military put in place by the former 
government. It took $14 billion out of the budget from 1989 
right through to 1997. We have added an additional $7 billion 
worth of cuts. Obviously there will be variations of the nature 
that the hon. member mentioned.
<P>
	I want to tell the member that by 1997 anybody aspiring to the 
lieutenant-colonel rank of the military will have to be bilingual. 
That means we are putting on notice anglophones who want to be 
generals or chiefs of staff that they have to be totally and 
absolutely bilingual.
<P>
	We have been improving the situation in the last few years. 
The college was opened in 1952 for the simple reason that, yes, 
there was a disparity in terms of the language preference of 
officers. However, because of the events of the last 25 years, the 
Official Languages Act and the appreciation in the rest of the 
country of the duality of Canada with respect to the French and 
English language and culture, there has been a great 
improvement. That improvement will continue even with the 
centralization in Kingston.
<P>
	As for the last comment, I certainly agree with the right hon. 
Prime Minister because he had it bang on yesterday with what he 
said. He embarrassed those members. They will find it tough to 
go home on the weekend and face the people of Quebec after the 
blow that he dealt them yesterday.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	A <I>Globe and Mail</I> report today shows how the minister 
overstated the Tory deficit for 1993-94 and understated his 
deficit for 1994-95. This creates the illusion that the deficit is 
shrinking but in fact the real deficit is growing.
<P>
	This seems to be a blind spot for successive finance ministers, 
both federal and provincial, who tend to blame their current 
deficit problems on a previous government. Canadians are 
growing tired of that.
<P>
	Will the minister explain why he has misrepresented the facts 
again about the size of the deficit to the Canadian people?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a little surprised at the question. I 
can understand perhaps why the <I>Globe and Mail</I> showed such a 
lamentable lack of understanding of the accounting principles 
by which the Government of Canada operates, but I would have 
thought that perhaps the hon. member opposite would have.
<P>
	Let me just go through this. That editorial talks about 
destabilization claims: ``$2.4 billion stabilization claims 
already received from the provinces''. We are required to 
provide for those liabilities once they are known, which we have 
done. A $250 million provision for the helicopter cancellation is 
entirely in accordance with public sector accounting principles. 
The reductions in the defence budget will save $7 billion, thanks 
to the actions of the Minister of National Defence. The 
voluntary departure incentives are known, and when one knows 
of a liability one must record it. On the acceleration of the 
income tax refunds, surely the hon. member would not say that 
we should delay those refunds and give the money back to 
Canadians simply to not have that money come into this year's 
effort.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	What we have done is exactly in accordance with the 
recommendations of the public accounts committee and exactly 
in accordance with the Auditor General's recommendations. I 
am sure the hon. member opposite would rather have us follow 
the dictates of the Auditor General than the dictates of the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I>.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
minister follows all the dictates of the Auditor General we will 
all be much happier, I am sure.
<P>
	However, we have another concern. The finance department 
largely with the same group of economic forecasters as with the 
previous government missed the mark last time by about $10 
billion in the budget projections.
<P>
	Can the minister assure Canadians that this group of 
economic forecasters will not be out by a similar amount in this 
upcoming budget?

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

answers for the member.
<P>
	First, as a partial answer to the hon. member, at the request of 
the deputy minister and senior members of the Department of 
Finance an outside accounting firm is essentially looking at the 
forecasting methods of the department.
<P>
	However, there is something else. It really is not fair to blame 
the existing forecasters within the department. The department 
essentially takes a consensus of the economic forecasts within 
the country. What the previous government did was take the 
median line optimistic forecast to do its forecasting. In this 
budget we chose to take the median line pessimistic forecast of 
the consensus of economic forecasters.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, according to the 
information given by the Department of National Defence, a 
portion of the staff and students of Saint-Jean will be 
transferred to Kingston. These changes are over and above the 
relocation of teachers and several courses given in French in 
Saint-Jean.
<P>
	Since the Minister talked about costs a few minutes ago, what 
will be the costs, first, of reorganizing the College in Kingston 
in order to increase its capacity and, second, of enabling it to 
fulfill its new role and new mandate as a bilingual teaching 
institution?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
transfer will not cost much more.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Simply, the facilities at RMC were built many years ago in the 
early part of this century and were designed for a much larger 
armed forces. There is all kinds of room to centralize the three 
colleges at Kingston. We may have a slight problem in terms of 
dormitories, but we feel that can be arranged with some of the 
other facilities in and around the Kingston area perhaps by 
moving some of the senior students out into apartments. 
However, that will not be a great cost.
<P>
	Comparing that cost with trying to centralize everything at 
Collége militaire royal de Saint-Jean, that would be prohibitive. 
We are in the business of trying to save taxpayers money, not 
just for people in Ontario but for people in Quebec and for all 
Canadians because this government governs on behalf of all 
Canadians from coast to coast.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, is the Minister

<P>
	I said in French a few minutes ago that the report quoted is not 
a report of the department. It is a report which was

Quebec getting its fair share of the pie. It is true there has been a

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National

	Now, let me answer the first question which is identical to a 
previous one, but I understand how these things work. I just 
want to add that the editorial in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> also talks 
about the $2.4 billion stabilization claims received from the 
provinces. Unfortunately, in accordance with accounting 
principles, we are required to pay those liabilities once they are 
known. The same thing goes for the $250 million provision for 
the cancellation of the helicopter contract, which we dealt with 
in accordance with private sector accounting principles. With 
regard to the significant savings arising from the defence cuts, 
which amount to $450 million, we now know that we have to 
include them in this year's figures.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	On the issue of accelerating income tax refunds, the truth is 
that we have to include that money in this year's budget since we 
are in the process of accelerating the refunds. We have followed 
to the letter the measures recommended by the Auditor General. 
I know full well that the critic for the Bloc Quebecois wants us to 
follow the dictates of the Auditor General, because he is always 
quoting him, and that is exactly what we have done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
how can the Minister of Finance, who travelled throughout 
Canada saying that he was going to reduce the deficit, explain 
that, according to the <I>Globe and Mail</I> experts, other specialists 
and our own figures, next year's deficit will be the highest ever 
recorded in Canada, at almost $44 billion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, all I can do is 
acknowledge the fact that we will have a record deficit of $45.7 
billion this year, thanks to the previous government so well 
represented by my colleague. As I just said, between the 
expertise of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> and that of the Auditor General, 
we will choose the expertise of the Auditor General.

the hon. secretary of state told  CBC television: ``Reformers are

label people who ask legitimate questions as racist, or merely a 
policy of the hon. secretary of state.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training

for the inherent right to self-government and all other

yesterday at a meeting with representatives from the Front 
d'action populaire en réaménagement urbain that he had failed 
to keep his word by not providing any funds for social housing in 
the budget.
<P>
	Would the Minister be willing to keep his word and reconsider 
his decision in order to restore the funds allocated to social 
housing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the member for her question. I 
think my colleague does not realize how serious a commitment 
this governement has towards social housing. We said 
repeatedly before this House that the governement had, for 
instance, committed $2 billion to maintain existing housing. I 
think that $2 billion is a substantial amount of money and so is 
the $2 million which is to be allocated to the Residential 
Rehabilitation Assistance Program. It is the same with other 
ongoing commitments which are going to be maintained. 
Therefore, there is nothing to reconsider. We have already made 
a serious commitment and we must go on from there. Of course, 
any positive comments and suggestions will be welcomed and 
carefully looked at in all fairness.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, to my 
great regret, I must admit that our friends opposite lost their 
social awareness when they left the Opposition benches.
<P>
	How can the minister maintain that the budget meets social 
housing needs, when the mayor of Montreal stated yesterday 
that all the mayors of major Canadian cities agree that the 
federal government cannot withdraw from its commitment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to

Speaker, of course, each and every city and each and every 
mayor would like to have more. Of course, we will never be able 
to meet all existing needs. However, we must recognize that 
there is a commitment. We must admit that substantial amounts 
of money are allocated to social housing.

ours because the commitment is there and the money is 
available.

<P>
	Deep concern was expressed by constituents of mine about the 
presence in Canada of one Hussein Sheik Abdiraham, a former 
minister of defence of deposed Somali leader, Siad Barre. In 
1991 soldiers massacred hundreds of protesters opposed to that 
regime in Somali.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister of immigration to tell the 
House whether he has new evidence of wrongdoing by Sheik 
Abdiraham and, if so, are there sufficient grounds for a removal 
order to deport him under the Immigration Act regarding 
persons who have committed serious offences prior to coming to 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his question and the interest he and other members 
have shown.
<P>
	In his question, he alluded to the fact that the Immigration Act 
has a section which permits the government to remove senior 
officials and persons of any government that were part of serious 
human rights violations and atrocities. The government has 
confirmed that the Barre regime was one of those governments.
<P>
	When the story broke on this individual I instructed my

application originated. We have now compiled the necessary 
information and I have instructed my officials to immediately

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	In a previous Question Period I asked the Deputy Prime 
Minister what was the purpose of a $200,000 consultant study on 
parliamentarians' compensation since the government had 
announced its policy previous to that. The answer provided was 
that the government needed more information.
<P>
	I was surprised to see a letter in my office yesterday on 
letterhead reading ``Commission to Review Allowances of 
Members of Parliament''.
<P>
	When the Deputy Prime Minister stood in the House to defend 
the need for a $200,000 consultant study, was she aware that the 
commission was going to be studying the very same topic?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the commission the hon. member spoke about is required to be 
set up after each election.
<P>
	The government met the requirements of the law in setting up 
the commission. I am sure the study that the hon. member refers 
to will be a very useful input into the work of the commission.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
seems to me that the government's talk about jobs, jobs, jobs is 
more about perks, perks, perks. We have been spending 
$200,000 to date.
<P>
	I would like the Deputy Prime Minister to advise the House 
what the cost is of studying the study, that is the cost of this 
commission to be put in place. I would also like to know if there 
is any limit to the number of studies the government plans to 
conduct on the same issue.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in the first place, the consultant study that he spoke about was 
commissioned and started by the previous government.
<P>
	Second, the commission which my hon. friend is complaining 
about is one that has to be set up after each election, according to 
a law passed by Parliament. The government cannot ignore a 
decision of Parliament to set up such a commission after each 
election.
<P>
	My hon. friend asked for the cost of this. This is a detailed 
technical question which he probably should have put on the 
Order Paper. In order to respond to him in a full and courteous 
way, I will take his question as notice and get him the 
information as soon as possible. In future I suggest that he check 
on the requirements of the law before asking that type of

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Solicitor General. Based on documents tabled 
by the federal prosecutor for the Rutland district, in Vermont, 
the CBC alleged yesterday that, in 1992, arms dealers, two of 
them from Kahnawake, supplied 700 to 900 automatic weapons 
to organized crime in Canada. These guns were used to commit 
major crimes in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver.
<P>
	Can the Solicitor General tell us whether he plans to intervene 
in Mohawk territory and seize all the illegal weapons located 
there, and which are used by organized crime in Montreal, 
Toronto and Vancouver?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
according to the same report, police forces, including the 
RCMP, have already seized about one hundred weapons which 
had been supplied by that same network presently standing trial 
in the United States.
<P>
	It is because this government is quite aware of the problems 
connected with major smuggling networks, dealing not only in 
cigarettes but also in firearms, that it launched an 
anti-smuggling action plan only three months after it came to 
power. We intend to enforce the law everywhere in Canada and I 
am confident that the RCMP took all appropriate measures in 
this instance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the Solicitor General's answer. In support of his 
comments, and in view of the numerous crimes which were 
committed lately, could he give us at least one recent example of 
an arrest and prosecution case for possession of illegal arms on 
Mohawk territory?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder why the hon. member keeps on raising the Mohawk 
issue instead of asking questions on criminal activity in this

nation, he would use different wordings in his questions.

question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. I 
ask this question believing that Canadians deserve to know on 
what the government bases its policies.
<P>
	On the 14th of this month the minister of immigration said I 
was incorrect in concluding that the Economic Council of 
Canada report argues for a 1994 immigration level of 
approximately 180,000 immigrants, 70,000 fewer than the 
government intends to accept.
<P>
	Could the minister please cite for me the exact number of 
immigrants the Economic Council of Canada study recommends 
be accepted into Canada in 1994?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Quite gladly, Mr. Speaker. The Economic 
Council of Canada suggested the approximate 1 per cent figure. 
It also advocates a gradual approach toward that 1 per cent, and 
that is what I had cited before and is what I cite today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> A supplementary 
question, Mr. Speaker. Certainly the Economic Council of 
Canada report cites a 1 per cent figure, I believe over a 25-year 
span. Perhaps the minister should dedicate more time to 
studying his portfolio and less time to just talking about it.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Will the minister agree to stop misleading the people by 
suggesting that he has specific evidence on which he bases 
immigration policy? Will he agree to cede to the will of the 
overwhelming majority of Canadians instead of the desires of a 
few special interests?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I try to study as much as I can. I do 
not claim perfection nor does this side claim a monopoly on 
virtue.

	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> Mr. Speaker, we do not speak for a few, select 
numbers of special interest groups. I find that statement 
offensive. We speak and we decide and we make policy based on 
the national interest. We did not hide our immigration policies 
anywhere. They are found in the red book; the red book was 
distributed across the country and we got a tremendous national 
majority government as a result.
<P>
	Consequently we proceed in the national interest. I have cited 
a number of reports. The member continues to cite the C.D. 
Howe report, or used to, and it was quite specific in saying that 
at the very worst, net immigration is neutral to the economy. We 
are not misleading, we are simply using the facts and evidence 
before us to build a case.

After this week's budget, however, fears were raised that severe

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National

I find interesting all this talk of a new Parliament and the 
previous government being defeated because of the way things 
were. All I hear from them in terms of our practices in the House 
is that what is being applied to us was the old system.
<P>
	So much for the change, the new Parliament and the will to do 
things differently.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	My point of order relates to the Minister of Finance who in his 
reply offered to make information available to me. His reply was 
unclear in terms of what he exactly was committed to do. I was 
asking a specific question.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. I do not think that is strictly a 
point of order. I am sure the hon. member could get this 
information simply by-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> That is not a point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. The hon. member will realize it is not a 
point of order. I am sure this information can be elicited in other 
ways.
<P>
	There being no other points of order, we will proceed to the 
next order of the day.

Standing Order 36, petitions with regard to the serial killer 
board game.
<P>
	The petitions I am tabling today, along with others tabled 
previously, total some 105,552 signatures, all of them calling 
for a ban on the importation of this product into Canada.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a

which has just previously been endorsed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to place before this House a petition co-ordinated by Holy 
Cross High School in St. Catharines and signed by almost 3,000 
of my constituents in the surrounding areas.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, I have spoken in the House before 
about the harm to society of serial killer cards. The petitioners 
state that they support the efforts of Mrs. Debbie Mahaffy in her 
quest to have the importation of killer cards seized at the 
Canada-U.S. border to stop their distribution in Canada.
<P>
	The cards published by Eclipse Comic Books, the True Crime 
Trading Cards and other publishers feature the crimes of serial 
killers, mass murderers and gangsters. We do not want these 
cards in our communities.
<P>
	The petition continues: We abhor crimes of violence against 
persons and we believe that killer trading cards offer nothing 
positive for children or adults to admire or emulate but rather 
contribute to violence. Therefore the undersigned, your 
petitioners, humbly pray and call upon this Parliament of 
Canada to amend the laws of Canada to prohibit the importation, 
distribution, sale and manufacture of killer cards in law and to 
advise producers of killer cards that their product if destined for 
Canada will be seized and destroyed.
<P>
	May I reiterate my support for this petition which I table in the

	Having clearly heard what a member told another, and 
recognizing the Chair's responsibility to maintain mutual

<P>
	The member for Richelieu.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with you, the word 
``hypocrite'' should be banned from this House. But while I am 
willing to withdraw it, I would like to remind-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria: </B>No way. Without any conditions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> There are no conditions, Sir, I withdraw it 
entirely. But I would like to remind the members that the Prime 
Minister, not the present one, but Mr. Mulroney, used that word, 
you can check the Chair's records, against the member for 
Shefford, Mr. Lapierre, who was then the Bloc Quebecois House 
leader. At that time, the Chair judged it to be acceptable. The 
Prime Minister had called Jean Lapierre ``hypocrite'' and 
``insignifiant''. It appears that these words were found 
acceptable in the context they were used.
<P>
	Personally, I find it unacceptable and I want to retract and 
apologize to the member for using it. But I want him to 
understand that what prompted me to do so, is that we do not 
accept that petitions dealing with official languages be tabled 
while saying: ``I am tabling them but I do not support them''. He 
should either agree or disagree. I like people who tell the truth.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I appreciate that and we

<P>
	I do not think it is totally fair that the member, although I do

in his additional comments is still leaving an impression in the 
House that is not accurate for a number of reasons. I want to 
make this-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. As I stated 
previously, I will not allow the House to engage in debate on this 
matter. The Chair asked the member for Richelieu to withdraw 
his comment. He has. It has been accepted. We will now move 
on. Were there any other petitions?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Point of privilege. The hon. member who made 
some comments and withdrew certain of them made reference to 
the contents of a petition and a comment that I made. In neither 
case was he aware of its contents nor were they accurate. His 
statements about something that he had not read, nor did he

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BORROWINGAUTHORITYACT,1994-95">BORROWING AUTHORITY ACT, 1994-95</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-14, an act to provide borrowing authority for the fiscal year 
beginning April 1, 1994, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
rising today to address Bill C-14, an act to extend to the 
government borrowing authority for the next fiscal year, 
borrowing authority in the order of $34.3 billion with a 
contingency for an additional $3 billion.
<P>
	For those who have trouble grasping some of these numbers, 
and I think that is probably most Canadians, I will just spell it 
out. We are talking here initially, to put it in number terms, 
34,300,000,000.00 dollars and cents. That kind of money, to 
give it some practical significance, would be enough to 
eliminate the GST and then pay it back twice to all Canadians. It 
would be enough to halve the income tax. It would be enough to 
pay old age security for an entire year without any additional 
revenue sources.
<P>
	This is the highest planned borrowing. As far as I know, it is 
certainly the highest planned deficit on which this is borrowing 
based in Canadian history. We have had higher deficits in the 
end, but this is the highest we have ever had to begin with.
<P>
	I will not waste a lot of time in telling the Chair that I will be 
opposing this bill on that ground. It is safe to say that every 
member of the Reform caucus and I will be opposing it for like 
reasons.
<P>
	In my speech and in the speeches of other members of my 
party who will follow today and subsequently, we will not 
restrict our comments merely to the borrowing aspect, but we 
will comment on and evaluate the general budgetary policies of 
the government from which are flowing these tremendous 
borrowing requirements.
<P>
	This of course all comes from the red book which I think is 
widely becoming known now, upon presentation of the budget, 
as the red ink book.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Liberal Party talked about its red book throughout the 
election campaign. But now we see what a red ink book is all 
about. With this bill, we will be increasing the national debt of 
our country by more than $34 billion. Over the next three years, 
we are talking about an increase of at least $100 billion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is a lot of money.
<P>
	I want to make my remarks on four particular categories. I 
will start by evaluating the stated targets in the budget and give 
an evaluation of those. Second, I want to look very carefully at 
the economic assumptions and the projections behind the 
targets. Third, I want to look at where we are headed financially 
and economically, particularly on the issue of this bill, the 
borrowing authority, the debt. Finally, I would like to 
summarize in some detail by looking at what the market is 
saying and where the government may be going.
<P>
	In his budget speech the minister spoke about achieving 
targets rather than having illusions and falling short. I want to 
evaluate some of those targets and the data used to obtain them. 
Let me make a general comment. The government, unlike the 
previous government, has provided some measurable targets. It 
has also provided in the short term more realistic data than were 
provided by the previous government. It is better data that are 
much easier to evaluate.
<P>
	However, to summarize, the targets are very soft; the action is 
somewhat overstated; the achievement is not at all clear. The 
minister has spoken of a two-part budget and of course we have 
no long term or even medium term financial projections in this 
budget. We have only an empty third year column in which we 
are told we will reach the target. That is a general comment.
<P>
	Let me go back to previous experience on this matter. In April 
1993 the former Progressive Conservative Party and 
government brought down its final budget. In that budget it 
promised to balance the books in six years. This would mainly 
be achieved through spectacular economic growth.
<P>
	The House will recall that at the time the budget only laid out 
projections for five years. It showed that by fiscal year 1997-98 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1866"> 1866 </A></B>
<P>
we would have a deficit of about $8 billion and extrapolating the 
economic projections we reached a budget balance in fiscal year 
1998-99.
<P>
	In the specific projections that were made we had this 
tremendous prediction of an average rate of growth of almost 
4.5 per cent per year until the end of the century. We had rapidly 
declining unemployment rates which would fall to about 7.5 per 
cent by the end of the century. We had spectacular falls in 
interest rates, both nominal and real, and of course we had an 
income tax system that would generate all the spectacular 
revenue increases that these assumptions implied.
<P>
	The former Conservative budget of 1993 called for a deficit in 
fiscal year 1994-95 of $29 billion. In the election campaign our 
party said, and I want to give a realistic evaluation of this 
situation, that the Conservatives were grossly underestimating 
the seriousness of the problem. We said that the Tory plan would 
not reduce the deficit. In fact we said that the Tory and the 
Liberal plans were pretty much identical in macroeconomic 
terms.
<P>
	This is not the first time when one political party, the 
Conservative Party, talked like born again right wingers about 
the seriousness of the deficit and how this had to be stomped out 
at all costs and the Liberal Party talked about jobs and social 
democratic priorities.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	Of course in reality the numbers that they were proposing 
were very close. When one extracted out of the Conservative 
projections the unrealistic assumptions, one found that one 
reached a target of about 3 per cent of GDP by the end of the 
century. That was the real Conservative target in that budget 
although they did not say that. The Liberals said this was 
excessively harsh and that they would do things differently. We 
Reformers said this was not good enough, the deficit was more 
serious than either of these parties was saying.
<P>
	Interestingly, if I look back at some of our own studies, and I 
can take some credit and blame for this, I see that the trend we 
had established in our evaluation of the likely deficit for fiscal 
year 1994-95 was $31.2 billion. We were told that we were 
excessively pessimistic, that we had grossly overstated the 
problem.
<P>
	Now we have the revelations of the past few months about the 
doctoring of the books that occurred in the later days of the last 
Parliament. We are now admitting, and the government is 
admitting, that we are looking at a trend deficit figure, with no 
policy adjustments, of $41.2 billion or exactly $10 billion above 
the Reform Party's estimate of how serious this problem was 
only a year ago; $10 billion above what we thought one year ago, 
we who were most concerned about this and were labelled 
hysterical about our evaluation of the situation.
<P>
	This is one of many signs of the very serious and rapid 
deterioration we are now about to enter upon if we do not get a 
handle on this problem.
<P>
	Just as an aside, why did the Reform Party so underestimate 
the deficit for 1994-95? I would like to comment on that as the 
finance minister has made some reference to it in the House. He 
has said that we had unrealistic growth assumptions. In fact we 
did not have unrealistic growth assumptions. Our growth 
assumptions for last year were modestly above what transpired. 
Our growth assumptions in the longer run were not over 
estimates. In fact they are lower than the growth assumptions 
that the government is presenting today.
<P>
	What happened was that we had overestimated the ability of 
the tax system in general to extract revenues from economic 
growth. Last year we had a dramatic collapse in the revenue 
GDP ratio which indicates a significantly lower revenue 
potential that is now recognized. We had a collapse of over 1.5 
per cent of the ability of the tax system to extract revenue from 
growth in the gross domestic product.
<P>
	That is something I will be talking about more. It is now a 
recognized problem. It was not at the time. It is indicative once 
again of the underground economy, smuggling, tax avoidance 
and the impact of sustained recession are problems we are 
beginning to understand better.
<P>
	Let me move on to the second issue I wanted to address. We 
talked about the targets the government set. Let us now talk 
about the specific economic assumptions and projections that 
the government has made in saying it will reach these targets by 
the end of the third year.
<P>
	This government, and I want to be fair here, unlike the 
previous government has not spectacularly exaggerated its 
estimates. Its record is mixed. It is better than the previous 
government but there is still a lot to be desired.
<P>
	I am going to talk about some subjects: economic growth 
projections, unemployment projections, interest rate 
projections, revenue projections and the efficiency of the tax 
system. I wrote most of what I have to say today prior to reading 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I> article this morning.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	Economists all over the country are in the process of studying 
the budget, of examining these tables and estimates very 
carefully. I should say that in the last two or three days it is 
increasingly obvious that some of the deficiencies in the 
assumptions of this budget are being exposed.
<P>
	Let me mention a few, not all, because there is going to be 
more debate about this in the upcoming days. First, the 
government's most positive feature in its planning, job creation, 
is definitely not exaggerated in the budget. Unemployment is 
projected to fall to only 10.8 per cent in 1995, with modest job 
recovery thereafter.
<P>
	I think it is probably accurate. It is a very interesting 
projection coming from a government that says that  creating 
jobs is the major priority of the budget, and continues to insist 
there is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1867"> 1867 </A></B>
<P>
somehow a link between jobs and debt. That somehow, if the 
government spends money, if we continue to run these deficits, 
we will create jobs. The budget indicates what we in the Reform 
Party are saying is correct. The longer these deficits stay high 
the longer job creation will stay low.
<P>
	I can be a little more critical when it comes to its projections 
for economic growth. The government has forecast 3.0 per cent 
economic growth for 1994 and 3.8 per cent economic growth for 
1995. It has avoided making explicit projections for the period 
after that but its documents as well as the minister's responses 
earlier this week would indicate that it expects growth in the 
order of 3.8 per cent to continue in years 1996 and after.
<P>
	The basis of these growth projections is said to be in median 
or even below median assessment of the forecasts of private 
sector economists and forecasters. This is said to be a brand new 
approach to budget planning. This is not the case. This is not a 
brand new approach. The previous government also cited 
private sector forecasters in making its own more exaggerated 
and unrealistic growth projections.
<P>
	What is similar here and what needs to be pointed out, if we 
are going to rely on the projections of private sector forecasters 
is that it would be useful to have some additional information, 
such as who are the private sector forecasters that are being 
sampled in these kinds of growth projections, precisely what 
kind of adjustments have they made to their own economic 
models in light of recent evidence, and most important, if that is 
your only basis of forecasting, what is in fact the record of some 
of these private sector forecasters in terms of their own 
evaluation of economic growth and other economic variables.
<P>
	I would like to mention that in a recent article in the <I>Financial 
Post</I> entitled ``Deficit and Jobs Cloud Optimism'' private sector 
forecasters were quoted as saying that their projections for the 
next fiscal year were the following: for 1994 the median 
projection was 3.5 per cent, but for the years thereafter the 
average median forecast was 3.2 per cent which is considerably 
below the government's forecast.
<P>
	Our position has been that budgetary planning should be 
based on very firm conservative budgeting principles. Those 
principles are the following: That we should select the lesser of 
two different pieces of information, the lesser of the forecasts 
that are out there among evaluators and recent economic history 
and experience. It would ensure a very conservative planning 
path over an entire economic cycle and is the approach we have 
used to estimate growth paths and recessionary deficits.
<P>
	Using this, let me convey to the House the planning forecast 
that we have been using. As I say the Minister of Finance has 
inadvertently misrepresented this.
<P>
	The planning forecast we have been using for the past several 
months, since the minister's statement in November, has been a 
forecast of 3.0 per cent for 1994. That is in agreement with the 
government. However, we suggest that the second and 
subsequent year forecasts are optimistic rather than 
conservative. We have projected those growths to range in the 
area of about 3.2 per cent on average as predicted by private 
sector forecasters.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	The third issue I want to look at is the interest rate issue where 
the statistical games being played are much more serious. They 
certainly involve more distortion and potentially much more 
danger for the government. That is the assumption on interest 
rates.
<P>
	Using the rate on 90-day commercial paper as its benchmark, 
the government is saying that short-term rates will be about 4.5 
per cent in 1994, rising modestly to 5.0 per cent in 1995. Longer 
term interest rates, with the 10-year rate on government bonds 
as the benchmark, will fall from 1993-94 to 6.4 per cent and will 
continue to fall in 1995 to 6.1 per cent and staying thereabout 
thereafter.
<P>
	In our view once again we should be using a conservative 
approach that would look at some of the forecasts out there-I 
suggest that these are exaggerations of the forecasts-as well as 
the clear market data which exist on interest rate expectations. 
There is in the marketplace an elaborate term structure for 
interest rates and an elaborate set of variables on which the 
market forecasts present and future interest rates.
<P>
	Looking at that data we can see they reflect the government's 
short term forecasts. We see that interest rates are expected to 
rise gradually in the short end over the next few years. The 
reason for that is quite straightforward.
<P>
	There is general concern about inflation, particularly if we are 
going to have recovery. That is reflected in interest rate 
projections. More significantly, there is no clear sign in the 
marketplace that long term interest rates are going to fall 
dramatically. Long term interest rates have had a pattern of 
falling and rising in recent years with the inflation pattern we 
have had.
<P>
	At present the 10-year rate on government bonds has been 
ranging between 6.8 and 6.9 per cent. There is no sign of a 
decline in real medium term and long term interest rates. Maybe 
there will be but certainly for an organization that is 
experiencing the kind of debt levels we have here, we would not 
want to underestimate the possible debt charges as a way of 
balancing the budget.
<P>
	This is the most serious deficiency. Other speakers 
particularly from the Bloc Quebecois have commented on the 
overestimation of the revenue forecasts. That is something 
serious. For a government that finds itself with a half a trillion 
dollar debt which will rise rapidly even under its own 
projections, to underestimate the potential debt charge on that is 
a very serious 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1868"> 1868 </A></B>
<P>
and imprudent planning assumption, particularly when that  
deficit on average has a term of about two and a half years. It is 
now a very short term debt.
<P>
	To concentrate that debt on the front end, while we face 
referendums and other economic and political uncertainties in 
this country, makes us vulnerable to rises in interest burdens. In 
our own case, as I have said, in our forecast of interest rates we 
have suggested we should look at the term structure.
<P>
	We can take factors such as the overestimation of growth rates 
into the second and third year and the underestimation of 
interest rates at the long end into account. These factors alone 
would have an effect of adding half a billion dollars to the 
planning assumption for 1994-95 and at least $1.5 billion to the 
planning assumption for 1995-96. Because these imprudent 
assumptions are concentrated in the area of interest and debt 
charge, we can assume that any such understatement will 
compound rapidly into the future.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	While these assumptions are somewhat of an improvement 
over the previous government, once we get into the second year 
in particular-and the government says those can be extended 
indefinitely into the third year-the overall pattern is not that 
different.
<P>
	We have growth forecasts below those of the Conservatives 
but well above market forecasts and well above recent historical 
experience. We have interest rate forecasts that are identical to 
what the Conservatives proposed. And we have the most 
dubious of all assumptions which is the tremendous revenue 
generating capacity of the tax system, even though we continue 
to have one of the highest tax burdens in the industrialized 
world.
<P>
	Where are we headed if we take all of these things into 
account? Our assessment is that we are probably headed for a 
very modest deficit reduction this year. It will be lucky to come 
under $40 billion. Our assessment is we will certainly not be 
achieving a 3 per cent debt to GDP ratio in 1996-97.
<P>
	Based on this budget we will not achieve all the things the 
government wants: rapidly falling deficits, modest to high 
economic growth, extraordinarily low inflation, nominal and 
lower interest rates, et cetera. It is a very optimistic pattern by 
the time we get to the second and third year and there is very 
little to suggest it will be achieved.
<P>
	In all honesty I would suggest to government members that if 
the government felt this were achievable, it would have 
published the figures. The fact it has decided to leave the third 
year column out of most of the tables is no accident.
<P>
	The minister says he does not want to be hoisted with his own 
petard. Those were not his exact words but in other words, he 
does not want to repeat the mistakes of the Conservatives. He 
does not want to repeat the mistakes of making these forecasts, 
putting them on paper and then having them not come true. 
Therefore, rather than provide us with conservative or prudent 
forecasts he provides us with no forecast whatsoever and says 
that way he will not be held up on this.
<P>
	On top of this another good question which should come out 
of all this is why is there a second stage to this budget if it will 
already achieve its objectives?
<P>
	That is another reason I asked the minister to admit that the 
projections show the deficit will not fall below $30 billion. If he 
could achieve this objective and if it was based on realistic 
assumptions, there would obviously be no need to hide them. 
Furthermore, there would be no need to announce a second stage 
in the 1995 budget. Clearly, some of these excuses are wearing 
thin.
<P>
	My personal view is that the government would be advised to 
provide the House with realistic information and to suggest that 
perhaps these targets are not going to be achieved. That is a far 
better way to do it than to play a shell game with the numbers.
<P>
	I will comment a little more particularly on some of the 
critical ratios that are going to be affected by this borrowing bill. 
I recommend to the House once again chapter 5 of the 1993 
Auditor General's report. It identifies five critical ratios in 
terms of evaluating federal fiscal policy. These are a set of 
operating ratios: Overall spending to revenue; program 
spending to revenue; deficit financing to revenue; as well as 
some more macro-ratios: the deficit to GDP target; and the debt 
to GDP target.
<P>
	Commenting briefly on the operating revenues the former 
government was so fond of using, under this budget the 
operating ratios are forecast by the government to improve very 
modestly on the way they have been trending. With adjusted 
projections based on more realistic assumptions those ratios 
will be flat at best and they are at very high levels.
<P>
	In terms of the deficit-GDP ratio, in spite of what the 
government says, with the actions strictly contained in this 
budget that ratio will be around 4 per cent of GDP by the time we 
hit 1996-97.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	The debt-GDP ratio is a very critical one. It is the level of our 
debt relative to our ability to pay. The debt-GDP ratio is forecast 
at about 75 per cent for 1995-96 and flattening. Our calculations 
suggest this debt-GDP ratio will be closer to 76 per cent in the 
subsequent fiscal year and will be rising. This is the most 
critical ratio of all because ultimately this is the ratio on which 
the long run ability of the federal government to sustain its 
spending and financial policies is based.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1869"> 1869 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me repeat for the benefit of all members the criteria on 
some of these variables contained in the Maastricht treaty in 
the negotiations for the European Community. The government 
is fond of quoting 3 per cent. Where did this 3 per cent concept 
come from? We are told that 3 per cent of GDP is a reasonable 
interim target. Why? We are told it is because that was the target 
used by the European Community in the Maastricht treaty. By 
the way, the European Community targets were not achieved 
but those targets were a 3 per cent deficit to GDP ratio and a 
60 per cent debt to GDP ratio, 60 per cent of all national debt 
to gross domestic product. It was gross, 60 per cent gross.
<P>
	Excluding the provinces and the municipalities, under this 
budget the federal government alone will have a public debt 
ratio of 75 per cent. It will be a net ratio, not a gross ratio. The 
government is well short. If it were to meet the Maastricht 
targets it would be expected to run a significant surplus in the 
upcoming financial years, not move toward a mere 3 per cent 
target.
<P>
	Let me also talk about the size of the borrowing because it is 
important as well. The deficit is projected by the government to 
be in the order of $39.7 billion. Government members and 
others fondly point out that this borrowing bill is only asking for 
$34.3 billion more or less. They say our borrowing requirement 
is less than the actual deficit and therefore is not as serious and 
we should not worry about it. We have these non-budgetary 
transactions that are generating surpluses and if we take those 
into account we are in much better shape.
<P>
	I caution government members very carefully against using 
that logic. I would call it Kim Campbell logic. Kim Campbell 
made some reference to this in her leadership campaign.
<P>
	The surpluses on the non-budgetary transactions mainly 
concern pension and superannuation accounts. In spite of their 
cash surpluses in recent years these accounts have had very 
serious actuarial liabilities. Far from there being a solution in 
these non-budgetary accounts, they are a completely separate 
problem in addition to the deficit and debt problems we face and 
will have to be addressed in the future.
<P>
	There are significant actuarial liability problems. To suggest 
for a minute we can borrow from the non-budgetary accounts in 
order to finance or reduce our deficit and thereby solve the 
problem is completely false. It is an extremely dangerous 
suggestion for anyone to send out to financial markets.
<P>
	I want to give a blunt summary of my reading of this budget, 
not just an economic one but a political one. The government has 
provided small cuts in this budget. It has provided smaller 
taxation measures. It has provided a very, very modest fiscal 
stimulus program. Most important, it has deferred major 
decisions about the budget and fiscal policy to subsequent years. 
Let me comment generally on some of those points.
<P>
	The government talks about having reduced expenditures 
much more than it has increased taxes. There are $5 of spending 
cuts for every $1 of revenue increase. There are five cents of 
spending cuts for every one cent of revenue increase. The budget 
has effected very small magnitudes. They are measured against 
planned expenditure levels. We all know that can be a highly 
distorted pattern because we then say we are not going to spend 
something we never really spent.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	On top of that, if we actually look at the figures, at the end 
product and not these ridiculous cumulative measures, and take 
into account that a large portion of these measures was actually 
Conservative policy, the government will have reduced its 
planned spending by less than $6.5 billion by the end of the third 
year. The actual discretionary increases of revenue are less than 
$1 billion. These are very small magnitudes. We can compare 
that with an expected $25 billion gain in revenue from economic 
turnaround. The measures in the budget are absolutely dwarfed 
by what is expected to occur in the economy.
<P>
	Then there is the fiscal stimulus program. I do not know how 
the government categorizes these, but there are 15 or so new 
spending initiatives in the budget, the major one of which is the 
infrastructure program. It is also a small package by any 
standards. I do not have to comment at length on the deferring of 
major decisions to subsequent years. We have had 18 studies.
<P>
	I am sometimes amused by the rhetoric used by politicians. 
The minister said that we were taking action directly, that we 
were constituting a study or a committee or a commission. This 
is a very interesting concept of immediate action. The bottom 
line is that the deferral of decisions will cost $100 billion in new 
debt and associated service charges over the planning period.
<P>
	In doing these things, particularly the small cuts, the smaller 
taxation measures and the fiscal stimulus, the budget is actually 
very close to the concept President Clinton had in mind though 
his magnitudes were much bolder. There is not an identical 
problem in the United States but a similar and serious problem.
<P>
	The congressional process in that country caused a much 
more sensible budget package to emerge. It included some of the 
expenditure reduction measures and, in the case of the United 
States in which there is more tax room, some tax increases. The 
congressional process eliminated the stimulus program which 
was, as it will be here, an absolutely ineffective use of additional 
money to convince people the government is doing something.
<P>
	What has happened in the United States has been a relatively 
high success. Growth in the United States is beginning and has 
been in the past several quarters to significantly outflank 
Canada's growth. On top of that its job rate is improving. Its 
unemployment rate is falling. Its budgetary deficits although 
still serious are dropping  very dramatically. I point to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1870"> 1870 </A></B>
<P>
congressional process which listened to opposition parties, the 
Republicans, and which produced a much better policy.
<P>
	On that last point let me just make another summary of the 
budget, a political summary. As deficient as the budget is there 
are some improvements. The improvements are not in the 
dollars. They are the improvements in the philosophy embedded 
in the budget.
<P>
	The finance minister may have spoken like a New Democrat, 
but many of the measures are in the direction of Reform Party 
policy. I look at what the government has done to old age 
programs, the direction in which it is moving. I look at the 
direction on unemployment insurance which I think is very 
sound. I look at the direction on industrial subsidies, the 
direction on social programs and transfers to the provinces. The 
fact of the matter is that these are just directions and with one or 
two exceptions the dollars involved are not significant.
<P>
	The government is laying the groundwork in the budget-and 
that is what the market expects-to shedding its election 
campaign pledge and moving toward adopting real budgetary 
measures in the subsequent year. That is what the market hopes. 
The market hopes that these UI cuts are a sign from the 
government of a much more serious attitude toward the big 
spending programs. The government is hoping that it will get 
some breathing room.
<P>
	I would suggest that buying time is a very dangerous way to 
proceed. We know what buying time has done to us in the past. I 
was with the Conservative Party in the mid-eighties when its 
members decided to buy time. We know what happened both to 
the their budget as well as to their party.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	In summary, the budget has weak goals. The goals are not 
clearly attainable. There is some exaggeration in the 
expectations. It is somewhat better than before but still 
exaggeration. More than anything the government is taking a big 
gamble with everybody's future by putting off these decisions.
<P>
	I would suggest that politically this gamble is not likely to 
work. It will probably benefit the opposition in political terms. 
Let me also point out that if it does not work out it is going to 
benefit members of the Official Opposition more than anybody. 
It is going to benefit their ultimate goals which will be hinged on 
the economic performance of the country much more than they 
will be hinged on the religion of official bilingualism.
<P>
	I hope the government remembers that. I hope it takes very 
seriously the concerns expressed in this debate and in the 
debates in the months to follow, not only as we complete this 
budgetary process but as we begin the next one.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Could the hon. member 
for London West indicate to the Chair whether she will be 
sharing her time or in fact using the full 20 minutes?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time. I consider myself privileged. I am deeply 
grateful to those in the urban riding of London West who put 
their trust in me. I pledge to do my utmost to justify this trust.
<P>
	I wish to acknowledge and thank warmly my family and all 
those colleagues and friends who support me in these exciting 
days. As the mother of three young children it would be 
impossible to carry out my responsibilities without their 
encouragement and assistance.
<P>
	In this Chamber I feel the privilege of serving Canada and my 
constituents, and to serve truly I pray for humility and decry 
arrogance, for humility leads to wisdom, the wisdom to listen 
and appreciate, to try and understand as well as to be 
understood.
<P>
	This is the start of my journey, a journey that may not be easy. 
It will certainly be bewildering and sometimes treacherous. I 
will strive for the courage, faith and courtesy to face squarely 
these unusual times of changing conditions and share a vision of 
a strong Canada with Canadians across our country.
<P>
	Let there be no doubt that together with all members of the 
House I will not shrink from responsibility so that one day I can 
look back and take pride in my modest contribution to this 
chosen homeland of mine.
<P>
	I came to this country at the age of 5, having been born on the 
beautiful Mediterranean island of Malta. I am the first Maltese 
born Canadian to sit as a member in the House. I am very proud 
and thankful to be a Canadian.
<P>
	At the commencement of the 35th Parliament each of us 
brings along an agenda that embodies a vision of Canada. Mine 
is a vision of freedom and opportunity based on tolerance and 
equality, a vision that rejects discrimination and extremism and 
every shade of injustice, a vision that gives us the assurance of a 
glorious Canada with all its democratic institutions at our 
disposal. We are fortunate in this land to have progressed well in 
many of these goals but our work is yet unfinished.
<P>
	The primary concern of my constituents is the rebuilding of 
our Canadian economy and jobs for the present and jobs for the 
future. I am heartened that the government, true to its 
commitments, has already taken the initiative to translate our 
promises into action and charted its direction for choices in 
co-operation with the provincial governments. I hope the entire 
range of economic institutions and groups will co-operate in 
this great venture for the realization of our pressing objectives 
of deficit reduction and growth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1871"> 1871 </A></B>
<P>
	What we need for our deficit reduction and for facing the 
economic challenges of the nineties is a simultaneous 
commitment to increase economic growth and to regain control 
of our finances. Our budget addresses squarely these 
requirements.
<P>
	In tackling the issue of growth one of our main thrusts will be 
where the backbone of job creation is: the area of small 
business. Small and medium sized businesses have accounted 
for 85 per cent of all new jobs created in Canada since 1979. In 
my riding of London West there are over 1,000 small businesses 
and many are struggling.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	The government through the Minister of Finance introduced a 
plan for growing small businesses. It is evident the government 
will take the necessary measures to address the basic problems 
facing the small business industry.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has announced the establishment of a 
Canada investment fund to provide venture capital for 
innovative companies. There will be a Canadian technology 
network to help small businesses gain access to new 
technologies. A task force will be established to work with 
banks to develop a code of conduct for small business lending.
<P>
	Another booster for small business will be the replacement of 
the GST, a program that in addition to dampening growth by 
fuelling the underground economy has been an expensive 
administrative nightmare. I also believe it is time to harmonize 
our provincial and federal taxation.
<P>
	The industrial competitiveness of the nation today more than 
ever before is influenced by its capabilities in science and 
technology and by its research and development efforts.
<P>
	OECD comparisons of science and technology expenditures 
as a percentage of GDP find that countries with a positive 
balance of trade in high growth industries are those that make 
substantial investments in research and development.
<P>
	The budget has now strengthened R and D in Canada. We must 
encourage technology partnerships among Canadian 
universities, research institutions and the private sector which 
emphasize the commercial application of research and 
development.
<P>
	The Drake-Siebens Research Institute, the John P. Robarts 
Research Institute, the University of Western Ontario, 
University Hospital and an industrial research park in my riding 
all are eager to share in the value added jobs that can result from 
these linkages.
<P>
	It is especially important to tap the talent and energy of the 
young minds of a generation that is now facing over 17 per cent 
unemployment. We must ensure that there is a relevant 
transition of these young minds from their schooling to their 
workplace. New youth internship and apprenticeship programs 
are being launched under the budget.
<P>
	Our world has undergone tremendous changes and the time 
has now come for a re-examination of a whole basis of social 
and economic policy. The world has become highly 
unpredictable both politically and economically. Nevertheless 
there is one common feature, a growing interdependence 
between countries, an interdependence that is unavoidable and 
is strengthened by a process of world economic globalization.
<P>
	The conclusion of the Uruguay round of the GATT further 
reduced tariff barriers. The political obstacles formerly imposed 
by the cold war are no more. Market based economies 
unconstrained by ideological divisions between east and west 
are gaining wide acceptance, all of which reinforce the 
globalization process and present us with a tremendous 
potential for new markets and ventures with east European 
countries, the new republics of the former Soviet Union, China 
and the Pacific Rim.
<P>
	Our jobs and future prosperity will depend upon our ability to 
get access to these new markets and to sell our products and 
services abroad. Let us start establishing the links to the future. 
It is important to remember that one in five jobs comes from 
trade.
<P>
	As a developed society we have to realize that in shaping our 
domestic economic policies we must consider the inevitable 
changing international economic order fuelled by the process of 
globalization. We must focus on the agents of this globalization 
process and deepen our understanding of the implications on 
domestic economic policies in general and trade policies in 
particular.
<P>
	At the same time we must ensure that Canadians affected by 
these changes are supported by the government in coping with a 
different economic order. Let there be no doubt that for 
Canadians this will be a challenge but should not be seen as an 
obstacle to our economic evolution.
<P>
	I would not be true to myself if I end my maiden speech 
without touching the subject which has been lingering in the 
minds and hearts of many Canadians. Much has been said and 
written about unity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In 1867, the English and the French communities decided to 
join together to form a confederation whose existence is now 
firmly established and which must be perpetuated. The other 
communities also contributed in an essential way to the 
development of our country and allowed Canada to become what 
it is now: a country admired by the entire world. For the nations 
that it welcomes, cultural diversity is a source of wealth and 
renewal.
<P>
	Canadian unity is an established fact and must not be 
questioned.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1872"> 1872 </A></B>
<P>
	It is our strength, our pride and a guarantee of stability and 
better future for all Canadians.
<P>
	Preserving that unity is absolutely crucial to all Canadians 
being able to meet together the challenges of the next century.

<P>
	Quebec is a part of Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>]

<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to make a brief comment because I liked 
the speech of the hon. member very much. First, she sounded 
very sincere, and second, she is the first member of Maltese 
descent. I congratulate her.
<P>
	Despite the ring of truth and sincerity in her speech, as well as 
her enthusiasm-something all new parliamentarians have in 
common-she will certainly agree with me that Canada is a 
country in which Quebec will democratically choose to stay or 
will decide to leave. The guarantee we must have from that side 
of the House or the other side is that as democrats-and there 
can be only one type, no doubt-the result of the referendum and 
the choice of Quebec will be respected.
<P>
	Personally, I can tell you that should Quebec decide to remain 
within the Canadian federation I would respect that decision, but 
I am committed to working democratically for the other choice.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for her speech, which was really from 
the heart.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Barnes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments. I would always support the hon. member's right to be 
an elected member of this House and to give his viewpoint.
<P>
	I am speaking from my riding and as one who did vote in 
favour of the Charlottetown accord and also from my heart when 
I say that I believe Canada is a nation that is for all of us.
<P>
	I was very fortunate as a young girl to have lived in the 
province of Quebec for a short time. I regard Quebec as part of 
my country. I want the silent majority across this land to know 
that we are inclusive. We are not two solitudes. It is my wish that 
we are one. I think it is very important economically that we 
grow more together, help each other and provide the necessary 
cohesiveness across this land so that we can go beyond.
<P>
	This is a country that has told us clearly that it does not want 
to involve itself in constitutional debate. They need this country 
to get back to work. That is why I am here. I do have a very 
heartfelt wish for unity in this country and I will express it but I 
will also respect other members to deliver their messages.
<P>
	I am hopeful, though, that my message as an English speaking 
Canadian will go out to members who represent constituents in 
Quebec and that they hear my message as an anglophone in 
Ontario. I am studying French and these were very difficult 
words for me to say in French. I do not understand everything 
but I want members to know that I am trying.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
commend the hon. member on her maiden speech. I thought it 
was very well delivered and from experience, once done, it gets 
a little easier every time.
<P>
	I would like to focus on trade and the hon. member's 
comments in relation to world markets, globalization, and 
bringing that down to an interprovincial trade concept. There is 
a tendency to think that our east-west linkage across Canada is 
deteriorating economically, that it is becoming more a 
north-south kind of thing, and that social issues are the binding 
factor from an east-west point of view.
<P>
	Would the hon. member address a few comments from a trade 
point of view in relation to the interprovincial trade barriers.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Barnes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her 
questions.
<P>
	I think it is very important to realize that this government is 
working toward breaking down interprovincial barriers because 
it is very important that we trade with each other as well as with 
the rest of the world. In my riding I am most concerned that the 
small businesses that have the expertise and the talent access 
these new markets, not only outside of our country but across 
our country. We are working toward that very rapidly. I hope 
these barriers come down so we can have better employment and 
better mobility for jobs across this land.

West for her fine maiden speech. I enjoyed it thoroughly.
<P>
	Today I ask my fellow Canadians, one and all, to think calmly 
and clearly upon the budget that has been placed before this 
House. We are indeed fortunate to have such a well thought-out 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1873"> 1873 </A></B>
<P>
and balanced financial plan presented to us as the basis of our 
operations the next fiscal year.
<P>
	This balanced approach will lead to a fundamental reform of 
our system, create jobs, continue to care for those in need, and 
begin the process of reducing the debt to the target of 3 per cent 
of gross domestic product.
<P>
	As the finance minister said in his speech, now is not the time 
to move away from our values but is the time to return to them. I 
see it. We have kept our commitment to the Canadian people as 
outlined in our campaign platform entitled <I>Creating 
Opportunities</I>, now simply known as the red book.
<P>
	This budget is about jobs. It takes action to support the job 
creation now, while at the same time it builds the foundation for 
solid growth and quality, lasting jobs for the future.
<P>
	This will be achieved through working toward three major 
goals.
<P>
	First, building a framework for economic renewal to help 
Canadian business succeed and to turn innovation into a more 
effective engine for economic growth.
<P>
	Second, ensuring a responsible social security system that is 
fair, compassionate and affordable, a reform that will create jobs 
and opportunities for all Canadians.
<P>
	Third, restoring fiscal balance to government so that it can 
devote its full energy to helping Canadians adapt to a world of 
challenge and change.
<P>
	This government is dedicated to restoring fiscal 
responsibility. This budget exemplifies that commitment by 
planning deficit reduction from $47.7 billion in 1993-94 to 
$39.7 billion in 1994-95 and down to $32.7 billion in the 
1995-96 fiscal year.
<P>
	Over the three-year period outlined in the budget the 
government will implement $5 of spending cuts for every $1 in 
revenue increase. This is the only path to successful deficit 
reduction. Canadians can no longer afford to shoulder an 
ever-increasing tax burden. This budget acknowledges that fact 
that while also recognizing the increase in spending today is 
simply increased taxes for tomorrow.
<P>
	In terms of these spending cuts, this is the most significant 
budget in years. Measures in the budget result in gross savings 
of $3.7 billion in 1994-95, rising quickly to $13.6 billion in the 
1996-97 fiscal year. During the entire three-year period gross 
savings total $28.6 billion.
<P>
	These cuts are not illusions. For instance, defence spending 
will be 7 per cent lower in the 1995-96 year compared to this 
year. Business subsidies will be almost 9 per cent lower in the 
1995-96 fiscal year. The cost to government will decline. The 
cost of the unemployment insurance program will be reduced by 
more than 10 per cent. In the end, total program spending will be 
virtually frozen over the next two years and will decline as a 
percentage of our economy.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, by applying prudence in making 
economic assumptions the actions set in this budget set the 
deficit on target of achieving our stated goal of a 3 per cent GDP 
of deficit by the year 1996-97. The response I have received 
from constituents regarding this budget has been most positive. 
Business persons were pleased with the rollback of the 
unemployment insurance premium rates to the $3 level. This 
initiative will save business nearly $300 million a year. This 
money can be reinvested in business to stimulate employment 
and create much needed consumer demand.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	They also like the support for small business that came from 
the formation of the Canada investment fund to provide venture 
capital for small business and the Canadian technology network 
which will provide access to new technologies.
<P>
	I have talked to small business. These operators were pleased 
to hear that a task force would be established to work with the 
banks for which at this moment they have great mistrust. We 
hope that the banks by working with our task force will allow 
small business people to regain faith in the national banking 
system, because they seem to be shut out by the great banks of 
this country, and to develop a code of conduct for lending to 
small businesses.
<P>
	Farmers and small business people alike were happy that the 
$500,000 capital gains exemption was retained, and for good 
reason. Over the past month I had the good fortune to meet with 
many farmers in my riding about this issue. I agreed with their 
thoughts on this matter and I am pleased that when they decide 
to retire, they will be provided with the security for which they 
have worked so hard.
<P>
	Many patients and dentists were pleased that the speculated 
tax on the employer health paid insurance program was not on 
the budget. Constituents entering the housing market for the 
first time and the realtors who assist them were overjoyed with 
the news that the home owners plan would be made permanent.
<P>
	As well, local charities in my constituency were delighted 
with the opportunity to raise more funds through the lowering of 
the threshold of the 29 per cent tax credit from $250 to $200.
<P>
	What about the many constituents without vested interests in 
any particular area? Were they covered in this budget? Simply 
put, they were in full agreement with the manner in which the 
deficit was reduced and handled. Canadians concerned about the 
deficit told me, and these are the facts, that the finance minister 
and his pre-budget consultations were the most important thing 
that has happened as far as they were concerned. That the 
government was ready to act to swiftly cut the deficit was 
another big point that my constituents reported to me by phone.  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1874"> 1874 </A></B>
<P>
However, they specified they were glad it was done through cuts 
and not taxes. Simply put, that is the kind of budget they got.
<P>
	As I outlined earlier, the 1994 budget works to cut the federal 
deficit while holding the line on taxes. It also works to increase 
job opportunities and provides capital for business. At the same 
time it is a budget that is becoming widely accepted by 
Canadians as a fair and honest approach to dealing with the 
challenges facing this country.
<P>
	How did the government manage to do this? Actually, it was 
quite easy. It listened to Canadians and for the first time in 
Canadian history the federal budget was developed through 
public consultations. From the feedback I have received the end 
result of these consultations was quite clear. The 1994 federal 
budget is good for the people of Perth-Wellington-Waterloo 
and I strongly believe it is good for Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I felt I had to put a question to the previous speaker, 
who is a fellow member of the National Defence Committee, 
because I share his concerns.
<P>
	I would appreciate his views on the following. If you asked 
me the difference between the economies of the 21st century and 
the economies with which the hon. member probably grew up, 
considering the slight chronological gap between us, I would say 
that a few years ago, it was possible for countries to attract 
investment, which meant that people would invest $200,000, 
$200 million or $50,000 in a region, and this would create jobs.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Today, we have the kind of economies where that is not the 
case. Take, for instance, the hon. member's riding, where 
companies like Alcan can invest 50 or 100 million without 
creating a single job. In today's economic context, massive 
investments do not help create jobs. I think there is a 
fundamental difference between the economies of the 1960s and 
1970s, and what will happen between now and the end of this 
century.
<P>
	The difference between government members and the 
opposition is that, try as we may, we find it hard to accept that. 
Hon. members on all sides of the House agree that we must 
reduce the deficit. Where we disagree is on how to get 
Canadians back to work. This is crucial.
<P>
	The infrastructure program has its merits, although we should 
not forget that Prime Minister Bennett proposed more or less the 
same program in the thirties during the Depression, when for the 
first time, the government was asked to intervene on a large 
scale in public works.
<P>
	All the analysts who looked at this proposal agree that at best 
it would create between 40,000 and 45,000 jobs, which makes 
this a very modest and conservative program.
<P>
	Since I know this is a very real concern, and I realize the hon. 
member represents a riding where there is a lot of 
unemployment, I would like to ask him whether he sees any 
reasons to be optimistic and whether he could share these with 
me and perhaps make me share his optimism, since I have an 
open mind. What reasons do we have to believe that with this 
kind of budget, Canadians will be able to get back into the labour 
market?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richardson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
with whom I work on the committee. He has placed on the table 
many very fruitful ideas for our discussions. I welcome further 
discussion on those items.
<P>
	Anyone in a professional business knows we like to talk in 
exact terms. Everyone knows that a budget is just an estimate of 
income and an estimate of revenues. Other areas impact on that.
<P>
	In the political realm we are dealing with moving a large 
institution, dans ce pays le Canada. Our country is so large it has 
this inertia to overcome because we have had so many years of 
bad employment and slow growth.
<P>
	The budget created a sense of stability for the people and gave 
small nudges to the economy. We were hoping that once the 
inertia could be moved-it is a big boulder, a big thing to 
move-we can break it and find ways to make it move slowly.
<P>
	I believe that we are in a stage, as the hon. member mentioned, 
where many dollars invested do not create the same kind of man 
hours that they did in the past. We would be foolhardy to think 
that would be the case.
<P>
	Simply with enough effort we will probably work at getting 
job creation going. That is the idea behind this. There was 
stimulus. We were stimulating the patient, hoping to see some 
revival, some reactivation within the body of our country that 
would get the country moving again; that the growth rates would 
reach the targets and exceed them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, today, I 
want to tell the Minister of Finance how disappointed and 
concerned the government's budget has left my constituents.
<P>
	I can still picture the finance minister putting on the 
workboots he was given by the Prime Minister. What a show! 
What cynicism on the part of the Liberals! The 30 per cent of 
workers who do not have a job in my riding will not put their 
workboots on today, nor tomorrow, for that matter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1875"> 1875 </A></B>
<P>
	The members opposite had promised job creation measures.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	They went on and on, saying that it was their number one 
priority. Where are those measures? Where is this plan for 
economic renewal they have been touting around?
<P>
	People in Laurentides can now judge for themselves the 
Liberals' lack of action in the job creation field. The 
government is falling back on its infrastructure program, totally 
inadequate as it is to put the unemployed back to work. What 
lack of realism!
<P>
	With the number of jobs which will be created in my riding, 
hardly a few hundred according to a quick calculation, it is 
obvious that workboots dealers in the Laurentians will not be 
raking it in.
<P>
	For workers, it is discouraging to see the government do so 
little against unemployment. The federal government invests 
peanuts, and then sits down, hoping for this supposed economic 
recovery to happen. However, economists agree that this 
recovery, if there is one, will not bring about the creation of a 
high number of jobs.
<P>
	The people opposite are quite aware of this. But they prefer to 
wait, to stand by, instead of taking action. This new government 
must not have anything new or original to offer to the 1.6 million 
unemployed in our country, but a lot of talk and no action.
<P>
	To people in my riding, the Liberals are not much different 
from the Conservative government, a government which was 
rejected, or I should say ejected, because of its inaction and its 
unacceptable decisions. The message given on October 25 does 
not seem to be working, unless members opposite have chosen 
to ignore it. You promised jobs to the unemployed. But what 
have you done in that area? Do you really believe that your are 
fully and truly honouring the commitments you made before 
October 25? I do not think so, and neither do my unemployed 
constituents. They are asking for positive action that will give 
them hope and let them see light at the end of the tunnel. They 
just want this government to resolutely show its will to help 
them and put them back to work. We cannot say that the finance 
minister's budget is very convincing in that regard.
<P>
	The government's attitude toward the unemployed follows a 
strange sort of logic, one that these people will have trouble 
swallowing. The Liberals are saying: ``We are creating or will be 
creating jobs''. But, in actual fact, they are doing very little in 
the short term. As for the long term, nothing is planned at the 
federal level. There is no vision in this budget.
<P>
	First, there are no jobs, and this directly affects the people 
who want to work. Second, the government turns around and 
makes a 2 per cent cut in UI benefit rates on the backs of the 
unemployed, victims of the incapacity of the people opposite. 
Third, labour is told: ``From now  on, you will have to work 
longer to qualify for these lower benefits''. Low and 
middle-income workers in my riding, several of whom are 
seasonal or contract workers, have just been dealt three stiff 
blows by the Liberals.
<P>
	My fellow citizens who were working hard and were always 
looking for long-term employment instead of makeshift jobs are 
going to have to work magic and pray God or providence to get 
the additional unemployment insurance stamps they need.
<P>
	Regarding the benefit rate which is being increased to 60 per 
cent for individuals with modest incomes who support children, 
an aged parent or other dependants, all those concerned are 
anxious to know how the federal government will determine 
who should belong to that category of recipients.
<P>
	I can see from here UI officers asking applicants whether their 
children are really dependants and requesting written proof. I 
can see them conducting enquiries to determine whether there is 
a common-law spouse or another income-earner in the 
applicant's household. In Quebec, we have had our ``boubous 
macoutes''. Are we about to witness the emergence of a new 
breed of macoutes, the federal Liberal macoutes?
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	These measures will affect many single-parent families, 
often headed by women. I sincerely believe that, by establishing 
classes of beneficiaries, the government is fostering a climate of 
distrust that will lead to significant social tensions. It can be 
concluded that, as far as unemployment insurance is concerned, 
the Liberal budget is far from brilliant.
<P>
	Another aspect of this budget a lot of people from my riding 
contact me about is the tax credit available to people aged 65 and 
over. Seniors do not accept this unfair decision. The minister 
tells us that this reduction will affect only 25 per cent of senior 
citizens, who built this country. It is outrageous to hear from the 
members opposite that our seniors with a $25,000 net income 
are rich people. This decision affects once again middle-income 
taxpayers and 800,000 seniors in my riding, in Quebec and in 
Canada.
<P>
	The minister appears to have picked a target that was easier 
and especially less influential that the family trust lobby. What 
an unfair and irresponsible choice on the part of the Liberals! 
True, these seniors do not contribute to the Liberal Party coffers 
to the tune of $45,000 a year.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is it.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The cat is out of the bag.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> I would now like to address the issue of social 
and co-op housing that the government has just washed its 
hands of. In this regard, they are following in their predecessors' 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1876"> 1876 </A></B>
<P>
footsteps. The Tories have been kicked out but their policies are 
still here in this House.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Right on.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> We, in the Bloc Quebecois, have been demanding 
social housing since the beginning of this session. Local 
organizations also put a lot of pressure on the Liberals. Alas, the 
government has remained insensitive to the needs of the poorly 
housed. This refusal to improve housing conditions for the 
poorest is unacceptable.
<P>
	What happened to the nice promises made to the poorly 
housed and to local organizations during the election campaign?
<P>
	Why did the Minister of Finance write this last September to a 
coalition of organizations advocating co-operative and social 
housing: ``No doubt a Liberal government will help finance 
co-operative and non-profit housing''? In the same letter, the 
minister added that it was up to the federal government to ensure 
that over a million Canadian households are housed decently 
and affordably. Does the minister remember what he said? It was 
a smoke screen. It was a lie!
<P>
	Other members opposite engaged in pre-election 
opportunism. The present Minister of Foreign Affairs was an 
ardent defender of social housing. He loudly proclaimed that the 
real power was in Cabinet. Where is this famous power today? 
Did he try to influence the government in favour of social 
housing? Looking at the budget, we must conclude that the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs has no clout or that social housing is 
no longer worth it, or maybe both conclusions are true.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development were also fervent defenders of social 
housing. What happened to them? They have disappeared into 
the luxury of limousines, Challenger jets and ministerial pomp. 
That makes you quickly forget about the poorly housed.
<P>
	What is the other advocate of the poorly housed, the member 
for London East, doing now to get his government moving on 
this issue? After such trickery, there is no need to look very far 
to see why the people are disillusioned with politicians.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	The government made a choice. It chose to say no to social 
and co-operative housing. In saying no to the 1,200,000 people 
who are poorly housed, the Liberals are also saying no to many 
positive aspects associated with multiple-dwelling units.
<P>
	The social and co-operative housing industry creates jobs in 
the construction industry and generates spinoffs for 
construction companies and suppliers of building materials and 
residential fixtures. It stimulates consumption at 
neighbourhood stores.
<P>
	From a social standpoint, the construction of social and 
co-operative housing generates enormous benefits. Clean, 
well-heated and well-lit units have a positive effect on the 
health of the occupants. Health care costs are therefore reduced. 
People who live in co-operative housing are not isolated. In the 
long run, social housing helps to lower the cost of social 
services.
<P>
	Social housing provides senior citizens with the sense of 
security they have a right to expect. The Liberals have turned 
their backs on these positive effects. However, the Minister of 
Finance has forgotten that there will be a price to pay for this 
rejection and all of us will be paying it, directly and indirectly. I 
call this governing without vision and without a sense of 
humanity. And this is completely unacceptable to me.
<P>
	I wonder what response the Prime Minister will get in 
Shawinigan where nearly 41 per cent of households spend over 
30 per cent of their income on housing. The situation has grown 
desperate. Poverty is gaining a toehold in Quebec and in Canada. 
A total of 1,200,000 Canadians live in substandard housing 
conditions. In Quebec, the housing crisis is even worst, with 
44.3 per cent of rental household, compared to 37.1 per cent in 
Canada. In Quebec and in Ontario, 194,000 households spend 
more than 50 per cent of their income just on rent. In Canada, 
583,000 households are in the same situation.
<P>
	In some cities, the problem is even more dramatic. In 
Montreal, one in five rental households, 19.1 per cent, must 
spend 50 per cent of its income on rent. Twelve thousand 
households in Ottawa, 26,645 in Toronto, 22,095 in Vancouver, 
and 4,940 in Halifax set aside more than half of their income for 
rent.
<P>
	Behind these figures are single individuals and lone-parent 
families, which are increasing in numbers in our society. The 
people living in the worst conditions are young Canadians 
between the age of 15 and 24, pre-retired individuals 55 to 64 
years old and individuals over 65 years old. The Liberals have 
abandoned these people. There are children in these households, 
members of the next generation, living in poverty. In Canada, 
child poverty affected 1,210,000 children in 1991. The Liberals 
have abandoned these children too. I strongly believe that we all 
have to take stock and ask ourselves if children must be left 
destitute in unhealthy housing.
<P>
	I would be remiss in not mentioning the homeless. 
Homelessness has reached unbelievable proportions. More and 
more people find themselves without shelter, mostly women but 
also an increasing number of young kids. Natives living in urban 
areas, of which there are 15,000 in Montreal, are among the 
worst hit people. To all you poverty-stricken people, the federal 
government says: no! It is telling you that you can keep living in 
substantial housing or in the streets. It is telling you that you 
must continue to cut on food, clothing, and basic care. The 
government is telling you that you do not exist. Such contempt is 
unbelievable!
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1877"> 1877 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	By opting out of new public housing programs, the federal 
government has badly damaged the social fabric of our country. 
With the federal contribution decreasing from $113 million in 
1989 to zero dollar nowadays, it is obvious that Ottawa has 
willingly and voluntarily decommitted itself from such 
programs. The Minister of Finance is well aware of the situation 
and is depriving people of their fundamental right to a decent 
and adequate housing.
<P>
	What is even more upsetting is to see that because the 
members opposite are so insensitive to the needs of people who 
have inadequate housing, Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation is considering a rent increase of 25 to 30 per cent 
for social housing. What a shameful idea.
<P>
	The government is saying to the less privileged: Give us more 
money and we will use it to provide housing for other destitute 
people. That is how mean this government is. I firmly believe 
that the minister could have eliminated the waste and trimmed 
the fat of the government in order to find some money for the 
people who have inadequate housing, instead of making the 
underprivileged pay for the housing needs of other 
underprivileged people. The minister should be ashamed of 
himself.
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians of all backgrounds, the 
underprivileged, the poor who live in awful conditions and the 
elderly all feel betrayed by this Liberal budget. While they do 
everything they can to stay in the black, to make ends meet, the 
government does not do its homework, does not take its social 
responsibilities, and lets the poor live in substandard housing.
<P>
	In conclusion, we now see the real face of this government 
which, before October 25, was talking about a better and a fair 
society, where individuals would regain their dignity and their 
pride. The government has shown its true colours. The members 
opposite are acting like robots, like cold and uncaring people.
<P>
	The government has betrayed those who longed for a better 
future. This budget is a shame.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the eloquence with which 
the hon. member put forward her comments. I believe she is 
speaking from her heart when she outlines the problems of the 
people in her riding, the people of the province of Quebec and to 
some extent in other parts of Canada. However, I would like to 
tell the hon. member that the concerns she has are shared by 
people throughout the country in terms of the need for social 
programs and so on.
<P>
	I come from the province of Saskatchewan which has a 
population smaller than the city of Montreal. We have farmers 
who are struggling and small businesses that are closing down. 
The Liberal government is more than  aware of these concerns. 
We had this kind of national perspective in mind when the 
budget was so closely designed in conjunction with the human 
resources development plan. It is a plan that links the monetary 
means to put into practice solutions to the problems that the hon. 
member raises.
<P>
	It is very easy to criticize a strategy, especially in the early 
days. It has not even been a week since we have heard the budget 
plan. I would ask the hon. member to at least give it some time 
before she starts tearing down what I see as very positive steps 
on the road to recovery.
<P>
	I see a certain inconsistency. One of the criticisms made was 
the laughing at-perhaps that is too strong a word-or at least 
not having total faith in having criteria for getting a UI benefit 
based on whether one has so many children, whose children they 
are and so on. I also find inconsistency in the cries I hear from 
the Bloc for fiscal responsibility. I would say it is only realistic 
in this world that before one gives out money one finds criteria 
according to which that money ought to be allocated.
<P>
	I would hesitate to add that this inconsistency is not dissimilar 
from a party that can sit as the opposition with a clearly 
separatist agenda. It is the same kind of thing that makes some of 
the arguments a bit fragmented.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	Our vision on the other hand is a national vision that offers 
goals for all parts of Canada. Part of being in a confederation is 
to give from one part to another part where the needs can best be 
met. Sometimes that means one part of the family ends up with a 
little less than the other.
<P>
	Coming from Saskatchewan I can assure the hon. member that 
the only way the people in our province have survived is by 
putting our shoulders to the wheel and helping our neighbours 
when they need the help most. I would encourage the hon. 
member and her party to use the same strategy when looking at 
this country.
<P>
	Finally, I would ask the hon. member to use her talents, her 
abilities, her eloquence to work with the government to address 
the very legitimate concerns she has raised. There is no question 
there are people in the country who are suffering and I feel that 
the budget and the plan put forward by the minister of human 
resources to re-examine the social programs addresses that 
squarely. Any assistance that the hon. member can give the 
government in putting those matters forward would be more 
than welcomed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, as you know, for three months now, 
I have been using every opportunity to promote social housing. 
Poor people need a place to live and cannot wait for the 
government to some day decide to act. They need help now, not 
in a year or two. There are already 1.2 million people in Canada 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1878"> 1878 </A></B>
<P>
who live in inadequate dwellings. This is unacceptable. 
Something must be done to help these people.
<P>
	Exactly two weeks ago, I participated in a demonstration 
organized by FRAPRU, a group which supports and helps people 
living in inadequate dwellings find social housing units. 
FRAPRU includes all kinds of non-profit associations. Four 
hundred people participated in the demonstration.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> And there were no Liberals.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Of course not. Did you know that not even one 
member of the Liberal party was present at this event, which was 
an important one for all these people.
<P>
	I guess I will have to keep using every opportunity to raise this 
issue. I also want to thank the hon. member. I do hope that she 
will be able to convince the Liberal Party to take positive and 
concrete action, instead of only using rhetoric as has been the 
case so far. The government will spend $2 billion, but not on 
social housing. Nothing is provided for cooperative housing. 
This is merely a residential rehabilitation plan for owners. It is 
impossible for a poor person who lives in an inadequate 
dwelling to own a property.
<P>
	Therefore, I ask that representations be made by everybody on 
behalf of these poor people, so that the government will provide 
funding to help those living in inadequate dwellings and to 
really promote social housing.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the hon. member for her comments. I represent a riding 
which badly needs social housing. I must say that I have been 
very active in this area and I believe the government has done a 
lot. I had the opportunity to meet many foreign visitors who 
came to see what we had done, including in terms of social 
housing units, and to be among those who were able to make a 
difference in this area, in Vancouver.
<P>
	I certainly understand the hon. member, but we must not 
forget that Canada is a vast country with a small population. The 
money has to come from somewhere.
<P>
	As you know, a consultation exercise on all social programs 
will take place, and social housing will of course be included in 
that consultation. I think that work in this area started a while 
ago.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	As you know, housing is very costly and the federal and 
provincial governments both help pay housing costs for those 
who live in social housing units.
<P>
	I hope that once the study and the consultation process is 
completed, we will be able to pursue these programs. In the 
meantime, the $2 billion provided in the budget are strictly to 
help those who already live in social housing units.
<P>
	I will continue to fight for social housing, because it is 
something very important. I am told that there are 8,000 people 
in my constituency who do not live in decent dwellings. I know 
that there is a need, but I also understand that funds and 
opportunities are limited.
<P>
	Again, I will keep fighting and I hope that the hon. member 
will do the same, so that together we can do something and 
hopefully get additional money.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> I thank the hon. member. I am well aware of her 
constituency's problem because I have been studying the 
situation in all constituencies for the last three months.
<P>
	However, I think that we could take immediate action when it 
comes to public housing. Cuts could be made in family trusts, 
for example, but that is something we do not want to talk about 
and especially do not hear about. The slush fund, of course! That 
is the reason. It would take courage to proceed with those cuts 
and I hope the hon. member has enough influence on his caucus 
and on his party to make sure that the cuts are made in the right 
places and not where the money is badly needed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to participate 
in the debate on the borrwing bill to impliment the budgetary 
masures announced at the beginning of the week.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is not only a pleasure for me to have this opportunity, but it 
is a great honour because officially this is my maiden speech in 
the House and my first formal opportunity to address my 
constituents from this place.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That, Mr. Speaker, is why I would ask you and my colleagues 
to allow me, briefly, to thank the voters of Hull-Aylmer, who 
supported me in my campaign and did me the honour of electing 
me to represent them in the House of Commons and speak on 
their behalf. I thank them sincerely for their support, and assure 
them that I will do my very best to live up to the confidence they 
placed in me.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to tell them that, as a 
member of Parliament, I intend to act in the best interests of all 
the voters in my riding, and not only of those who voted for me.
<P>
	As we all know, the historic riding of Hull-Aylmer is on the 
Quebec side of the Ottawa River, just across from the nation's 
capital. It has a population of 87,700; this number can be broken 
down as follows: 76,2 per cent are francophone, and 14,1 per 
cent are anglophone. Portuguese is the mother tongue of 2 per 
cent of the people in my riding.
<P>
	I may add that 60 per cent of the people speak both official 
languages fluently.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1879"> 1879 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Over 25 per cent of the workforce is composed of civil 
servants. Although I am a newcomer to active politics, I am no 
stranger to government and the workings of our democratic 
institutions.
<P>
	As a career public servant I have had the opportunity to work 
closely with many governments of different political stripes. I 
have indeed been fortunate to have had the opportunity to 
observe up close how governments function. It is in large part 
because of this knowledge of government that I started to feel 
increasingly uneasy in the last few years about the way in which 
the country was being managed. I felt that the hackneyed, 
disjointed and visionless approach of the previous Conservative 
government was no longer working.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada and its public institutions are now at crossroads. It is 
urgent that our institutions, especially government ones, change 
radically and quickly if we do not want our country to be left 
behind by others. What is at stake here is that we do not become 
a small marginalized country with rigid structures, while other 
countries enthusiastically embrace the future.
<P>
	In the Liberal Party, I found people who think the same way I 
do and who are determined, as I am, to be part of a government 
that is aware of its primary responsibility of fundamentally 
restructuring the state machinery in order to put it back in the 
service of the people so that they can regain both confidence and 
hope in their government.
<P>
	Like other countries' governments, the government of Canada 
must tackle head-on the need to change fundamentally, because 
of the many forces that are in play in the world: a diminishing 
role for the state in modern societies, an expansion of 
international institutions, an increase in international 
competitiveness, developments in communication and 
information technologies, and an increase in the education level 
of people, who demand, rightly so, a greater participation in the 
decision-making process.
<P>
	However, the need for reform also stems from a deep 
dissatisfaction by a good portion of the electorate regarding the 
effectiveness of government authorities. This dissatisfaction 
leads to a gradual loss of confidence in political leaders and the 
institutions. And this loss of effectiveness is obvious in a 
number of areas of the government apparatus. We occasionally 
see it as well in politicians who, once elected, forget their 
commitments to their constituents, and in elected 
representatives when they start acting mainly for narrow 
partisan reasons or showing favouritism.
<P>
	We sense it also in our government institutions, tied by their 
own red tape, in organizations designed more to help those they 
employ than those they are supposed to serve. We can see it in 
outdated or inefficient government programs which might 
duplicate the work of other levels of government. Finally, we 
see it in the power struggles between levels of government 
seeking to protect their authority, their bureaucratic interests or 
their administrative preserves, regardless of the superior 
interests of their citizens.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The resolution of problems such as these requires us to set 
truly farsighted goals for ourselves. This is what our party has 
done.
<P>
	At the heart of everything is a need to restore confidence in 
both the people and the institutions of government. We have to 
do this in the context of the imperative of the fiscal crisis which 
has given rise to some of the tough medicine contained in the 
budget and which will continue to condition the policies of this 
government throughout its mandate.
<P>
	However, the goal of getting government right is not simply to 
save money. This initiative is animated by a much wider vision 
of the need to rethink and redesign government in response to 
profound forces, both external and internal, of which 
expenditure restraint is only one. Our intention is that the 
process of reform will be shaped by an evolving vision of the 
role of the federal government in society, of its relationships 
with its key partners and the part which its public service should 
play within that framework.
<P>
	To reach these results we must proceed in a coherent way. 
Other governments have tried to deal with some of the problems 
I just mentioned with a random hacking at programs and 
services and costs of government. Problems of this breadth 
cannot be solved through an approach such as that.
<P>
	Therefore one of our first objectives must be to try to define 
more clearly where each level of government can make its best 
contribution. If we can do this we should be able to improve the 
climate of federal-provincial relations in this country.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	In addressing this matter we will be forced to ask some basic 
questions. Is government doing too much? Can government 
truly be asked to take on every issue and attempt to arbitrate, 
compensate or replace? Should government pull back and do 
less, leaving more scope to the individual, the private sector, 
communities and the voluntary sector?
<P>
	A second objective must be to ensure that our programs are 
targeted as much as possible to the highest priority needs of our 
citizens and our country. We have to set priorities and we have to 
transfer resources from less productive to more productive uses. 
We have to make choices. In doing so we must see that as far as  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1880"> 1880 </A></B>
<P>
possible we place the needs of the most disadvantaged groups in 
our society first.
<P>
	Our third objective must be to refashion the programs of the 
federal government in a way that makes them more responsive 
to clients and more service oriented. We have to see that clients 
are substantively involved in the exercise to ensure that we look 
at the programs from their perspective, not just from that of 
administrative convenience.
<P>
	Where federal programs touch those of other levels of 
government we have to achieve greater harmony and eliminate 
instances of duplication or waste of other kinds. Clearly an 
ongoing quest for greater efficiency and higher levels of 
productivity and performance must go hand in hand with these 
other goals.
<P>
	Our fiscal situation is such that we simply cannot afford to see 
taxpayer funds misused or wasted. In all of this we have to bear 
in mind that the impact of the federal government depends 
enormously upon the public service. We need to preserve the 
best features of that service, encourage change where it is 
necessary, help the loyal people who work within it to adapt, and 
support them in the transitions that will be required. We must 
maintain Canada's reputation for having one of the best public 
services in the world.
<P>
	The task of reforming government extends beyond the world 
of programs and public servants. It also imposes responsibilities 
upon those of us at the political level. Thus another objective 
must be to reassert some old-fashioned values such as integrity, 
reliability and accountability.
<P>
	Our government has taken a number of steps already to 
reinforce these values. We have staked out a policy position in 
the red book. We have stuck to it in our throne speech and in this 
budget. We have encouraged Canadians to watch our 
performance and hold us to account for what we do. We intend to 
be consistent, accountable and honest in our dealings with 
Canadians. Old virtues and values need to be restored to public 
life.
<P>
	The final objective associated with getting government right 
is to see what measures can be taken to encourage citizens more 
effectively to participate in decision making and to place 
relationships between citizens and government on a more 
positive footing.
<P>
	Both at the political level and within the public service we 
hear continuous rhetoric about the need to consult more, to 
participate, to build a greater sense of partnership with the 
electorate, and so on. Most reform initiatives never get beyond 
that rhetoric. We have to do better. What practical steps can be 
taken by both politicians and public servants to achieve this 
goal?
<P>
	I would like Canada to be seen as a leader among other 
countries in this sphere, open to new ideas and willing to 
experiment with new approaches.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So, it is obvious that the budget that was just tabled in this 
House is only a piece, but certainly a major piece, of a much 
bigger puzzle. It is only a step in the huge reform process that 
seems essential to us, and I would like to briefly remind you of 
some of these proposals.
<P>
<B>(1415 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The budgetary provisions will strengthen both the economic 
and the social union of the country. The deficit reduction plan 
laid out in the budget calls for a reduction in spending of $17 
billion over the next three years. There is $5 of net expenditure 
restraint for every dollar of net revenue enhancement, a measure 
that will contribute dramatically to getting the deficit under 
control and allow us to reach our deficit target of 3 per cent of 
gross domestic product.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This budget fulfils our promise to tell the provinces what they 
can expect of the federal government for the next few years. 
They had told us that in order to plan their services they needed 
to know what the transfers would be. We listened to them.
<P>
	Unemployment insurance premiums are really employment 
taxes. Their high cost is often a deterrent to job creation. We 
have therefore decided to solve this problem by lowering these 
premiums to create jobs now. This measure will translate into 
$300 million savings for industry; $300 millions which they will 
be able to invest in job creation.
<P>
	Various measures are geared to helping small businesses, a 
sector crucial for our economy, specifically we will create a 
Canada Investment Fund to provide venture capital, set up a 
Canadian Technology Network to help small businesses gains 
access to new technologies, and expand the network of Canada 
Business Services Centres to concentrate access to government 
services in a single point.
<P>
	Our national infrastructure program supports job creation. We 
have negotiated agreements with all 10 provinces and this 
means that the way is now clear. The projects can start to create 
real and productive jobs in all parts of the country. We will also 
set up apprenticeship training programs for young people to give 
them the opportunity to get a first an crucial work experience.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Measures in the budget also address important social issues. 
Full funding for the national literacy program is being restored. 
A centre of excellence for women's health is being created. The 
Canadian race relations foundation will finally be established. A 
prenatal nutrition program for low income pregnant women is 
being launched, as is the aboriginal head start program.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1881"> 1881 </A></B>
<P>
	The budget also reinstates the law reform commission and the 
court challenges program.
<P>
	I will not at this time, unfortunately, dwell on every single 
initiative outlined in this budget. The Minister of Finance on 
Tuesday, hon. members will agree, did an excellent job of that. 
Let me, however, mention that as part of our re-examination of 
the role of government I have been asked by the Prime Minister 
to review all federal boards, agencies, commissions and 
advisory councils. Once again, this is not an exercise simply to 
reduce expenditures. There are no predetermined targets for 
savings. The objective is to determine whether their raison 
d'être is still valid and whether they are consistent with current 
needs and priorities.
<P>
	I would like to emphasize this point. The purpose of this 
review and all others that will be undertaken is not like it was 
under the previous Conservative government, a scorched earth 
approach to public policy. Any cuts, rationalizing or 
streamlining that results from reviews are intended to ensure 
that all of our activities and programs are delivered with 
maximum efficiency and meet the real needs of real people.
<P>
	Likewise, it is in the same spirit and in the same context that 
the Prime Minister has asked me to proceed with the program 
review to assess the continued relevance and effectiveness of 
federal programs and services. In this review, we will identify 
options and resources for future programming geared to our 
changing society and the changing expectations and needs of 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	It is my intention to see that as result of this program review 
our resources, both human and financial, are directed to the 
highest priority requirements and to those areas where the 
federal government is best placed to deliver services.
<P>
	I spoke earlier about the need for governments to co-operate 
and co-ordinate their activities. With this in mind, the Prime 
Minister has also asked me to work with the provinces to 
achieve a better alignment of roles and responsibilities and, as a 
result, a more efficient and affordable federation. This should 
allow governments to reduce overlap and duplication while 
improving the delivery of critical services.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Of all the measures announced in the budget, I am particularly 
interested in those concerning the renewal of the public service. 
I know the federal public service and I can assure you that it is a 
credit to our country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government naturally needs and relies on the public 
service to help make the government's objectives and plans a 
reality. All Canadians must realize how fortunate this country is 
in having a world respected non-partisan public service, made 
up of dedicated men and women, which daily in hundreds of 
communities  right across the country ensures the essential 
services to all of us.
<P>
	To be the best and to maintain a position as the best, it is 
necessary for any institution to continually renew itself. 
Renewal includes questioning some of the basic assumptions 
which have guided our operations for years, even decades. It 
means constantly seeking better, faster, more effective and more 
efficient ways of delivering services. It means creating and 
recreating an organization that is sensitive to and responds 
appropriately to the needs of clients, in this case the Canadian 
taxpayer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The public service is well aware of this requirement. We have 
to recognize the fact that it was able, over the last five years, to 
make difficult and comprehensive changes to its operations and 
methods. It is obvious that a transition period like the one it is 
going through right now is not only stimulating and motivating, 
but also a source of great tension.
<P>
	I want to emphasize that the salary freeze announced in the 
budget will allow us to avoid massive lay-offs. The President of 
the Treasury Board has indicated that the government is 
determined to guarantee a high level of job security to federal 
public servants.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is also important to view our decision to freeze wages in this 
context. First, it is evident from the other provisions of the 
budget that the public service is not being singled out for 
different or harsh treatment. In fact, in 1993 close to two-thirds 
of all employees under major wage settlements in Canada were 
subject to either a wage freeze or a decrease in their wages.
<P>
	Second, the Prime Minister, the President of Treasury Board 
and I have been very clear about our determination to form a real 
partnership with civil servants. Everyone will agree that the 
climate has changed, that we have made genuine attempts to 
change our relation with the public service. This is not a replay 
of 1984 when the previous Prime Minister talked gleefully about 
giving public servants pink slips and running shoes.
<P>
	The process of renewal of the public service has begun and 
will continue as all of us co-operate on forging a new definition 
of government, its role and purposes.
<P>
	We are calling on all the members of this House, other levels 
of government and particularly on Canadians in every walk of 
life to join with us in finding new, innovative and more effective 
approaches to program and service delivery. United in our 
determination, we can steer this country toward horizons of 
harmony, social justice, tolerance and prosperity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1882"> 1882 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I say it again, these budgetary measures are only the first step 
in redefining the social and economic union that makes Canada 
an example for the world to follow, an example where 
differences are respected and the most vulnerable in our society 
are protected.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This was the wager of the Fathers of Confederation, a risky 
wager, a courageous wager and one that each generation of 
Canadians must win anew through a collective act of faith and 
imagination.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	It falls to this generation of Canadians to preserve, indeed to 
fight to defend the precious legacy of previous generations so 
that we can pass on to our children not a damaged country, not a 
shrunken country, not a poorer country, but a greater, wiser, 
more generous country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To those who are ready to give up on this country and who lack 
the creativity and stamina to reinvent a society of which the poor 
and the hungry of the world can only dream, I say no.
<P>
	In the dying days of this century of unprecedented change, we 
have a responsibility to demonstrate that a small group of people 
that have come from all countries and cultures around the world 
can live in peace and harmony, in a spirit of mutual respect, and 
garner strength and courage from the sharing the experience of 
their vulnerability.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To those who would tear away the human face of this country 
and rob us of the right to be different, I also say no. Canadians 
have always been innovators and pioneers. Unlike our great 
neighbour to the south, we have resisted the temptation to 
homogenize our society. We have made room, often imperfectly 
and at the price of fierce struggles for diversity and for 
difference. This is what the world must learn to do and we must 
lead the way.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The challenge this government must meet is not any different 
from that of many other countries. A budget is not a simplistic 
deficit reduction exercise. Our mandate for change must result 
in fundamental reform, and this budget is but a first step in that 
direction.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I did let the minister go a 
little longer than his 20 minutes, in part as it was his maiden 
speech and in part largely from my reading of the good sense of 
ongoing co-operation and goodwill by members from all 
parties.
<P>
	Now I would hope that the minister will allow the Chair to 
fulfil the opportunity for members opposite to have a full 10 
minute complement to ask questions or comments which 
obviously will take us slightly beyond the 2.30 adjournment 
time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
congratulations to the hon. minister on his maiden speech and 
congratulations on your election and appointment to your high 
office.
<P>
	Throughout the speech I heard several times the word waste 
and also the word essential. I have jotted down four items. I 
would like the minister to comment on whether he considers 
these items essential or non-essential. If he feels they are 
non-essential, would he consider removing these from the 
present expenditures and putting this money either toward more 
job creation or toward the poverty stricken children in our 
country according to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development?
<P>
	The first thing I have on my list are the Challenger jets, which 
should not surprise anybody, MPs pensions, the blue cars that 
the cabinet ministers run around the hill in and the $4.5 million 
museum that is going to be constructed in the Prime Minister's 
riding.
<P>
	I ask the last one based on the idea that we presently fund 12 
museums to the tune of $268 million. They cannot support 
themselves and I would question that one. I would like the 
minister's comments, please.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé: </B>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his kind 
words at the beginning of his remarks. I would like to point out 
something, in terms of principles.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
There is no doubt that any government in the modern world now 
must be extremely careful in the way it allocates its 
expenditures because the days of the fat cats have disappeared. 
No longer will we face a time when governments, whether 
municipal, federal, provincial in Canada or elsewhere in OECD 
countries, have enough free money that they can afford to waste 
a cent of it.
<P>
	Voters in all OECD countries have expressed very clearly in 
recent years that they are much more aware of what 
governments do, that they watch governments much more 
carefully and that they will not permit their governments to be 
wasteful.
<P>
	On the question of principle I must say I agree entirely with 
the hon. member. It is always in the application of principles 
that reasonable people disagree. There may be a large number of 
actual expenditures where we on this side of the House feel there 
is full justification for spending the taxpayers' money and where 
members of the other parties in the House may indicate different 
priorities. I believe this is democracy.
<P>
	We have to offer to voters in our country a number of choices, 
as I think we did quite clearly in the red book. We have to ask 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1883"> 1883 </A></B>
<P>
them to vote for parties that offer very  different priorities in 
terms of their expenditure plans in particular. We did that.
<P>
	We not only indicated our intention to bite a few extremely 
difficult bullets in terms of expenditures such as in the case of 
defence, but we had the courage to do this year in the budget 
what governments in the last 30 years have not had the political 
courage to do, namely to cut infrastructure expenditures that had 
become unnecessary because we had finished the second world 
war and were moving into a period in which international 
relations were very different.
<P>
	I take this example of military expenditures because it 
involves literally over the years billions and billions of dollars; 
in fact $7.4 billion over the next five years. It is much more 
important for a government to have a clear idea of its long-term 
views and priorities so that it can make reductions in 
expenditures or reductions in waste that will permit the country 
to meet its long-term need for fiscal responsibility and to better 
use its money.
<P>
	In the various items the hon. member mentioned there may be 
ways of reducing waste. I would fully agree with him that we 
should reduce that waste to an absolute minimum. In the budget 
we saw in terms of the large numbers and in terms of the difficult 
decisions that we have agreed and we have taken the right 
decisions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>M. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, listening to the hon. 
minister responsible for the public service, one gets the 
impression that he is a new politician with definite and 
unquestionable experience, that he is a very articulate man who 
should bring about changes, at least as far as renewal of the 
public service is concerned.
<P>
	The minister alluded to the importance he attaches to the 
public service, to the importance he attributes to public servants 
who support the work of members of Parliament, ministers and 
Parliament as a whole. I think he is right because none of us 
could work effectively if we could not count on public servants.
<P>
	The minister knows what he is talking about since he himself 
was, until very recently, until his election, a senior public 
servant. That is why I believe that he knows what he is talking 
about.
<P>
	However, I am surprised that nothing in this budget reflects 
this appreciation of the Public Service. There is no tangible 
evidence in the budget. Although the vast majority of public 
servants helped to elect this new government, and it is public 
knowledge that the Public Service supported the federal 
government, they could at least expect some appreciation of the 
services they provide. What they got is a slap in the face.
<P>
	The budget does not contain a single measure that would 
communicate to these people the government's recognition and 
appreciation of the work they do every day to support its 
operations.
<P>
	I would like to know if the minister is planning any statements 
in the near future about Public Service renewal and if he will 
finally demonstrate that proposals will be followed by concrete 
action. Instead of coming down harshly on the people who are 
important to us, perhaps the government should start a dialogue 
and agree on ways to improve morale and maintain the level of 
professionalism and fairness in the services they provide.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure to answer that 
type of intervention. Certainly I feel at ease when dealing with 
questions on the public service.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I greatly appreciated my hon. colleague's opening remarks. I 
must say that, when you are familiar with the civil service, you 
often get a much better feel for the kind of problems it faces. In 
recent years, the Government of Quebec has imposed a number 
of wage freezes and cuts that civil servants did not take too well.
<P>
	I can understand that. When, as a civil servant, I was seeing 
the wage gap widen between the public and the private sector, 
especially at the senior levels, I too found it hard to take.
<P>
	In the context of the last budget, I think that it is important to 
see that, with this wage freeze, we are in fact protecting the job 
security of our civil servants. It was a hard move to make, but 
given the context, it was clear that cuts were required not only in 
government programs, but also in operating budgets.
<P>
	To compensate for wage increases, we would have had to 
reduce the number of employees in the Public Service. 
Considering, as I said, that two thirds of private sector 
employees either had no increase or a negative increase, we 
determined that the sacrifice asked from federal civil servants 
was not disproportionate, as compared to those who are seeing 
their military base close down in Atlantic Canada or those 
affected by the decision to withdraw from the KAON project in 
British Columbia or to reduce the level of activity or close 
military bases in the Prairies and in Ontario.
<P>
	Under those circumstances, while I agree entirely with my 
colleague on the principles of good management for a public 
service, I must say that I fully support the decision made in this 
budget to freeze wages.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There is very little time 
remaining, barely one minute. I would ask the member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Standstead to put his question as briefly 
as possible so that the minister can answer quickly and we can 
then proceed to adjourn.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1884"> 1884 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will try to be as brief as possible to allow the 
minister time to respond. I put the question to him, since he is 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and this is the area 
that concerns me at the moment. The minister spoke at length 
about government efficiency and wondered if the state got too 
involved. Many people do in fact believe that the state 
intervenes too much in their lives. Many people also feel that 
there is too much government.
<P>
	I would like to hear the minister's views on the role of the 
federal government in its relations with provincial 
governments. I am thinking here in particular about the Quebec 
government and the whole question of overlap. What does he 
intend to do about this?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The minister's views, but 
briefly please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member of the Opposition 
has presented me with a challenge in giving me some 30 to 45 
seconds to talk about the role of governments and the 
elimination of overlap.
<P>
	Consequently, I will only address the policy issues. There is 
no doubt in my mind that the government or public sector has 
grown too big in recent years and that it tried to provide too 
many services, a large number of which could have been 
provided more efficiently by the private sector. Our three levels 
of government-federal, provincial and municipal-must act 
more responsibly in fiscal matters and review all their services 
to the population so that we can finally offer the same quality of 
service for much less.
<P>
	The division of responsibilities among the various levels of 
government is clearly something we need much more time to 
discuss, since it is a fundamental issue. However, I fully agree 
with the hon. member that we should reduce overlap as much as 
possible, as it is expensive and unnecessary.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I want to thank the 
minister and all hon. members present for their co-operation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would also take the occasion as we go into a week of recess 
to wish you all a good week with your families, friends and 
constituents. We look forward to your speedy return.
<P>
	It being 2.40 p.m., this House stands adjourned until Monday, 
March 7, 1994 at 11 a.m pursuant to Standing Orders 24(1) and 
28(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.40 p.m.)
<P>
