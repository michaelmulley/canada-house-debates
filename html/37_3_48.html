Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, researchers at Harvard University and the American Public Health Association report that smog and carbon dioxide are affecting respiratory health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than 20 years the rate of childhood asthma in Canada has risen from 2.5% to 11.2%.  In the case of adults, 14% of Canadians are diagnosed with asthma.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high concentration of carbon dioxide can affect asthma in several ways.  Research shows that cities are under a dome of carbon dioxide created by the burning of fossil fuels such as gasoline, coal and natural gas.  Carbon dioxide does not disperse.  It reaches high concentration and alters the climate of cities underneath, thus affecting human health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christine Rogers, of the Harvard School of Public Health, refers to asthmatic children as being hit “with a powerful one-two punch: exposure to the worst air quality problems and allergen exposure arising from global warming”.  Kyoto opponents may want to reflect on these findings.</p>

In gruesome detail they documented the killing  of children, the mass execution of civilians, systematic rape, wholesale destruction of villages and the displacement of thousands of people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the United Nations compounded months of inaction by allowing the election of Sudan to its commission on human rights. One country walked out of that charade in disgust.  Canada sat there silently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not too late for Canada to save its reputation and, more important, to possibly save lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have requested, in a motion before our committee on human rights, that our government announce it will immediately dispatch to Sudan a monitoring team,  including MPs, to join other countries in an international effort to possibly stem the tide of this genocide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question now is not why did Canada not act yesterday, but will the Government of Canada act today?</p>

We now celebrate our diversity on many occasions.  May is Asian Heritage Month in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2001, a motion was introduced by Senator Vivienne Poy and passed by the Senate of Canada.  Throughout the month of May we will celebrate and honour the heritage of Canadians of Asian descent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asian Canadians have made and are making a huge contribution to every aspect of Canadian life, in arts and culture, in science,   in medicine, in business, in education and in politics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my hope that through Asian Heritage Month activities, members of all communities across Canada will continue to develop a deeper insight into Asian cultures and a greater appreciation for our rich multicultural heritage and for one another.</p>

This was the longest sovereignty patrol of its kind ever conducted by the Canadian Forces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group travelled to Canadian Forces Station Alert, which is the northernmost outpost in Canada on Ellesmere Island, placing three cairns along the way and both the Canadian flag and the Canadian Ranger flag was flown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1,300 kilometre trek started in Resolute on the south coast of Cornwallis Island.  Travelling across Devon Island, with some of the harshest terrain, the team endured long snowmobile rides while contending with severe ice, weather conditions, injuries and damage to their equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the efforts and the daily courage exhibited by those Nunavummiut and Canadian Forces personnel as they made their way to CFS Alert.</p>

This, the  first francophone university in an outlying region of Quebec, was born from the daring and vision of its founders and has since met the academic needs of tens of thousands of students from Quebec and other parts of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I attended the 50th anniversary gala, which celebrated 50 examples of brave and innovative actions, each of which has opened up new perspectives, new fields of action, and new approaches, and has broadened our horizons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it has expanded, the Université de Sherbrooke has acquired an international reputation, not only for the quality of its programs but also for the people-friendly campus its 100,000 or so graduates have been able to enjoy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Université de Sherbrooke is an excellent example of what can be accomplished if one dares take the first step.  Once again, my wishes for a happy 50th birthday to the Université de Sherbrooke, one of the jewels of the Eastern Townships.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures will assist the Canadian apparel and textile industries in promoting their competitiveness as well as ensuring that they continue to excel in an increasing global marketplace.</p>

Groceries, housing, taxes and general necessities are quickly eroding their limited budgets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's seniors do not expect the government to keep them in the lap of luxury, but they are expecting to be kept out of poverty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government has been quick to reward its friends, hands out bonuses to almost everyone and wastes money at every turn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us ensure our seniors can live out their lives in dignity within a safe and friendly Canada that they worked to develop.  They did not work for a Canada whose social programs are scaled back at the very same time as their income.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long does the Liberal government expect our seniors to continue doing more and more with less and less?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignoring Canada's glaring gender inequality in the Liberal throne speech and budget ran into more rough water today when the pay equity task force called for a complete change from the government's laissez-faire approach that has left women's wages stagnating 30% behind men's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unions and women's advocates have called for proactive laws for decades, but the Liberals have refused, just as they have refused action on growing economic inequality that has been today cited by campaign 2000 as the root cause of our outrageous child poverty levels and poverty of families headed by women on their own. Equally disturbing was the report just released by the National Council of Welfare entitled, “Income for Living?” </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women in Canada are being left behind on the shore because this government and its corporate friends want low wages, no benefits and high profits, keeping women's priorities off their agenda.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This measure by the federal government squarely violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, considering there was nothing wrong with the work performed by Ms. Gendron. Moreover, as a federal public servant, she has political rights recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also strange and ironic, to say the least, that one of the members of the committee that made the decision to dismiss  Ms. Gendron is none other than Guylain Thorne, a well-known Liberal and former chief of staff of the member for Bourassa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By refusing to get involved, the Minister of Canadian Heritage, who is also a  Quebecker, becomes an accomplice in the taking of a partisan, undemocratic and totally discriminatory measure. Such are the true Liberal values.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are important questions for the fishermen in my area, all of Atlantic Canada  and on  both coasts, and I do not believe the government can stand in this place and ignore those questions day in and day out.  Why do we not have the answers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope  the parliamentary secretary will confer with the minister so that we get some of this cleared up.  A lot of Canadians are very interested in that issue.  We want to know what the government policy is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Speaker, if you examine the Standing Orders, I confirmed exactly with the Standing Orders and have done everything that would be expected of me as  a member of Parliament.  Now it is incumbent upon the government to answer those questions.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The House resumed from May 4 consideration of the motion that Bill C-30, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 23, 2004, be read the third time and passed, and of the motion that the question be now put.
</p><A NAME="Int-923057"></A><a HREF="#Int-923198"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-923050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick (Prince Albert, CPC): </b>Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the budget implementation act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to focus on a couple  of major deficiencies in the budget and I will use this as an occasion to do that in speaking to the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equalization formula that we have has totally shafted the province of Saskatchewan from every standpoint.      Incidentally, for provinces such as Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, it is not a very good formula either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to do today is point out some of the problems with the equalization formula as it pertains to Saskatchewan.  I am shocked that the Minister of Finance, being a person born and raised in Saskatchewan and  who had an opportunity to deal with this issue, did not address the  issue  in the budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of equalization is to ensure that all provinces can provide roughly equivalent public services.    This is simply not happening in my province of Saskatchewan.  We are facing a fiscal crisis that I have never seen in my lifetime in that province.  Taxes are extremely high. Young people are leaving the province in droves.  Opportunities are evaporating before our eyes. The health care system is in crisis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the average wait time for an MRI in the province of Saskatchewan?   The average wait time is 22 months. Thousands upon thousands of Saskatchewan residents leave the province every year to go to MRI clinics in Alberta and North Dakota.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A doctor in my riding, who was the former president of the Canadian Medical Association, indicated to me that he had just sent 22 people to Calgary to receive MRI scans. They cannot wait 22 months. I do not know of any disease that can wait 22 months. It is totally unacceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surgical waiting list in Saskatchewan is 30 weeks.  Imagine, Madam Speaker,  if your car broke down and when you took it to the shop   the mechanic told you that he would fix it in 30 weeks.  It is twice as long as the wait time in the province of Manitoba which is right next to Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to blame all the problems in Saskatchewan on the New Democratic  government that we have in Saskatchewan, but it is only partially responsible for the accumulation of these problems that we have in Saskatchewan.   A good deal of the problem I have identified is the gross unfairness in the equalization formula.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out a couple of those discrepancies. I also want to  point out that the Conservative Party has clearcut  policies on this matter as opposed to the government across the way. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over an extended period of time, let us say the last 10 years, there have been  high inequities in the equalization payments. Saskatchewan over the past 10 years has received a little over $300 million per year on average in equalization. Manitoba, with a population of one million people, basically a similar type province, has received on average something in the order of $1.1 billion per year in equalization payments. That is a huge disparity. It is a $750 million per year difference.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obvious question for anyone who would be listening to my speech would be this.  Is Saskatchewan a lot wealthier and better off than the province of Manitoba?  That would be the obvious conclusion that someone might come to with that kind of disparity.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However that is not the case. Over the past 10 years the average earned income in Manitoba has been  over $1,000 per person higher than in Saskatchewan on a per annum basis. The earned income in the past year has been  approximately $1,500 higher than the average Saskatchewan resident.  Therefore, if we look at statistical indicators, Manitoba has a higher standard of living and a higher fiscal capacity than the province of Saskatchewan but it receives $750 million more on an annual basis  under the equalization formula.</p><A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1525)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did this injustice come about?  Quite frankly, it is the federal Liberal government's equalization formula.   I guess it believes  in equality, but some people are a lot more equal than others in this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 33 tax bases in this formula.  It is a very complicated formula.  Twelve of those tax bases are non-renewable resources, things like potash, oil and gas, and uranium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make it clear that this formula is grossly unfair to a province that has non-renewable natural resources.  Today, for every dollar the province  of Saskatchewan earns out of oil and gas, it  loses $1.25 in equalization payments.  It is not even a dollar for dollar loss; it is $1.25 for every dollar that the province makes.  This is bad policy.  It is terrible policy.  It punishes provinces for attempting to do the things  they are supposed to be doing:  developing their own economies, developing their non-renewable resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a province develops its non-renewable resources and grows its economy, all of the other tax bases improve. Eventually, the need for equalization  would  disappear.  It  would disappear if there were correct policies in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that the  formula also ignores, from what I can read and what I have studied, other important sources of revenue.  In  the nation of Canada, the most important tax base   in the country is  geographic location.  Southern Ontario is blessed to be right near the heartland of the United States, surrounded by the industrial heartland of the country. There is no accounting for that fact in the formula.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manitoba Hydro and Quebec Hydro, if I understand the formula correctly,  make a lot of money out of hydro power in this country, but it is not included in the equalization formula. That is a renewable resource, not a non-renewable resource.  Some day the  non-renewable resources will run out.  These are renewable resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are some of the other inequities that exist in that formula.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, the other problem  is that this is supposed to be a national formula for all of Canada, but it is calculated on five provinces.  That is very distorting and very unfair.   The formula should be based on  10 provinces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am really surprised  by  the Minister of Finance. He should have known about these problems.  He has been in this town for more than 10 years. He  knows the problems we have in Saskatchewan.  Here was an opportunity to tackle something like that.  If  any questions were raised about equalization, he would come up with the Kim Campbell comment,  “This thing is just too complicated to discuss and to deal with,” and would just shrug  it off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two reforms to the formula that would make it  much fairer for all concerned.  The first one would be to eliminate, or at least reduce the emphasis on non-renewable resources in a major way.  This could be done over four or five years and  implemented on that basis. The other  would be to change it to a 10 province national formula, not a five province formula.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two moves alone would at least put Saskatchewan on the same footing as her sister province,  Manitoba.  Maybe we could  buy a few more MRIs and a few other things in our province.  If Saskatchewan was receiving the  $750 million extra per year that Manitoba has been receiving, what would that mean for  Saskatchewan?  </p><A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1530)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saskatchewan has  three MRI machines, which is not very many. I think Turkey and Syria have a higher ratio than Saskatchewan. We could buy about  250 MRIs for $750 million. Somebody told me that with $750 million we could train something like 20,000 nurses and we could hire something like 3,000 doctors. I am just using these as examples of  what could be done  with that amount of money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could probably drastically and permanently reduce property taxes in Saskatchewan. They   are  killing the farm economy. Our property taxes are  at an unbelievable level. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are some of the things we could do if that formula were fair in any way at all. The Minister of Finance  seems to be oblivious to these problems and does not seem to be prepared to even look at them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the budget was presented, this was certainly an issue I was looking at.  I was very disappointed to see very little done with this formula, except for some minor tinkering. What does the minor tinkering mean this year for Saskatchewan? There were some measures put into the budget that deal with what the Minister of Finance called some inequities, some transitional matters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year the province of Manitoba, with one million people, is receiving $1.1 billion in equalization payments. Saskatchewan, without the changes that the Minister of Finance brought in, would have received $7 million. In what I think is probably the worst year I can remember in the province of Saskatchewan with the problems we have in that province, we get $7 million. After the tinkering, it goes up to $130 million. It is about an $850 million shortfall compared to our sister province of Manitoba.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Minister of Finance has been asked this question, he has said that   it is too complicated to discuss with anybody. I guess it is Saskatchewan's responsibility  to carry on its shoulders this flawed equalization plan for the benefit of other provinces. Is it any wonder when a poll is conducted about people's attachment to Canada and the degree of alienation they have toward the country, that Saskatchewan has the highest number  of people who feel alienated about this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody on that side of the House, quite honestly, including the Minister of Finance, seems to give two hoots about a very, very serious problem. This formula is unfair. It is shocking. I do not know what terminology I could use to describe the matter. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor General in her reports on government policy said that  what she found was shocking. She found the way the government handled other things was that all of the rules were broken. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a resident of Saskatchewan, I am looking at a formula that does not serve our province very well at all. As I stated at the onset, in many respects it shafts the people of Saskatchewan to the umpteenth degree. What is the government's response to this very serious problem? The finance minister says that it is too complicated to discuss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to close my objection to equalization with a few comments. Many people have said that the new Conservative Party does not have any policies. Well, on this issue it does. It proposes to change the formula to a national 10 province formula. It also proposes to phase out non-renewable resources as a component of that formula over a five year period. That would be very welcome news in the province of Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is what people in Saskatchewan want. They want a federal government that knows how to effectively and efficiently manage and spend taxpayers' dollars. This would be one way of doing it. They do not want  their dollars spent on boondoggles, on firearms registries, on   sponsorship programs, on  unity funds, and goodness knows what else the government can find to spend money on here.    </p><A NAME="T1535"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1535)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  are just asking for the things that count to people in Saskatchewan.  We want the financial capacity and tools so that tax dollars can be spent in an effective and efficient way for all people in that province.   It is just not happening under the present structure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out that  over the course of the federal election, when it does come, the Conservative Party will be announcing ways in which government can restructure and redirect government spending in this town that are  far more efficient and effective for Canadian people.  I know there will be Liberal friends and  Liberal narrow interest groups and supporters who will not like this  because they have been receiving a disproportionate share of the public purse.  The Liberal government has been very good at taking care of its friends,  pals, buddies and special interest groups while it neglects whole regions of the country, such as Saskatchewan. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My party will be addressing that. We are going to design fiscal policies  which are good for Canadians at large, not special interest groups or Liberal pals and friends, but policies that are good for every single Canadian from one end of the country to the other. If we have the good fortune of forming government, we are going to try to dismantle this entire culture of incompetence and corruption that has built up in this town.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to quickly address another omission in the budget speech. The Prime Minister, in his run-up to becoming the Prime Minister and leader of the party, had much to say about the urban agenda.  His government was going to get on to the urban agenda and address those issues and the municipal problems in the country. He met with mayors and  all sorts of people and raised their expectations   really high. There is not a whole lot in the budget on the urban agenda that the Prime Minister huffed and puffed about.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to raise a few questions about his proposed solutions to the urban problems. Number one, this country is both urban and rural. There is something inherently wrong with a federal government taking a slice of our society and creating a special department and bureaucracy to deal with it while the rest of the country, the rural area, has all sorts of problems as well. That is one objection I have.  The last thing the people in Saskatchewan want in the city of Ottawa is another government department.   The last thing we need in Ottawa is a department of urban affairs.  That is more bureaucracy, more government and more taxpayer dollars.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing we do not want is another three ring circus involving the federal government, the provinces and the municipalities.  To me, three is a crowd.  We do not need the federal government in there.  They have always been difficult people to deal with at the local level so why in the world would we want to be introducing more of the federal government into our local decision making?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to point out that the Conservative Party proposes a solution to this problem.  We would take between 3¢ and 5¢ of the federal fuel tax, per litre of fuel, and rebate or transfer that to the provinces on the condition that the provinces would use it for two items: transportation needs and municipal infrastructure concerns.  This would get the federal government entirely out of the picture. It would give the provinces the fiscal capacity to deal with their infrastructure and transportation  problems  in the cities and in the rural areas.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be a very simple way to  deal with the problem.  It would be  an efficient and effective way to  deal with it.  I think most Canadians would accept this  approach.  We would be bypassing the creation of some federal government department in Ottawa and the  creation of a three ring circus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Madam Speaker, I thank you for being a very attentive listener.  I thought you would be taking notes during  my speech, but I guess you will read <i>Hansard </i> tomorrow. </p><A NAME="T1540"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1540"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1540)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think these are the sorts of issues that Canadian voters should be concerned about when we do get plunged into a federal election: really addressing the imbalances and problems we have in the country and getting the nation on the right track.</p><A NAME="Int-923198"></A><a HREF="#Int-924523"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-923057"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Hinton): </b>Is the House ready for the question?</p>

Larry Bagnell (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, <i>drin queesy shilakat</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am delighted to speak to Bill C-23 today.  There are different views on different aspects of this legislation and there is some lack of clarity in regard to some areas.   I hope to quickly get through my speech and then try to add some light to some of the issues that have been brought up,  and make sure that people totally understand them and understand why we see, putting all of those issues together, that this bill would be of benefit to first nations people.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin by saying that the bill was started by a group of first nations people. After working with the financial system's institutions, they approached us years ago because they felt they needed these new institutions.   We have been working for a long time to bring this issue forward.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My only interest in any of the initiatives that I support here as parliamentary secretary is that of trying to help in conditions for first nations people.  If I can be convinced that an initiative will do that, then I will support it.  I look forward to listening to the various views on this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rise to support Bill C-23, the first nations fiscal and statistical management act.  The legislation would provide first nations with access to the financing tools they need to promote investment in their communities.  This investment will no doubt lead to improvements in the quality of life for residents of these communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe my hon. colleagues all agree on the clear and pressing need to bridge the economic and social gaps that exist between Canada's aboriginal and non-aboriginal communities.  Nowhere are these gaps more apparent than in the lack of capital infrastructure. Many first nation communities lack adequate water and sewage treatment facilities.  Other components of basic capital infrastructure, such as roads and power lines, are crumbling or non-existent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital infrastructure is expensive to build and maintain. That is why most municipal and provincial governments finance their infrastructure projects with special measures such as long term bonds and securities.  While these bonds may pay low rates of interest, they offer a level of certainty that investors find attractive and, as a result, they will invest in these projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First nation communities, however, do not have ready access to the bond markets.  As a result, first nations are forced to raised money locally, usually through short term loans that can be relatively expensive.  This results in each dollar generated by first nations buying less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the higher interest rates and transaction and negotiating fees, these communities pay up to 50% more than municipalities or provinces to finance their capital works projects.  Consequently, infrastructure projects are either delayed or dropped. Plans for economic and social development stall, and first nations struggle to move ahead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-23 aims to breathe new life into these communities.  Simply put, this legislation would enable first nations to access capital needed to finance major infrastructure projects by allowing them to issue investment-grade securities, financial instruments similar to government bonds. The first nations that approached us of course found out after years of trying that they just could not do this under the existing financial systems in place in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first nations finance authority will play a central role in this venture by pooling the capital requirements of participating first nation communities. By combining the assets and liabilities of all participants, the authority will be able to issue bonds with a credit rating that will attract investors. Discussions with representatives of bond raters and underwriters have indicated that there is every reason to expect that the authority will earn a single A credit rating, which would yield an attractive return for investors, with minimal risk.  That is the advantage of combining first nations together in the system: investors will see that their risk is more secure.  This is a commonplace activity in financial markets.</p><A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1550)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advice on the structure and operations of the authority has been provided by the Royal Bank, the Dominion Bond Rating Services and Moody's Investors Service of New York, key players in both Canadian and international financial institutions. The Municipal Finance Authority of British Columbia has operated effectively for nearly a decade, enabling numerous smaller communities in British Columbia to access debt capital at affordable rates. The Municipal Finance Authority of B.C. has offered to help the finance authority build on this success and minimize investor risk. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an independent institution, the authority would pool the capital requirements of member first nations and then issue bonds on their behalf so that the persons holding the bond would have less risk because there would be a number of projects involved. Moneys raised would go back to the participating first nations in the form of loans. This process would be strictly controlled through a series of checks and balances. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To become a member of the finance authority, the first nation must have a property tax regime established under this bill and approved by the first nations tax commission. It must also have in place a sound and effective management system certified by the financial management board. Participating first nations must have unutilized borrowing capacity and have a capital infrastructure project approved by the band council and reviewed by the tax commission. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there is a  purpose for all these checks. If we are to convince these Canadian and international investors to invest in these projects, they need to be assured that these checks have taken place, and of course it is great that they would be done by a first nation institution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to be clear. Bonds issued by the finance authority are based on property tax revenues. There are no provisions in Bill C-23 that would require first nations to use reserve lands as collateral. This is an exciting part of the bill, because anywhere else, including the banks and the financial institutions, they usually would be required to place their land forward. This system is set up very wisely by the first nations, so that it is based only on their future property taxes. They do not have to, under any circumstances, give up their land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, to ensure even greater protection for investors, a minimum of 5% of the value of each bond issue will be kept in a debt reserve fund established by the finance authority. That is just another way of securing things for the investors and it would have a minimum impact on any one first nation that decided to use this mechanism to borrow funds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government of Canada is committed to contribute up to $10 million to a separate credit enhancement fund, the same fund that was the subject of  one of the report stage motions previously before Parliament. The combination of these funds will further support the achievement of the desired single A rating. So once again the federal government will help backstop it, the deposit will help backstop it and, in the long run, the tax regime will help backstop it so that there is no other draw on any  first nations assets or land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these measures address only one aspect of the problems facing first nations: that of limited access to capital. To improve the quality of life in first nation communities, aboriginal leaders must also have access to the tools they need to be able to  plan effectively. This brings me to the importance of the first nations statistical institute. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound planning decisions are always informed by accurate, current statistics. Information on population growth, income levels and property values helps establish government plans and priorities. At present, the quality of first nations social and economic statistics is inadequate. Even such basic statistics as population counts for communities are not reliable. Currently first nations do not have access to the kinds of statistical information available to the majority of Canadians: information on housing, justice, natural resource management, culture, education, employment rates, and health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of reliable and comprehensive data on first nation communities hinders planning and access to essential economic and social tools. Without reliable comparative material, making accurate assessments of the relative health of any first nation community becomes extremely difficult. Of course these statistics will help first nations when they are applying for program funding. They will have a much better case to make with the availability of these statistics, and we would not be able to say, “no, that is not true”, because the statistics would then be available.</p><A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address this issue, Bill C-23 would establish the first nations statistical institute.  The institute would provide first nations with the statistical information needed to plan successfully.  It would work directly with aboriginal organizations and government agencies to help first nations identify and meet their information needs.  The institute would also play a vital role in assisting first nations to build their capacity to understand and utilize statistics. Thus, first nations would be able to improve their accountability and decision making capacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note the valuable contributions that the statistical institute would make to the property tax and borrowing regimes established by this bill. First nations would benefit from statistics on residents and commercial enterprises on reserve in determining whether to proceed with the implementation of a property tax regime, which of course is totally optional.  No one has to get into property taxes if they do not want to.  I think there are about 98 first nations to date that have chosen to have a property tax regime and another 14 or so are waiting for this bill.  No one has to if they are not interested in doing so. The statistical institute will certainly help those who choose to do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First nations would benefit from stats on residents and commercial enterprises on reserve in determining how to proceed  with this property tax system.  Further statistical information is a required element in the development of the capital projects which  underlie the issuing of first nations bonds by the finance authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By encouraging first nations to use and thus understand the value of stats, the institute will also encourage first nations to participate more fully in national statistics programs. This will help ensure that the Government of Canada has the statistical information needed to develop and implement efficient policies.  In this way the statistical institute will complement the role of Statistics Canada. For me it will be very helpful in lobbying for first nations programs and the resources required if I have these more detailed statistics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am convinced that Bill C-23 contains the checks and balances needed to protect the investors, to convince them to invest in first nations and to ensure that first nations can develop their economies. By establishing effective statistical and fiscal institutions, Bill C-23 will lead to significant improvements in the quality of life of residents of first nations communities. I am speaking of the ones that have asked for this bill.  Of course other first nations communities are working on other initiatives in other areas and lots of other work is being done by the department in those areas. By providing the community leaders with the tools they need, the legislation will draw more first nation communities into the economic mainstream and clearly all Canadians stand to benefit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said at the beginning, I have tried to dialogue with people to understand some of the concerns they might have had about this and I want to speak informally to try to address some of those concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as we know, the Prime Minister held a summit a couple of weeks ago to talk about a new way of doing business.  In particular he emphasized the fact that first nations ideas were not just coming from the various parties in Ottawa, but from first nations people.  That is what is very exciting about this bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were approached by certain first nations people.    Lots of others do not have an interest in this and it is of course totally optional.  This idea has come from first nations people. When the first nations people presented the major concerns, as per the Prime Minister's relationship with them, he has taken those concerns and put them in the amendments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are  two major concerns.  First, some people suggested that they are collecting property taxes now and they do not want to change that.  They want to keep the Indian Act the way it is.  They do not want to be forced into the new regime and some of the elements about which I have talked today. Those provisions were left in the Indian Act.  People who want to continue  collecting property taxes under the Indian Act may continue to do so.  It is staying the same. The new first nations that decide they want to collect property taxes can do so under the Indian Act, if they so choose.  As I have said, it is totally voluntary.</p><A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1600)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing we did in response to the feedback from some first nations was made it totally optional.    First nations do not have to participate in this under any circumstances if they do not want. It is not a requirement.  Some first nations came to a spot where certain financial institutions in the modern world economy of financing would help them.  They asked us to put institutions in place that they could use and anyone who wanted to could use.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a new relationship, when first nations people bring something forward, and many first nations have supported this, it is hard to tell them no, we cannot give them this tool, if it is totally optional. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to clarify that the $10 million, which I spoke of earlier, from the Government of Canada is not a guarantee.  It is a one time contribution. The government does not backstop this institution. I explained in my speech the number of items it would backstop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just one of many bills we have brought forward since the summit.  As the House knows, from my perspective land claims and self-government are ultimate goals.  They are very successful in my area.  We have tremendous efforts going on in that area to complete those as quickly as possible.  There is $226 million of extra money in this year's estimates so we can keep moving ahead as quickly as we can on land claims and self-government and the ultimate goal for those first nations that want to move ahead in that manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimate is that this could take many decades to cover everyone.  Some first nations have chosen to have these institutes so  they can move ahead in this area.  That is why the bill goes along with all the others.  We have just passed the Westbank self-government and we are in the process of debating the Tlicho self-government  and land claim, which of course is a high priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other first nations, property taxes may be the last of their problems at the moment.  They want clean water, sewers and food.  They need economic development. They want to get the governing and basic needs in their community taken care of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many programs in the department for those first nations.   In the estimates there is an increase of $400 million for other programs to provide for those basic services. That is obviously not forgotten.  It is a very big need for which I will continue to push.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some suggestion that there are no other options. People have to get their lands assessed if they want to get loans. Nothing could be farther from the truth.  This is totally voluntary. First nations have different ways to get loans. They can go to the bank.  First nations can set up their own institutions. They can do what everyone else does to get loans.  They would not have to do anything under the bill because it is totally optional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the first nations that have come forward have financial institutions, have property tax bases and want to move ahead in managing them themselves. They  want institutions governed by first nations people. Those first nations found that they could not get the type of bonding they wanted at a certain level.  Therefore, they asked the government to put this process in place. That is why we are proceeding this way today.</p><A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1605)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing is this is not only for a select few.   It is not just for big cities.    There are many first nations in rural areas with very little assets.  They would like to or are participating in tax collection. If there is any way we could improve it, we would, but  we have had  improvements since the 1990s in development with advisory boards. These institutions are not in place now, but there are advisory boards of first nations people to help advise on each institution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why there has been so many years of work on this.  In my opinion this is why  it would be great if we could proceed at this time.</p>

I will ask a couple of questions and hopefully he can give me the answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question is whether my colleague is aware that the Assembly of First Nations passed a resolution last year not to support this and other bills that the government had put forward. To my knowledge, it has not changed that position. The Assembly of First Nations, which the government does give resources to, is the representing body of first nations throughout Canada, not just 30 or 40 or 50 that might want this.  It represents over 600 first nations in Canada. How does he get around suggesting that first nations want this when there is an Assembly of First Nations resolution, which is still in place, indicating that they do not support the legislation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also quite curious as to where he would expect a good number of those first nation members to get the taxes to pay on their property? I never cease to be amazed.  I listened to the former minister Nault  talk about how first nations people wanted mortgages. My God, I went into communities and they wanted enough food to eat. They wanted enough money to pay for the heat in their homes. They sure did not need a mortgage on top of it. That is where the government is. It has no idea how first nations live in the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want my colleague to tell me where the members of  Bloodvein,  Paungassi, Little Grand Rapids, Shamattawa, Poplar River, Pukatawagan, Brochet,  Lac Brochet,   Tadoule Lake, and I could go on and on,  are supposed to get those wonderful property tax dollars to get an investment down so they can get a loan?</p><A NAME="Int-923600"></A><a HREF="#Int-924252"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-923559"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Hinton): </b>The hon. parliamentary secretary in response.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the number of first nations, she suggested 50 or 60. First, even if we were only helping one first nation of people, I would be pushing for this bill, just like I did for Westbank, just like I did for Tlicho. If I talk--</p><A NAME="Int-924339"></A><a HREF="#Int-923606"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-924252"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Hinton): </b>I do hate to interrupt, but I do have to make it very clear that the audience in the House of Commons are all Canadians and are all very much welcome here, but there cannot be any response.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. parliamentary secretary.</p><A NAME="Int-923606"></A><a HREF="#Int-923634"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-924339"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Larry Bagnell: </b>Madam Speaker, the House of Commons is dealing with two different bills that will help one single first nation.  If I could help one first nation, in fact one first nation person, and if it were optional and it did not hurt the others, then I would be happy to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I do it for only one, the member suggested 50 or 60. There were resolutions from the British Columbia summit of 138 first nations, the Union of Ontario Indians of 43, and the Atlantic Policy Congress of 35 to 216.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to her last question, once again showing a total lack of understanding of the bill, she asked where are we going to get the taxes to pay?  First of all, this bill is not designed for those people who do not have money to pay taxes.  In fact, most of the people paying taxes on first nations taxable authorities right now are non-first nations people living on first nations land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members know that we just had the Westbank bill where there are 7,500 people and only 400 or so are from the first nation.  This provides authorities with the ability  to attract commerce if people want to do taxes, and to tax people that have the ability to pay taxes. I do not know why she would want to hold back successful first nations when it is totally optional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first nations that she mentioned, as I said earlier, if they do not want to collect property taxes, if they do not have a rationale that will help their first nation to do that, and if they do not have the capacity to pay, then they do not have to get involved in this bill.  The bill is to help those who have asked for it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw cases during our tours and meetings with first nations representatives where officials from the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development—like the former minister of that department—were incredibly arrogant.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point the member has raised, which is definitely a good point even if it has nothing to do with the bill, about the workings of bureaucrats, of course, unacceptable behaviour should be dealt with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We as a government have great confidence in civil servants in general, the civil servants who work for the Province of Quebec, and the civil servants who work for the Government of Canada.  If the member has examples, as he described, of civil servants dealing arrogantly with any of our Canadian citizens then he should take that through the proper channels to have it corrected.  I agree with the member that it is totally unacceptable for people to act that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not hold back any particular legislation in this country because it will be abused by some bureaucrat.  We should deal with individuals and, as I said, I think they are very few and far between.  When they are identified, then such their actions should be held to task and be accountable.  I am hoping that everyone in the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is there to help advance the cause of first nations in this country that have such a great disparity with the rest of Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different first nations are in different stages and so they need different solutions.  Some require the basic services.  Some first nations are ready for land claims and we are in negotiations with them in bills.  Some of them have asked for this.  We should be flexible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our employees are not being flexible and open, then please let us know and I agree that we should fix the problem.</p><A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1615)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

I am not saying that there are isolated cases involving public servants. What I am saying is that the government wants so much for this law to apply that it might give directives to its officials to make it totally mandatory to meet the requirements of the law. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government has found a backdoor method of setting aside its fiduciary duties, by passing this bill and making the first nations responsible—against their wishes—for applying the provisions of the law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not isolated cases. They might be directives from the government, which has an incredible desire to apply the provisions of this law. My fear is that the federal government will throw its fiduciary responsibilities out the back door.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We brought this in good faith to the first nations people of this country saying that it is totally optional.   They brought this to us.  We are putting this tool in place for those who want it.  If they do not want it, they do not have to use it.

It was previously Bill C-19.  This was a bill that was tied very closely to Bill C-7, the first nations governance act.  The government tied those two together so tightly that when Bill C-7 was finally buried by the minister, Bill C-19, now C-23, wore a lot of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a great attempt by the government to try to address concerns that were brought forward in terms of making C-19, now C-23, more palatable. There were a series of amendments tabled and discussed with the opposition critics.  The opposition critics, including myself, agreed that tabling could occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the difficulties   that all of the opposition parties are having is that those amendments were amendments that improved the bill. However, for all of us,  those amendments did not improve the bill to the point where we are willing to support the bill.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My single biggest complaint with the bill, which I discussed with the previous minister, was the fact that the statistical institute was not decoupled from the fiscal institutes.  Everyone agrees that the statistical institute is not essential to the workings of the other three institutes or boards that are enabled by this legislation.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was expecting those amendments that would decouple the statistical side to be tabled.  It did not happen.  What we now have is  a contradiction in the legislation.  I do not see how a statistical institute for first nations can operate on an optional basis. I do not really want it to either because all of this is basically duplicating what Statistics Canada already does.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already have a report from the Auditor General from December 2002 which clearly states that the amount of paperwork that the federal government demands of first nations at the administrative level far exceeds what is realistic or reasonable.  Most of that information is never used  by the federal government in any case.  Therefore, it seems to me we are piling a problem on top of a problem for no rational purpose.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the president of the first nations finance authority agreed with the statement that the statistical institute is not essential to the workings of the other three institutions.  </p><A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1620)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has never been any attempt on the part of the non-government proponents to say that this is essential or necessary, yet the government, for whatever reason, has made a conscious decision that it is going to keep this in an omnibus fashion within the bill rather than let that other institution stand or fail on its own merits. I fail to understand that.  I empathize very much with the criticisms that here is an institution to collect first nations statistics, but if it is not being done  on  anything more than an optional basis, the statistics are going to be meaningless in any case. This seems like some kind of swamp country that we just as well might avoid. That is my single biggest criticism of the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has brought a great deal of polarization to the first nations community, and  a lot of it is unnecessary. A great deal of it relates to the fact that it was tied so closely to the first nations governance act. We do have about 25% subscription within the province of British Columbia to taxation by the bands in British Columbia and they have endorsed this. However, many of the other groups certainly have not, in a very strong sense of the word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary talked at great length about the endeavours within the House of Commons since the aboriginal summit that  was held in Ottawa not too long ago. That hastily prepared $350,000 summit  excluded some native leadership. It  certainly excluded the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs and I am sure it excluded others. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary was putting great focus on the amount of aboriginal legislation that has been in the House since that moment. I have  quite a different point of view in that really there has been almost no agenda from the government in this place on any subject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aboriginal agenda included Westbank, which the government side  ended up filibustering, and there is   Bill C-23, and not much else has happened in this place. I think one of the reasons even these two bills have progressed along the path to the extent that they have is that the government does not have any other legislation on the  agenda that it wishes to pursue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can look at this many ways, but the way the government is choosing to look at it is certainly very constructed. It is certainly not the way those of us who have been in this place for many years are viewing the current goings on in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, some of the difficulties that are inherent in this legislation, and I have given the background, ended up being worn by the proponents of, for example, the Westbank legislation. The Westbank legislation creates the strongest individual property rights on reserve anywhere in Canada, yet it took a lot of heavy criticism.  I think a lot of that criticism would have been avoidable  had it not been for the baggage that was brought forward as a consequence of the first nations governance act, this bill, and other goings on with the government.</p><A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1625)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westbank is a band with significant taxation revenues, revenues that it has  been collecting since the early 1990s.  It has  a strong record on taxation and it has  a legitimate ability to use this suite of legislation in a very constructive and productive way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the bands that are in a good financial situation or have the ability to be there quite readily are very supportive of this legislation. I think it is unfortunate that the government delivered a package that was not much more straightforward and clear right from the beginning.  The major criticisms it  hastily tried to  address  after the fact could have been addressed months earlier, but they  were not. To this date, all of the criticisms have not been addressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that covers most of my points.  The parliamentary secretary is busy looking through his notes. I will give him the opportunity to ask me questions or to make comments.</p><A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1630)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-923992"></A><a HREF="#Int-924032"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-923709"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Larry Bagnell (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, the member will be happy that I did not find what I was looking for in my notes so I will have to wing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the member that there are different views on different aspects of the bill from a number of first nations people.  I applaud the different views.  They have  approached me and I have tried to answer many of the concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the first nations people who approached me, there was not one who had a concern about having the statistical institute in this  bill.  From what I understood from the member's speech, the only major concern he had related to leaving the fourth institution, the statistical institute, in the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This institution does not duplicate Statistics Canada.  It does not do what Statistics Canada does. It is to collect statistics that are not collected and to take statistics if Statistics Canada is collecting them.  Statistics is a fairly detailed mathematical science involving  a lot of procedures.  We have a first nations institute that can do this when first nations people are looking to extract statistics from Statistics Canada, to embellish them with more statistics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having worked on the census once, I can say that collecting stats is a very sensitive activity.  All people, including first nations people, can be quite sensitive to being asked different types of questions.  I think  they would be more open if they were being asked questions to help their first nation by a first nations statistical institute.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that basis, I do not understand the member's only objection to the bill, which is basically the statistical institute being in the same piece of legislation.</p><A NAME="Int-924032"></A><a HREF="#Int-924101"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-923992"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Duncan: </b>Madam Speaker, I have a big problem with the statistical institute and I am not the only one.  This came up in committee and it  has come up in complaints from several first nations groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the collection of personal and vital statistics, there is a huge gulf between where the parliamentary secretary is coming from and where I come from.   For example, I can remember how irate the member for Edmonton North was, and rightly so, when the census was taken. We were not allowed to answer on our census form that we were Canadian when asked what our ethnic origin was.  People wanted to put “Canadian” and were told no.  There was a revolt in the land,  a cry that this was most inappropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Canadians it takes us a long time before we get upset at some things.  It takes a while for us to get riled up, but when it comes to the collection of private information and statistical information that is an  exception.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, after people cast their  ballots they will probably be asked how they voted. People are tasked to do that  for the media and pollsters.  Almost everybody tells them.  If that were done in Canada,  the people would probably get punched in the nose because we treat that kind of information differently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I completely understand why we do not want a plethora or even more than one statistical institute in this country running amok collecting data. We certainly do not need a parallel organization based on some racial division doing exactly that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I object to it and other people object to it for different reasons.  The main thing is that this information is not going to be optional for the individuals if their band opts in.  I do not see how it can be optional for bands because a partial collection of statistics on a band will be meaningless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The persuasions of the parliamentary secretary are most unconvincing.  I do not see the rationale for the necessity for this institution, other than to further sow divisions, which  unfortunately   sometimes is a political strategy in order to exploit political advantage.  I do not subscribe to that reason either. That is the track record of the Liberal Party and Liberal governments. They would rather exaggerate our differences than treat us the same.  By doing that the Liberals can then be the great ones to somehow take care of all that.</p><A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1635)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the arguments we have heard on fiduciary obligation, this is a bigger threat to the government abusing its fiduciary obligation than anything to do with taxation.  I think the collection of these statistics would allow the government to exploit how it is going to deal with first nations in a manipulative fashion more than anything that might happen with any other part of the legislation. I have very strong feelings about this and I think I have explained them fairly well.</p><A NAME="Int-924101"></A><a HREF="#Int-924112"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-924032"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP): </b>Madam Speaker, I listened closely to my colleague's comments and I will agree on one position.  I do not think it should be the government's legislation that puts in place these institutions.  I firmly believe that first nations should have the opportunity to do that on their own without the okay of the federal government.  That is where we differ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think they have to ask for the federal government's permission as to whether or not they want to get statistics within their first nations.  I do not think they have to ask for the federal government's permission if they want to have a fiscal institution. They should be able to do that without the federal government's permission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite frankly, I want to make this comment because I think it is crucially important that we have accurate statistics for first nations.  For years the federal government did not collect any of those statistics and, as a result, I think first nations have been shortchanged in a good number of instances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was first elected  I would look at statistics on unemployment rates in my riding and they would provide average incomes.  The average income would be $45,000.  I can tell everyone that the average income in first nations communities is not $45,000.  There are very different dynamics and it is crucially important that first nations are able to address those dynamics, but they should  not have to ask permission of the federal government to do so.</p><A NAME="Int-924112"></A><a HREF="#Int-924129"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-924101"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Duncan: </b>Madam Speaker, in a perfect world I would agree with what the member said. However the difficulty is   that they in a sense do have to ask permission.  The reason is that  the default of not asking permission is the Indian Act.  We all know how imperfect the Indian Act is and what an albatross it is in so many ways. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is really happening here is that fiduciary obligation and the Indian Act are being joined at the hip, which  is   a terrible fit.  It is an alloy that does not work.  We have to try to separate that without a perfect model as to how to get there.  This is the conundrum.  This exemplifies everything that is so difficult in terms of moving forward from a first nations or aboriginal perspective, and so much of it relates to the imperfect and outdated Indian Act.</p><A NAME="T1640"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1640)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Earlier, I listened carefully to the reply by the parliamentary secretary to my questions on where exactly in the bill it was clearly set out that all these parameters, all these institutions, and the framework of this legislation, were truly optional, in the following context. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the federal government wants to slough off its fiduciary responsibilities, can it do so by the back door, using this bill?  The answer is yes.  Why so?  I will demonstrate, if I may, and then will get back to some other essential information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I met the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development a few weeks ago, he assured me beyond any doubt that, with the government's amendments, the new provisions in the bill would protect those first nations that did not wish to take advantage of the new framework imposed by Bill C-23.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told me, “It will be beyond any doubt, and departmental staff will not have the right to use the means at their disposal, even intimidation, as has sometimes been the case in past files.  That will be made clear”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the amendments introduced by the government, however, we see there is no assurance that, once Bill C-23 is passed, there will be no government directives to the effect that, for example, any first nation's application for funding, or its ability to benefit from established programs, will not be subject to a directive indicating to the recalcitrant nations, “If you want to benefit from the program, or if you want to continue to get the funding to which you were entitled in the past, you absolutely must implement the provisions of Bill C-23”.  There is no assurance whatsoever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My references just now were not to isolated cases.  This is, in my opinion, the best tool to relieve the federal government of any fiduciary responsibilities.  That will be easy for the federal government, once the bill is passed. I am not saying that it will not benefit certain first nations, but they are the richest ones, the ones with the possibility of levying property taxes and borrowing from financial institutions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the others, I believe we must have confidence in the aboriginal leaders. These are intelligent and thoughtful people. My colleague from Churchill mentioned that 61% of the chiefs of Canada's first nations have come out against this bill. The parliamentary secretary has just told us that, even if there were only one first nation that would benefit, he would fight for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the best way to divide and conquer, to arrange it so that, among the first nations, where there is usually  great agreement on the defence of the basic rights of the aboriginal peoples, in comes a bill of this sort. The first nations are divided; two classes of members of the first nations are created; and they say, “Even if it is only of benefit to a few, we will pass it, despite  fierce opposition by the 61% that do not want it”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would have been interesting, especially yesterday during the vote at report stage, to see the Prime Minister take a different approach. He brags about wanting to establish a new relationship and harmony between the first nations and the federal government, which has been sorely lacking over the past few years with the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, whose mind was made up, who wanted nothing to do with aboriginal claims, who took a hard line and disregarded the unanimous opposition to Bill C-7, for example. Relations between us and the aboriginal people have suffered incredibly as a result of the former minister's attitude to the governance bill, or Bill C-7.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister tells us he wants to establish a new relationship. He even held a first nations summit—quite recently, just a few days ago—where he talked about new directions and self-government and so forth. He stood up yesterday, all smiles and fervour, and gave his unconditional support to Bill C-23, completely disregarding the fact that the majority of these first nations oppose this bill. </p><A NAME="T1645"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1645)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving, he actually greeted first nations members who were sitting in the gallery and who were extremely upset about what was happening. Yesterday, they found out that the new framework for harmonious relations between Ottawa and the first nations was just a smokescreen. The current Prime Minister will do exactly as his predecessor did; he will try to impose his views on the majority of first nations.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no way to act. When Bill C-7 was introduced in the House, we  argued strenuously against it. Even on an initial cursory examination—we looked into it more closely later on—we realized that what the government wanted to propose was as shameful as the Indian Act that has been in effect for 130 years. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spoke out against this legislation and we fought it, because the first nations have unanimously asked us to do so on their behalf. Unfortunately, the first nations were not at the table of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Development and Natural Resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are discussing the future of the first nations and redefining relations, it seems to me that first nations officials should be at the table to be part of these discussions. In this regard, the treaties that were signed decades  if not centuries ago, were not agreements reached by Europeans, by pioneers who  subordinated first nations and looked condescendingly on them. These agreements were reached through a negotiation process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first nations never gave up any authority over their lands. They never gave away any part of their lands either. Over time, over the past 130 years, with the Indian Act, we have violated the rights of first nations, we have parked them in reserves and told them “Do not worry, we will give you something to drink and  eat”. We  deprived them of their resources, of their traditional activities and of their hunting and fishing grounds. We also trampled on their institutions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we doing today? We are proceeding more slowly, in a more polished manner, but we are doing the same thing. The large majority of first nations keep telling us that they are not satisfied with this bill, just as they unanimously told us that they disagreed with Bill C-7. We fought on their behalf against that legislation. We won because Bill C-7 was set aside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, have we actually won?  This government has more or less the same attitude as the previous government. In fact, this government is the continuation of its predecessor. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be interesting to stop imposing things on first nations. It might be interesting to negotiate  as equal partners. Such was the spirit of the initial treaties. There was  a wampum belt, which was a kind of symbolic but no less real contract in terms of provisions. These treaties talked about two peoples making their way in parallel, each   looking after its  own affairs, in harmony, sharing the land, not transferring it  from the first nations to the first Europeans. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has our attitude changed?  Yes it has.  As a Parliament, we feel it is our  mission  to keep first nations in line.  We do not care about harmony.  We could have kept on working on this bill until things were perfectly clear and truly optional.  For example, it is out of the question for ancestral lands to be  used as collateral, or one day become  the property of large financial institutions instead of belonging to first nations.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could have agreed on a way to ensure the  development of all first nations in order to do something about their desperate lack of wealth. </p><A NAME="T1650"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1650)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could have agreed to fast track  self-government negotiations while at the same time moving to adopt institutions which would have been optional  and used only by those first nations ready and willing to do so. First nations that were forced by the government through the back door, against their will,  to accept certain parameters of Bill C-23 should have been provided avenues of redress. This could have been done. Why was it not?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we allow ourselves to say that, if 40% of first nations agree, we can disregard the other 60%? Those who see this as the path to harmony should realize that they do not have the right attitude.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a recent meeting of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Development and Natural Resources, I put a question to the deputy minister in charge of negotiations regarding the expression “inherent right of first nations to self-government”, which is to say outright self-government. I asked him what was the status of these negotiations at present  and what timeframe he envisaged to reach a settlement, to make agreements. These agreements would allow first nations to benefit from development tools such as government, community-based decision-making related to their identity, their culture, and even to aboriginal institutions which were scoffed at in the past. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked him when he thought the negotiations on self-government would end. He could not say. He only said that a lot of resources were needed to finalize the talks. That should be a government priority. We should not put the cart before the horse. We should not create institutions that are not suited to the vast majority of first nations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Churchill was quite clear on that when she asked what wealth the majority of first nations will be able to apply the provisions of the bill to or to benefit from. There is a high level of  poverty in the majority of first nations communities. Basic needs are not even being met.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to housing, for example, this year, 450 units will be built in Quebec, when it is 8,700 that are needed. Most of the existing housing stock has problems. There are chronic mould problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where in this bill is there a possibility for these first nations to escape the poverty cycle? There are also socio-economic problems. What have we to offer for the young except a dead end? Does the bill deal with that? No.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only possible answer is to speed up the implementation of self-government and give back to the first nations the ability to pursue their inherent right to self-government, which is entrenched in our Constitution. First nations need the tools to bring about their own development. Only after that should we consider the use of institutions that will gradually become major tools for the pursuit of that development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is our response to the problem of multiple substance abuse among first nations youth? What does a bill like this  do about the lack of safe drinking water in many areas? Something is wrong. We are setting up ultra-modern institutions that can meet the needs of the rich, but not the real needs and circumstances of native peoples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we consider the situation now, two things should be done, as I said several times. First, we should provide adequate resources. And by adequate, I mean resources that are urgently needed to speed up the conclusion of self-government agreements so that we can eventually leave the first nations alone. They should become equal partners. Let us stop patronizing them and trying to impose things the overwhelming majority does not want. That is the first thing we should do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, we should adopt a contingency plan. As I was saying earlier, there are urgent problems on first nations lands, serious socio-economic problems. Members of the first nations are left to their own devices. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is happening in Lac Barrière with the unsanitary homes, is nothing new. I have seen the same thing in many aboriginal communities across the country. These people are being left to their own devices. Sometimes there is not enough money to hire a teacher, for example, to keep the school open in September. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to fight here, as we did in Winneway for example, for Chief Mathias. We asked for supplementary funds to prevent the school from closing in his community for lack of a teacher. There was a two month delay. </p><A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1655)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, chief Mathias has to deal with forestry companies that want to cut trees on his land. This Algonquin community does not get any royalties. What kind of world do we live in? We are in 2004, and we still have the old colonizing attitudes that existed a few hundred years ago. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must accelerate self-government and introduce emergency plans to force the communities with the most problems to solve their dramatic  social and economic situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish that the new Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the new Prime Minister had more consideration for first nations. I know that, with my speech, I will disappoint some of the first nations that would like to see this bill passed quickly.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we would have liked a renewal. As I mentioned earlier, the government could have reached out to all first nations in Quebec and in Canada and said, “Listen, we will take a few more weeks, but the outcome will be  approved unanimously, or with a very wide consensus”. If this project had been proposed at the Assembly of First Nations' convention, the attitude would have been totally different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sensed some openness on the part of the new Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. I also sensed some openness on the part of the new Prime Minister. However, in view of the facts so far, as of yesterday at least, when we voted on the report stage of this bill, my opinion has changed. The Prime Minister and all the members of the government, including the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, have missed a unique opportunity to demonstrate that perhaps now was not the right time to pass this bill, and that they should review the whole bill so as to reach a consensus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development could have announced—before continuing debate on this bill—that he intended to put more resources into negotiations about self-government. He did not do so. There is nothing there but words and speeches; the attitude and actions are not there;   it is just not enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks ago, as I mentioned earlier, the deputy minister responsible for the negotiations admitted it, but not in so many words, by not providing a target date for the conclusion of the negotiations for the 80 self-government and claims tables. He sounded the alarm. Since the Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, the Erasmus-Dussault report, was published there has not been any real acceleration in these negotiations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Erasmus-Dussault commission, as hon. members will recall, talked about 20 years for a wide range of things to be put in place so all negotiations on self-government could be concluded and the first nations would finally be able to take charge of their own destiny and develop their communities in terms of what they are and what they want to become.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this rate, in 50 years, nothing will have changed. In 50 years, our successors will say, “Listen, many negotiations still have to be concluded. There are still first nations living below the poverty line with unemployment rates as high as 75% in some communities; there are substance abuse problems”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Erasmus-Dussault commission provided a golden opportunity to change things. Ever since the report was tabled, it is as though it never existed. The attitude seems to be, “Since we have given ourselves 20 years, we can take our time”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot take our time anymore. It has now become a national emergency. We absolutely have to redefine a number of things. We have even been  criticized by organizations like the United Nations. That is incredible. And we are turning a deaf ear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the support of my colleague, the hon. member for Sherbrooke, I would like to move the following  motion in amendment:</p>
<p>

I know he has demonstrated an exceptional interest in this issue for not just this  incarnation of the bill but, in fact, when the bill was called Bill C-19. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of us who have been involved in this bill since the very beginning, we see Bill C-23 as a fraud,  an illusion, that there is no appreciable difference in tone or in content from the basic flaws that we pointed out in Bill C-19.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague cited a number of   problems that he had with this bill and, I think in great detail, tried to share with the House what his reservations were as to what might be really motivating the government in introducing this bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key things   he pointed  out, and what I would ask him to expand on, is the whole issue of optionality.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government seems to mitigate the downside of the bill by saying that people  should not worry, that it is only optional and that they  do not have to use it if they do not want to.   However we have had first nations come to our caucus and tell us that the bill is optional in the same way that a driver's licence is optional.  A driver's licence is optional unless we want  to drive a car and then  we must    have one.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the member  agree that the same logic applies to the bill?  People do  not have to avail themselves  of the details of the bill unless they want  to institute some financial bylaws in  their  community, or build a sewage treatment plant and go outside for financing, or  they want  to actually implement their  right to self-government.  If  they want  to do any of those things, then  they have   to join.  Would he agree with me?</p>

He is always very enlightened. I was happy to fight alongside him for 55 days, on behalf of the first nations and  against Bill C-7, in the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Development and Natural Resources. That was a record in Canadian parliamentary history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst thing is that the government is talking out of both sides of its mouth. If the government is so enthusiastic about this bill, if it thinks this bill represents the future with all the parameters it contains, then it is possible and completely plausible to think that the government—through the back door—has given directives to the officials in the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, who are responsible for implementing all these programs for the first nations, to have the first nations conform to the provisions of the bill, a bill they do not want, in order to receive grants or continue to benefit from government programs.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is still deciding on behalf of the first nations what is suitable for them and what is not. That is paternalism,  pure and simple. What is the difference in attitude between the Indian Act that was imposed on the first nations and a bill like this one? They are the same. There is always this desire to keep the first nations down, to keep the pressure on them, even if they disagree with a bill, to apply the provisions of that bill, which might become law. That is unacceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is  understandable that the first nations who are opposed to this may have their doubts about the government's good will. For decades, they have been promised all sorts of things, and their rights have been trampled on. For decades, they have been told they will be able to live, to develop and to benefit from the growth in the collective wealth, but they are kept on the sidelines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was talking earlier about Winneway and Chief Mathias. This same chief is engaged in a dispute with the lumber companies that want to cut wood on his land. His community would not collect any royalties on this harvest—on their own land. That is unacceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most  first nations chiefs saw right through the government's intentions. The federal government is trying to get in through the back door in order to shirk its fiduciary responsibilities toward first nations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the whole matter of dispossessing traditional lands.  Not much was said about this earlier. This is also a risk. At some point,  traditional lands could be used as collateral by financial institutions. Is that right? Generation after generation of first nations members and chiefs have fought, throughout Canada's history, for the right to get their land back. Suddenly, this land could be seized by financial institutions. This is also a risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all first nations communities are prepared for this development, property tax, loans, and so forth. Can we allow this risk? Can we just ignore these risks when the provisions are not clear on this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many mistakes have been made in the past. The federal government's management of aboriginal affairs for the past 130 years is nothing to be proud of, not that it has been easy. As I mentioned at the end of my speech, even the United Nations finds that Canada is acting like the Rhodesians in South Africa before apartheid was abolished. Our treatment of the aboriginals is a little nicer, but not any less cruel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why negotiations on self-government should be accelerated and concluded. Since the Erasmus-Dussault commission, since 1997—five years ago—not much progress has been made. Some first nations have achieved self-government.  Some have concluded sectoral agreements. Some have reached a true self-government agreement on governance and jurisdiction, but not many.  </p><A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec,   we set ourselves the objective of speeding up the negotiations.  Hon. members have seen what happened with the James Bay Cree, with the peace of the braves.  That grew out of the 1978 agreement concluded by René Lévesque with the James Bay Cree.  We modernized it, providing additional tools.  Everyone knows how the James Bay Cree are developing now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thing goes with the proposed agreement with the Innu.  We want to speed things up in order to be able to live in harmony, to share the land and live as two nations on the territory of Quebec.  The federal government ought to share that enthusiasm and that concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine what an about-face would ensue.  After 130 years of  the infamous Indian Act, of subjugation, suddenly the federal government steps things up. Firm negotiations.  The Erasmus-Dussault report. The first nations took great hope from the Penner report and the report by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.   Young aboriginal people could glimpse the possibility of identification with their nation, of pride in their nation, of a future with opportunity instead of a dead end. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened since?   Some things have been done, but are they things to be proud of?  Can we say that we put every effort, every enthusiasm into it?  When the government across the way is convinced of something, then it puts in the appropriate resources. When there is a bill it wants to see passed, it makes sure it moves through.   Why not the same approach to the first nations?  It would not be hard to devote more resources to this.  The Prime Minister has surplus funds coming out of his ears, and he is well aware of this, having been the finance minister. Why, then, not put more resources into it, speed up the process, achieve self-government, be proud of this coexistence with the aboriginal peoples?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aboriginal culture is a treasure.  Its history, its languages are rich.  Why not take advantage of that wealth instead of blocking the first nations' rights to be themselves, to govern themselves, to enact their own laws on their own territory, to benefit from its resources, and thus to survive?  Quebec knows something about preserving culture.  It is the most fundamental aspect of any people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But instead, we are still stubbornly engaged in the divide and conquer approach.  That is not the way to improve things. </p><A NAME="T1710"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1710"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1710)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-924456"></A><a HREF="#Int-924464"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-924397"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair): </b>Before proceeding further, I declare the amendment brought forward by the hon. member of the Bloc Quebecois in order.

To be clear, I understand the debate is on the amendment at this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with my colleague.  I have long admired his particular sensitivity to this issue.  I think perhaps part of that comes from his own background as a sovereignist.  He can identify with the right to self-government of aboriginal people perhaps with a sensitivity that others only aspire to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-23 is vehemently opposed by the overwhelming majority of more than 600 first nations across Canada. There are over 633 first nations who are affiliated with the Assembly of First Nations.  The overwhelming majority are opposed  to Bill C-23, just as they were opposed to Bill C-19.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, that is where the debate should properly stop. That should put an end to this debate because that is all we really need to know. This bill has not been developed with the cooperation and input from the 633 first nations of the Assembly of First Nations, the parliament of the first nations community.  It was resoundingly rejected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin with a bit of history.  In Halifax in the summer of 2001, I was at the Assembly of First Nations gathering where the first draft resolution in support of this concept was voted down.  The people were upset.  A great deal of work took place at that assembly. With a fair amount of generosity, the chiefs at that assembly, even though they voted down the original resolution, agreed to allow it to carry on under the explicit condition that any draft bill had to come back to the Assembly of First Nations to be reviewed, accepted or rejected.  That never happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In classic, unilateral, arrogant, and colonial fashion, the government, even after having heard from the legitimately elected leadership of first nations across the country, went ahead in complete opposition to the directives given, that the Assembly of First Nations would cooperate in the development of this bill if the draft was brought back to them for their review, input and cooperation.  That never happened. We have to begin from that basic premise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also state another fact which is somewhat at odds with the presentation by the parliamentary secretary.  The hard core support for this bill is probably in the range of 30 first nations, mostly from British Columbia.  These first nations seem closely aligned both philosophically and otherwise to INAC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me raise another point.  It seems that those who are in favour of this bill, those who are promoting these four fiscal institutions, have unlimited money and funding to fly around the country and promote this bill, and the formation of these four institutions. I raise that as a concern right from the beginning because it seems to me, first of all, those four institutions are up and running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are debating here the enabling legislation to create those institutions and they exist. They have offices, staff, CEOs, high priced help and seem to have an unlimited amount of money to fly around the country and lobby me to support this bill.  Many of us in the House have had personal visits from people who identify themselves through their business cards as the salaried officers of these institutions.  I know the money to create them comes from the aid-based budget of INAC, money that could have and should be more properly directed toward meeting the basic needs of aboriginal people, I would think, rather than fly around the country as high priced lobbyists to convince me that I should vote for this bill. I raise that as a concern, but let us be honest about this.  </p><A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1715)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary said that      about 100 first nations  support the bill. There are about 30 first nations that actively support the bill and  another 70 first nations  that have expressed some interest in availing themselves of the services that the institutions would provide at some later date, for a total of 100 first nations.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an exaggeration and, in fact, it is misleading and  disingenuous to say that   a full 100 first nations  support the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-23 as it stands is national legislation that negatively affects the rights and interests of all first nations across the country.  Even though there are only 30-some first nations that vehemently support the bill, it adversely affects all first nations.  Let me elaborate and explain somewhat because   I think it warrants an explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is being promoted as a first nations driven piece of legislation, which  is utterly misleading.  If first nations driven is meant to imply that the bill is supported by most first nations across Canada, let me say again that it is vehemently opposed by most first nations across Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national fiscal and statistical institutions created by Bill C-23 affect the rights of all 600-plus first nations, even though it is supported by only a few.  The institutions would  be funded on an indefinite basis from the federal envelope that is allowed for all first nations.  In other words, even those first nations that do not support these institutions would  be inadvertently paying for them by money that would have otherwise been spent in their communities, possibly meeting basic needs.  Yet these institutions are actively opposed by the majority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this very early point in my remarks  let me say that this is not only bad public policy but it  is bad law if it is overwhelmingly opposed  and those who oppose it are forced to pay for it.  How unfair can that  be?  It offends doubly, in a sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It  is true that there are  a handful of first nations, mostly in B.C., that are driving the legislation forward.  However it is also true that the overwhelming majority that are opposed to the bill are opposed   in both principle  and text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from the disrespect to Parliament that this misinformation serves, the misstatement of the level of first nations support raises a constitutional issue as to the very validity of the bill.  Bill C-23 affects the rights and interests of all first nations, not just those that sign on to the optional schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court of Canada, in leading cases  such as Sparrow and Delgamuukw, has been clear  that first nations are entitled to full and reasonable consultation when there is proposed legislation that is likely to affect their rights. In some special cases the consent of first nations may be mandated.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if the consultation record is insufficient, as I argue it has been given the level of opposition and the failure of the government to bring back a draft to the Assembly of First Nations for ratification or approval prior to coming to Parliament, I argue that the consultation obligation has not been met.  The most basic, fundamental test put to us by the Supreme Court in terms of legislation that may affect inherent aboriginal and treaty rights has not been met  in this case again.  This is a pattern that we have seen since I have been here as a member of Parliament, a disturbing pattern, a deliberate pattern, a colonial imperialist pattern.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not overstating it to say  that  because of the government's unwillingness to give meaning and definition to section 35 of the Constitution, it has allowed the courts to interpret time and time again what inherent and treaty rights mean.   Time and time again the government loses at the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court is now telling us that if we are going to introduce any future legislation that may affect inherent and treaty rights, consultation is required.  Again, the government has chosen not to consult because consultation means more than just informing people  what will  be done to them.  Consultation requires a meaningful exchange and accommodation of the points put forward by the other party.  True consultation means bringing the issue forward, putting it on the table,   getting the other person's point of view and accommodating some of the points raised, not imposing one's  will on someone else.  That  is a basic, fundamental principle and the government has ignored it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If passed into law,    Bill C-23 will surely be challenged in the courts.  There is a strong likelihood that the statute will be held unconstitutional because of the failure once again of INAC to follow the consultation standard laid down by the Supreme Court of Canada in numerous landmark decisions, numerous court rulings that actually took place during  this 37th Parliament and  during  the 36th   Parliament.</p><A NAME="T1720"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1720)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty to properly consult first nations is a key aspect of federal fiduciary obligation.   It is protected by section 35 of the Constitution but we would never know that  from the government's attitude and approach to it.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to raise the issue of optionality again.  All the government can think of to try to allay the concerns brought forward by the majority of first nations is to say that it will make it optional;  that it will only apply to those people who choose to avail themselves of it.  That is a lie, or  to put it another way,  that   is misleading. This new schedule mechanism is a parlour trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made the point earlier and I will say it again.  For the government to say that the bill is optional is like saying a driver's licence is optional.  It is optional unless one wants to drive a car. As soon as  one wants to drive a car, a licence becomes mandatory.  Smaller first nations will find themselves in   that trap because if they do not sign on and become one of the member nations on the schedule, they will not be allowed to set up any other type of financial bylaws within their own first nations unless they meet the approval of this new institution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are not on the schedule and they want to seek outside financing for some project in their community, instead of the government meeting its fiduciary obligation to that first nation, it will simply say that if the first nation needs the development in its community it should go    join the new fiscal institutions and  join the pooled effort of financial activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are some of the fears put in a very simplistic way. This new schedule mechanism is a carnival trick.  It is meant to deceive.  It conveys the impression that three of the institutions in the bill, all but the statistical institute, are optional and therefore not prejudicial to first nations that choose not to join.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note in passing that once on the schedule  it seems that a first nation becomes subject to those institutions and getting out is in fact more difficult than getting in because once on the schedule the first nation cannot get off the schedule without the approval of all   those other first nations that  are on the schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That  may seem like a fine point but any time we have rules and conditions under which we can join something, at the same time we have to factor in rules and conditions by which we can leave.  In other words, it is more difficult to leave than it is to join and we get pulled in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pretence of optionality fostered by the schedule amendment is not maintained in the case of the statistical institute.   This part is imposed on all first nations and bands in Canada, whether or not they add their names to the schedule.  There is nothing optional at all about the statistical institute.  In fact, it can gather sensitive, private information on all first nations in the country, no matter whether they want that information gathered or not.  There is a serious privacy issue associated with this question.  This should be alarming to the overwhelming majority of first nations that  are voting against the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask all members to take note that under clause 105  the federally appointed institute can indefinitely collect and use the most sensitive data about all bands in Canada  without their consent.  Where is the optionality there?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alleged optionality of these three institutions is completely misleading.  In fact, they are statutory national bodies that will affect the rights and interests of all first nations in Canada, whether or not they are added to the schedule.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anything, the schedule model, I would argue, actually makes things worse.  This is because the schedule model perversely guarantees that these important national institutions will be perpetually controlled by the small number of first nations that  are strongly in support  and which  have aligned themselves with INAC.  If anything, this schedule would have  a perversely negative effect on people. I do not think the minister and his INAC officials have thought this through.</p><A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1725)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax commission, which is really the Indian tax advisory board on steroids,  is one of the institutions said to be optional.  Again, nothing could be further from the truth. The tax commission is a federally appointed body and it will become the czar of all future on reserve property taxation bylaws or laws. This is what I was getting at, and I hope people will listen to this carefully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this law is passed, in the future all first nations in Canada that want to develop on reserve property taxation laws and systems will have to seek the approval of this federally appointed commission, whether they signed on to it or not. All such first nations will have to submit their annual property tax budgets to the commission for approval. That is in clause 9. People can check that if they do not believe me. I do not make up this stuff. There is no optionality here. This affects the rights and interests of all first nations therefore, whether they are on the schedule or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unilateral nature of the tax commission is made even more problematic by the many upfront restrictions on first nations property taxations contained in Bill C-23. First nations will not be free to spend their tax revenue as they please. Instead, they will be forced to spend their money on local infrastructure and the like, and therefore lightening the burden on INAC. I get back to one of my basic problems here, which is that the bill is more about the desire of the federal government to offload its fiduciary obligations, its financial obligations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First nations cannot just use their tax revenue for any purpose they see fit. No matter what the need and demand is in their community, they have to use it for things that the federal government approves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, I cannot make all the points I would like to make because my time is running out.  However, again, the impression of optionality, stoked by the tricky schedule amendment, is misleading. People saw through that right from day one. The first nations  that  read the bill saw that. Many of us are only just beginning to see that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most disturbing, strong armed component to Bill C-23 is directly linked to the management board, clause 8 of the bill. I urge people to refer to that. Communities that do not voluntarily join the bill are not permitted to pass bylaws or laws dealing with the critical area of financial administration. Even if they are not on the schedule, the management board, they are not allowed to pass comparable bylaws and financial bylaws. This is contrary to the inherent right of self-government, plain and simple.</p><A NAME="Int-924635"></A><a HREF="#Int-924643"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-924464"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair): </b>The hon. member for Winnipeg Centre has four minutes left in his speech, and he is entitled to a 10 minute question and comment period when the bill comes before the House again.</p>

As his predecessor had, he mentioned an action plan leading to ratification after stakeholder consultations.  This would be good news were it not for the fact that consultations have been dragging on for years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultations surrounding Canada's involvement with the protocol have been discussed as late as February in international meetings.  By now, Canada should be on the verge of ratification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add at this point the following observation.  First, 96 countries, including Mexico, Japan and the European Union have already ratified the biosafety protocol.  They have adopted the precautionary principle dealing with the risks posed by importing genetically engineered organisms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada currently exports approximately 22 million metric tonnes of grain annually, 80% of which may have trace levels of genetically modified organisms.  Our exports will be greatly affected by the standards set by countries which have ratified the biosafety protocol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on March 31 of this year Mr. Stemshorn, the assistant deputy minister of the Environmental Protection Service at Environment Canada, informed the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development that Canada will be subject to the regulations imposed by importing countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By not ratifying the protocol we have very little influence in the decision making process on import regulations.  In addition, further delays would damage Canada's access to foreign markets because genetically modified grain continues to be sold unlabelled. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the purity of genetic stock of grain is affected, Canadian farmers will have an increasing uphill battle maintaining access and penetrating international markets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons, delaying ratification of the biosafety protocol is not in Canada's best interests.  The next round of international meetings will take place next spring. Canada needs to participate fully in these discussions. Therefore, it stands to reason that the Government of Canada should take into full account Canada's long term interests in growing global markets, and also ensure Canada's voice is in the international fora.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening, could the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food tell us when Canada will ratify the biosafety protocol?</p><A NAME="T1825"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1825"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1825)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-924946"></A><a HREF="#Int-924974"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-924941"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Mark Eyking (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food (Agri-Food), Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his question regarding when Canada will ratify the Cartagena protocol on biosafety. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biosafety protocol is a multilateral environmental agreement designed to address the potential adverse effects on biological diversity of transboundary movements of living modified organisms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living modified organisms are genetically modified organisms,  what we call GMOs, that can replicate in the environment.  Living modified organisms currently in commercial production in Canada are corn, canola and soybeans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada supports the environmental objectives of the biosafety protocol and this is one of the reasons that we signed the protocol in April 2001. However, at the time of the signing, Canada indicated that we had a number of concerns that would need to be addressed, including documentation requirements for shipments of food, feed for processing, and  obligations and responsibilities in a number of specific areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central to Canada's position is the need to finalize the implementation details of the biosafety protocol in a practical way that does not impede trade. Consultations with  industry in this respect are ongoing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hon. member knows, Canada currently has one of the most stringent regulatory frameworks for plants with novel traits, which include living modified organisms. All plants with novel traits undergo a stringent environmental, human and animal health and safety risk assessment prior to being approved. As such, Canada ensures that no living modified organism poses a risk to biological diversity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to some of the concerns that Canada had at the signing, documentation provisions were discussed at the first meeting of the parties in February 2004. Some decisions taken at that meeting, however, warrant careful consideration by all interested stakeholders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final decision on the documentation provisions will be taken at the second meeting of parties, which is scheduled for next year. The fact that Canada has not ratified the protocol has no effect on the continuing obligation of Canadian exporters to meet the import requirements of  other countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me clarify that the biosafety protocol is an environmental agreement and was never intended to regulate the labelling of genetically modified products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultations regarding the outcome of the first meeting of parties have been initiated, with a view to assess the decisions taken by the first meeting of parties. Our government is committed to work closely with all stakeholders on this very important issue.</p><A NAME="T1830"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1830"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1830)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-924974"></A><a HREF="#Int-924975"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-924946"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Réginald Bélair): </b>The hon. member for Davenport has one minute to respond.</p><A NAME="Int-924975"></A><a HREF="#Int-924977"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-924974"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Charles Caccia: </b>Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my thanks to the hon. parliamentary secretary for his comprehensive reply. Unfortunately, he has not answered my question, namely, when will Canada ratify the biosafety convention? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He  also indicated that consultations with industry are ongoing. These consultations started after the signing of the biosafety convention in 2001 and have gone on for three years. One begins to wonder how long the consultations will last. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally,  I do not agree with the statement just made that the non-ratification does not affect our effectiveness in round table discussions on  the matter. Therefore, I must ask again, could the parliamentary secretary   at least indicate when the biosafety convention will be ratified?</p><A NAME="Int-924977"></A><a HREF="#Int-924979"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-924975"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Mark Eyking: </b>Mr. Speaker, I  thank the member for bringing this issue before us tonight. The issue of GMOs is a concern for  many consumers all over the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have a definite answer for the member on when exactly we will fulfill all the obligations in that protocol. As I stated before, it is a very complicated process and it has a lot of impact on our food producers, especially our exporters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some key provisions in that protocol are  documentation requirements, compliance, liability and redress, transit, trade with non-parties, and relationships with the WTO rules. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also recognize, and it is also important to note, that no major exporter has yet ratified the protocol. The United States is Canada's most important trading partner and it  is not a party to the protocol. As we have found out over the last year, we are very intertwined with the United States, whether we buy or sell products to the Americans, so we have to  work  with them also in  going through this process.</p><A NAME="Int-924979"></A><a HREF="#Int-924977"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair): </b>The hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester not being present to raise the matter for which adjournment notice had been given, the notice is deemed withdrawn.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The House adjourned at 6:34 p.m.)</p>
