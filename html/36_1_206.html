as a result of the negociations to return Christine Lamont and 
David Spencer to Canada, iremized by department and including, 
but not limited to, administrative and travel costs for ministers

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  I am informed by 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada and the Ministry 
of the Solicitor General as follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1. The sum of $1,674 was the cost for translating a 6,200 word 
document from Portuguese to English relating to the sentence, 
judgment and appeals, which is required by Correctional Services 
in order to calculate the sentence and eligibility for 
conditional release in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five other texts were translated prior to 1996.  The costs for 
translation were borne by the secretary of state.  The estimated 
cost for the translation of those five documents is $10,878. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2. The sum of $785 was the cost for translation of documents by 
the embassy in Brasilia.  These documents relate to the behaviour 
of the two Canadians transferred back to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These documents are not required in order to effect the 
transfer, but would be used in the assessment of the conditional 
release terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>3. There were no trips made relating to the negotiation of the 
transfer.  The Transfer of Offenders Treaty itself was negotiated 
in 1992 and ratified in 1998.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 173—<B>Mr. Randy White:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the years 1997 and 1998; (<I>a</I>) how many criminal offences 
were committed with the use of a firearm; (<I>b</I>) of those 
offences, how many firearms were recovered by law enforcement 
authorities; and (<I>c</I>) of those firearms recovered by 
authorities, how many were registered in the national firearms 
registry? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> I am informed by 
Justice Canada and Statistics Canada as follows: (a) The most 
recent year in which Canadian crime statistics are available is 
1997.  Data on criminal offences committed with the use of 
firearms are reported by police to the Aggregate Uniform Crime 
Reporting Survey UCR1, and Homicide Survey maintained by the 
Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics.  The CCJS is Canada's 
official source of crime data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three criminal offences reported in the 
above-mentioned surveys.  These include firearm homicide, firearm 
robbery and discharge firearm with intent.  Other types of 
criminal offences investigated by the police which may involve 
the use of a firearm, et cetera, for example attempted murder, 
assault, sexual assault, abduction, are currently not reported to 
the CCJS, nor are they available nationally from other sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 there were 193 firearm homicide incidents, 5,478 firearm 
robbery incidents and 189 discharge firearm with intent 
incidents, representing a total of at least 5,860 criminal 
incidents which involved the use of a firearm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) Although individual police agencies may collect this 
information, data on recovered firearms are not available from a 
national data source.  Compiling such data would require 
considerable effort and cost.  However, the Canadian Firearms 
Registration System, CFRS, will assist in further developing 
national data on firearms recovered by law enforcement in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of alternative sources may be examined to provide a 
partial picture.  Data from the Provincial Weapons Enforcement 
Unit, PWEU, of Ontario and from various recovered gun studies are 
presented below.  According to PWEU, there were a total of 7,566 
firearms seized by Ontario law enforcement in 1997 and 1998. 
These data reflect firearms seized from a crime scene or guns 
that were illegally possessed.  According to PWEU, their records 
do not indicate whether the firearms were in fact used in a 
crime.  Individual municipalities are still reporting data from 
1998 and as a result the above figure is an undercount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As additional information, PWEU provided the types of firearms 
seized by police during the above period.  In 1997, 78% of the 
firearms seized were rifles/shotguns, 18% were handguns, 2% were 
machine guns/pistols and the remaining 1% were sawed-off 
rifles/shotguns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the Department of Justice Canada, in partnership with 
police services in Saint John, New Brunswick, Hull, Quebec, 
Thunder Bay and Windsor, Ontario, and Regina, Saskatchewan 
commissioned a joint research project to study the number and 
types of firearms recovered by police.  It examined police 
records and property room files for the year 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study found that in 1995 these law enforcement agencies 
recovered 473 firearms in criminal incidents.  Overall the study 
found that 52% of the firearms recovered by police in relation 
to a criminal incident were non-restricted rifles and shotguns, 
21% were handguns, 19% were air guns, 4% were sawed-off 
rifles/shotguns and the remaining 4% were other firearms.  It is 
important to note that under the Criminal Code air guns that 
shoot projectiles under the velocity of 152 meters per second are 
not defined as firearms.  However, due to the number recovered in 
this and previous studies data on air guns were collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Data collected by the national Firearms Smuggling Work Group 
from 10 different police agencies across Canada revealed that 
they recovered 4,496 firearms in criminal incidents in 1993. 
The study also reported that of the 4,496 firearms recovered in 
criminal incidents, 47% were rifles/shotguns, 21% were 
handguns, 18% were air guns, 11% were other firearms and the 
remaining 3% were sawed-off rifle/shotguns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the above two studies, recovered firearms served as the unit 
of analysis, not criminal incidents involving firearms.  In these 
studies the firearms may or may not have been used directly in 
the commission of a crime.  For example, they includes firearms 
recovered by police during a drug raid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) As noted above, data on recovered firearms are not readily 
available on a national level.  Futhermore, if national data were 
readily available, the registration status of recovered firearms 
could only be ascertained for restricted firearms “mainly 
handguns” registered on the Restricted Weapons Registration 
System, RWRS, maintained by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 
Once again, the CFRS will assist in developing information on the 
registration status of all firearms recovered by law enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Long gun registration statistics for crime will only be 
available when long gun registry is fully operational, after 
January 1, 2003.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the Halifax Port Corporation: (<I>a</I>) has the corporation

<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromiski (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> (a) The Halifax Port Corporation did enter 
into a lease agreement with Scotia Terminals Limited for 
facilities at Pier 9A.  The lease commenced December 1, 1998.  A 
tender call for the lease was not issued.  In fact, it would be 
highly unusual for the Halifax Port Corporation to call for 
tenders to lease facilities.  Neither HPC's enabling legislation 
nor its internal policies require it to call for tenders for 
leases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) In 1996, the dock, which was constructed over 50 years ago, 
was declared unsafe and taken out of service.  The proposal to 
lease facilities put forward by Scotia Terminals Limited provided 
the necessary support for the decision to carry out the $5.3 
million repair expenditure.  The repairs were at the cost of HPC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) In the past five years there have been two other leases of a 
multimillion dollar port facility.  One was to PanCanadian 
Petroleum Limited at Shed 9B and the other was to Colbalt 
Refinery Limited at Shed 22.  The latter area was subsequently 
leased to Scotia Terminals Limited.  The lease terminated on 
November 30, 1998 when the operation moved to the Pier 9A 
facility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) The Halifax Port Corporation deems the amount of revenue to

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have been the federal government's activities in the area 
of hepatitis B vaccination, specifically: (<I>a</I>) information 
learned by Health Protection Branch regulators from the decision 
by France to suspend the administration of the hepatitis B 
vaccination; (<I>b</I>) actions taken by Health Canada to assess 
safety of the vaccination B product and, in particular, to survey 
for adverse reactions over and above voluntary reporting; (<I>c</I>) 
information requested and received from international bodies such 
as the World Health Organization about the safety of the 
hepatitis B vaccination; (<I>d</I>) reassessment of existing evidence 
in the new drug submission for the hepatitis B vaccination 
previously assessed; and (<I>e</I>) evidence that plasma was not 
involved in any part of the manufacturing of the hepatitis B 
vaccination? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Hepatitis B is a 
potentially serious disease, spread by blood and body fluid 
contact. From 1990 to 1994 the incidence of hepatitis B in Canada 
was on average about 10.3 per 100,000 per year, with 
corresponding mortality, morbidity and the potential for long 
term complications and chronic carriage. The best time to 
introduce the vaccine into the routine schedule is before children 
become sexually active. Targeting high risk groups only is an 
ineffective strategy, which is why the vaccine is being offered 
for infants or children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) The decision in France was taken in response to pressure 
exerted by opponents to the vaccine who allege that immunization 
with the vaccine is associated with the development of some types 
of neurologic disease. It was not based on scientific evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The French Minister of Health announced on October 1, 1998 that 
school based vaccination programs would be temporarily suspended, 
in part due to pressure from opponents to the vaccine. 
Allegations have been circulating in France, despite a lack of 
scientific evidence, linking hepatitis B vaccination and the 
development of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, 
MS. In contrast, the vaccine is still recommended for routine 
infant immunization, and for adults in high risk groups. More 
importantly, vaccination is still recommended and available to 
adolescents through their family doctor's office. The French 
minister highlighted that this move was temporary, and it will 
permit a reassessment of the method of delivery of adolescent 
immunization in school settings. France embarked on a very large 
scale hepatitis B immunization effort several years ago, to the 
point where some 25 million doses have been distributed and over 
one-third of the population have been vaccinated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) The Laboratory Centre for Disease Control, LCDC, Health 
Canada and the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, NACI, 
have continued to review available evidence, including results of 
postmarked surveillance in Canada, in light of the allegations 
against hepatitis B vaccine. There is no evidence to suggest any 
change in the current recommendations for the routine use of 
hepatitis B vaccine in Canada. There is no credible scientific 
evidence linking hepatitis B vaccination and MS and chronic 
fatigue syndrome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The World Health Organization, WHO, has reaffirmed the safety of 
hepatitis B vaccine and strongly recommended that all countries 
already using hepatits B vaccine continue to do so, and that 
countries not yet using the vaccine begin as soon as possible. 
Health Canada's role with regard to the hepatitis B vaccine is 
multifaceted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Therapeutic Products Program, TPP, reviews the vaccine 
through a process of careful assessment of pre-market clinical 
trials to ensure it meets required standards of safety and 
efficacy. In addition, each lot of vaccine is individually 
cleared by TPP before being allowed on the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Advisory Committee on Immunization, reporting to 
the Assistant Deputy Minister, Health Protection Branch, issues 
guidelines and recommendations on the use of the product. NACI 
indeed has recommended routine use of the vaccine and continues 
to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Division of Immunization, Bureau of Infectious Diseases of 
the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control is responsible for the 
postmarked surveillance of vaccines in Canada, including the 
hepatitis B vaccine. It undertakes both passive and active 
surveillance of vaccine associated adverse events and supports an 
external expert advisory committee on vaccine safety. There have 
been no concerns regarding MS identified in Canada, and an 
investigation into whether the vaccine causes chronic fatigue 
syndrome found no evidence of an association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The monitoring of vaccine safety relies on many interrelated 
activities in addition to case reporting. Not only do the 
Laboratory Centre for Disease Control, LCDC, Health Canada and 
the National Advisory Committee on Immunization aggregate and 
assess all reports received to be able to detect any signals of 
increased, unusual or previously unrecognised adverse events, but 
in addition Health Canada funds a national program, through the 
Canadian Pediatric Society, which actively monitors for serious 
reactions to vaccinations in children and adolescents at 11 
pediatric hospitals. The Division of Immunization has also 
established a committee of medical and vaccine experts to review 
all the reported serious cases and to further investigated any

</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) The World Health Organization, WHO, has issued a press 
release reaffirming the safety and benefit of hepatitis B 
vaccination. It concluded, after careful review with the 
assistance of external experts, that available scientific 
evidence does not demonstrate a causal association between 
hepatitis B immunization and central nervous system disease, 
including MS. The Viral Hepatitis Prevention Board, a World 
Health Organization collaborating centre for the prevention of 
viral hepatitis, called a technical consultation at the end of 
September 1998 to review accumulated data. Participants at that 
meeting were presented with data, including preliminary and still 
unpublished recent analytic epidemioligic studies conducted in 
France, the United Kingdom and the United States. Although they 
acknowledged that the data available to date was limited, none 
demonstrated a causal association between hepatitis B vaccination 
and demyelinating disease. They concluded that no evidence was 
presented at the meeting to indicate a need to change public health 
policy with respect to hepatitis B vaccination. Routine 
immunization programs against hepatitis B are in place in 100 
countries around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) Reassessment of existing evidence has not been considered 
for the time being in view of the aforementioned notification 
from WHO. Its statement is based on the conclusion from the 
international expert meeting at Geneva, on September 28-30, 1998, 
at which all available information was reviewed in 
detail—national public health and regulatory authorities, 
academia, the hospital sector, the pharmaceutical industry and 
the World Health Organization; experts in public health, 
epidemiology, immunology, neurology and pharmacology—in 
response to the decision of the Minister of Health in France to 
temporarily suspend the school based immunization program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) There two hepatitis B vaccines available in Canada, both of 
which are recombinant products. This means that they consist of a 
non infectious subunit derived from the hepatitis B  surface 
antigen harvested and purified from cultures of a strain of 
yeast. Therefore, no blood products are used at any stage of the 
manufacturing process. Before the approval of these two vaccines 
in 1987 and 1990, human plasma was involved in the manufacturing 
of hepatitis B vaccine. Those “plasma-derived” vaccines have 
been discontinued with the availability of recombinant products 
and are no longer in use.

criminal investigations. Department of Justice counsel may 
provide advice and assistance to the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police, RCMP, and other police forces with respect to their

relevant sections of the department and the resources relied upon 
are those assigned to that particular function. Thus, it is not 
possible to provide figures on funds spent by the Department of 
Justice in relation to any particular RCMP investigation unless 
charges have been laid and the Attorney General of Canada has 
responsibility for the prosecution. In that instance, it might be 
possible to provide cost estimates for the prosecution. The 
budget for providing assistance to the RCMP in various contexts is 
allocated globally to units such as the International Assistance 
Group and it is not calculated by reference to individual cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the position of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police not to 
disclose the costs at this time as it would be harmful to the

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the debate progresses today, Reform MPs will be speaking one 
by one about the concerns of Canadians on a region by region 
basis beginning with the west.  We want to try to provide the 
Prime Minister with information firsthand which is much more 
detailed and valuable, and perhaps even more relevant than that 
which will be collected by his partisan task force, a task force 
which appears to be interested in receiving input only from 
persons or groups who can be identified as Liberal supporters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example of a meaningful message, I would like the House to 
consider for a moment a poll of residents in B.C. and Alberta 
which was completed by Mark Trend Research in late March.  The 
results of the poll provide some important contradictions to the 
claims made by the Prime Minister that he has been dealing with 
western concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is especially interesting to note that barely one in ten of 
the respondents had even heard of the Prime Minister's task 
force.  That is not surprising in light of the complete failure 
of the task force to publish an agenda or to even make public the 
venues for the meetings so that westerners can give their input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take as an example last week's activities of the task 
force, the chairman of the task force claimed in this House 
yesterday to have met with 60 individuals and organizations in 
Manitoba.  I have a copy of their agenda here. It is quite clear 
that it was designed to exclude the public who would more than 
likely have arrived at the meetings with tough messages 
embarrassing to the task force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agenda was obviously put together months ago.  It has been 
carefully constructed and it is entirely a set of meetings behind 
closed doors with special interest groups and Liberal Party 
hacks.  Mind you, the chairman could be a bit gun shy of public 
exposure. In light of his experience on a Canada-wide talk show 
in early February, I would not blame him for wanting to have his 
meetings behind closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In two hours of open radio talk show he did not receive a single 
call of support from anywhere in Canada, in an entire two hour 
talk show.  In fact, it was probably the hottest of public 
roastings experienced by any MP in a long time.  Callers 
predicted that the task force would be a complete waste of money 
and that the members would not listen anyway.  This prediction 
appeared to become a self-fulfilling prophecy as the talk show 
progressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia made comments 
like “We have to pursue what we think is in the national 
interest” and “I hope the passions diminish and westerners 
accept the legislation”.  He was talking about the ill-fated gun 
control bill, the Liberal gun control disaster.  His comments 
made it quite clear that he had no intention of listening to the 
input from law-abiding gun owners who are sick of being treated 
like criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another comment from the task force chairman on that talk show 
was in connection with the probably unconstitutional Nisga'a 
treaty that is being dealt with in B.C.  His answer to a request 
from one of the callers was “You know we don't believe in 
referendums”.  To say the least, this is a truly insensitive 
statement from someone who claims to be leading a group which in 
the Prime Minister's words has a mandate to travel throughout the 
west on a fact finding mission.  No wonder a caller to the show 
told the member that he is obviously deaf and needs a hearing 
aid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Mark Trend poll I mentioned earlier found that 65% 
of people in B.C. want a referendum on the Nisga'a treaty.  That 
is up from 60% three months ago and up from 48% in August 1998. 
The more people learn about the agreement, the less they want it. 
The fact is they do not want two arrogant governments, each 
elected with less than 38% of the popular vote, ramming down 
their throats a system of government which is 100% based on race 
and which is probably unconstitutional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the flight to Ottawa from Vancouver this week I sat alongside 
a B.C. businessman who had lived in South Africa for seven or 
eight years.  He told me, as have so many of my constituents who 
have lived in South Africa prior to coming to Canada, that the 
Nisga'a treaty does exactly what South Africa was told by the 
international community to abandon.  It sets up a government 
based on race, a system of apartheid and racism and homelands 
rather than a system of equality of peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Liberal Party of B.C. is against the Nisga'a treaty and 
has launched a court challenge against the unconstitutional 
delegation of powers contained in the agreement.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the member for Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia and his 
so-called task force are choosing to ignore the concerns of the 
people of B.C. and even what their own provincial counterparts 
are telling them.  Unfortunately, the callers to the radio talk 
show were correct when they said that the task force would be a 
flop.  They know that the vast majority of government members are 
simply trained seals who will vote the way they are told to vote 
by the Prime Minister regardless of the input they have received 
from the people in the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad commentary on our dysfunctional parliament that men 
and women who no doubt in their private lives are intelligent, 
thoughtful and reasonable people have no option but to vote the 
way they are told by the Prime Minister because otherwise he will 
not sign their nomination papers.  It prevents them from 
representing their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast, soon after westerners started the Reform Party, 
they included in the party constitution a provision which 
prevents a leader of the party from refusing to sign nomination 
papers.  In the Reform Party it is the executive council, a body 
elected from the members at large which decides whether or not a 
leader will sign a candidate's nomination papers.  Reform MPs are 
guaranteed the freedom to do what has to be done when it needs to 
be done in terms of voting freely in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is good because that Mark Trend poll I keep mentioning 
found that in both Alberta and B.C. more than 87% of the people 
want parliament reformed to establish free votes as the norm 
rather than the never.  They want their MPs to represent them, 
not a political master in an office on Parliament Hill. Until the 
task force comes to grips with that reality, we all know that the 
callers to CKNW's radio talk show were absolutely right that the 
task force is a big waste of money and resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely it might make the task force members feel all warm and 
fuzzy inside when they meet with their carefully chosen 
sympathetic supporters, but as Winnipeg <I>Sun</I> copy editor 
Mark Perry wrote back in January “If Chrétien and his Liberal 
flunkies really wanted to know what's on the minds of Western 
Canadians”— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Deputy Speaker:</b>  Order, please.  The hon. member knows he 
cannot refer to other hon. members by name, even when quoting 
from a document.  I would invite him to comply with the rules in 
that respect fully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ted White:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I thought you might stop me 
on that so I will start again.  The article states that if the 
Prime Minister “and his Liberal flunkies really wanted to know 
what is on the minds of western Canadians, they could start by 
unplugging their ears and listening to what those folks sitting 
across from them in the House of Commons have to say.  No, not 
the separatist Bloc Quebecois, the Reform Party”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Perry then went on to state that they would find out very 
quickly and pointedly why the west does not elect more Liberals, 
which is of course the real point of this wasteful junket. Mr. 
Perry also wrote that the member for Charleswood St. 
James—Assiniboia should know better than to be part of this 
sham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my time is running short already.  I am going to 
read out a typical list of western concerns.  It is a list that 
has only grown since the government was elected in 1993. With 
respect to a few of the items on the list, the government has 
engaged in a very expensive and lavish public relations exercise, 
feigning concern and pretending that they have actually done 
something about the issues but to all intents and purposes 
nothing has changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the items on the list is an overhaul of the Young 
Offenders Act.  That is a real overhaul, not the pathetic piece 
of fiddling while Rome burns that was recently introduced by the 
Minister of Justice. They want an end to the wheat board 
monopoly; a referendum on the Nisga'a template; prompt 
deportation of the tens of thousands of criminal refugee 
claimants in Canada and an end to refugee claims at the borders; 
action on judicial activism and a more transparent and public 
method for selecting judges; reform of the Senate; an end to the 
use of closure to limit parliamentary debates; and meaningful tax 
reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That poll I mentioned asked westerners what they thought would 
be a meaningful tax reduction.  Almost 87% said the tax 
reductions given by the minister were pitiful and that $2,500 to 
$3,000 per year was meaningful.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member referred to the fact that a number of Liberal 
backbenchers toured western Canada to seek out why people from 
that region of Canada were feeling somewhat alienated.  Could he 
share with the House what his constituents felt about this 
initiative in terms of having to send out a delegation of eastern 
backbenchers to find out what they were concerned about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ted White:</b>  Mr. Speaker, that is a really good 
question and I thank the member for it.  He is from British 
Columbia and he is well known as what we call a constituency rep. 
He cares for his constituents and their opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mark Trend poll I mentioned asked a question of whether or 
not people thought the Liberal task force would actually listen 
or make any difference.  Almost 70% thought it would not make the 
slightest bit of difference.  Therein we have an answer to part 
of his question.  People do not believe it will make any 
difference.  All it will do is meet with its own people, Liberal 
supporters, and not really listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judging by the telephone calls to the radio talk show I 
mentioned, many of which were from western Canada, they simply 
did not believe the member for Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia 
was listening at all to the concerns.  Caller after caller said 
“You are not listening, are you?  Will you please be quiet and 
listen to what I have to say?”  They repeated one after the 
other the same theme that the member really had not clicked to 
the need to listen to the constituents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, I want to say 
how happy I am to learn, from the remarks by my hon. colleague 
from North Vancouver, that in his second term as a member of 
this House he has realized that the west is neglected by the 
Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the first referendum in Quebec in 1980, we consulted the 
people to inform them that the Canadian government saw the 
province of Quebec as a region and that Quebecers were 
recognized by Ottawa only as taxpayers but that no services were 
being provided to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why in 1980 the then Premier of Quebec, René Lévesque, 
and, in 1995, Mr. Parizeau, told the people “We should be 
masters in our own house, we should manage our own affairs and 
stop being considered as a region by the government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted that today the Reform Party member in his 
speech is beginning to take a view similar to Quebec's position 
and that he realizes the Canadian government is doing nothing 
for the west.  While it may be doing nothing for the west 
now, it has not been doing anything for Quebec for a very long 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why one day Quebec will assuredly achieve sovereignty, 
or independence, and then it will govern itself with its own 
money, its own taxes and its own powers, and will no longer 
depend on the Canadian government. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ted White:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the 
question.  I would like him to know that in the 10 years since 
the Reform Party was formed we have always had a policy that the 
federal government should remove itself from using its spending 
powers in areas of provincial jurisdiction.  It has been an 
irritation to the west just as it has been to Quebec that this 
federal government interferes constantly in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He may also be aware that there has been quite a strong 
separatist movement in western Canada that has ebbed and flowed 
from time to time.  It even elected two members in Alberta at one 
stage.  In B.C. the support for western separation was measured 
as high as 17% to 18% at one point in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irritations he mentioned are certainly not limited to 
Quebec.  They are widespread throughout the country.  I hear 
comments from people in Ontario that they feel this place, 
Ottawa, interferes constantly in what should be left to the 
provincial government.

which I am very proud to undertake.  I want to tell the 
government that there are other areas in the country that are 
truly alienated.  I am sure that is why the Liberals do not have 
any seats in Nova Scotia.  It may be just dawning on them what 
the problem is.  I asked quite a few people in Nova Scotia what 
exactly was bothering them about being alienated from the Liberal 
government and I will give their responses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to clarify something for the geniuses across the 
way that they are bragging about a byelection they won last night 
in Windsor—St. Clair.  The Reform Party did not do well but the 
NDP just about took them out.  I might add that they did lose a 
considerable number of votes from the last election.  Not only 
that.  I would invite members opposite to come to my riding 
during a byelection any time and then come into the House and 
brag after it.  We will see where they go.  The Liberals do not 
win seats across the country.  We are trying to point out today 
that the Liberals have won seats in two regions of the country. 
That is where the Liberals primarily have votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other regions of the country are sick and tired of the way the 
country is governed.  Let me give some idea of the things I have 
heard in Nova Scotia.  I am sure some of my colleagues who 
represent that area will either agree or add more to the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why in the name of heaven are we sending this group of 
backbenchers and senators to one region of the country when there 
are all kinds of regions that are hurting and all kinds of 
regions that are sick and darned tired of what is opposite? I ask 
them to listen up, all five of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sable Gas is a project the people of Atlantic Canada, Nova 
Scotia in particular, have been watching for so long as one of 
the great hopes of the region.  One can understand that with the 
potential it has.  It continues to remain on the horizon.  The 
country was promised a November 1999 start-up of the project, and 
now they are talking about November 2000.  Who knows where it 
will go from there?  There are still no clear indications of the 
benefits when the contract is signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can recall in the House some time ago debating the issue of 
why the Liberals went to another province and said let us divert 
that natural gas pipeline north around Nova Scotia.  Nova 
Scotians and people all over Canada asked what they were doing. 
In fact I stood in the House and asked why they would not allow 
these people the production and the growth as Alberta did with 
its natural gas until they introduced the national energy 
program.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia is an area of great potential.  Yet the federal 
government did nothing but play games in that exercise.  It is 
not even visible in getting this project active today.  It kind 
of walked away from it when it did not serve its own benefit.  Do 
the people of Nova Scotia feel alienated by that?  Maybe the 
government better send some members down there to ask a few 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues and I met with families affected by the 
Devco situation.  There has been no direction from the 
government.  There has been no meaningful assistance and no 
acceptance of responsibility by the government.  Some shake their 
heads, but that is what is happening.  The government says that 
it is only the west that is alienated.  Give it a break. Get a 
life.  There is more to the country than one small region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no policy on what to do with Devco or what to do for 
the men and women, particularly the families in Cape Breton that 
are highly stressed.  Where are the Liberals today? How are they 
dealing with this situation?  The frustration is showing more and 
more with protesters, depression and suicides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government goes to Sydney, makes an announcement and walks 
away.  No responsible government does that under any 
circumstances.  Why do the people in Nova Scotia feel alienated? 
One problem is that the government does not ask why.  It just 
thinks it is a problem in the west because the Reform Party is 
sitting here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about shipbuilding in Nova Scotia.  The Marine 
Workers Federation had an excellent suggestion.  Where was the 
government when that suggestion was made?  Nowhere.  It was not 
even supportive of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the issue?  I know a number of people who have worked in 
the marine industry for 20 or more years.  Why not build some 
ships?  There is the capacity in the shipyards in Halifax.  The 
dedication is there.  Canada has low costs in terms of the 
international value of the Canadian dollar.  Holland is producing 
at a higher cost.  Why can we not do it here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question from the government would be why do we have to 
build ships anyway.  It does not understand that one potential 
market is the coastal tanker fleet which is 25 to 30-plus years 
old.  It must be renewed by 2004 to meet environmental standards. 
Many of the necessary tax acts and other incentives are already 
in place.  With a little policy direction there could be half a 
billion dollars worth of work at approximately $30 million per 
vessel.  Where is the government promoting that kind of thing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a saying that a government that robs Peter to pay Paul 
can always depend on the support of Paul.  Is it the government's 
intention to rob Peter to pay Paul and to make sure that the 
Pauls are always in place rather than look at some initiatives 
that might help a region?  Talk about regional alienation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk all day about the tar ponds in Sydney.  I will be 
there on Thursday looking at them again.  It is one of the 
biggest open sewers in the world.  After $50 million plus were 
spent on it nothing has been done.  There has been study after 
study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals walked in, threw some bucks at it, walked out and 
said the problem was solved.  It has not been solved.  It has 
been going on for decades and decades.  For the last 12 years the 
government has been throwing money at it in a big way.  People 
are still living in front of a major sewer which is unacceptable 
anywhere in North America.  Except this government accepts it in 
Sydney.  It is incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about the gun law.  Nova Scotia among other places 
is appalled at what is going on with the famous gun law the 
government brought in to prevent murder by gun.  What did we 
recently see in Ottawa?  Murders by guns.  Has it stopped it? No. 
Steve Gullon in Nova Scotia can tell us.  He cannot live off his 
business any more.  It is dying because of the cost and the 
exorbitant administration rates.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Deputy Speaker:</b>  The Secretary of State for Parks

knows it is contrary to the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Randy White:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Not only is it improper, but there are only three members on the 
other side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Deputy Speaker:</b>  The hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford knows that is not a point of order.  He is 
only compounding the difficulties of the Chair.  The Chair is 
trying to ensure orderly debate in the House and I know that the 
hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford, as House leader for the 
official opposition, would want to assist in every respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</b> Mr. Speaker, so as not to make your 
job more difficult, I will refrain from making such comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that this particular debate would take place 
the day after at least some Canadians spoke directly to the role 
of how the various parties are doing here in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to note in the byelection results in 
Windsor—St. Clair that a Liberal was returned to the House.  It 
was interesting to note that the Reform Party got a little over 
6% of the vote, certainly under 10% of the vote, and actually saw 
its percentage decline, which is interesting to put in the 
context of the debate that is taking place today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question has to do with the comments of the two initial

views of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Some hon. members:</b>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</b>  Mr. Speaker, members opposite are 
chuckling because they think they are the only ones who know how 
to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make it clear that what the Reform Party is criticizing 
is an effort by parliamentarians to understand what Canadians are 
thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the opposition House leader is, why does the 
Reform Party not support efforts to talk to Canadians to ask them 
what their perspective is?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that since it is not the Reform Party doing it 
Reformers are somewhat embarrassed that they are left flat-footed 
because they have not gone out and asked their folks what they 
think, but the Liberals have indeed done that.  I want to know 
why they have not gone out to consult with their constituents. 
Why they have left it to the Liberals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Randy White:</b>  Mr. Speaker, the Liberals do not 
understand that in the last election 62% of Canadians voted 
against them.  How does the member figure that?  It would be an 
awful lot more important if the few Liberals here would 
understand that what we want to talk about today is not what they 
are doing but what they are not doing in all regions of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His question was why we would be concerned about the Liberals 
going to the west asking about what is alienating westerners.  If 
it were truly a practical good exercise with the intention of 
finding out what alienates westerners, we would be all for it. 
But the fact is that this is a clandestine exercise by a 
committee that announces its itinerary a week after it shows up, 
gets absolutely no press in Winnipeg and talks behind closed 
doors with people.  It is a fact that it is on a search for 
candidates for the next election.  As well it bellyaches about 
parties opposite meeting behind closed doors.  I hardly think 
this committee is really looking to find out why westerners are 
alienated.  I think it is really there for other exercises, and 
it is not doing a very good job at that.  I would encourage those 
committee members to try to be more realistic.  If they think 
westerners cannot see through this they are kidding themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the other opposition parties are hoping that if the 
committee is coming to their area it would at least notify them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</b>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
very important that all members of parliament, on a consistent 
basis, be judicious in their comments relative to other regions. 
During a previous debate on issues facing Atlantic Canada I was 
offended as an Atlantic Canadian when I heard a member say that 
the smallest violin in the world plays for Atlantic Canada.  That 
member was mocking the efforts of Atlantic Canadians to bootstrap 
themselves into prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to comment on that, given that it 
was a member of his party, the member for Calgary West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Randy White:</b>  Mr. Speaker, we are going to hear a bit 
about this today.  There is some shyness and concern from the PCs 
who are a little concerned about us bringing up regional 
interests, in particular in their area.  We should watch for the 
kinds of suggestions and improvements they have for their own 
area.  It is unfortunate that they act this way, but that is just 
the way it is going to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about is not a matter of party politics. 
Maybe some day when the PCs grow up they will get to be the 
official opposition, but it is going to be a long time.  I would 
encourage them to listen to the issues and to respond in kind to 
the real problems in this country.

Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the official opposition's 
motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night, as I was putting down some thoughts with respect to 
today's address, I was in a restaurant and a number of people 
came over and asked what I was doing.  I showed them the motion. 
I asked them what they thought of it.  The first person said “I 
really don't understand it”.  Another two people said that it 
seemed rather silly.  Another person said “It makes no sense”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having already heard from these people, I recognized some 
others, so I went to them.  The truth of the matter is that 
another two said it was a silly motion and another two said that 
it made no sense that the government should rename the Liberal 
committee on western alienation to the Liberal alienation 
committee.  Even the most literate could not understand what that 
meant.  Reformers did not even have the courtesy of having the 
formal title.  They probably could not find it, or perhaps they 
could not understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of issues that could have been raised in debate. 
We could have talked about building a stronger, more united 
Canada.  We could have talked about increasing Canada's economic 
performance.  We could have talked about Kosovo, the genocide 
that is occurring there and what it is that we might do to lessen 
the atrocities.  What did they do?  They picked a silly motion 
that does not make any sense to anyone.  They are playing 
politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would they be doing that?  They are a little nervous because 
they have pockets of support.  They say that this could be 
useful.  This might work.  Therefore let us get in there, let us 
be dysfunctional, let us be negative, let us do whatever we can 
to torpedo it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are they waiting to see the report so they can look at it and 
then perhaps address substantive issues and solutions that will 
be identified in it?  Of course not.  That would be logical. 
That would be a professional approach.  Of course they are not 
going to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I participated for two days on the task force.  I met with the 
mayor and councillors of the city of Winnipeg.  It was an 
excellent meeting.  We met with the Manitoba Chamber of Commerce. 
We met with la Chambre de commerce francophone du Manitoba and it 
was an excellent meeting.  There was a meeting with the Brandon 
mayor and his council, which was an excellent meeting.  I also 
attended a meeting of reeves and councillors from southeastern 
Manitoba.  Guess what?  It was an excellent meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were they friends of the government?  No.  They were responsible 
citizens, identifying issues and making concrete proposals for 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the way in which this has started and in view of this 
particular motion, perhaps the Reform Party ought to consider 
renaming itself the silly party of Canada, or perhaps the “we 
never made sense and will never make sense party of Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example of the lack of respect they have for 
their colleagues.  This morning “flunkies” was used with 
respect to government members.  They referred to MPs from eastern 
Canada as lackeys and trained seals, as if they had no role to 
play on such a task force.  They also referred to senators 
without the least bit of respect, as if they were men and women 
who had no knowledge of the country, who could not make a 
contribution.  I find that shocking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>An hon. member:</b>  Reprehensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</b>  It is reprehensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good news is that they are not all like that.  I will share 
what one Reform member said.  He no doubt recognizes the fallacy 
of the Reform Party's motion this morning.  Here is a quote found 
in two publications which was made by the member for Athabasca. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has made the provision of information one 
of the cornerstones of its effort to assist Canadian small and 
medium-sized enterprises....no matter where you live in western 
Canada, Western Economic Diversification, in partnership with 
other business service organizations, is your local link to a 
world of business resources. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the member for Athabasca had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another MP from the Reform Party, one of the more enlightened 
ones, who sees more than what they see thank goodness, who 
responds to materials made available to him so that he can share 
them with his constituents, said “It will be my pleasure to 
share this information with my constituency”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has a platform.  It would like to remove the 
economic development agencies, but it has not said what it would 
replace them with. 
It has not given an indication of how it would undertake economic 
development.  Absolutely none.  This is the party that would 
reduce equalization payments without having any clue whatsoever 
of the impact it would have on the provinces that are in fact 
receiving that kind of assistance.

diversification. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

this agency's presence in western Canada. Before doing this, I 
want to talk about, or at least briefly mention, the other 
agencies. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Atlantic provinces we have ACOA.  While there are 
similarities to western economic diversification, there are 
differences and there need to be differences.  If we are to 
listen to the people from those regions, we need programs that 
respond to their unique needs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, there is also the Economic Development Agency of 
Canada for the Regions of Quebec. Here again, there are some 
similarities with other economic development agencies. Of 
course, there are some programs that have been tailored to meet 
the specific needs of Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>FedNor, an agency that operates in Northern Ontario, is similar 
in many respects to the other economic development agencies. 
Programs are in place to meet the special needs of this region. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the mandate of western economic 
diversification.  It is to diversify the economies of the western 
provinces.  What does that mean?  We all know that traditionally 
we have made a good living.  We have done very well based upon 
the natural resources that we have had, an abundance of natural 
resources in a number of sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also recognize that we are in a different world today.  We 
are in a knowledge based society which requires a knowledge based 
economy.  What does that mean?  That means getting more from what 
we have by applying the knowledge we have in the mining sectors, 
the forestry sectors, the agricultural sectors and the fishing 
sectors.  That is what it really means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people have businesses that are doing well, can they do more 
with those businesses?  Can they create more jobs? If they have 
an idea for a new business, can they in fact launch that business 
successfully and create more jobs for western Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House believe that a strong western 
Canada, like strong Atlantic provinces, like a strong Quebec, 
like a strong Ontario, like strong northern territories, is good 
for Canada.  It makes for a stronger nation.  That is what we are 
all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is western economic diversification in the Government of 
Canada?  It is headquartered in Edmonton, headed by a deputy 
minister from Edmonton, an outstanding public servant with an 
outstanding staff for each of the provinces, committed to western 
Canadians, committed to being advocates for western Canadian 
issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just where I come from in the west.  I spoke on some 
serious issues that I was made aware of in Nova Scotia.  They 
were the port of Halifax, the tar ponds, shipbuilding, Devco and 
Sable Gas.  All these issues are facing the federal government 
and it could do more.  I am sure the people down there do not 
take kindly to the words that it is a waste of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had hoped to get from the government not that it was a waste 
of time on regional issues but that we could do more and this is 
what we should do.  It is truly unfortunate that it has taken 
this stance.  I hope it can do more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member do one thing at least?  Would he stand 
here and commit on behalf of the committee he says he is on that 
it would table in the House today the itinerary, the agenda it 
has for the rest of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia would like 
to know where and when these folks will be showing up.  He talked 
about having meetings with chambers of commerce and other 
organizations.  The vast majority of people in those areas do not 
know those meetings are occurring.  Behind closed door meetings, 
quiet meetings or unannounced meetings do not get adequate public 
input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</b>  Madam Speaker, I will respond to 
my colleague's questions.  First, I did not say it was a waste of 
time.  I said that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Randy White:</b>  Yes, you did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</b>  No, I did not.  I said people 
said it was silly.  People said it made no sense.  My hon. 
colleague knows that it is nothing but petty politics he is 
trying to play.  He is trying to embarrass the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he had wanted he could have given me an extra 10 minutes to 
talk about our partners in the women's enterprise centres, to 
talk about the 90 community futures development corporations we 
have in western Canada, and to talk about the 81 Canada-Manitoba 
and other provincial business centres that help businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could have permitted us to talk about businesses with which 
we work, businesses to which we provide information and 
businesses which we assist by finding funding and information on 
internal markets and export markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could have permitted me to talk about aboriginal peoples and 
the way in which we are trying to integrate them more fully into 
Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could have permitted me to talk about the youth programs we 
have because we recognize that they are important.  He could have 
encouraged me— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Nelson Riis:</b>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The rules of the House are well known, particularly to my 
hon. friend who is an experienced member.  The first round is 10 
minutes with 5 minutes for questions and comments.  It seems to 
me that he is simply bootlegging in parts of his speech that he 
was hoping to make within 20 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</b>  What is your point? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Nelson Riis:</b>  My point is— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</b>  The hon. secretary of 
state still has two minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</b>  Madam Speaker, I would like to 
know what his point is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to point out that western economic diversification, 
with other government departments, has responded to the needs of 
western Canadians such as those in rural areas and francophones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not want to hear about that.  We have been involved with 
the fishing communities that were devastated in western Canada 
and with the people affected by the floods.  We have had a number 
of initiatives in science and technology and invested major 
dollars in western Canada.  Why?  Because western Canadians are 
competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that hon. members opposite cannot see what the 
government has done?  Why is it that their only ability is to try 
to identify issues about which they know very little and to try 
to inflame the passions of western Canadians against other 
regions of the country?  I cannot understand that logic.  That is 
petty politics.  That is unacceptable.  Frankly I am ashamed of 
that behaviour.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</b> Madam Speaker, it is my 
turn to speak on this opposition day motion by the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to divide the motion into two parts.  The first 
part of the motion condemns the government's failure to address 
the concerns of the regions of Canada. In Quebec, our region, 
this failure is only too clear.  Our presence here is vivid 
proof that Quebeckers are deeply dissatisfied with this 
government and the federal system that governs them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the motion, on what should be done to remedy 
the situation, is a proposal that the government rename the 
Liberal committee on western alienation the Liberal alienation 
committee.  Even if this proposal might be considered justified, 
it seems to me that somewhat better wording could have been 
found to condemn the government's action and suggest to it 
possible courses of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shall concentrate on the first part of the motion, condemning 
the government's failure—I would say historic failure—to address 
the concerns of many of its citizens, and in our case, 
Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shall not go over all the constitutional negotiations that 
have been the subject of dispute and the failure by the federal 
government to respond to Quebec's demands. There have been many 
such negotiations, particularly in the past 30 years, and they 
have one thing in common: regardless of who was negotiating—the 
federal Liberal or Conservative Party, a Quebec Liberal or Parti 
Quebecois government—the result has always been the same: 
failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be tempting to lay this failure at individuals' 
doorsteps, but that would not hide the fact that there is a 
profound problem: an inability to live together or find rules 
that can govern all of us within a single system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Efforts to this end have always been based on the concept of 
Quebec as a province.  From the federal government's point of 
view, the provinces must have a certain character. 
Though the government is reluctant to say that it sees them as 
all equal, it does have a very strong tendency to say that it 
has to avoid special treatment for certain provinces. This has 
prevented agreements being reached that would have led to an 
asymmetrical model, more particularly for Quebec, giving it a 
different constitutional status from the other provinces.  The 
Canadian government has always been too frightened of the 
reaction from other regions of Canada and too frightened as well 
that the whole thing would become unmanageable, although it is 
already extremely difficult to manage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To come down to brass tacks, this is causing a considerable 
number of day to day problems for ordinary citizens.  I am going 
to indicate some of these.  I will not expand on my examples 
right now, I will return to them, but I am thinking of the 
millennium scholarships. 
There are also secretaries of state for various economic 
development agencies, for example Canada has a regional 
development agency for Quebec, while Quebec has its own regional 
development sttructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gives rise to a sizeable number of concrete problems.  It 
is hard to co-ordinate the work in the field, because the federal 
government wants to be visible more than it wants to be useful. 
This causes problems of slowness and inefficiency in the system, 
when it comes to meeting people's needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary underlying problem in all these negotiations, in 
Quebec's case, is that it is difficult to reach an agreement 
with someone who represents an entity whose existence one 
refuses to recognize.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are told there is no such thing as Quebec culture, as 
the Prime Minister said, when one refuses to recognize the fact 
that Quebeckers are a people, it is very difficult, when it 
comes to negotiating with someone who refuses to recognize our 
very existence, to find a basis for understanding. This in turn 
creates a number of problems. The basic problem in relations 
between Quebec and Canada has always been at this level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though people believe we talk too much about it, we do not 
stress it often enough. When it comes to the Constitution that 
currently governs Canada and contains the fundamental rules 
according to which people are living together, it is now 
shameful to talk about it. 
Are there many other countries that are ashamed to talk about 
their constitution, which should be a fundamental principle and 
something accepted by the citizens as a whole? There is 
something wrong when a country is ashamed of its constitution. 
Why is it wrong? Let us not forget what happened during the 
patriation of the constitution which governs us currently. One 
player did not sign, and this player is Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know a few people will say “Yes, but separatists will never 
sign anything”. They should remember that for nine years there 
was a federalist government in Quebec. Even the main federalist 
party, the Quebec Liberal Party, does not intend to sign the 
Constitution as it stands today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not seem to worry too many people. On the contrary, 
the federal government is forging ahead with administrative 
framework agreements, such as the one on social union, to 
further centralize decision making in Canada. This is along the 
same line. It could not care less that one of its components, 
which it sees as a major, beneficial, essential part of Canada, 
did not sign the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to specific examples, such as culture. If there 
is one thing that sets Quebeckers apart, it is of course their 
cultural characteristics. 
The Government of Quebec is rightly claiming, and in practice 
now, the ability to represent itself internationally.  The 
Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Prime Minister reacted 
hysterically to its doing so and to its promoting its unique 
qualities internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can these people not understand even such basic things as 
these?  They are, however, the very people who, with meaningless 
resolutions, would have us believe they recognize the vaguely 
distinct character of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will not agree to our promoting even the most obvious 
elements of our distinctiveness.  This is a cultural element. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also our ability to do things differently.  The 
Government of Quebec has made decisions regarding the education 
system in order to give students better access to post-secondary 
education, saying “We must have more graduates, therefore we 
will lower fees as much as possible”.  Our policy on tuition 
fees is very different from that of Canada.  They are much 
lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Outside Quebec, tuition fees are very high, less than in the 
United States, but still a lot higher than in Quebec. 
Obviously, that creates a debt problem that is heightened when 
students have difficulty finding a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand there is a problem and a need that is greater in 
Canada than in Quebec. 
The government creates a scholarships program for students and 
says “We will help them, we will reward excellence. There has 
been this whole debate on elitism. Therefore, we will back off a 
bit. We will go back to the issue of financial need and help 
students in this way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the government came up with a coast to coast program. Yet, 
needs are not the same everywhere. If we could have control over 
that money, our priority might be to provide tools that could 
benefit all students, because in Quebec the primary issue is not 
students' indebtedness, as is the case in the other provinces. 
For example, we might use that money to modernize the 
technological equipment used in our CEGEPs and universities. In 
this communications era, this might be a greater priority than 
scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, these choices cannot be made because, with its taxation 
power, with its huge power to collect revenues, the federal 
government dictates its decisions, or uses the tax system to do 
so, thus setting priorities that are not necessarily the same as 
our own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because it is incapable of getting along with the Government of 
Quebec, the federal government does not even want to come to the 
negotiation table. Instead, it gave that mandate to a private 
foundation run by BCE's president, and told him “We are sending 
you $2.5 billion. In addition, you will get two year's interest 
before starting to deal with issues. You will settle them by 
negotiating with the government”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very big accountability problem there, but they are 
washing their hands of the whole thing by hiding behind a 
foundation.  That is a problem.  In the meantime, our 
educational system cannot define priorities as quickly as it 
needs to be able to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec held a summit conference on 
priorities in postsecondary education.  But the federal 
government does not see this as important.  One morning, the 
Prime Minister had a bright idea and told the House that that 
was the priority because he believes that Canada has a role to 
play in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the few minutes I have left, I want to look briefly at 
regional development.  It is the same thing. 
Our RCM in Témiscamingue has managed to develop a genuine single 
window approach.  Higher levels of government having had 
difficulty reaching agreement, we created a single window with 
one board of directors for the federal, provincial and municipal 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who barged in?  The federal government.  Having lost its 
visibility in such a structure, it made us dismantle it.  Now, 
we are going back to two boards, two directors general and, in 
the long term, two different development visions.  Locally, it 
was a success, but because the federal government had lost its 
visibility, it decided to make us go back to the earlier system. 
This is not conducive to economic development.  This agency 
should be called Propaganda Canada, not Economic Development 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government takes the attitude that Quebeckers do not know 
how good they have it and should be shown.  But our presence in 
the House, and the presence of others who are not satisfied with 
this system, shows that there are serious problems that the 
members opposite have historically been unable to resolve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</b>  Madam Speaker, I have 
listened with a great deal of interest to the words of my 
colleague.  I believe he is absolutely right.  There are 
particularities to the west as there are to Quebec, but I 
believe the Liberal government would be well advised to announce 
its intentions when it is travelling in the regions, 
particularly in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an anecdote to relate in this connection.  Over Easter, a 
minister decided to come to the Charlevoix region, one of the 
loveliest regions of Quebec.  Did he come to the casino, or to 
visit his relatives?  Of course, in order to justify his travel 
allowance, the minister had to meet the press, or a mayor, or 
visit an arts centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He ought to have given the MP for Charlevoix a call to say “I 
would like to consult your area of the riding, I would like to 
meet with local unemployed people in order to see whether the 
$27.3 million in cuts in Charlevoix are doing much harm. 
I would like to meet the people of Charlevoix in order to see 
whether they are frustrated by our unkept promises made in 1997. 
I would like to meet the people of Charlevoix to see what 
effects our transfer payments to the provinces have had on 
health and education”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked to have got a group of women together so that 
they could tell him how the President of Treasury Board is 
refusing to give public servants pay equity.  I would have liked 
to have got a group of young people together to tell him how the 
federal government is refusing to withdraw from collective 
agreements the orphan clause which penalizes very young workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But no.  When ministers travel to the regions, they do so solely 
to raise their profile.  We have seen that the problem is the 
same in the west, as the Reform Party pointed out this morning. 
Quebec is recognized as a region.  I believe that Quebec has 
been calling for that right for some years now. The Bloc 
Quebecois has been doing so in the House of Commons since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem of duplication and overlap, and I would like 
the hon. member for Témiscamingue to give us some other 
examples. He has already mentioned the millennium scholarships, 
to demonstrate that the Government of Quebec is acknowledged by 
the Canadian government as a region, as a kind of board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Pierre Brien:</b> Madam Speaker, I do not have a lot of time 
left, but we could have talked, for example, about the 
environment of pulp and paper companies or others that have both 
the federal and the provincial standards.  Sometimes the higher 
standards are federal and sometimes they are Quebec's.  If a 
criminal offence is involved, the weight is in favour of the 
federal standard.  Conversely, if it is a civil matter, the 
weight is in favour of the provincial standard.  It is a total 
administrative mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as regards what my colleague from Charlevoix was saying 
recently, a well-intentioned individual working for the federal 
government at home with the Department of Human Resources 
Development said to the stakeholders “The regional office 
analyzes that”.  I knew that by “regional office” she meant 
Montreal. 
But the people in my region, when they heard “regional office” 
understood it was managed in Rouyn-Noranda, because that is where 
the regional office is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So at one point I spoke up and said “We will clarify one thing. 
In Ottawa, when you say 'region', you mean Quebec entirely.  If 
you say Abitibi—Témiscamingue, you are referring to—”  I would not 
even use an adjective for fear of having it used against me. 
For us, Abitibi-Témiscamingue is our region.  We would like the 
government to think this way.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What sets us apart is the number of mines we have.  There were 
tax incentives, which still exist, but have been cut 
considerably by the federal government, which led to a lot of 
exploration.  Northern Quebec still has extraordinary potential 
for mining exploration, but the reduction in the worth of 
natural resources, particularly metals, and the Bre-X crisis and 
other incidents, have discouraged exploration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the federal government did not restore that 
program in its original form was very prejudicial to our region. 
When that flow-through shares program was at its peak, 
unemployment in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region was at 7%. 
However, from the federal government's perspective, a tax 
measure that applies to just one region of Quebec clearly does 
not have enough of an impact to justify an extended program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unfortunate because that initiative was specifically 
targeted to the needs of our region. I could list many more that 
do not specifically meet regional needs. It is not the economic 
development agencies, which often do promotional work, that 
identify these needs. These agencies exist primarily to sell 
Ottawa to people in the regions, not to take regional issues and 
get the federal government to do something about them. 
There may exceptions, but this is how it works in my region.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</b>  Madam Speaker, I must say I always welcome the 
opportunity to talk about topics such as why those of us who 
represent the regions sometimes feel alienated from the central 
part of the country and why there are concerns in the regions of 
Canada. I say this today with a certain discomfort in light of 
the events that have surrounded us.  We are in a state of war. We 
are in an offensive operation against a sovereign nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The news reports this morning are of Serb infantry troops 
crossing into Albania and seizing Kamenica, a village in northern 
Albania.  There seems to be an expansion of the war. There are 
topics we could talk about in terms of welcoming refugees in 
particular those with family connections here in Canada and the 
use of spent plutonium on the bullets of weapons from certain 
countries.  We could talk about a whole number of items, but 
today we are talking about alienation particularly from a western 
perspective.  Therefore my comments will focus obviously on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a school of history which is called the heartland 
hinterland school.  It is where we try to describe what goes on 
in our country in terms of recognizing that the heartland of 
Canada is mainly parts of Ontario and Quebec and the rest is a 
hinterland and the relationship between the heartland and the 
hinterland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important when talking about the alienation of regions to 
recognize that we are talking about western Canada, British 
Columbia, Yukon, the north, Atlantic Canada.  But there is also 
northern Ontario, the Gaspé and other regions which feel very 
alienated from the centre, meaning the central triangle in 
Ontario and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question there are serious problems in the regions 
of Canada.  One of the reasons I suspect these concerns and 
problems go unaddressed in any serious way is the result of 
simple demographics.  There are more MPs in the city of Toronto 
than in all of British Columbia. That tells a bit of the tale. 
When we look at representation by population the vast majority of 
Canadians are focused in central Canada, their representatives 
are from central Canada.  The regions are a long way away in 
geographic terms. I suspect they are a longer way away 
psychologically also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a representative from western Canada, in particular British 
Columbia I want to toss out a challenge to my Liberal colleagues 
across the way.  Over the years there have been shared programs 
between the federal and provincial governments. Recognizing that 
British Columbia has a little over 12% of the population of 
Canada, I have yet to determine a single shared program where 
British Columbia gets 12% of the benefits.  There is not a single 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to be contradicted.  Therefore I am challenging my 
Liberal friends opposite to identify for me a single program over 
the last 20 years where British Columbians have simply received 
their fair share.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want more than our fair share.  We do not want an 
excess.  If we have 12% of the population and highway funds, for 
example, are being divvied up, we should get 12% of the funds. 
What do we get?  Nothing, absolutely zip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the money the federal government collects from 
gasoline taxes and where it invests that money in highways, is a 
single cent invested in western Canada?  No, not a single cent. 
Is it any wonder western Canadians feel somewhat alienated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about the north, about Yukon.  Yukon has been 
dealt devastating blows by the federal government.  It lost its 
weather station.  This is a part of the world where the weather 
is crucial but the weather station is gone.  It is the one part 
of Canada where the stay in school program has been most 
successful, but it has been yanked out of the territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been major cuts in crucial health programs 
particularly for aboriginal peoples.  Then there is the 
privatization of the airport which has a particular impact in the 
north.  Those of us who travel and use airlines have to pay a 
certain fee in some airports.  In Whitehorse a fee for cargo has 
to be paid as well.  As a result of the fee that is added on in 
terms of this airport user fee there is a huge extra cost for 
bread and milk in remote communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and talk about the Devco fiasco in Nova Scotia, 
the Sable Gas disaster or the shipyards on the east and west 
coasts that are crying for work.  The unions come forward with 
very complicated, complex and thoughtful programs in terms of how 
to develop our east and west coast shipbuilding industries and 
are virtually ignored by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To someone from British Columbia one thing symbolizes the 
frustration we feel.  It is fair to say that as we have attempted 
to diversify away from the resource based industries that are 
known to have built British Columbia, we have been developing the 
film industry.  We now have the largest film industry in Canada. 
Yet when we look at the number of dollars the federal government 
invests in the film industry in British Columbia compared with 
Ontario and Quebec, it is infinitesimal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is a significant effort to diversify away from the 
resource based economy, is there any serious help from the 
federal government?  The answer is no.  I am not here to say that 
there is no help, that there is absolutely nothing, but it is 
pretty close to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economy of that region of Canada to a large extent is based 
on the resource sector, on agriculture, mining, forestry and the 
fishery.  Members should come to British Columbia and have a look 
at the fishery industry.  A disaster is unfolding.  Granted, the 
federal government has come up with a few dollars to help out but 
not very much.  Whole sections of the British Columbia coast are 
absolutely devastated economically because of lack of support for 
the west coast fishery.  I do not even have to talk about the 
east coast fishery because we know what has happened there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could look at agriculture, the struggling sector in all 
regions of Canada, and see where the federal government is taking 
us in terms of support.  It is relatively abysmal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mining has been essentially abandoned.  We could consider the 
importance of mining for the north, for British Columbia, for the 
northern parts of the prairies, for northern Ontario, and for the 
regions of Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland. 
It is a critical sector that has by and large been bypassed by 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it is not terribly romantic.  The romance now is in the 
high tech sector, the information technology sector and so on. 
That is where the investments are being made.  Not surprisingly 
those operations are by and large located in central Canada, 
again to the abandonment of those of us from the regions of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that the issue of water diversion concerns 
us.  Water diversion and the sale of freshwater are probably not 
huge issues in downtown Toronto or downtown Montreal, although 
they are probably issues with some people.  For those of us who 
represent the regions of Canada they are major issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little while ago a motion was passed in the House which called 
for an immediate moratorium that the government should announce 
on freshwater exports to the United States and northern Mexico 
eventually. 
It also called for the government to bring in policy as quickly 
as possible to safeguard that very crucial resource for the 
future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We passed that motion unanimously.  That should send a pretty 
clear signal to the government that the House of Commons, 
representing every part of Canada, wanted action immediately on 
the preservation of Canada's freshwater resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the government do the next day?  It went to the United 
States and asked the Americans what they thought about it and 
what they suggested it do in terms of our freshwater.  From where 
did that initiative arise?  Who suggested that we go to the 
Americans and ask what they thought about exporting water, 
diverting rivers into the United States, and that sort of thing? 
That is where we are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge my Liberal friends across the way to identify for 
those of us in the opposition parties a single program where 
British Columbia gets its fair share, one program where British 
Columbia which represents 12% of the population of Canada gets 
12% of the action.  I see the minister from British Columbia is 
here.  I know he will be standing in a moment or two to list 
those particular programs.  I look forward to those comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would gladly yield to a Liberal colleague answering my friend's 
question.  None rose to their feet, so I will do my best to fill 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know for a fact that there are no programs that give British 
Columbians their fair share, even though they contribute more 
than their fair share in terms of revenue to the federal 
government.  The same applies to my home province of Alberta.  I 
think that is why people in the west in particular, but in all 
regions of the country, find good reasons to feel alienated from 
the federal government and from central Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend touched on the important issue of the government's 
lack of respect for democracy.  We saw that in the water debate 
and again more recently.  On many occasions in this place we have 
seen the Liberal government whip its majority into place to vote 
against a particular bill.  We must remember that the Liberal 
Party has 101 seats of the 103 seats in Ontario, or at least most 
of them.  There are only two provinces in the whole country in 
which is has majorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if one of the big reasons people feel alienated is that 
they do not see Liberal backbenchers standing up and representing 
points of view that are held strongly across the rest of the 
country.  Would my friend care to comment on that and on the 
whole idea of the democratic institution of parliament being 
fundamentally broken and not working well to reflect the 
interests of the rest of the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Nelson Riis:</b>  Madam Speaker, perhaps I can use an 
example to respond to my hon. friend.  A little while back there 
was a byelection in Port Moody, British Columbia.  The individual 
elected used to be mayor of the community of Coquitlam.  During 
the election campaign he said he would come down to that town and 
raise hell.  He would speak up for British Columbia.  He would be 
on the floor of the House of Commons and even speak out against 
the government if he had to.  He said that time and time again 
during the campaign.  People listened to him, believed him and 
elected him.  I ask members if they have ever heard this hon. 
member speak in the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>An hon. member:</b>  Lou who? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Nelson Riis:</b>  I hear somebody saying “Lou who?”  To 
be fair, he may have spoken but the reality is he has sat in the 
back row and has not said a single thing on a single issue 
publicly about British Columbia.  That is why British Columbians 
feel short-changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the Liberals have put together this little 
travelling road show to go about western Canada unannounced 
seeking the reasons for grievances is another abuse of this 
institution.  We have representatives from western Canada here 
that well know the concerns.  They could easily be sought out in 
terms of advice.  Instead of using parliament as a tool, they 
twist the partisan part of this place and send out a group of 
Liberal backbenchers and Liberal senators.  If there is one thing 
that will alienate western Canadians it is that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from my own riding that the Liberals sent out a certain 
individual.  I will not name the person, but when she arrived in 
Kamloops I can tell the House the response she received.  I can 
tell the House how people feel about it.  They had an elected 
representative from British Columbia, an elected representative 
from Kamloops.  They wondered why somebody from Ontario was being 
sent out there to find out their views when their representative 
could have been asked about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She goes out there regularly.  I do not know who she talks to 
but she talks to a few folks.  I know what people are saying on 
the street about these visits.  I suspect it is the same as they 
are saying about the delegation that visits certain parts of 
western Canada in secret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reason there is a feeling of alienation.  We elect 
people and then the government ignores the individuals concerned. 
We elect individuals and they are completely ignored by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say with reluctance that its arrogance will grow and grow so 
that in another two years from now it will be almost intolerable. 
The level of arrogance will be almost intolerable as we move 
toward the next election.  It seems to be a pattern that develops 
in this place.  That arrogance is reflected in the fact that when 
the government wants to know what is going on in British Columbia 
it sends out a group of senators and Liberal backbenchers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</b>  Madam Speaker, 
normally when I rise to debate an issue in the House I start my 
debate by saying that I am very proud and very pleased to stand 
to debate a particular issue.  Unfortunately I cannot say that at 
this time because quite frankly I find that the motion put before 
us by the Reform Party is basically taking up very valuable time 
of the House.  The motion is totally partisan and quite frankly 
an opportunity, I suspect, to put forward a face that is kinder 
and gentler for the Reform Party.  Perhaps the Reform Party has 
too many supply days if it has to go this level to put forward 
important issues to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken in the House on numerous issues from the hepatitis 
C situation that we found the Liberals ignoring to health care. I 
have spoken to the budget, which I was very pleased to do.  I 
have spoken with respect to defence issues, very important issues 
that resonate out there in our country today and are very 
important to Canadians in general.  I cannot put this motion in 
with the other issues we have debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I say, I am always proud to be a representative of the 
constituency of Brandon—Souris in the House.  I must say that 
speaking to this motion does not instil a lot of pride in myself. 
Certainly it should not instil a lot of pride in the people who 
put forward the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in the House a very important debate took place, a 
debate of great significance to Canadians, the Canadian military 
and our responsibility with respect to NATO.  The Reform Party 
and the leader of the Reform Party justifiably took offence to 
the fact that we as members of parliament did not have the 
opportunity to vote and make our mark or have the ability to come 
forward and suggest that what the government was doing was right 
or wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the Reform Party would have been much better served if 
it had put forward that motion today and if the Reform Party 
leader had some conviction as to whether he wished to have that 
vote on the floor of the House.  Then we would have been much 
better served than with the motion before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it a rather perverse irony that the Reform Party would 
come forward with a motion that actually speaks to alienation. 
Alienation is synonymous with the Reform Party.  To bring it 
forward now obviously is the Jekyll and Hyde of the Reform Party. 
It is trying to snow Canadians at this point in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make no mistake that Reformers have alienated the rest of 
Canada.  We can see that on their benches.  They have alienated 
Ontario.  They have alienated Quebec.  It does not take much for 
me to speak to that with the advertising campaign that they had 
in the last election, as well as comments that were made by their 
members just recently with respect to anti-French, Frenchified 
and anti-francophone.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the Reform Party have alienated eastern Canada, 
Atlantic Canada. They have done it many times in suggesting that 
Atlantica should be an amalgam of all the Atlantic provinces. 
They have alienated Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward 
Island and Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any point in time if the Reform members would like to come to 
me, I can introduce them to my colleagues from Ontario, Quebec 
and Atlantic Canada, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland. 
The Reform members cannot do the same.  I would love for them to 
introduce me to their colleagues in those other regions of Canada 
that they now so passionately speak of as being alienated, not 
only by the Liberal government, but by other members of this 
parliament. They do not speak of their own alienation.  Let me 
speak to that briefly and then I will get into the alienation the 
Liberal government has also allowed in this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about Atlantic Canada?  A member of the Reform Party stood 
up recently and spoke very eloquently to the fact that there are 
issues in Atlantic Canada that have to be put on the floor of 
this House, which the Liberals and the government should be able 
to deal with immediately. Let me deal with some of those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote:  “The Leader of the Reform Party of Canada does not 
like special income assistance programs for fishermen and plant 
workers.  He would wipe out regional development initiatives like 
the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency and he is opposed in 
principle to the special bailout of Cape Breton coal mines”. Not 
only is that an irony, it is a complete flip-flop from a comment 
that was made recently by a member of the Reform Party. He talked 
about Devco and about the Sydney mines. That quote, by the way, 
was made on July 25, 1996.  Those are the chameleon policies of 
the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another quote:  “The kind of fiscal shock treatment the 
leader of the Reform Party favours may eliminate the deficit, but 
would also abandon thousands of Atlantic Canadians to a cruel 
fate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it rather ironic that they speak so eloquently on issues 
of Atlantic Canada on the one hand, but do not tell the truth on 
the other.  They are saying something totally different. I would 
like to add another quote:  “Canada should slash its universal 
social program and return to a bygone era when families and 
charities looked after the elderly, the unemployed and the poor, 
the Reform Party says”. That was in the <I>Chronicle-Herald</I> 
on February 22, 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely incomprehensible that the Reform members would 
talk about the alienation of a region when in fact they are the 
ones who have alienated the majority of the regions in this 
country. It is the wrong thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be debating something of consequence here in this 
House, but we are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak to the motion because perhaps there are 
some items the government would like to hear about from the 
Progressive Conservative Party to try to improve upon its record 
in western Canada.  The government has alienated in its own right 
and its own way, as have we.  I take some consequence of 1993 
when the Progressive Conservative Party had alienated Canadians. 
Perhaps we all do it at some point in our political careers. 
That is why they are not necessarily long careers, but they are 
valuable and viable careers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 7, 1999 the Prime Minister announced the creation of 
what he called the Prime Minister's task force on the four 
western provinces.  I have to admit my first reaction was that it 
was definitely a political manoeuvre to try to get additional 
support in the western Canadian provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt in my little mind that is what this particular 
task force is all about. It is to go out and gain some public 
relations and some media attention.  It is to say that the 
government is listening, that it cares not only about western 
Canadians but also about eastern Canadians, Atlantic Canadians 
and the Quebecois who are still very strong Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force is a bit of a make work project for little 
Liberal backbenchers. However, it is doing it for whatever it 
feels are the necessary reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the chairman of the task force is a colleague of mine. 
He is also the chairman of the agriculture committee on which I 
sit. 
I find it rather amusing. The member who is from the Manitoba 
riding of Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, and heads the task 
force is the very same member on the agriculture committee when 
we were trying to put forward some very well thought out changes 
to legislation, Bill C-4, which had to deal with the Canadian 
Wheat Board, who said that Canadian farmers want what we are 
putting forward and we are not prepared to make any changes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the way governments are to listen to the people who 
represent Canadians in those areas.  I wish that particular 
individual had made some of the changes. We would not be in the 
position we are in now with the alienation of Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the government consult with not only the stakeholders but 
also the premiers of the provinces of western Canada when it put 
together the AIDA program?  No.  It developed a program of its 
own design and then it went out and forced premiers to come into 
the program.  It is the absolute wrong way to do it.  Of course 
in doing that people are alienated and the government is learning 
from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish that Canadians would better recognize this country as 
being ten provinces and three territories.  Perhaps we could all 
learn from our mistakes.  Perhaps by working together as opposed 
to driving these wedges between the regions of the country we can 
become a much better country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel (Secretary of State (Science, 
Research and Development)(Western Economic Diversification), 
Lib.):</b> Madam Speaker, I want to commend my colleague for his 
positive attitude. Let me give a few examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He acknowledged that any activity which a political party takes 
has a political dimension. When I go to Brandon and make an 
announcement which I have done, obviously it has a political 
dimension. When one undertakes an initiative such as the one we 
are discussing this morning, out of necessity it has some 
political ramifications. There is no question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly pleased that my colleague pointed out that if 
we look at the country today, indeed if we look at the world, 
there are some questions we could have been discussing today, 
debating and exchanging information on which could have benefited 
all Canadians.  I am not sure that is going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague agree that an initiative such as the one that 
has been undertaken, which he has discussed, could have some 
potentially positive benefits for western Canadians and western 
Canadian provinces?  I indicated that the Government of Canada 
was fully integrated into western Canada. There are a lot of 
services which many people do not know about, but I acknowledge 
the fact that a couple of colleagues have identified how helpful 
those have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us strip away the politics.  Let us strip away the other 
dimensions.  Is there some potential benefit in having people 
from not only western Canada but from eastern Canada, MPs as well 
as senators, meet with groups to talk to them and to try to 
understand better than they do now what this country is all 
about?  In this case it happens to be western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</b>  Madam Speaker, I thank the Secretary 
of State for Western Economic Diversification for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that he does not make enough of those 
announcements in the city of Brandon.  Perhaps he could expand on 
some of those announcements and I would be very happy to be a 
part of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is any doubt that it is always to our 
benefit to listen to Canadians.  The Progressive Conservative 
Party has a task force under way that is listening to those 
people who are homeless and who are dealing with poverty.  We 
deal with that task force from coast to coast. We would not be 
able to learn the issues and to better deal with them if we did 
not listen to the people who are at the root of those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt there will be some good that comes from this 
particular task force.  I have no doubt the task force initially 
was developed and designed to try to elevate the Liberals' 
profile in an area where their profile is very limited.   Will it 
work for the profile?  Probably not.  But the members of the 
committee should well learn something from the people whom they 
listen to.  The people they are talking to certainly know the 
areas better than the Liberal members do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was mentioned once before, I believe by a member from the 
NDP, I too have some very strong opinions on those issues. I have 
had the opportunity on occasion to share those opinions with 
members of the government.  Unfortunately they do not implement 
those opinions as much as they should.  They would do a much 
better job if they did.

would like to have a good one on one with the member. He spoke 
about alienation and that the Reform Party has alienated the 
country, which is absolutely silly. As a matter of fact if it had 
not been for his party and the degree to which it alienated 
Canadians, there would be no Reform Party.  If the Progressive 
Conservatives had not created the vacuum, there would be no 
vacuum to fill. Really, they are experts in alienation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are trying to bring to parliament the concerns of 
people across the entire country. I would hope the member would 
use this occasion to enter the debate by showing us the concerns 
from his part of the country and from his constituency.  In my 
riding around 60% of the people voted for me.  The reason they 
did is because of the fact that we have promised, and this is 
true for candidates in our party right across the country, to 
represent the riding. What is it in the member's riding which 
causes people to feel alienated from Ottawa?  That is the real 
question we should ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</b>  Madam Speaker, needless to say, the 
people of my riding do not feel alienated because they have

we debating this motion?  We are giving the government members an 
opportunity to hear the concerns of Canadians from coast to coast 
to coast.  That is what it is about, listening to their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do people want to be heard?  What are their frustrations 
right now?  No matter where we go, people consistently tell us 
over and over again that the Liberals are not doing their job.  I 
listen to dozens of people in this country.  In Ontario people 
are feeling alienated and frustrated and likewise in Nova Scotia. 
These people are coming up with the same concerns that I hear in 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I spoke with dozens and dozens of British Columbians. 
I asked them if they had something to say to the government what 
would it be.  One response came up over and over again without 
prompting them.  I told them they had an opportunity to say 
something to the Prime Minister, so what would they like to say? 
They said there was contempt for parliament and a lack of 
democracy.  That came up in virtually every conversation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One gentleman said to me that 38% of Canadians gave 100% of the 
power to one man.  He said that every four years we 
democratically go to the polls to elect a dictator.  There is no 
question that far too much power centres around the Prime 
Minister.  They went on to say that there are numerous examples 
in parliament that the Liberal backbenchers are nothing more than 
sheep.  They might as well send trained robots to Ottawa to do as 
they are told.  We have heard that over and over again.  It is a 
rubber stamp for these guys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke with Irv Koombes from Burnaby.  He expressed alienation 
that stemmed from the government's fundamental lack of respect 
for members of parliament and the democratic process.  He said 
that he feels parliament treats British Columbians more like a 
nuisance and at its worst its attitude borders on contempt.  He 
went on to say how can one help but not feel alienated from a 
government that treats its own MPs like sheep.  That came up over 
and over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are lots of examples.  Members have been kicked out of 
government for not voting with the government and now sit on 
their own as independents.

make a long story short, this private member's bill was sent to

the entire bill.  It was outrageous and a contempt of parliament. 
It was was absolutely inexcusable.  These examples happen over

he do?  He punished the member by removing him as committee

government and the Prime Minister, out came the heavy club. These 
are people from the Liberal member's own riding who are telling 
me this information.  This is the level of frustration we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole country was shocked earlier this year when Justice 
Shaw struck down the law with respect to possession of child 
pornography.  Seventy Liberal members, MPs and senators from 
across the country, including those from British Columbia, sent 
the Prime Minister a letter asking him to immediately bring into 
parliament legislation that would reinstate the law and make it 
stronger or use the notwithstanding clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party put its motion forward to deal with this as 
expeditiously as possible.  When this motion was put forward we 
were not even aware of this letter.  The letter came up after the 
fact.  What did the government do?  It again brought out the 
heavy club. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal members from British Columbia feel frustrated and 
alienated because they cannot stand up and represent their views. 
The government has no concern for them at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally witnessed it as a member of the fisheries 
committee.  In my very first year in parliament our committee 
went out and did excellent work.  When we were sometimes critical 
of the government, how did it respond?  It fired the chairman, 
the member for Gander—Grand Falls, Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Gander—Grand Falls, right now as we speak, is 
speaking to the fisheries committee on the seals issue.  Does any 
member know whose time he is speaking on?  He is speaking on 
Reform's allocated time because the government does not provide 
him with any.  The Liberal member for Gander—Grand Falls, a 
member of parliament for 24 years, is at the fisheries committee 
speaking on the allocated time of the Reform Party of Canada.  He 
does not have a lot to offer because the government will not 
provide him with anything.  The government punishes him because 
he is not a trained sheep.  This is absolutely disgraceful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could speak here all day on the things I have heard from 
British Columbians.  A member from Victoria, a member who works 
in the minister of fisheries' riding, told me that the government 
considers British Columbians to be parasites; they literally suck 
the life out of us and give nothing back.  That is what a 
parasite actually does.  It literally sucks all the life out of 
something and offers nothing in return.  That is how this member 
described the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Liberal government, if British Columbians are 
making too much noise, it throws them a bone once in a while to 
keep them quiet and slow them down a bit.  It thinks of British 
Columbians as nuisances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the exact comments, word for word, coming from British 
Columbians that I have spoken to.  It is an opportunity for the 
Liberals to listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also aware of this.  What did it do?  It knows 
this is out there but is not dealing with it.  It created a 
committee called the western alienation committee.  That 
describes it in itself.  When we have to create a committee 
called the western alienation committee what does that tell us? 
It tells us that there is no representation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are opportunities for the government to act for British 
Columbians.  The federal government could push to renegotiate the 
software lumber accord with the U.S.  Two out of every five jobs 
in British Columbia come directly or indirectly from the forestry 
industry.  It is suffering terribly partly because of the federal 
government's policy with the softwood lumber accord.  No, it is 
not taking it to task.  It is sitting on its hands and doing 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard throughout the province that the forestry communities 
throughout British Columbia are devastated.  Where is the 
government?  How come it is not standing up and fighting for us? 
Let us be absolutely clear that when it negotiated and agreed on 
the quotas with the U.S. in the softwood lumber agreement, it was 
a Liberal member on the committee who negotiated that. 
Ironically, the quotas for British Columbia went down while the 
quotas for Ontario went up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had to sum up the issues which are frustrating British 
Columbia, the first issue would be the contempt of parliament and 
the lack of accountability and democracy.  That issue resonates 
everywhere we go.  They want people to come to Ottawa to 
represent their views.  They do not want Ottawa to tell them what 
they think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue is taxes, taxes, taxes and tax fairness for the 
family.  They are outraged that the government could not support 
a very simple motion.  It only confirmed in their minds that the 
government has its own agenda.  It refuses to listen to the 
people of Canada and, more importantly, the people of British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke with a family from Surrey.  This women received an 
increase of $1.24 per hour 13 months ago and not one extra dime 
has shown up on her pay cheque.  It was all going into taxes.  I 
hope the government is listening. 
<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):</b> 
Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member's 
comments, particularly with respect to the alienation in British 
Columbia and its concern about the abuse of parliament.  I 
thought I would point out a couple of things and then ask him a 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have had three opportunities since the general 
election to speak in a byelection.  We seen how much they have 
supported the Reform Party in that respect.  Not only has it lost 
all three, but as recently as last night the Reform Party went 
down in its vote in Windsor—St. Clair.  In fact, I think it got 
a little more than 6% of the vote.  That shows how its message is 
resonating to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I found more important was the comment about the abuse of 
parliament.  I sit here every day and look across at the hon. 
member who used to be the Reform Party defence critic.  He had 
the audacity to make his own decision about an issue that his 
leader and the Reform Party did not like.  What happened?  The 
Reform Party leader said that he had to be sentenced to sit out 
of caucus and go into purgatory.  That is Reform's new way of 
discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several members on the other side are not particularly enamoured 
with the united alternative initiative of their leader.  My 
goodness, they had the audacity to say it publicly and to have a 
discussion on how concerned they were about it.  What happened? 
The whip of their party came out with the big hammer and sent out 
a letter stating they must cease and desist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the hon. member would explain to me how those examples 
are examples of the great new Reform way of not disciplining 
members, of not ensuring that it has to be the leader's way? 
Maybe the hon. member would like to explain that to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Gary Lunn:</b>  Madam Speaker, I will gladly explain.  Our 
party emphatically believes that we must represent the wishes of 
our constituents, which we do all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has mentioned the member for Okanagan—Coquihalla who 
at one point in time was the defence critic and then the justice 
critic.  This member resigned his position as a critic on his 
own.  I am not going to go down there.  He resigned on his own 
and I will leave it at that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the member for York South—Weston who took a 
principled stance on the GST, on a promise made by this 
government.  Again we are talking about accountability.  He was 
the only individual who voted against the government.  It does 
not matter whether it is hepatitis C or child pornography.  Here 
we had one on taxation.  He voted against the government and 
where does he sit?  He sits on this side of the House.  The 
Liberals kicked him out of the party.  They would have nothing to 
do with him because he voted by his conscience and by the people 
who sent him here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in Ottawa for two years.  People ask me how I like 
it and what is happening here.  The only thing I can tell them is 
that it is a disgrace to see that there is an absolute 
dictatorship there.  It is controlled by one individual.  The 
people out there are equally frustrated and the Liberals are sent 
in here like trained sheep to heckle.  They will not listen and 
it is very unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to change this institution.  It is dysfunctional.  Both 
Chambers, the Senate and this one, do not represent the views of 
Canadians.  We need to ensure that all members of parliament have 
more input.  That is what we are talking about.  We are talking 
about true representation and true accountability so that the 
views of Canadians are actually represented here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that there are times when we want to 
collectively be a force, but that should not cause people to be 
fired and thrown out of their party into the opposition.  It is 
absolutely outrageous and a contempt of parliament to treat 
people like that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</b>  Madam Speaker, it is my 
privilege to stand before the House today as the regional critic 
for Alberta, to speak on behalf of Alberta and to explain how I 
arrived at the questions I will be posing to the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got those questions by canvassing 26 ridings in Alberta.  I 
have enough to fill the rest of the afternoon with what they feel 
has alienated them from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, they are insulted that a task force has to be sent to a 
province where there are 24 MPs who would be glad to tell the 
government and the Prime Minister of exactly the sorts of things 
that alienate the people of the province I live in and represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got involved in politics because I believed the message had to 
come from the constituents to Ottawa and that all MPs should have 
the opportunity to express themselves and to be listened to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last night we were here talking about Kosovo.  As the 
foreign affairs critic, I have many points of view that I believe 
Canadians would like to have expressed here.  Of course no one 
was here to listen.  It was a take note debate.  The motion had 
no substance and of course there was no vote at the end of it. 
That is the sort of blatant abuse that just disgusts people from 
the province of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the list that will save the Prime Minister and the member 
for Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia from having to visit our 
province.  Here are some of the things on the list that have 
alienated our province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we feel the federal government has become too intrusive 
in provincial affairs.  That is a claim that could come from most 
provinces, specifically Quebec where a whole party was formed 
that said it knew it could not make any changes so it was going 
to separate.  What a terrible option.  Many people in my province 
are saying that if the government keeps intruding the way it is, 
they will not put up with it forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarship is an example.  The provincial 
education minister was not even consulted.  There have been 
health care cuts of 40%.  The federal government continually 
wants to blame the provinces for those cuts.  On the environment, 
the endangered species act keeps floating around this place, 
again without consultation with the people who will make it 
happen.  Farmers, grassroots people, will save endangered 
species.  It will not be those on high in government.  People are 
responsible and do want to have input into legislation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could go on.  The flag money was mentioned many times in many 
ridings, the waste of money by Ottawa and of course the Kosovo 
situation and the vote which I have already alluded to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second item that was most often mentioned by the 26 ridings 
in Alberta was the whole tax situation.  The federal government 
just does not get the message that taxes cost jobs.  Taxes cost 
this country in lost productivity.  The incentive to work is 
destroyed by high taxes.  The government just does not get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course Alberta has led the way.  We have the lowest taxes. We 
are going to an 11% flat tax in 2002.  That is leadership.  The 
federal government could learn a lot about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxes on petroleum and not on hydro has been brought forward by 
many petroleum producers.  There are taxes on private utility 
companies like TransAlta while government run utility companies 
are tax free.  That is a penalty against the free enterprise 
system which Alberta practises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is Kyoto and what that will mean for our province, as 
well as the GST promises on which the government reneged.  We do 
not have a sales tax in our province and we do not want to have 
the GST either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is unfair taxation on families.  The EI surplus is being 
taken as a tax.  When only 38% of people can actually receive EI, 
the rest is just tax money.  Small business after small business 
talked about the EI and the CPP.  They said “Just be honest 
about what you are doing”, but the federal government is not 
doing that at this point.  It is taxing us to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there were many mentions of patronage.  The CF-18 bill is 
not dead yet in Alberta.  We still remember that.  I often have 
said that in Alberta there are two things to be mentioned if one 
wants to get elected.  One is to mention the name of Mr. Trudeau 
and the national energy program.  Immediately individuals say “I 
won't vote Liberal”.  Then one has to mention the name Mr. 
Mulroney and GST.  That means “I can't vote PC”.  We have 
eliminated two parties right away just by saying those words.  It 
becomes pretty easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is blatant patronage everywhere.  Candidates who are 
defeated end up on parole boards and all kinds of other boards 
simply because they decided that they would be a Liberal 
candidate.  We have example after example.  It makes people 
furious that the Liberals are using taxpayers' money to reward 
their friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth is the judicial system.  Albertans are concerned 
about victims' rights.  They are concerned about the soft Liberal 
approach to justice.  They are concerned that when a judge in 
B.C. said it was okay to have child pornography the government 
did not slam into that judicial system and say “That's wrong”. 
That is wrong in anyone's books.  They cannot understand how any 
government can agree with child pornography.  They just do not 
understand how anyone who cares about anything could go along 
with that sort of thing.  It infuriates them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Albertans are fed up with the very fact that the Young Offenders 
Act is tampered with a bit, but that the real recommendations by 
the committee are not looked at.  The judges are making the laws. 
The Prime Minister says that it is okay for judges to make laws, 
that parliament should not have any say in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Albertans find fighting for criminals' rights, whether they be 
in Brazil or in Texas, distasteful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth is gun control.  I received 13,000 letters in my 
riding from people who wanted to talk to me about Bill C-68. They 
are disgusted by it.  I asked the justice minister to come to my 
riding.  I said that I would book the Centrium, which holds 
approximately 10,000 people.  I would pay the bill if she would 
come to explain to me the justification for Bill C-68. 
She has not said no.  She has said she is very busy.  But she 
should come.  She is our Alberta justice minister.  If she is so 
certain that the law is good, why will she not appear in front of 
10,000 Albertans to justify it?  Why will she not do that? What 
is she afraid of if the law is so good?  Again I challenge her to 
accept the invitation, which she has now had for two months, to 
come to Red Deer.  I will make sure the crowd is there for her.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also noticed someone in an Edmonton paper reporting that they 
bought an $800 dinner.  It was donated by the minister.  She now 
has decided not to give the dinner because it was someone opposed 
to gun control who bought it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the wheat board is concerned, let farmers have their 
say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be Senate elections.  It is a slap in the face of 
Albertans because we elected two senators and we want them to be 
appointed, not some political hacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we had the Prime Minister's comments about the UN and not 
being Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message is “Wake up”.  Albertans are entrepreneurial.  We 
are gaining population.  We are gaining influence and we will 
roll over the government if it does not start listening to us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel (Secretary of State (Science, 
Research and Development)(Western Economic Diversification), 
Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I think an error was made by previous 
speakers, which I am sure was unintentional.  The official name 
of the task force which has been referred to is the Prime 
Minister's caucus task force on the four western provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is very simple.  I want to ask my colleague if he 
personally has ever made any positive comments about the 
Government of Canada's contributions to western Canadians or to 
Alberta in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give him a couple of examples that I think might be 
useful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He may not be aware that there are 14 centres of excellence in 
Canada and that the University of Alberta is involved in 14 out 
of 14.  I think the University of Calgary is involved in 12 out 
of 14.  That is a pretty good score. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He may not know that since 1993, 1,790 schools and 72 libraries 
have been connected in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He may not know that the Small Business Loans Act backed 20,957 
loans, valued at $1.4 billion, to Alberta SMEs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He may not know that the National Research Council, through its 
IRAP program—and these are people in the field working with 
industry to try to bring ideas in order to commercialize 
manufacturing as quickly as possible—provided support to 838 
clients for 1,319 projects worth $26.7 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He may not know that the Natural Sciences and Engineering 
Research Council of Canada has invested since 1993 $132.6 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He may not know that the Social Sciences and Humanities Research 
Council has invested since 1993 over $24 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He may not know as well about the $40 million partnership that 
Canada has with the province of Alberta that is going very, very 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are these the kinds of things that the hon. member shares with 
his constituents, with other Albertans and with other western 
Canadians?  Perhaps he could enlighten us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Bob Mills:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank the hon. 
member for his comments, but I think he just proved the very 
point, the very message that Albertans are sending.  We want 
government out of our lives.  We do not want government giving 
this and handing out that and taxing us more and more so that it 
can spend our money for us.  Leave the money in our pockets.  We 
are entrepreneurial.  We are creative.  We can take care of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1960 socialist philosophy of “government will take care of 
everything” did not work anywhere.  If it had the eastern bloc 
countries would be leading the parade in the world today.  But 
they are not.  They are collapsed and in decay because they had 
too damned much government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Get the message.  Get out of our hair. 
Let us run our province.  We are proud Canadians.  We want to be 
Canadians.  The government should not tax the very incentive out 
of us and then hand it back through all of the programs that have 
been so kindly mentioned.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Bloc Quebecois formed the official opposition, its 
members were making the same comments that Reformers are now 
making. We said the same things in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are talking about overlap, duplication and federal 
intrusion in provincial jurisdictions. That is what the Bloc 
Quebecois was condemning, and continues to condemn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the federal government is making 
increasingly deeper cuts in transfer payments to the provinces, 
while intruding in areas of provincial jurisdiction such as 
health and education with the millennium scholarships. 
When the federal government intrudes in our jurisdictions, this 
adversely affects regional development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has been condemning such intrusions since

Albertans have a lot in common.  The one difference is that we 
have decided to try to change the system from within.  That is 
the big difference.  Quebecers have decided that they cannot do 
that and have taken another option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying to the government that it has to start listening to 
regional concerns.  That is the purpose of the supply motion 
today, to give every province an opportunity to have its 
grassroots views expressed and recorded, and hopefully the 
government will respond.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
splitting my time with the member for Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is indeed a pleasure to take part in the debate today and to 
say a few words about a topic affecting not only the regions of 
the country but Canadians as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition motion speaks about a government alienated from 
the various regions of the land.  My contribution to the debate 
will be to offer a concrete example of federal presence in every 
province, a positive presence that is a force for economic 
growth, environmental sustainability and prosperity in all parts 
of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about the Government of Canada's nationwide system 
of scientific research and technology development which 
represents a significant contribution to the success of Canadian 
agriculture.  This network has a proud history of over 100 years. 
It has given Canada new crops and scientific advances that have 
transformed this nation and continue to contribute to our 
economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This includes Marquis wheat, canola, the Shepody potato and the 
new frontier of plant biotechnology, just to name a few.  Marquis 
wheat transformed the Canadian west by giving Canadian farmers a 
variety suited to the harsh winters and short growing seasons of 
the Canadian prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of canola on Canadian farmers, particularly in the 
west, cannot be underestimated.  It has made a tremendous 
contribution to the prairie farm economy by providing an 
alternative to King wheat.  Not only has it provided an 
alternative, but this year, for the first time ever, it has 
outperformed wheat, as far as grains are concerned, in western 
Canada.  That is the first time in history that has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Shepody potato is one of 23 potato varieties developed by 
federal scientists.  It alone accounts for 15% of Canadian potato 
production and is ranked number two among varieties for french 
fry production.  This variety and this particular research is the 
underpinning of the economy of my province of Prince Edward 
Island and also contributes greatly to the economies of the 
provinces of New Brunswick, Manitoba and Alberta, as well as to 
the economies of many nations around the world to whom we sell 
our seed potatoes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's pioneering federal researchers have put Canada in the 
lead to develop new products and processes that will make

system that is both national in scope and regional in focus. 
These centres also collaborate with their counterparts in the 
industry, academia and provincial governments to form a powerful 
research community with links across the country.  Each federal 
centre has a specialized research focus reflecting the industry 
strengths of the region in which it is located. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal researchers and scientists have well earned 
international reputations for their skill and expertise which 
they use to help all Canadians regardless of region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The livestock research in Lethbridge and Lacombe is helping 
producers in more than just Alberta.  Biotechnology research in 
Saskatoon is helping create jobs well beyond Saskatchewan.  Food 
research in Quebec and Ontario is creating opportunities for 
growth in every region of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research efforts and resources are meeting regional needs 
through the matching investment initiative as well.  This is a 
program that brings government and industry together in joint 
research projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998-99 the Government of Canada and its partners in industry 
collaborated on over 860 projects with a combined investment of 
more that $58 million.  Investment through this initiative is 
projected to reach the level of $70 million by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal research in agriculture also focuses efforts in the 
vital area of sustainability.  Work done by both the research 
branch and the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Agency aims to improve 
the environmental performance of agriculture in areas such as 
integrated pest management, conservation tillage and animal waste 
treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal research is also focusing on ways to use water and 
fertilizers more effectively.  This means improved soil 
structure, better conservation of water and a reduction of 
so-called greenhouse gases that are behind global warming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal agricultural research is helping to shape the future of 
agriculture.  In many ways it is helping to ensure that there 
will be a future for agriculture.  That is what makes the 
research done in federal research centres so important to 
Canadians whether they are farmers or consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agri-food industry is responsible for 9% of our gross 
domestic product and provides jobs for 1.8 million Canadians. 
These people are found in B.C., on the prairies, in central 
Canada, in the maritimes and in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our nationwide network of federal research centres and expertise 
is the foundation on which this essential industry is built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is indeed responding to the needs of 
Canadians in all regions. One of the ways we are doing it is 
through our investment in research and technology development.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the speech that was just given and I am somewhat 
puzzled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a province like Alberta the Liberals had very little support 
in the last election.  All of these programs which the Liberals 
like to crow about really do not deliver that much support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recommend to the Liberal members that they listen to 
Canadians.  I guess we are all guilty of this to a degree.  I 
think it is human nature.  We tend to see things, read things and 
interpret them based on our own experience and our own 
predisposition to what we believe is true.  That is one of the 
foibles of human nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberal members really listened, they would find that 
people in western Canada, and this is probably true across the 
country, want fewer programs and less government interference in 
their lives.  We want the government to give us freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not know how offended people in western 
Canada and in the prairie provinces are when there is a distant 
government in Ottawa with an Ontario majority.  Ontarians are not 
subject to the rules of the wheat board act but the government 
imposes a wheat board on western farmers.  It takes away their 
total freedom and forces them to sell their grain through that 
one agency when what they want is freedom.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government puts a referendum out with two options, 
neither of which is their first option and then claims that they 
have listened to the people, that is the stuff of which 
alienation is made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the response of the member to that kind of 
thing, the programs and just not listening to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Joe McGuire:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I think we will recognize 
that question is a very peculiar one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member seems to imply that we should not be spending any 
money in Alberta because they did not support us electorally as 
much as he thinks they should have. As a national government we 
do not do these things for the support we may garner here or 
there, but for what is good for the whole country as a nation 
from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member is suggesting we should not do anything in Alberta 
because we only have two or three members there, then that is a 
very peculiar way to think about how a national government should 
be running the country.  We are as concerned about the problems 
in Alberta as we are concerned about the problems in the north or 
in Newfoundland or in my own province of P.E.I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the way a true national government looks at things. This 
is why the previous speaker from the Conservative Party was 
saying this party represents alienation itself.  They grow fat on 
alienation.  This is why we have this topic here.  They should be 
looking at ways where we can share and co-operate and be partners 
as the Fathers of Confederation envisioned it many years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ken Epp:</b>  Mr. Speaker, just as a follow up, it is not 
that the Reformers feed on alienation.  Wrong.  Just stop to 
think. Had the Liberals and the Conservatives before them and the 
Liberals before them done a decent job for Quebec, had they done 
a decent job for western Canada, there would be no Bloc party, 
there would be no Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could we possibly have told the people to vote for us 
because we are going to do for them something they were already 
happy with?  Why would they switch their allegiance?  On the 
other hand, if we came up with something that they are not happy 
with, they would most certainly stay with the party that they had 
been supporting and would not support a new one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new party is not a cause of the problem.  It is a symptom of 
the problem.  As far as I am concerned, those members are missing 
the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Joe McGuire:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that the 
Liberal Party of Canada has been in existence since the beginning 
of this country and will still be here for many more decades, 
long after that party is but a figment of somebody's imagination. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to enter the debate today on this very important 
topic.  I want to emphasize a federal presence in one of our 
regions, that being the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I am a little astounded at any insinuation that the 
federal government is alienating itself from the regions.  It is 
really all quite silly on the part of the Reform Party but I 
suppose in that sense it is not surprising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my hon. colleague from the Reform Party who is 
proposing the motion has had an opportunity recently to look in 
the phone book.  The presence of federal departments and agencies 
is quite astounding and remarkable.  We are in all the places 
people would expect us to be, for example in the metropolitan 
centres like Winnipeg and Vancouver, but we are also as a federal 
government in communities like Bruno, Saskatchewan and 
Bonnyville, Alberta. All key federal departments have offices 
throughout western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is much more than just that.  Using our own department, 
Western Economic Diversification Canada as a primary example let 
me highlight how wide reaching this government's efforts are in 
this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, with respect to western Canada business service 
network, I note that western diversification and its partners 
have over 100 points of service across western Canada serving 
urban and rural communities from Lac du Bonnet to the Queen 
Charlotte Islands.  In that sense we are still growing and that 
is important to note.  The headquarters are in Edmonton and there 
are offices, four of them actually, in Vancouver, Edmonton, 
Saskatoon and Winnipeg, and satellite offices in Calgary and 
Regina.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Western diversification plays a unique role in helping the 
western economy to grow.  That is its purpose. It works closely 
with the people of western Canada.  This includes aboriginal 
peoples, youth, communities and industry leaders throughout that 
part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We advance the interests of the west.  We advocate on behalf of 
businesses in the west. Our government provides integrated 
services to small business in that area, for example, advice on 
financing options, help with business planning, exporting, and 
selling to government.  All of these are important things and 
aspects to western Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We work with financial institutions to provide loans to new 
economy sectors.  Western diversification contributes to loan 
loss reserves to lever small business loan capital.  We also 
provide up to $57 million toward a lever for a total of $439 
million in small business loan capital.  This represents a 
leverage ratio of nearly 8:1 which is important to note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international trade personnel program and first jobs program 
match small businesses with recent graduates, all in the effort 
to help our young people.  We provide small businesses with the 
cash flow to hire young people and provide young people with a 
first job opportunity. It is also important to note that since 
1995 our government has provided over 900 jobs to young people in 
western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to highlight at this point the existence of 
four women's enterprise centres, one in each of the western 
provinces.  There are five satellite offices.  This meets the 
needs of women in business.  It offers financing, counselling and 
advice. Over the course of time, 17,000 women have trained and 
1,600 loans worth over $10 million in the last four years have 
been made evident.  This supports and shows the difference we 
make to the lives of western Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also 90-plus community future development corporations 
across the west.  Seven are aboriginal exclusive.  This program 
provides focal points for the delivery of western diversification 
services outside the major cities covering all non-metropolitan 
areas in western Canada. I also want to point out that between 
1995 and 1998, 8,100 loans worth $171 million and over 28,000 
jobs were created as a result of this. That too underscores our 
commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There also are four Canada business service centres, one in each 
of the western provinces, which provide one-stop shopping for 
business services.  Thousands of entrepreneurs have made this 
their focal point of contact for business services each year. 
Expansion of services to rural areas are part of this with 97 
regional access sites being established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 1,000 volunteers are part of the western Canada business 
service network.  This month in Jasper, Alberta western 
diversification is participating in the first ever pan-western 
conference which will bring together international and other 
partners in this area and volunteers.  That too is important to 
note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn now to the role of regional agencies in western 
Canada.  Western diversification and its counterparts represent 
the interests of all regions in the west. Through regional 
partners they develop an in-depth understanding of the needs and 
requirements of their region.  They deliver national and regional 
programs on behalf of the federal government.  For example, it 
administers infrastructure works programs in western Canada and 
it partners with provinces and municipalities to upgrade 
transportation and local services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have noted over the past while $747 million in funding with 
over 5,300 projects and over 35,000 jobs.  They are agents of 
economic development and job creation.  All of this says that we 
are flexible, responsible and accessible in this very important 
region of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the process, there is a focus on client needs and local 
people responding to local concerns.  Our government has also 
shown the importance of responding to communities in need, for 
example the Manitoba flood. Total federal funding of $224 million 
in assistance was provided for flood relief and flood protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The response of western diversification was immediate and 
creative. Our government put teams of personnel on the road to 
search out affected small businesses and provide them with 
start-up money to resume their operations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to talk a bit about aboriginal initiatives.  As 
the federal government in this important region we provide 
integrated services to our aboriginal people.  I should note that 
63% of Canada's aboriginal population resides in the west.  Last 
week our colleague, the Minister of Industry, announced a $21 
million package to improve business development opportunities for 
aboriginal peoples with western diversification contributing 
one-third of that funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal business development initiative is expected to 
result in 900 new businesses and 2,000 new jobs, and many of them 
will in fact be in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also point out that an aboriginal business services 
network was built on existing infrastructure and will provide 
enhanced business services to aboriginal entrepreneurs.  This 
initiative will also see increased access to capital for 
aboriginal businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have over the course of time made a $950,000 contribution to 
the Aboriginal Business Development Centre in Winnipeg to 
encourage entrepreneurship among urban aboriginal people.  For 
example, $5 million recently was set aside to establish the 
Saskatchewan Indian Federation College, the only native 
controlled college in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point to technology and innovation in this very 
important region in Canada.  First of all let me say that 
knowledge and innovation is a revolutionizing industry.  Even 
traditional resource industries of the west have become high 
tech.  We are marking a new era of scientific research and 
technological innovation in Canada as we move into the 21st 
century, and much of this is in fact taking place in the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to turn for a minute to the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation.  Through the Canada Foundation for Innovation the 
federal government is modernizing research infrastructure at 
universities and research hospitals. Two weeks ago, for example, 
the foundation approved a $56 million contribution to the 
Canadian light source project at the University of Saskatchewan. 
It will become one of the largest scientific projects ever built 
in Canada.  It will enable Canadian scientists to conduct world 
class research at home.  It will enhance the reputation of 
Saskatoon and the country as a whole, I should point out.  It 
will create an expected 500 jobs and millions of dollars in 
economic activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to connecting Canadians, I want to point out that 
the government has made connecting Canadians one of its primary 
goals.  The aim is to make Canada the most connected country in 
the year 2000.  We are establishing public Internet sites in 
rural and remote communities across the west.  We have connected 
183 community access sites in Saskatchewan alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I would point out the National Research Council and the 
industrial research assistance program, IRAP, need some 
discussion.  Under the National Research Council we have $31 
million in additional investment earmarked for the next three 
years.  An extensive network of IRAP contributors and research 
institutes across the west is also in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these things provide an overview of what we are doing in 
western Canada.  They are important initiatives. 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</b>  Madam Speaker, 
during his speech the member mentioned that the government was 
responding to the needs of aboriginal peoples in the west.  The 
fact is that the government completely ignored an enormous amount 
of input that came from aboriginal peoples with regard to the 
Native Land Management Act, to the point now that the bill has 
gone to the other place, the Senate, and the Senate has to amend 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With credit at least to the member for Vancouver Quadra, he 
admitted there was a problem with the bill.  In fact he publicly 
stated that it was badly flawed, but he failed to follow through 
at vote time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the member think his constituents feel when their MP 
speaks out against something and then votes the opposite way in 
the House?  No wonder there is alienation.  It is not the least 
bit surprising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also said it was silly to say that the Liberals did 
not understand what was happening in the west.  I have to ask him 
why then set up a task force.  Why did the Prime Minister do 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it seems that basically all the government can do 
is talk about its western economic diversification program as if 
it somehow answers all of the frustrations in the west.  What a 
pathetic and pitiful example that is.  I doubt that western 
diversification appears in the top 500 concerns of people out 
west.

discussion about the lumber quota problems out there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have some real substance instead of this nonsense about a 
diversification fund that might help some business somewhere. The 
businesses in my riding and out west would rather have tax relief 
and get rid of the western diversification fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Lynn Myers:</b>  Madam Speaker, I want to reply to the 
question in terms of what we as a government are doing in western 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about the variety of issues that hon. member raised.  We 
do so on a continuing basis.  It is important to engage the 
Canadian people wherever they may live in this great country of 
ours in the kind of debate that is necessary to provide good 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very proud of economic diversification and what it does 
for people in the west.  It is a very good foundation upon which 
to build.  Businesses, aboriginal people, young people and all 
kinds of western Canadians benefit as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud of what our government has accomplished in this 
area.  I will repeat what I said at the outset.  I find it quite 
silly that members of the Reform Party, in their usual extremist 
views and their usual attempt to alienate people and pit people 
against each other, would go to this extent.  It is a kind of sad 
reflection on them in terms of how they think, but I guess it is 
the reality of where they are coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am more for our government being an inclusive government, as 
opposed to the Reformers who exclude people, who want to break 
people apart and who do those kinds of things to the detriment of 
Canada.  I do not want any part of that and most Canadians do not 
either. 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</b>  Madam Speaker, there has 
been a massive withdrawal of federal presence in the north.  The 
privatization of Navigation Canada has meant that where food has 
to be flown in it is now incredibly expensive.  There is a 
withdrawal of flood watch warnings and the weather station.  The 
air traffic control tower will completely leave Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that we now have three territories in the north with 
roughly equivalent populations, but Yukon gets $200 million a 
year less in transfer payments than either of the other two 
territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sense of almost not belonging because the federal 
presence has been so withdrawn from the north.  I can understand 
the difference in the geography and wanting to compensate the 
other two territories so that they have the extra money, but I 
cannot justify a difference of $200 million.  I would like the 
hon. member to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Lynn Myers:</b>  Madam Speaker, I emphasize that the 
Government of Canada continues to want to provide and will 
continue to provide the kinds of services that are required for 
any of our regions no matter where they exist in Canada 
including, and especially in the north, Yukon and the other two 
territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fundamental that we as a federal government ensure that 
there is a federal presence to make sure that the quality of life 
for people, not only in the north but across this great country 
of ours, is sustained in a fashion that we have taken for granted 
over the years and is consistent with the values that we share 
and cherish as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the federal government will continue to do that in a 
manner that is meaningful for people wherever they may live.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</b>  Madam 
Speaker, the motion before the House today reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemns the government for alienating itself 
from the regions of Canada by failing to identify and address the 
concerns and issues of those regions, and as a symbolic first 
step towards taking responsibility for all of the regions of 
Canada, the government should rename the Liberal committee on 
western alienation the “Liberal Alienation Committee”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The depths to which western alienation goes are so deep that I 
do not really know where to begin or where to end.  Let me start 
with the Liberal alienation committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent the constituency of Saskatoon—Humboldt in the 
province of Saskatchewan.  The Liberal government did not even 
bother to appoint a single person from Saskatchewan to the 
Liberal alienation committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse than that, three of the ten members of the task force are 
senators.  Ironically one of the biggest sources of western 
alienation is the unelected, unaccountable and unequal Senate. 
With these senators there, it makes me wonder exactly how the 
logistics will work.  Will they fly a plane in from Mexico, pick 
them up with a bus and stop by the penitentiary on the way to the 
consultations?  Exactly how will it work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sending senators to Saskatchewan to find out why we feel 
alienated is like sending Bill Clinton to consult with sexually 
harassed women.  It does not make a lot of sense.  They are the 
source of our alienation.  They are the reason we feel resentment 
and we feel alienated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that southern Ontario and southern 
Quebec have more members of parliament than all the rest of 
Canada combined.  The modus operandi of those MPs is to pacify 
the rest of Canada with lip service.  We do not have any 
meaningful representation either here or in the Senate.  Policy 
after policy is passed contrary to the wishes and the interests 
of western Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberal government were interested in addressing the 
alienation, why did the Prime Minister appoint a senator from 
Alberta despite the fact that Alberta had already elected the 
senator it wanted to be appointed?  That is a slap in the face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he has the audacity to strike a committee to come out there 
to find out why we feel alienated.  What kind of leadership is 
that? We know there will be another Senate vacancy because a 
current Saskatchewan senator has been convicted of an infamous 
crime and his removal from the Senate is imminent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since there is an upcoming election in Saskatchewan why does the 
Prime Minister not offer Saskatchewan the opportunity to elect 
its senator and appoint the democratically elected person?  He 
will not though, will he?  He is the prime minister in control of 
the direction of the country.  Why does he not reform the Senate? 
We have been asking for that for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could use many examples, but I will just pick a couple to 
illustrate the point.  There is the language policy of the 
federal government.  I accessed numbers from the public accounts 
of Canada which showed that last year the federal government 
spent a quarter of a billion dollars, $250 million, to fund the 
official languages program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it absolutely incredible that it tries to justify this 
kind of expenditure while in Saskatchewan hospital waiting lists 
are growing, our nurses are not paid well and are on strike right 
now as I speak, ordinary Canadians are having trouble making ends 
meet, and our taxation levels are absolutely burdensome.  The 
government does not have a problem throwing a quarter of a 
million dollars into a program that quite frankly alienates and 
irritates us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give another example.  There is currently an income 
crisis among farmers in Saskatchewan.  In January, while the 
House was not sitting, the eight Reform members of parliament 
from Saskatchewan conducted an extensive series of town hall 
meetings throughout the entire province to hear from farmers, to 
hear their views.  It was publicly announced and open to 
everybody including the agriculture minister, but where was he? 
He was on vacation in the sunny south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not begrudge the minister taking a vacation once in a 
while, but did he have to do it at the exact time we were facing 
a crisis which falls within the purview of his responsibilities 
as minister of agriculture?  Why was he not out there listening 
to the concerns of farmers?  Nonetheless, I do not mind doing it. 
That is my job and I was pleased to be part of that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eight Reform MPs from Saskatchewan put together a two page 
letter which outlined the concerns of farmers and suggested ways 
the agriculture minister could change the program to meet the 
needs of the farmers it was supposedly designed to help.  That 
letter was written on February 4 and there was no response from 
the agriculture minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 22 I sent him another letter asking for a response, 
and there was no response.  On March 29 I urgently appealed to 
him.  I pointed out that spring was right around the corner, that 
farmers were in a crunch, and that more deficiencies in the 
program had revealed themselves since he has made it official and 
the forms were now available.  The program is fraught with 
problems and difficulties.  He responded yesterday, the day 
before we had the debate on western alienation.  Is that not 
ironic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government wants to know why we feel alienated.  We 
are consulting the people.  As an elected representative I write 
letters to the minister.  I come before the House of Commons to 
explain and debate the issues, and it falls on deaf ears.  He 
would not even respond to my letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use another example, that of the minister responsible for 
the Canadian Wheat Board.  All the times last year we were before 
the House of Commons to debate reforms to the Canadian Wheat 
Board which we advocate must happen, we spoke on behalf of the 
farmers who elected us and sent us here.  The minister for the 
Canadian Wheat Board was not here once to hear us.  He was here 
when he spoke at the outset of consideration of the bill and then 
he was gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were here talking to the walls and they wonder why we feel 
alienated.  Every day we come before the House to explain the 
feelings of westerners.  I am a westerner; I represent 
westerners.  They ignore us and then strike a Liberal alienation 
committee to find out why westerners feel alienated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will not table its schedule of where the Liberal 
alienation committee will be.  It does not want the people to 
know where it will be because it will get flak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I definitely speak for the vast majority of the residents of 
Saskatchewan.  Perhaps it is not unanimous but it is close. 
Firearm registration, as everybody knows, will do nothing but 
target law-abiding owners of firearms.  They look to me for 
leadership and ask me to do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a motion before the House in September to repeal the 
legislation and replace it with legislation that targets the 
illegal use of firearms.  The Liberals voted against it.  Last 
month I tabled a private member's bill that targets the criminal 
use of firearms, the 10-20 life law which will be debated 
Thursday evening in the House.  What did the Liberal committee 
do?  It was deemed non-votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my time is running short.  That is unfortunate because I 
have many examples; I am barely getting started.  In closing, I 
did not have an opportunity to speak to the last Liberal speaker. 
He mentioned the Canada Foundation for Innovation fund and the 
Synchrotron light source of Saskatoon.  I would like him to know 
that when the former Liberal MP from that riding was defeated the 
next day she said that Saskatchewan would pay for not re-electing 
a Liberal MP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Damage control went in and some Liberal strategists negated 
that.  At a press conference last month when the decision was 
announced, her name and the name of another former Liberal MP 
from Saskatoon were mentioned.  Talk about a political ploy.  The 
Minister of Industry and the minister responsible for the 
Canadian Wheat Board, the only Liberal MP from Saskatchewan, were 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is an arm's length fund that administers funds for basic 
research, which is good and which it should, what are the Liberal 
MPs and ministers doing there?  They are making political hay out 
of it and westerners resent that.  We do not need our votes 
bought.  We want accountable government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel (Secretary of State (Science, 
Research and Development)(Western Economic Diversification), 
Lib.):</b>  Madam Speaker, first I want to know whether my 
colleague believes that the decision taken by the Canadian 
Foundation for Innovation, an independent organization which 
makes decisions based upon the evaluation of peers, the very best 
in the field, determining whether or not something should be 
supported, was a good decision for Saskatoon and a good decision 
for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second point concerns the Official Languages Act.  I have two 
questions in this regard.  Does my colleague realize that when he 
quotes figures it provides translation services for our 
colleagues from Quebec who want to express themselves very often 
in their first language. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to speak their first language, French.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he realize as well that it involves services that we 
require in order to speak to people who do business with Canada 
from other countries?  It is not simply money that is tossed 
away.  Why is it that he and the Reform Party are so irritated by 
the French language?  What is with them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</b>  Madam Speaker, his first question was 
whether the decision of the CFI was a good decision.  I assume 
that it must have been because I believe an independent arm's 
length body made the decision.  Since this has been done and it 
is an independent arm's length decision, why do Liberal MPs have 
to be there to try to take the credit for it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in Saskatoon are not stupid.  They saw right through 
that.  It is insulting for them to have even been there.  Why did 
they not send the officials from the CFI to make the 
announcement, as it should be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that topic I point out that basic scientific research funding 
is a reasonable role of government.  It is something that private 
industry cannot do or is unwilling to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When government spends $500 million to fund special interest 
groups, the grants and giveaways to all its millennium projects 
and regional development funds that it hands out all the time, 
that is not a legitimate role of government.  That is another 
source of western alienation: the size of government and the 
waste of money.  More money could be spent on good projects like 
the Synchroton light source if the government did not mismanage 
its finances such as it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His second question with respect to the Official Languages Act 
asked whether I realized that some of the money was spent 
for translation purposes and doing business with other countries, 
et cetera.  Of course I do and I think that is wonderful.  We should 
go to whatever extent we can to accommodate members in the House 
whose first language is not English.  That is not a problem, but 
does it have to cost $250 million a year?  The hon. member knows 
full well that only a small fraction of that money is spent on 
legitimate government language services. 
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</b>  Madam 
Speaker, I am not exactly the youngest member in the House.  I 
have lived in my home province for a long time.  I have never 
seen more of an irritant in my province, and I am sure in the 
other provinces, as the AIDA package that just came out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am keeping track of this and I will make a pronouncement right 
now that the agitation in the west is so great there will be more 
of these forms thrown in the wastepaper basket than will be 
returned to the government.  It costs up to $500 for those who 
are not computer based to get the forms filled out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the experience of my colleague from Saskatoon—Humboldt, are 
his farmers as irritated as mine?  I have only had two farmers 
admit that they filled out the forms.  I wonder what will be the 
result in the province of Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</b>  Madam Speaker, I have spoken to several 
accountants and accounting firms to find out how many farmers are 
actually filling out their forms.  As near as I can tell it will 
be about 15%, and about 20% of them will actually qualify for 
assistance.  Only a small fraction of farmers harmed by the 
failure of the Liberal government to address the trade 
deficiencies internationally by which all farmers are harmed will 
actually receive any compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The end result of what my hon. colleague refers to is that 
western alienation will increase, and calls for Senate reform and 
for the heads of Liberal MPs will continue to increase. 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</b>  Madam Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak to today's supply motion.  My point is 
to qualify clearly that the Liberals have lost complete track of 
the electoral populace and that constituents have lost faith in 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday we heard the member for Charleswood St. 
James—Assiniboia state that task force members met with over 60 
individuals and organizations across Manitoba.  I congratulate 
those individuals for even being able to find the elusive Liberal 
task force.  Nobody even knows what its schedule is. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the committee actually listens to western Canadians its ears 
will be burning.  However I doubt that the Liberal caucus will 
learn much of substance from this task force for the Liberal 
disposition for not being able to face the truth will likely 
reign supreme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certain many people from Saskatchewan, Alberta and British 
Columbia are very pleased to learn that the Liberal alienation 
committee plans to come to their province.  I know numerous 
people in my home province of British Columbia who would love to 
meet with this task force and explain the facts of life in 
Canadian politics to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge them to release its schedule and ensure that all 
members of the public are welcome to explain why they feel 
abandoned, taxed to death and sick over the current state of the 
health care system among many other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first 31 years of my life I lived in southern Ontario. I 
recently spent a good deal of time particularly in southwest 
Ontario.  In this Liberal dominated province one would think that 
constituents would be pleased to be a part of the government 
majority.  Family, friends, acquaintances and even perfect 
strangers have been telling me about their very strong concerns 
about how the government operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to offer the top 10 concerns the people of Ontario 
have given to me about the Liberal government.  These are not my 
words but what they would like conveyed in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tenth, the Liberals have little or no grassroots involvement. 
The concept of actually having a bottom up form of government and 
ensuring that the people, the voters, the electorate, the ones 
who sent them here, actually have a say in what is going on is 
unheard of in the Liberal government.  The concept is lost in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ninth, the Liberals are not accountable for their actions.  As 
often as questions are raised on issues of the day, the Liberal 
government refuses to be accountable for its actions.  A classic 
case in point is the hepatitis C debacle.  Clearly the Liberal 
government erred in only including some of the hepatitis C 
victims in its compensation package.  It was an obvious error and 
many of its backbenchers felt so.  Yet the Liberals refused to 
account for and correct their past mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighth, the Liberal government is arrogant.  The Liberal 
government knows no bounds.  The decision making process in the 
House of Commons is an insult to democracy.  The Liberal 
government has limited debate in one form or another 50 times 
since it was first elected in 1993.  No other government in 
Canada's history has reached this number so quickly.  I find that 
absolutely appalling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventh, the Liberals run roughshod with aboriginal affairs. The 
people of Ontario are dismayed with the callous way the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development deals with 
people, native and non-native alike, in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Chatham—Kent were recently outraged when the 
Liberal government initiated a new reserve in their area.  The 
outrage was not aimed at the need for settlement of aboriginal 
claims but was aimed at the Liberals for not working with the 
local residents.  The residents wanted to be assured that the 
planned reserve would be compatible with current land uses and 
that an environmental impact assessment was completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 Dudley George was shot and killed at Ipperwash.  The 
dispute around Ipperwash Provincial Park has been ongoing for 
some time now, yet the Liberal government insists that it knows 
what is best.  The people of Ontario are still waiting for 
answers from the government for actions taken at Ipperwash four 
years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, the Liberals have poor ethics.  In the 1993 Liberal red 
book the Liberals stated that they would appoint an independent 
ethics counsellor who would report directly to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are in 1999 and guess what?  The ethics commissioner has 
been appointed by the Prime Minister but he reports only to the 
Prime Minister.  This in itself creates a conflict since the 
current debate over ethics concerns the Prime Minister's 
shenanigans in Shawinigan.  The office of the ethics commissioner 
only works when it is viewed as being unbiased by all.  This is 
not the case today.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, the Liberals disregard the auditor general.  Only in 
Canada could the office and authority of the auditor general be 
so blatantly ignored.  At this time the auditor general has not 
signed off on the past two budgets of this government. The 
accounting method for balancing the federal budget has been 
called into question.  New accounting methods have been invented. 
Other recommendations by the auditor general's office are 
blatantly ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the auditor general recommended more intensive efforts 
of consulting with parliament be made with regards to 
federal-provincial equalization payments, no such efforts have 
ever been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the Liberals are not trusted.  For many people of 
Ontario the level of trust for the Liberal government is at an 
all time low.  While the bank accounts of the average Canadian 
decreases, the finance department dips into the EI surplus in 
order to help balance the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conclusion drawn by Ontarians is that just prior to the next 
federal election being called, all sorts of election goodies are 
going to be carted out.  The people of Ontario are not blind to 
this action.  This sort of chicanery is obvious and will be 
remembered by the electorate when they have their say at the next 
general election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the Liberals gag their backbenchers.  Pavlov would be 
proud with the lever of control that the Prime Minister has over 
the Liberal backbenchers.  The Liberal backbenchers are not 
allowed to speak out on behalf of their own constituents.  It was 
sad to watch as Liberal members in an obvious conflict with their 
conscience, were not given the opportunity to vote as their 
constituents would have mandated on motions such as hepatitis C, 
child pornography and assorted private member's bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal backbench is under such tight control that these 
Ontario members must dread returning to their ridings and 
answering to the concerns of their own electorate.  I cannot 
imagine how I would feel if I could not look a constituent in the 
eye and tell him or her that I was able to vote on any given 
issue with a clear conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Liberals have destroyed the health care system. The 
Liberals have done more to institute a two tier health care 
system than any other government in Canada.  Since 1993 the 
Liberal government has reduced the Canada health and social 
transfer by over $21 billion.  Then the government had the 
audacity to put token amounts back into the CHST and ask to be 
thanked.  One of my hon. colleagues has described this as like 
thanking the mugger for bus fare after he stole your wallet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the federal Liberals were taking money out of the CHST, 
the Ontario provincial government was putting money in.  Between 
1995 and 1998, it actually increased provincial health care 
spending by $1.2 billion, more than any other province.  Why did 
it do this?   It had no other alternative in the face of the 
massive Liberal gutting of the health care system of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are indisputable facts and yet the Minister of Health 
criticizes the Harris government for reducing taxes instead of 
spending more on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number one reason Ontarians do not trust the Liberal 
government is simply because of overtaxation.  No matter who I 
talk to or where I am in Ontario, people are concerned with the 
high level of taxation they have to endure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that a family earning what should be a reasonable 
income can just make financial ends meet?  If they live frugally 
they can just get by.  Single income families face greater 
taxation than the dual income family earning the same amount.  EI 
payroll taxes are higher than the actuary recommends.  Bracket 
creep sucks millions of dollars out of the national economy and 
into the federal government's coffers.  Yet the Liberals just do 
not get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this motion states, I hope that if nothing else the Liberals 
will heed the call to listen, not just here but actually listen 
to what Ontarians and other Canadians are saying. Communication 
is a two way process and right now Liberals are not listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontarians and Canadians are not satisfied with the Liberal 
government for the Liberals have successfully alienated every 
part of this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):</b>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to ask the member opposite why his own party has 
been ignoring the growing western alienation that the Reform 
Party is facing by its grassroots supporters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, I want to draw the attention of this House to a 
radio broadcast that was on CBC Radio as I drove from my riding 
of York North to Ottawa yesterday. 
There were two grassroots members of the Reform Party and one 
member representing GUARD, a group that is very concerned about 
the demise of the Reform Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot begin to tell members how absolutely appalled and upset 
these individuals were that the leadership of the Reform Party 
was trying to foist a united alternative on their grassroots 
memberships without even the slightest bit of consultation or 
understanding of some of the issues that westerners face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member opposite, why is his party ignoring alienation, 
lacking consultation and not listening to the people in his own 
party whom he professes to represent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Reed Elley:</b>  Madam Speaker, I am absolutely thrilled 
to be able to get up and answer that question.  It is obviously 
apparent that the Liberals have no idea about what is going on in 
the Reform Party today.  The reason they do not is because such 
an open process of democratic decision making is total foreign to 
them.  They have no idea of this huge grassroots exercise that is 
going on in this country to determine the future of the Reform 
Party and ultimately the future of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has never been a more transparent process of trying to 
bring together like-minded Canadians across the country than what 
is going on with the united alternative today. If the hon. member 
ever cared to, she could come out and be an observer at these 
meetings and see what is actually going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than listening to the radio, why does the member not get 
out there and really see what is going on in the grassroots 
because that is what Reform is all about?  We are proud to have 
that kind of dissent in our party.  At the end of the day, we 
will go forward to make this country a better Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</b>  Madam 
Speaker, I kind of got a kick out of listening to the question 
coming from the other side.  I would like the hon. member to know 
that he answered it quite correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not afraid to stand in the House and say I am in 
disagreement with the united alternative.  This does not mean I 
am in disagreement or at odds with my leader.  It just means I am 
not afraid to come out in public and state my concerns because I 
know I will not have to sit in some far off place like the 
members of the Liberal Party, or ex-members of the Liberal Party, 
after they have talked about the government.  The members in that 
democratic party across the way either agree with what their 
leader says or they shut up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Reed Elley:</b>  Madam Speaker, this hon. colleague of 
mine standing up and saying what he has said is just an absolute 
example of what I was saying previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an open and honest debate in our party.  We brought this 
motion to the floor of the House today because we do not believe 
that Canadians across the country are well served at all by the 
undemocratic attitudes and actions of the Liberal Party which 
controls the Government of Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not have this kind of open debate in the country today

Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec), Lib.):</b> Madam 
Speaker, on behalf of the government and especially as Secretary 
of State for the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the 
Regions of Quebec, I am pleased to rise today to speak to the 
Reform Party motion which, as my colleague, the Secretary of 
State for Science, Research and Development mentioned earlier, 
can be interpreted in a variety of ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically I understand that this Reform Party motion is a 
further illustration of the attitude adopted since 1993 by 
opposition parties as a whole, but more particularly by that 
one, a negative attitude, which runs contrary to the democratic 
meaning of constructive opposition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully submit that we and Canadians as a whole should be 
entitled to constructive opposition. Unfortunately, the 
opposition parties as a whole tend too often to play petty 
politics. The interests of Canadians are too important for the 
government to put up with such rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, the government and the members of the Liberal Party 
have worked hard to manage public money in a responsible manner 
and to develop our regions' economy according to the realities 
in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I went to the archives to read a speech given in 
1969 by Jean Marchand, a famous politician we are proud of as 
Quebeckers and Canadians, when what was then called the 
Department of Regional Economic Expansion was established. It 
was obvious from this speech that the government wanted every 
region to have equal access to economic development 
opportunities. 
It tried to take all disparities into account and be 
sufficiently flexible to meet the very special needs of each 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Marchand's vision was realized.  We began with a national 
department and, at the time, this national department was 
required to consult with all other federal departments in the 
interest of improved co-ordination.  Today, we have three 
economic development agencies.  My colleague, the Secretary of 
State for Science and Technology, also mentioned another 
structure in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These agencies have maximum flexibility. 
They are there to operate in terms of the economic realities of 
each part of this country and, as the Secretary of State 
responsible for the Economic Development Agency of Canada, my 
mandate is to do what is in the best interest of Quebeckers.  In 
order to take the particular features of each region into 
account, the Prime Minister made sure that agencies could derive 
the maximum benefit from economic development policies during 
the latest government reorganization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We put the three agencies under one umbrella, Industry Canada, 
so that the agency and its economic development policies would 
be adapted to what the regions were facing and so that there 
would be a sense of family, the broader co-operation people had 
in mind when the Department of Regional Economic Expansion was 
created, which makes it possible to derive the maximum benefit 
from economic development policies designed with the entire 
country in mind while still taking into account the realities, 
needs and viewpoints of each of the agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I am proud to say that Canada has always been seen as an 
international leader in the area of regional economic development. 
Especially under the Liberal Party of Canada, this country has 
been able to create an approach which has made it the envy of 
many OECD member countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our effort to adapt to changes and to a variety of 
requirements, we have also had a program review, which 
represented a major turning point for all of my colleagues. 
When we speak of re-examining the way the Canadian government is 
involved in various areas of jurisdiction, we are also referring 
to the economic development of the regions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, those of us at Economic Development Canada 
had, if I remember correctly, some 42 or 43 programs.  As a 
result of program review, we created one program for SMBs, 
initially called IDEE-PME. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also rethought our mandate on involvement in the regions, 
stressing the core of economic development which, as you may 
have guessed, is small and medium size business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, taking advantage of program review, we 
re-examined our role.  That exercise brought us to the conclusion 
that Economic Development Canada's activities would involve 
multiple roles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to say that Economic Development Canada is the main 
gateway for any SMB that wants to have dealings with the federal 
government, the Canadian government.  When they want information 
on all of the programs available in the departments, Economic 
Development Canada is the main gateway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the important roles of myself and my team is the 
responsibility to represent within the federal machinery all the 
various issues relating to economic development that concern 
Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another facet of our mandate, and an important one, is promoting 
to the entire population of Quebec the various services of the 
Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention that we set up in 1997 what we called 
small and medium business fairs.  This is a Government of Canada 
event that travels to all of Canada's regions.  As regards my 
mandate, obviously, we are talking about Quebec.  These fairs 
travel around to inform business people and those who will be in 
business of changes we have made since 1993 and of the various 
services available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to tell you that, in 1997-98, there were eight small 
and medium business fairs in Quebec, and 11,000 business people 
or future business people had access to these services of the 
Government of Canada.  They had access to major seminars on ways 
to set up a business, how to export and new economic realities. 
They also had access to our services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998-99, five fairs were held and 5,345 present or upcoming 
business people attended and had access to this source of 
information.  The fairs are a mine of important information.  We 
business people know we are living in a new era.  Often ready 
access to information means a capital gain that makes us more 
competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all, our concerted intervention has enabled 16,345 people in 
business to understand or better understand the federal machine 
and, in many cases as well, I hope, find programs that suit 
their needs.  Or perhaps they met people, experts, who could 
help them with certain problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another equally important aspect of our role is to resolve 
special mandates, hence the flexibility.  The flexibility we 
sought in 1969 continues to be reflected in the Canadian machine 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some examples of special mandates: the management of 
the Canada-Quebec infrastructure program, which was given to 
Canada Economic Development for the province of Quebec, and the 
strategy for the Greater Montreal, on which I will report in the 
near future. During the July 1996 torrential rains, initiatives 
were also taken to help affected regions, and a liaison office 
was set up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also mention the implementation of an economic recovery 
program following the ice storm. There is also a special and 
specific initiative for communities affected by the groundfish 
crisis called the Quebec coastal fund. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT43"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT43"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1335

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important initiative because we know that there is 
currently a groundfish crisis affecting certain regions of 
Quebec and, of course, of Atlantic Canada. As a government, we 
reacted quickly and very matter-of-factly to these new situations. 
Our goal is to help all the individuals affected, but also the 
communities affected, in terms of their economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The specific initiative regarding the groundfish crisis includes 
an economic development component. The responsibility for that 
component was given to Canada Economic Development. 
We are currently talking about a fund of close to $20 million—and 
I recently had an opportunity to see the situation first hand in 
the affected regions—that was put at the disposal of Canada 
Economic Development. This organization manages that fund along 
with its other responsibilities. From March 1996 to December 
1998, investments of $9.1 million were made in Quebec. The total 
investments generated in Quebec regions to help people rethink 
their economic safety net are of the order of $30 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A total of 203 projects and 560 jobs were either created or 
maintained in the regions that experienced particular problems. 
This regional development policy is one that reflects the 
Canadian way of doing things and which, to some extent, is 
despised by opposition parties. 
Thanks to this policy, these regions finally got a chance to 
take another look at how they did things and to rebuild an 
economic net so that their communities could again hold their 
heads up, create jobs and generally get back on track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a great variety of projects, including the one in 
support of the Pied du Vent cheese factory in Havre-aux-Maisons in 
the Magdalen Islands, which received $80,000 from the Quebec 
coastal fund; of fisheries such as Marinar Limitée in 
Rivière-aux-Renards; of Ghislain Tanguay Complexe and Chez Maxime 
Enr. on the Lower North Shore, and at Baie-Johan-Beetz, where we 
have also invested in some very special projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the things we are doing that show the Canadian 
government's flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could also mention some of the results. 
Earlier, I mentioned the Canada-Quebec infrastructure program run 
by Economic Development Canada. This program has had amazing 
success across the country and which has also shown that when we 
work as partners, when the parties and the various levels of 
government set aside their purely political interests and look 
at what is best for the public, together we can accomplish quite 
extraordinary things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We funded 3,250 projects under the Canada-Quebec infrastructure 
program.  The Canadian government contributed $633 million, and 
$2.7 billion in investments were generated.  An estimated 35,646 
jobs were created or maintained through this partnership. That 
is our role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the programming of Economic Development Canada, 
which we have tailored to the new economic realities.  The 
IDEA-SME program enables us to intervene within the limitations 
of our jurisdiction and our expertise and to provide to all 
regions of Quebec an attractive partnership with the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>IDEA-SME is an intervention in the areas of innovation, design, 
research and development.  It encourages entrepreneurship in all 
regions of Quebec and of course helps them develop export 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second program we created a little over a year ago is the 
Regional Strategic Initiatives Program. 
Its purpose is, if I may put it that way, to push to the 
limits—although there will perhaps never be any limit—the 
government's desire to work in partnership with all regions and 
to ensure the structuring of programs which truly correspond to 
the realities and needs of the local people. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus the Regional Strategic Initiatives Program enables us in 
each region of Quebec to structure an intervention which did not 
originate in my office but rather is prepared in a partnership 
with the stakeholders of economic development in each region. 
Its results truly speak for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the east of Quebec is concerned, we have announced a 
Regional Strategic Initiative called Technopol Maritimes.  And 
in the greater Quebec City region, there is another RSI aimed at 
developing a techno-region with an international outreach.  In 
Chaudière-Appalaches there is RSI-Amiante. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through these specific initiatives, we have so far allocated 
$72.4 million to the regions of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, when we talk about economic development, we refer to 
initiatives that involve public moneys, but it is important to 
realize that, in the context of globalization and the new means 
of communication, the role that governments must play has 
changed completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about regional economic development, we must think 
in terms of partnerships, of the networks that we can provide to 
a region, and also at the international level. We must include 
the expertise, experience and economic development tools such 
as, for example, Industry Canada's Strategis web site, which is 
the largest commercial site in Canada, if not in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to partnerships, we have also created special links 
with the community futures development corporations in Quebec. 
These 54 corporations do a remarkable job and I believe they 
will play an increasingly important role within the great 
Canadian family, in terms of delivering services. Community 
futures development corporations have existed for 20 years in 
that format or in another and they currently provide good 
expertise that complements the input provided by the Canada 
Economic Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When governments want to work together, when we recognize that 
the concept of economic development has evolved over the last 
decade to encompass expertise, partnership and networking, when 
we recognize this together, I think there is an opportunity for 
all those who want to help do something about economic 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's strategy is working and respects the 
legitimate aspirations of the regions, and under no 
circumstances will members on this side of the House sit back 
while the opposition parties trivialize the very important 
things we have done for all regions of Quebec and of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</b> Madam 
Speaker, the Secretary of State for economic development for the 
regions of Quebec criticized at the start of his speech the so 
called petty politics of the opposition parties.  I would ask 
him to talk about the grand policies he intends to follow in 
partnership with the regions, by responding to three questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can he assure us that he does not manage his portfolio according 
to partisan criteria?  Is the money provided in Quebec ridings, 
apart from for the ice storm and catastrophes provided fairly as 
was the case with the infrastructure program, because the 
Government of Quebec at the time had a say in it, as did the 
municipalities, naturally? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also ask him why, since he wants to work in partnership 
with the regions—he has said nothing of the Government of 
Quebec—he does not consider the strategic plans of the regional 
development councils in Quebec, in providing the money?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does he not allow to sit on the CFDCs the regional 
organizations funded by his department, someone from the 
regional development council, an existing structure, whose 
representatives he has up to now refused to consider? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</b> Madam Speaker, I am most happy that the 
member for Lévis asked this question. The only thing that 
saddens me is that I have little time to answer it. I could 
speak on the issue quite easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards petty politics and since my colleague has raised the 
issue, I must admit the idea crossed my mind, more specifically 
in reference to members of the Bloc. Why? Because some two or 
three weeks ago, I had the opportunity to deliver the main 
speech during a small and medium-size business fair. 
Presentations were followed by a period of questions from 
participants. 
Common sense commands us to give the floor, not for a political 
debate but to give participating entrepreneurs a chance to put 
questions to their elected representatives and to those up front 
who have expertise and some knowledge to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the fair I mentioned I was amazed to see that a 
representative of the Bloc held the floor during the whole 
question period—which was short—in order to denigrate the Canadian 
government whose goal was to inform the population about 
services it can offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is rather a peculiar way of doing things. I want to assure 
Canadians that this is not the way Liberal members do things. We 
defend the interests of Canadians.

which is not very efficient as we know.

British Columbia.

Columbia without emergency preparedness.

cheap politics with my province and other provinces, and the

which I could talk for hours.

of the Reform Party have a bad understanding of what economic 
development is all about.  That is why I have been explaining it 
for the past 20 minutes.  Following the question of the Reform 
member, I realized that they do not only have a huge 
misunderstanding of economic development, they also have a huge 
misunderstanding about what a federation is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working together to help Canadians across the country. Of 
course when we talk about a federation, some parts of Canada they 
will get more for specific portfolios.  Certain parts of Canada 
they will get more for immigration, for instance.  Central Canada 
may get more in terms of economic development.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</b>  Madam 
Speaker, I know what the minister's answer is to economic 
development.  He mentioned it in his speech.  He said it was 
intervention based on taxpayer dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government's idea is to take taxpayer dollars and 
redistribute them in an unequal way, as my hon. colleague from 
Surrey just mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the minister a specific question.  He talked about 
having an open attitude in his speech.  The Liberal task force 
will be going to the west, and perhaps to Atlantic Canada and 
Quebec later on because they are lacking seats there too.  This 
question was asked earlier of his colleague, the minister 
responsible for western economic diversification.  If this 
government has an open attitude, why does it have closed 
meetings?  If it is going to find out what people want to hear 
about and why they are feeling alienated in these regions, why 
does this government, with an open attitude, have closed meetings 
instead of open public meetings to have real input from people 
and not just selected groups of people for manufactured consent? 
Why does it not have open public meetings? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</b>  Madam Speaker, the media were at the 
meeting to which they referred.

diversification on an equal basis, and we all know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something that is annoying.  The hon. member of the

economic development of a region, but it is a whole vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned in my 20 minute speech that we are proceeding in 
terms of repayable contributions, but today economic development 
is more than that.  It is expertise.  It is net worth.  It is 
making sure that our industries in the regions across Canada have 
access to export markets.

I am pleased to take part in the debate today on the alienation 
of most of this country or, better put, how Canadians perceive 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's task force was to seek out information from 
Manitobans on the future of Manitoba.  Manitobans know about 
their future and they also have a vision for their future.  What 
we want from this government and all federal governments is more 
transparency and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Manitobans speak daily to their members of parliament. 
Hopefully their members of parliament echo their concerns in the 
House.  Does the government listen to the concerns that are raised 
in the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me do a quick review of some of the concerns that are raised 
by Manitobans:  Bill C-68, the wheat board monopoly, unfair 
justice appointments, the use of federal spending powers to 
interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction, the giveaway of 
our rail assets to CNR, the rail abandonment issue, little return 
of $5 billion in fuel tax paid by consumers, waste and 
mismanagement of Indian affairs, and repayment of the flood 
compensation given to Manitobans.  Most of these issues have been 
debated in the House over the course of the last two years.  If 
only the government would listen.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the further away you are from Ottawa, the less input one 
has.  The decisions are made without the interests of the people 
from that region.  The solution to reducing alienation would be 
to have more members of parliament interacting with the municipal 
leaders on a regular basis, from all parties.  This would develop 
rapport.  One would feel that they were becoming part of the 
total team, rather than feeling isolated as we are today from 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also dissatisfied that the Minister of Natural Resources, a 
westerner, is not echoing the needs of farmers.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the Minister of Foreign Affairs' intervention and 
assistance in privatizing the rail line in the port of Churchill. 
This gives Churchill the opportunity to look after its own 
future.  Ottawa is too far away.  Currently Churchill has 
embarked on a tripartite partnership with the Winnipeg Airport 
Authority and Omnitrax to develop future business for the rail 
line, the airport and the port of Churchill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, when it comes to airports, lacks vision 
for the future.  It can only think of saving money for the 
present.  It bewilders me that the port is not utilized to its 
potential.  The Canadian Wheat Board must ship more grain through 
the port of Churchill instead of east-west.  We are up against 
the big business of east and west coast terminals.

hinterland, that we are the resource base for the east.  That is 
the real attitude of the rural municipality of Dauphin.  The east 
has had all the power and still does today.  The only way to 
resolve this is to get rid of the Senate as it operates today or 
make it equal.

know where our money is going; right into the big pockets of 
Ottawa.  I don't think we get our fair share on transfer 
payments.  Being far away doesn't help the feeling that we are 
alienated from Ottawa.  We feel that Ontario and Quebec get 
preferential treatment over everyone else in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</b>   Mr. Speaker, the 
Royal Canadian Air Force was officially established 75 years ago 
on April 1, 1924. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the second world war, Canadian pilots flew with dedication 
and heroism beside our allies to establish peace.  Canadian 
aviators flew in the Korean War and served in Europe throughout 
the cold war.  In 1991 our pilots tasted battle again, flying a 
variety of missions during the gulf war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At home the air force conducts a number of missions, including 
search and rescue, med-evac operations and fire evacuations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Abroad, air crews have provided support to peacekeeping missions 
in the Congo and Kashmir.  Canadian pilots have brought critical 
supplies to the displaced and dispossessed after natural 
disasters.  In Rwanda, for a time, we alone provided airlift.  We 
were one of the nations providing the humanitarian air bridge to 
besieged Sarajevo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this very moment, Canadian aviators are flying in the Balkans 
with 12 CF-18s, two Hercules and personnel aboard NATO AWACS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The air force motto is as relevant today as it was 75 years ago, 
“Through adversity to the stars”.

in 1971 a group of parents and community-minded individuals in

absolutely essential.  The Prime Minister says that Russian

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are watching with growing horror the unfolding 
disaster of NATO's bombing campaign in the Balkans, with innocent 
civilians dying on a passenger train yesterday, cross-border 
attacks in Albania and a growing flood of desperate refugees.

calling for an emergency meeting of the G-8 nations, and will he

<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</b> 
Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member had read the communique issued 
yesterday at the NATO meetings, we in fact had a very specific 
proposal to reach out to the Russians, to work with them to try 
to find a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just today the secretary of state of the United States met with 
the foreign minister of Russia to determine whether there would 
be grounds for a G-8 meeting.  We are certainly not opposed to 
that, but there must be Russian acceptance of a basic fact, that 
there must be an international force in Kosovo to protect the 
refugees.  Without that no agreement is worth having.  We must 
protect those innocent people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</b>  Mr. 
Speaker, no one disagrees that we must protect the innocent 
civilians and the refugees in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that the minister does not seem to understand is 
that NATO troops who have been involved in bombing in Serbia 
cannot then be involved in a peacekeeping force in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister not understand and will he not take to the 
NATO council the reality that a peacekeeping force in Kosovo must 
be made up of non-combatant troops under UN command?  Will he not 
take that to NATO?

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</b> 
Mr. Speaker, what I understand, which apparently the hon. member 
does not, is that right now there are hundreds of members of the 
armed forces of NATO countries who are involved in doing exactly 
that, protecting the life and dignity and integrity of people in 
Kosovo against the repressions of the Milosevic government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</b> Mr. Speaker, a 
number of things confirm that the Kosovo conflict is spreading 
to more regions, perhaps even to others countries, which means 
that sending ground forces would appear to many to be 
increasingly necessary, if not the only solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, we learned that the Yugoslav government has voted in 
favour of the federation joining the union of Russia and

that the Serbian army had crossed the Albania-Kosovo border, in 
order to confront the Kosovo Liberation Army in three villages 
and put an end to the fighting between the two. 
Today, my colleague for Compton—Stanstead tells us that Canada 
has moved far further ahead than planned.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I would like to hear the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
tells us what he thinks of the Kosovo Liberation Army, commonly 
known as the UCK.  In his opinion, is it a real or potential 
ally for NATO against Milosevic, is it too extremist to be an 
ally, or is it a group of no importance which might do more harm 
than good?

Mr. Speaker, at the NATO meetings yesterday we had the

</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very clear that we all felt that it was very important to 
encourage the moderate leadership among the Kosovars who can help 
in the redevelopment, help in the rebuilding of government and 
help in the re-establishment of a social society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to one central point.  That will only happen 
when the Milosevic regime agrees to the principles which say that 
it has to withdraw its troops, it has to quit harassing and 
exploiting refugees, and it must stop using armed force against 
its own citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left>You're never really part of the system if you're west of the 
Ontario border.  The provinces do the same thing.  They tend to 
alienate communities if they're located too far from Winnipeg. 
Distance doesn't help feeling you're a part of something. The 
solution is that the federal government needs to demonstrate a 
willingness to work with the provinces on all fronts.  The feds 
can surely do something about levelling the playing field so that 
aboriginal businesses don't have the upper hand over 
non-aboriginal businesses.  We need more free votes in the House 
of Commons so that local issues can be brought to the House for 
debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The perception, whether true or not, is that decisions are made

</I></B></P><P align=left>Alienation by Ottawa is evident by the frustration municipalities 
have in dealing with the federal bureaucracies. Case in point, 
Ottawa has broken off negotiations with Thompson in dealing with 
the transfer of the regional airport.  The federal system has 
little credibility.  Look at the GST promise, the Airbus scandal, 
the cancelling of the helicopter deal, the cancellation of the 
Pearson airport deal.  The federal system needs fixing.

the stops of the task force: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My solution for the federal government on the issue of alienation 
is that Ottawa needs to treat all parts of the country equally. 
We all know that discrimination causes only conflicts within our 
country. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reeve Dwayne Lawless from the rural municipality of Rossburn: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa is far removed from here.  They don't listen to our 
concerns.  Case in point, with the reorganization and cutback of 
the local RCMP, why is it always that the locals are at the 
receiving end of the cutbacks?  I'll bet that the RCMP in Ottawa 
isn't reduced.  They should be cutting at the top, not the bottom 
where real policing needs to take place.  We've lost control over 
government.  They do as they want.  Another case in point, the 
gun control Bill C-68.  They keep pouring good money after bad. 
It would be better to put that money into the pockets of farmers 
who are about to go broke instead of into registering long guns, 
which will do nothing to reduce crime.  People feel alienated 
from big government and are not happy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received numerous calls on the farm aid package.  These 
calls were very negative.  These farmers, the likes of Richard 
Cleland and Ken Caldwell of Rossburn and John Puchailo of Gilbert 
Plains, are very disillusioned about the AIDA program.  The 
method of calculation will ensure that very few, if any, farmers 
will receive assistance at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are smart businessmen.  They write off most of their 
earnings into future business capital needs.  Farmers are 
frustrated with the AIDA program.  Farmers are being informed 
that it will cost them between $500 and $800 to get the 
applications filled out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force of the Prime Minister started on the wrong foot. 
When the task force was first announced in Manitoba in January, 
the chairman, the member for Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, 
indicated to the Winnipeg press that the Liberal task force would 
not consider any recommendations for change to the Firearms Act. 
How ironic.  On the one hand the task force was to listen to 
Manitobans and on the other hand the task force would not listen 
to any concerns about the gun control Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one objects to consulting Canadians.  It is the process we 
object to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments at all levels are elected to serve all their 
constituents.  We are all Canadians and want to be treated 
equally.  Manitobans have said to me that Ottawa does not treat 
them in an equal manner.  This of course creates the feeling of 
alienation. I believe the only solution is for Ottawa to start 
listening to all members of parliament in this House and to start 
treating all parts of this country equally irrespective of 
political parties.  All Canadians deserve good government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The gentleman mentioned the Prime Minister's task force on the 
four western provinces of which I am proud to be a member.  Last 
week I visited Manitoba and I returned on the same airplane as 
this gentleman.  I have been visiting the west for 45 years and I 
enjoy every part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understood the hon. member said that only Liberals were 
invited to appear before the task force.  We had the chamber of 
commerce and municipal representatives.  For example, in Brandon, 
Manitoba council members were present. I understand that the 
mayor was out of the city.  I believe most of the members were 
there and I can assure everyone that they were not all Liberals. 
After we broke the session we had some conversations with these 
people and they were critical of our government.  It was an 
opportunity to listen to people and to hear their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We met with the Women's Institute representing rural Canada.  We 
met with economic development groups.  We met with the Canadian 
Federation of Agriculture.  We met with the Keystone Agriculture 
Producers organization of Manitoba.  We met with these people and 
listened to them.  They gave us ideas to bring back to share with 
our colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member, did he put on the record that the witnesses to 
our task force were only Liberals by invitation only? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Inky Mark:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite 
for the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I actually quoted the reeve from the rural municipality of 
Ethelbert.  She said that she had heard about the Liberal task 
force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can certainly explain the real workings of what happened with 
the task force.  My staff in my riding in Manitoba have followed 
the works of the task force since January.  We called the office 
of the member for Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia several times 
to get a schedule for the meetings and information on how one 
would access the meetings.  We received requests from 
constituents in terms of how to access the hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately right up to the week previous we could not get a 
schedule of the meetings and no one seemed to know how to access 
them.  It certainly was one of the best kept secrets of the task 
force.  I would have appeared before the task force just to 
listen to the concerns of Manitobans.  That is the reality of how 
the task force worked in Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not that we do not support public consultation; we all do 
it.  We need to do it, but it is how this Liberal government is 
doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Larry McCormick:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I want to mention to my 
hon. member colleague that these were public consultations. 
Members of parliament did not appear before us.  We did not have 
any members on this side of the House or on that side of the 
House appear before us.  It was not a political exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as my colleague saying that he did not have access to our 
program and schedule, I was not in charge of that.  I certainly 
would not want my colleague to say to Canadians that we were 
there only to listen to elected members.  Yes, we listened to 
municipal people who are elected but we did not have any of the 
provincial people there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me that just before the break, Tony Clement, the 
minister of transport for Ontario, came to one of the standing 
committees.  The Reform Party brought the minister into the room 
and wanted him to appear as a witness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Inky Mark:</b>  Mr. Speaker, the whole idea of this task 
force I believe was to consult the public.  We cannot consult the 
public if we do not tell the public where we are going to be and 
do not give them the access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not talking about asking members of parliament to go before 
the task force.  The grassroots people are the ones.  I spoke to 
probably 15 different mayors and reeves.  I called them on the 
telephone and asked each one of them what they knew about the 
task force.  Other than a few of the big city mayors, they did 
not know a thing about the task force.

the trips I have made to New Brunswick and how people in the east 
end of the country are feeling just as frustrated with the 
Liberal government as they are in the west.  Maybe the Liberals 
can get a little task force together to look into the alienation 
of Atlantic Canadians as well, because I am sure they would get 
some news from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is spring.  You and I, Mr. Speaker, have just come back here 
from Edmonton.  The snow has gone there and we have fresh clean 
air.  It is wonderful that spring has hit Canada. It would be 
terrific if spring and some fresh air were to move through the 
House of Commons.  It would be just super.  It is certainly time 
for spring in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at a new country.  The next spring that this 
country sees will be in the new millennium.  It would be terrific 
to do some spring house cleaning as well and see a new government 
in Ottawa so that we could bring about some real changes, serious 
changes that would make Canadians from coast to coast feel proud 
to be Canadian again.  I was speaking with someone last week who 
does not feel proud to be Canadian any more.  That hurts all of 
our hearts, regardless of what side of the House we are on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to ask the people of New Brunswick for some of their 
feedback.  I am a westerner.  Although I spend time in Atlantic 
Canada from time to time, I do not understand everything about it 
and never pretended to.  I thought the best way would be to go to 
source and talk to New Brunswickers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sent out a form to several people asking them to distribute it 
around New Brunswick.  I put two comments on the form asking for 
responses: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>1.  Here's how one Liberal policy in Ottawa has severely affected 
me and my fellow New Brunswickers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2.  Here's how I would fix that Liberal policy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People had an opportunity to send in real comments and say this 
is how Liberal policy has affected them in New Brunswick as a New 
Brunswicker.  I have had several responses from people.  It is 
amazing the feedback that came from them.  I suggest the Liberals 
should listen to this also because they will find some incredible 
parallels to the task force on western alienation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number one was no surprise, taxes.  People were concerned about 
taxes.  They say taxes are grossly unfair, discriminatory and too 
high.  That is no surprise, no matter what corner of the country 
they live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals promise job and wealth creation and they keep New 
Brunswick back from its potential.  What a sad story it is to see 
people from across the country faxing MPs to say that taxes keep 
New Brunswick back from its potential.  That is the saddest thing 
to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What federal taxes do New Brunswickers want reformed?  Their 
biggest concern was about extending the tax deduction to single 
income families.  We know this has been prevalent in the news 
lately, but we have seen a lot of people come forward like 
Kimberly Oliver who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel single income families are unfairly taxed.  A stay at home 
parent cannot get a part time job because they lose it all at tax 
time at year end.

taxes and they know the price that they are paying in the high

little areas here and there, but complete tax breaks across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lower payroll taxes.  We have gone around and around in the 
House about that as well.  The government might just bubble forth 
here and tell us how it has dropped the EI rate, but it forgets

disconcerting.  I have invested both time and money into my 
education in hopes to make a better life for myself, my family

predecessors) have seen fit to saddle me (and all Canadians) with 
a tax system that will make this very difficult.

work.  They want to pay taxes but not high discriminatory taxes 
so they are burdened to death.

CPP issue again.  Our plan is to rescue the Canadian pension plan 
from bankruptcy through guaranteeing full benefits to Canadian 
seniors and creating super individually vested RRSPs that will 
allow Canadians to secure their own retirement without being 
taxed to death, perhaps before their natural time.

old camper trailer the government gets HST.  Somebody sells it

care and education funding.  Eric Banks from Second Falls, New 
Brunswick, wrote:

networking.  They sound so glossy, but basically it is a knife in 
the back.  The Liberals are cutting them but if they dress it up 
with a fancy name and it will be oh so painless.  That is 
scandalous and the government should be ashamed of itself, 
especially when it announced in its budget all the wonderful 
billions of dollars going back into health care.  It cut $20 
billion and put $11.5 billion in.  Then it tries to tell me, 
an English major, that this is good math.  Even I can figure 
out that it does not make much sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third major issue that New Brunswickers talked about was gun 
registration.  The present plan will not work.  We have raised 
the issue that the wonderful firearm centre that is doing such 
tremendous work is sending out firearm acquisition certificates 
with somebody else's picture on it.  As good looking as you may 
be, Mr. Speaker, I am sure you would not want your picture on 
someone else's FAC.  It would not be a good thing.  Nor would 
your twin.  I know he would be equally scandalized.

many cod seals are eating.  Again, Eric Banks from Second Falls

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth issue is EI reform for seasonal workers.  Many people 
in New Brunswick are seasonal workers.  I have information from 
people there who said there was a problem with EI, and 
specifically the intensity rule, for people to be able to say 
that they work seasonally.  Some of these industries are

reception by the wonderful people of western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We held public sessions in several ridings, in several centres 
across Manitoba.  We started in Winnipeg and we went north.  We 
were in several ridings.  Actually we were in ridings that were 
represented by at least three parties in the House.  We were not 
there to lobby one group or another.  We were there to listen to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tell my colleague who just spoke that we are a party that 
represents all parts of Canada.  We did not just target ridings 
held by one group of people.  Is this not evident in the results 
in the Windsor—St. Clair byelection yesterday?  We got more 
votes.  I feel for some parties because they will not even get 
back their deposit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this byelection result not reflect the fact the Reform

of the confines of representing a few people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Miss Deborah Grey:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad to hear the 
meetings were so well attended in Manitoba.  In fact I have been 
talking about New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me those meetings were by invitation only.  It seems 
as though we have to be members of a secret society to get in on 
some of these meetings that the Liberals are holding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be really smart to put a general advertisement in the 
newspapers.  If the Liberals are so concerned about finding out 
what westerners think, because he is back to the west now, surely 
to goodness they could make sure those meetings are well 
publicized and get everybody out to listen to their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member talks about Liberals being the national 
party across the country, I might remind him of the seats that 
they lost in New Brunswick, to which I was just referring, and 
Nova Scotia.  I must remember one of his friends, Doug Young, had 
some EI policies in New Brunswick.  He knows exactly what 
happened to him, a very senior minister in cabinet who was gone 
after that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the west because the hon. member seems 
obsessed with that.  Let us talk about the seats that were lost 
in Manitoba by the Liberals.  Let us look at Saskatchewan for 
just a minute.  There is one lonely Liberal soul left from 
Saskatchewan. He has a wonderful tan today and he sits on the 
front bench, but irrelevant is irrelevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us move on to Alberta.  Let us have a little look at Alberta 
for Liberals.  They did not have a seat for a generation.  They 
managed to squeak out four seats, probably purely by accident, in 
the 1993 election.  Then we cut that in half to two seats, one of 
which I snapped away from a Liberal on June 2, 1997.  It was a 
wonderful night in my life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at B.C. if we are talking about a national party. 
There are precious few Liberals left.  I dare the member and his 
Liberal friend from B.C. to put a public advertisement in the 
paper and invite people far and wide; not like the Minister of 
Justice, one of the two Liberals left in Alberta, who had a 
fundraising event recently and someone paid $800 to have supper 
with her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a steal, $800 to have supper with the justice minister. 
Guess who is not coming to dinner.  It is the justice minister 
because she found out that one of the people who paid $800, one 
of the guests, was going to be the president of the National 
Firearms Association, a perfectly civil, polite fellow.  Then 
Link Byfield was coming to supper too, the editor of the 
<I>Alberta Report</I>.   What do we think happened?  Guess who is 
not coming for supper.  One of those Liberals. 
They paid $800 to have supper with her, but because she only 
wanted to have supper with Liberals, she would not have supper 
with them.  If it is a truly national party and if it is proud of 
its stuff, it ought to have supper with anyone and brag about it.

North who, I guess, was obviously on some kind of a vacation in 
New Brunswick.  I did not know Reformers actually travelled east 
of the Manitoba border except to come to this place.  Obviously, 
they are out campaigning on their own, talking to New 
Brunswickers, doing what I am sure they are accusing us of doing, 
looking for candidates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the member should have spent some time in the byelection 
in Windsor where this party did not even get its deposit back, 
where this party came fourth, where this party got a message from 
the voters in Ontario that some day it is going to wake up and 
understand that those voters have no time for the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been advised that I am splitting my time with my good 
friend from Vancouver Quadra. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find astounding is the fact that we are debating what 
could only be called one of the silliest motions that I have ever 
seen in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night through until 8 o'clock this morning, members of all 
parties stood in the House and talked about the war.  Like it or 
not, this country is involved in a serious conflict and all we 
get from the member opposite is her travelogue from New 
Brunswick.  Members should instead be standing up in the House 
and talking about important issues such as the war.  What do we 
get on an opposition day? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night in a question period, the members opposite berated 
the government for not having a vote.  While the lives of our 
fighting men and women are at risk, they wanted to play politics. 
They wanted to have a vote.  That is terrific.  This is the vote. 
We are going to vote on whether or not we should join our 
partners in NATO.  Once we have had that vote, then we will send 
the message over to Mr. Milosevic, who I am sure will be busy 
listening to C-SPAN to hear exactly what we are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they wanted a vote on any of those issues, why would they not 
take that opportunity today?  It is their day.  The Canadian 
people should know that this is opposition day.  The Reform 
Party, as the official opposition, has the option of putting 
forward almost any motion it wants, save and except a spending 
bill, for debate in this place, and then at the end of the day we 
would vote on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the Reform Party not stand up in this place and 
introduce a motion to have a vote, in whatever way it wanted to 
frame it, surrounding the issue of the war in Kosovo?  Why would 
it not do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today of all days, when we awake this morning to the news that 
the Yugoslav army has invaded Albania with ground troops, we are 
talking to a motion that says we should rename a government 
caucus task force, the liberation alienation committee, something 
about alienating the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we not be debating the issues that Canadians have on 
their minds today?  Canadians are worried about the men and women 
who are in Europe defending freedom and democracy, defending the 
refugees in that part of the world.  Canadians are worried about 
the potential influx of thousands of refugees and how we are 
going to take care of them.  They are calling all of our offices 
as MPs and opening up their hearts, wallets and homes to try to 
help these people, and the best the Reform Party can do is come 
up with some cockamamie motion about renaming a government task 
force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess its nose is out of joint because the task force has 
found it necessary to go into the ridings represented by 
Reformers in western Canada and meet with people.  We get phone 
calls from those people telling us their member of parliament has 
not told them about the details of the millennium fund, or their 
member of parliament has not told them about the details of the 
tax cuts in the recent budget. 
Why would the Reform Party not do that?  I believe it is not 
doing its jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I really do not care whether the members opposite agree with the 
millennium fund program.  I really do not care whether or not 
they agree with the western diversification programs that are 
going on in western Canada.  Whether they care or agree is not 
the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once members of parliament are elected, they are obligated to 
represent everyone in their constituency whether or not they 
voted for them or carry the party card.  They are not allowed to 
be partisan when it comes to representing the constituents in 
their communities.  They are not allowed to display partisan 
material in their offices.  There is a good reason for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was elected the member for Mississauga West, it was my 
duty and sworn responsibility to represent everyone whether they 
voted New Democrat or Tory.  I know they certainly did not vote 
Bloc.   A few in my riding voted Reform, although I do not 
believe they got their deposit back.  This is a message that some 
of them should think about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The battle cry of the Reform Party when it was formed some years 
ago was that the west wants in.  Let me give some examples 
because the Reform members do not think that the west is in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have representatives doing terrific work and actually 
handling constituency complaints from ridings represented by 
Reformers because they are not doing their jobs.  We have a 
dedicated, honest and hard-working woman in Vancouver Kingsway. 
Members will hear shortly from the member for Vancouver—Quadra. 
We have a former mayor of Coquitlam who is a terrific, 
hard-working member for his constituents.  We have the member for 
Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia.  We have the members for 
Winnipeg South, Winnipeg North—St. Paul and Provencher.  The 
west wants in.  How much more in would it like? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans who has stood up 
and made sure, for the first time, that somebody is doing 
something about the fish.  Is that not a revolution?  Is that not 
a reform?  This motion is about the west, but the truth is that 
our fisheries in eastern Canada were destroyed by former Tory 
ministers.  This minister is fighting for them as he is for the 
salmon in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Revenue has changed the collection agency to 
make it a responsive agency.  The Minister of Multiculturalism 
and the Status of Women stood in this place and defended single 
parents and single stay at home moms.  The Minister for 
Asia-Pacific is representing and fighting on behalf of human 
rights issues all around the world.  The Minister of Justice 
recently introduced amendments to the Young Offenders Act that 
are being lauded across the country.  The Minister of Natural 
Resources is a fighter on behalf of the changes in the Kyoto 
agreement.  The Minister of External Affairs, who nobody can say 
anything negative about, is one of the greatest parliamentarians 
in this place.  He is a man known around the world for leading 
the fight to ban land mines.  The west is clearly in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party should be looking at the Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification who is trying to find a way to funnel 
energy and economic growth into western Canada.  All of these 
ministers are at the table on behalf of the people in western 
Canada.  The additional members are in caucus fighting every day 
on behalf of their constituents and are doing the job that 
members in the Reform Party fail to do for their constituents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I 
agree with the member.  The business of this House is to discuss 
the important issues of the day.  Therefore, I ask my hon. 
Liberal colleague why it was the Reform Party that initiated the 
discussion on hepatitis C compensation?  Why was it the Reform 
Party that initiated the discussion on child pornography and the 
Young Offenders Act?  Why was it the Reform Party that initiated 
the discussion on tax relief when it did not come, despite 
election promises?  Why was it the Reform Party that initiated 
the discussion on APEC and whether or not students were going to 
be able to have access to funding and what was going to happen 
with the suppression of freedom of speech? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder why it is the Reform Party that is talking about those 
issues.  I wonder why it is the Reform Party that is asking for a 
debate and a vote on whether or not we send troops into Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I was neglectful in not 
mentioning the member for Saint Boniface who is also the 
Secretary of State for Western Economic Diversification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the member would talk about all these 
issues.  I will agree with him on something.  The Reform Party 
has stood up and mentioned many of those issues in the House, but 
generally it was the afternoon after it came out in the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I> or the <I>National Post</I>, which is where it does 
its research.  It was not because it was on any kind of cutting 
edge or that it was being proactive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party members are reading the newspaper over morning 
coffee and saying, “Look at this, APEC.  We had better talk 
about this.  Holy smokes, there is a scandal.  We had better talk 
about this”.  That is where they get their research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they would spend more time taking care of their constituents 
and giving them the information that comes out of this government 
in western Canada, just maybe there would not be a need for a 
task force to travel across the west. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, when 
the hon. member first stood he said that this was a silly motion. 
I guess if it is such a silly motion it makes the member pretty 
silly for joining in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member would not mind standing and feeling silly once 
again, I would ask him to explain how anything he said in his 
speech, anything at all, had the slightest bit of relevance to 
the alienation of the Liberals in the west or anywhere else in 
the country because of their ignoring of the concerns across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the member's interest, I would like him to know that a Mark 
Trend poll taken in B.C. and Alberta in mid-March found that the 
tax relief he puffed up as being something important that the 
Liberals were all calling him about, did not even receive favour 
with a fraction of a percentage of the people. The persons 
responding to the poll said that the average amount of tax relief 
they would like to see would be $2,600 a year not the measly few 
hundred the government granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the Young Offenders Act being lauded across the 
country.  It is being criticized across the country as tinkering 
around the edges as usual, nothing worthwhile and certainly 
nothing worth having. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He thinks, as many of the hon. members on that side have said 
all day, that throwing money at the west or anywhere else through 
diversification funds somehow responds to the concerns.  What a 
lot of bunkum.  The importance of the western diversification 
fund does not even appear as a blip on the radar screen in 
western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to get up, be silly again and tell 
us what relevance his speech had to the whole debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I would not expect the 
hon. member to understand anything that I have said.  I would not 
expect him to agree with it by any means, but I would tell the 
hon. member that as the Prime Minister's chair of the task force 
on youth entrepreneurship, which I have not seen him criticizing, 
I have travelled western and eastern Canada.  I have met with 
representatives of western diversification.  I have met with the 
service delivery people.  I have met with the young entrepreneurs 
in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To hear this member stand hear and say that the western 
diversification fund is not important to western Canada simply 
reinforces my view that the members of his party have neither 
their feet on the ground nor their ears to it.  They are not 
representing their constituents in ensuring that they have access 
to government plans and government information.  The reason why 
the Prime Minister has seen the need to strike a task force of 
parliamentarians who will travel through western Canada listening 
to the needs and concerns of western Canadians is because the 
Reform Party is not doing that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</b> Mr. Speaker, I 
also was puzzled by the choice of the topic of today's debate, 
but I am puzzled with all political parties at a certain time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago we might have debated all night the Kosovo 
intervention but another party chose to debate something else on 
domestic politics.  I do not criticize that.  Then all parties 
decided to adjourn a day early and we had the debate two weeks 
later. The committees which are all-party committees, defence and 
foreign affairs themselves did not have any initiatives from 
government or opposition members to come back earlier than a week 
ago. The House sometimes chooses its business in ways that may 
seem strange to outside people but we do get our work done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assume that spring has arrived early in the west and that 
explains perhaps the tone, perhaps the thrust of the present 
debate.  I hope you will allow me in that spirit, Mr. Speaker, 
simply to send a message to that well-known western raconteur and 
wit, Malcolm Parry, based on information he derived from the 
political chattering class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every party has its political chattering class.  They hang 
around party headquarters.  They do not get out in the trenches 
like the hon. members opposite or those around me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me put the record straight.  I do not intend to quit 
parliament.  I am not about to be named roving ambassador for the 
Balkans.  I am not about to be elected to the college of 
cardinals.  I am not even the next general manager of the 
Vancouver Canucks. I might wish such a fate upon some of the hon. 
members opposite, that is to say the Vancouver Canucks.  But we 
are all optimistic in the west.  We may find another Pavel Bure 
and we may somehow win the golden chalice again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some comments have been made and I am always complimented when I 
find members opposite listen to my speeches or in some cases read 
my householders, my letters to constituents.  The member for 
Saanich—Gulf Islands is a very promising younger member of this 
House.  In fact, Professor Sandra Anderson, who is an 
environmental specialist and I believe the wife of someone close 
to the present members of the House, has regarded him as one of 
her most promising, if unpredictable, students.  He has made some 
comments on the issue of APEC funding.  I would think that this 
would perhaps direct attention to the special role of western 
members.  I include my colleagues opposite in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are interested in getting results.  We do not have to take 
the essay in imagination that a New Brunswick scholar has made in 
today's <I>Globe and Mail</I> on the transformation of the 
parliamentary system, nevertheless getting results in parliament 
is a matter of hard work.  We have to research a file; we have to 
meet the parties concerned.  If we make propositions, we have to 
quantify their social cost, their financial cost and we have to 
lobby people, ministers, our own caucus and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel very happy that after 15 months I was able to produce a 
result in the APEC funding issue that I felt to be the correct 
one and which I had recommended in the first place.  I am glad to 
have hon. members opposite join me in that.  I take the comment 
of the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands in that light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also say to the hon. member for North Vancouver who has 
given me the benefit of his advice, and it has been valuable in 
many ways on certain matters involving native leaseholds and 
other things, that I have given about 150 hours of time since 
early December to the issue he discussed today, Bill C-49.  I do 
not have the exact transcripts of his remarks, but I believe 
there is progress being made there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were issues in which I felt the legislation could be 
tidied up.  I have been proceeding by quiet diplomacy, meeting 
with lawyers, meeting with the parties, the stakeholders and 
meeting with ministry officials. I am hopeful that a resolution 
which I would think would be satisfactory in terms of the 
constitution, the charter and the interests of the conflicting 
stakeholders will be reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, I think it is an opportunity for correcting this 
simplistic view of parliament that our main work is making 
speeches and that it is sometimes good to make charges to the 
opposite side of the House and back, Don Quixote style.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of our work, and this applies to people in government and 
opposition, is hard slugging work.  It is research.  Sometimes I 
think I am doing a half million dollar private lawyer's work for 
an MP's salary.  I think that is true of all members of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some remarks have been made on the west.  I would have to cavil 
with my colleagues on that.  I understand the west is a large 
concept but I have argued since I was first elected in 1993 that 
B.C. is separate and distinct in itself.  We are a fifth region, 
which is not to say we cannot coexist peacefully with the three 
prairie provinces and that we cannot co-operate as we are doing, 
as is obvious in the task force that has been referred to.  But 
we are a distinct society and the Prime Minister recognized this 
in the joint resolution of both houses of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has implications of course, concretely.  For example, if we 
ever get around to reform of federal institutions and an elected 
Senate, I want a fifth of the seats in the elected Senate for 
British Columbia. I think the hon. member for North Vancouver 
would not disagree with me on that.  I want to see proportional 
representation in federal institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we contribute 13% of the national revenue from B.C. and 
five or six years ago got only 7% of federal funding for sciences 
and research and development, I am delighted to say that it has 
gone up.  When it gets beyond 13% I think we will ask for 20% as 
a region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these areas the west has its own distinctness, but within it, 
I would argue B.C. has a distinctness more so even than Quebec 
has in relation to Canada as a whole.  The miracle in our case is 
that we made the transition to a multicultural society without 
too much pain, with a great deal of optimism and goodwill, to the 
point where the ethnic communities are no longer a monolithic 
block, if they ever were one such block of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are plural also.  They have differences of opinions, 
differences of attitudes and anybody would have to be wary to 
take the vote for granted. For example on the issue of the 
intervention in Kosovo, different ethnic communities within my 
community of Vancouver take different positions and ask me to 
explain why I might take one position or the other.  That is good 
and healthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a way our charm in B.C. sometimes is an embarrassment to the 
rest of the country, but not to us.  We produce interesting 
political leaders.  I have sometimes had to rescue my province 
from its activities in giving counsel in various places, 
promoting peaceful transitions from impossible situations, from 
impossible political leaders, but I value the interesting variety 
and heterogeneity of our political personalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our role is a little like that of the 19th century MP in Great 
Britain or perhaps the continental European politician today. One 
of my constituents said to me “We vote for you.  You are part of 
your party but we do not like you to be 100% for your party.  We 
like you to dissent sufficiently when we feel our interests our 
involved”.  There is an art in doing that.  You recognize the 
gain you have from an affiliation with the party.  You also have 
made the pledge when you accept membership that you in general 
will abide by its principles and its program but the dissent 
within the party, the argumentation, the presentation of a 
reasoned case, the diversity of treatment, is there and 
opportunities are available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we do our job well, this is when we really do establish the 
western personality and in particular, if I may say again, the 
B.C. personality.  There is nothing like it even in New Zealand, 
Australia, or anywhere else.  We are distinct and we are very 
proud of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pluralism within a party is something we have to ask for 
more and more in a period when presidential prime ministerships 
are the rule of the day.  A French friend said we have a 
monarchical president. 
I said that sometimes it is an imperial president. Nevertheless 
the countervailing power in our society with an unreformed Senate 
and various other things is coming within the parties.  That is 
where the give and take is.  That is where the legislation is 
made and it is a healthy development.  I think it has lessons for 
this side of the House and for the other side of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I take it that it is in this spirit, the spirit of spring which 
came early to Vancouver as it always does, that this motion was 
put forward by the opposition.  I accept it in that spirit. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, it 
was a very civil speech, although I am not sure how much 
relevance it actually had to the motion.  A couple of interesting 
points came up in the speech.  I do appreciate the member 
mentioning how he supports proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he has done the numbers, as I have.  He certainly 
would have discovered that Reform would come out with 60 seats, 
but the Liberals would drop dramatically and would no longer be 
the majority government that they are today.  I thank the hon. 
member for that endorsement of a process which would certainly be 
more representative of how people vote in the country. The 
situation that gives 100% of the power with 38% of the vote to 
that side of the House is really not healthy for the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I gave him credit earlier today and I do again for actually 
speaking out publicly from time to time, contrary to the will of 
his party, and representing his constituents.  He is to be 
congratulated for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he would mind speaking to the member for Port 
Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, who did promise to speak out 
regularly and correct all the ills of the world, who never has 
said a word in this place and thinks that everything is fine with 
the land management bill.  I wonder if the member would mind 
having a little chat with him and setting him straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad we can enroll 
the member for North Vancouver in the process of parliamentary 
reform.  It will be more complex I think than many members 
envisaged in 1993 when first elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The presidentialization of the prime minister's power in Great 
Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada is a phenomenon of our 
times.  It cannot be reversed, but we can develop countervailing 
checks and balances, constitutional checks and balances, much as 
they were developed in Westminster in the 18th century, but they 
are more likely to be within the political parties themselves. I 
wish the hon. member would direct his very fertile mind and 
imagination to that task because he may have a good deal to offer 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On reform of the electoral system, each electoral system begets 
its own practices and we could live with PR.  I could myself.  I 
have a feeling in some ways that it would be a more interesting 
House.  Again, it would change the constitutional system and we 
would have to make corresponding changes in other institutions. I 
could suggest them, but it is a large test and we would be into a 
decade of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the business, the give and take between colleagues, the 
give and take across the House, it is one of the things I value. 
This is a continent widely divided.  This country is the distance 
from Moscow to Vladivostok.  One of the experiences on that long, 
five and a half hour flight twice a week from Vancouver to Ottawa 
and Ottawa to Vancouver, is that I meet with constituents and I 
meet with the opposition parties.  There are more than two 
parties in B.C. federally.  I have conversations.  I believe 
there is a process of give and take and it is beneficial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it was in that spirit, if I may say so, that it was 
suggested I was not speaking to the motion.  But if the motion 
was whimsical, not perhaps serious, I put it down to the spring 
and the arrival of the daffodils.  It was in that spirit that I 
attempted to offer a prairie rose to the hon. member for North 
Vancouver. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</b>  Mr. 
Speaker, I heard the hon. member mention during his speech that 
if and when his government gets around to it, he would like to 
see some democratic reform, especially with regard to the Senate 
having better representation of what is existent in B.C. 
population in the Senate.  His government has been in power now 
for over six years and we have not seen any movement on 
democratic reform.  There have been provinces, for instance 
Alberta, which have made an effort to try to change the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member a simple question.  Will the 
government get around to democratic reform maybe before the end 
of the next millennium or some time sooner?  When may that

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</b>  Mr. Speaker, we have to establish our 
priorities by considering the ways and means that are available. 
Unfortunately, Senate reform is virtually impossible, except 
marginally because of Part V of the 1982 Constitution Act, which 
I advised against incidentally.  The only way we are going to 
change the Senate, other than marginally, is with a constituent 
assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the feeling that the generation of Canadians coming into 
political power very shortly will want to have a constituent 
assembly and will want an act of constitutionalization.  But I 
would advise the hon. member that I think he could use his 
talents and energy in other areas of constitutional reform where 
we do not have that constitutional straightjacket that Part V of 
the Constitution imposes.  It is a pity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend Rafe Mair and I agree that we would like to be United 
States senators.  There is no more beautiful job than that.  But 
it is just unforeseeable for another 10 years here.  Give us a 
constituent assembly and all will spill.  But the country has to 
be ready for it and it is not quite ready yet.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</b> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to join with my colleagues today in a discussion of the 
important issue of national alienation, in particulary that of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a Quebecer myself, but I wish to point out that I 
respect and admire Quebecers.  I have learned French, and 
continue to do so, because I wish to acquire a better 
understanding of Quebecers and of the francophone culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked for the national unity portfolio in our caucus in order 
to be able to help ensure that Quebec remains within Canada, by 
giving Quebec and the other provinces true equal powers and not 
mere symbols. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want Quebec to stay within Canada, and I am prepared to fight 
the Liberal style federalism of the status quo, which continues 
to alienate Quebec and the other Canadian provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, although not, of course, a Quebecer, I hope I am 
in a position to understand the feelings of alienation felt by 
the citizens of Canada living in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government understands that education is an area of 
provincial jurisdiction protected by the Constitution.  It also 
understands that when it encroaches on areas of provincial 
jurisdiction protected by the Constitution, Quebeckers become 
increasingly frustrated, and the feelings of alienation intensify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, the Liberals' instinct to meddle in everything is so strong 
and their condescending, paternalistic, interventionist, big 
brother attitude is so pronounced that they continue to get 
involved in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction, in spite 
of the resulting damage to Canadian unity. The millennium fund 
is a prime example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fund is nothing but another inefficient and costly Liberal 
policy. For our friends from Quebec, it is a constant reminder 
that the current government refuses to recognize the division of 
powers provided under the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc Quebecois members, like Reformers, are just as interested 
in education as the Prime Minister is. They simply want the 
federal government to respect provincial jurisdiction, and they 
also know that provincial governments are in a better position 
to administer the programs than the federal government, which is 
far away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the Prime Minister does not care about national 
unity or constitutional issues. He is only interested in leaving 
his mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, he will join the long list of federalist politicians 
who are advocates of the status quo and who turn a deaf ear when 
Quebeckers are urging the current government not to get involved 
in provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before concluding, I want to ask the House to remember the 
debates on Bill C-36, dealing with the millennium fund.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Quebecers should remember that the Reform Party put forward 
a recommendation that the provinces and territories be allowed 
to opt out and to conclude agreements with the millennium 
foundation, to use their share of the funds based on their own 
priorities for post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has always recognized Quebec's right to determine how 
its education needs should be met. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to shift to the topic of health care and the social 
union.  The social union is about health, education and support 
for people in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When federal transfers to the provinces were cut by $7 billion, 
when hospitals were closing and when 1,400 doctors left Canada in 
the last two years, we needed to address health care in the 
social union.  But this government's solution was to play a money 
game and pit provincial premiers all across the country against 
Quebec.  It was a shame because that in itself created even more 
alienation in the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a real effort, for once, from the point when the 
Calgary declaration began, all the way through the talks on the 
social union, when we saw that provincial premiers were making 
progress in trying to come together and work together to put 
pressure on the federal government to address problems in the 
balance of powers in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government and the Prime Minister did not take that 
seriously.  Instead they played the money game.  They cut money 
out of transfers, especially to health care and education, and 
they left the provinces with really no choice.  When it came to 
the crunch, they had to put that money back into health care and 
education.  In the end they had to buy into a deal that was just 
not fair to the provinces, creating even more alienation in the 
province of Quebec when all of the other premiers had to take the 
cash.  They had no choice because they had people to take care of 
in their provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately Quebec once again felt that it was left out of 
the process because there just was not a solution to take care of 
the balance, which we in the Reform Party have been trying to 
meet right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the success of this government.  That is why it has been 
relegated to a majority in central Canada.  It continues to 
succeed by pitting one part of this country against another. Then 
it asks the question:  Why is there alienation in this country? 
It really is no surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue I would like to touch on very quickly is that of 
taxation.  My hon. colleague from Edmonton North talked about the 
issue of taxation in the east. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec people are concerned about the high level of taxes 
they pay.  I discussed with people from the Economic Institute of 
Montreal, a new think tank, the issues of high taxes and what 
they do to the economy of Quebec.  They are a lone voice trying 
to talk to the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we take into consideration the tax factor of the federal 
government and the provincial government, Quebecers unfortunately 
pay some of the highest taxes in the country, if not in North 
America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is another factor which the government has failed to 
address.  At the end of the day, regardless of where we live, we 
want to make sure we can put food on the table.  We want to make 
sure we can provide for our families.  The tax rates are so high 
that even Quebecers feel alienated that no one is listening to 
them at all when it comes to that particular problem. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a national unity problem because Quebecers and other 
Canadians feel profoundly alienated, and this problem will not 
go away until honest discussion and real reforms replace the 
present empty rhetoric and divisive symbolism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party and most Canadians seem to understand that.  In 
our opinion, the debate on national unity must be open to 
scrutiny and to public support, and the dialogue must be real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why, as Reform critic for intergovernmental affairs, I 
am proud to defend the Reform Party's new law on Canada, a 
positive and creative measure to rebuild a Canada based on 
equality among people and provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The distribution of powers must be reviewed to put an end to 
Canadians' feeling of alienation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our opinion Quebec and the other provinces must have the 
same real powers. This will bring out regional diversity.  What 
is needed is a new distribution of powers giving all provinces 
greater autonomy in areas constitutionally under their 
jurisdiction.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, 
the issue of the CHST cuts continues to come back.  I remind the 
member that the cuts which the federal government made to its own 
fiscal expenditures were more than the cuts it made to the 
provinces.  There was a sharing of the burden.  There was a 
lesser percentage of revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member probably knows, and would probably like to confirm, 
that at a time when he admits the provinces were cutting health 
care and education because of the transfer cuts, was not the 
province of Alberta running surpluses and still cutting health 
care?  Was not the province of Ontario actually giving 15% income 
tax cuts while cutting health care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost to the province of Ontario of the tax reduction was in 
the order of $1.2 billion.  The reduction in transfers from the 
federal government was in the neighbourhood of $400 million. 
There was a significant difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the actions of the provincial governments were taken into 
account at the same time they were cutting health care and 
education, it would be very clear that the priorities of the 
provinces were not the same as the priorities of the federal 
government and the people of Canada.  The priorities of the 
provinces were to either accumulate surpluses or grant tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also should acknowledge that in any analysis like 
this he cannot ignore the reality of equalization payments in 
Canada, of which Quebec is the single largest recipient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I will address the hon. 
member's question briefly.  As he knows, I was discussing 
alienation in Quebec, not in Alberta or Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, with regard to the cuts in transfers from the federal 
government, the hon. member has to realize that there were 
targets and plans which the provinces had put into place for the 
money that was to come from the federal government.  The fact is 
that in Alberta, if we look at the way it managed health care, it 
made the sacrifices it had to make.  However, alongside the cuts 
made by this government, it actually has more money to put into 
health care, plus, something which is totally foreign to this 
government, it actually paid down debt, giving more tax relief to 
Albertans, which overall is a much more positive move than this 
government will ever commit to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of Ontario the same thing happened.  Harris 
actually put more money into health care over the time it was cut 
by the government but still balanced his priorities of debt 
reduction and tax relief; again something which is foreign to 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Quebec, the question of alienation was even more 
significant when it came to the cuts.  Then, to come back, 
especially with the case of the millennium scholarship fund, and 
force Quebec to implement a program that it was not in favour of 
after the cuts were made by this government was outrageous.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia,

from the Reform Party and I heard some conciliatory words from 
him regarding the good province of Quebec.  That is pleasing to 
my ears because all parliamentarians should always reach out to 
every part of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member remembers those embarrassing election ads 
in the election campaign of 1997 when the Reform Party actually 
said that it did not want any more prime ministers from the 
province of Quebec. 
That is what those ads said.  Does the member remain embarrassed 
by those election ads almost three years hence?

amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, once 
again the opposition has tried to address an issue, the idea of 
alienation, which the government does not seem able to bring 
before the House of Commons.  The government is willing to strike 
committees to recruit candidates across the rest of the country, 
but is it willing to discuss the issue and generate debate on it 
in the House of Commons?  No.  Unfortunately that job is up to 
the opposition just like it was on a number of other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel lonely in the House as many Liberals have poured out the 
door.  I wonder if it is to go and talk with constituents in 
Newfoundland.  Why do Newfoundland and Labrador feel alienated 
from the government?  Since 1949 Newfoundland has been part of 
Canada and since 1949 the Government of Canada has mismanaged the 
fishery of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Alberta we have had many scuffles with the federal government 
over the control of natural resources.  Predominantly oil and gas 
are the ones that come to my mind.  Nonetheless we have still 
been able to have those fights because Alberta has some 
jurisdiction over those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Newfoundland, because we do not have an 
implementation of the Law of the Sea, foreign draggers and 
vessels pillage the ocean depths and destroy the fishery in 
Newfoundland. Newfoundlanders rely on the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans and it does not allow the numbers to be accessed by 
the public. It is a secret organization that deprives fishermen 
of the numbers they need to sustain the fisheries in 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the federal government is continuing to do this, and it 
must therefore accept responsibility, foreign vessels are fishing 
off the coast of Newfoundland, the Grand Banks and the 
surrounding areas.  These foreign nations have quotas and are 
taking tens of thousands of fish.  They are depriving 
Newfoundlanders of their jobs.  The government says that it does 
not understand alienation and that it represents Newfoundland. 
That is a crying shame.  It is a joke.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government do?  It goes ahead and tries to buy 
votes.  It tries to hold it over people's heads.  Instead of 
allowing the government and the people of Newfoundland to decide 
what happens with their fishery, the federal government lords it 
over them.  It says that if they do not vote for the Liberals 
they can expect to get even worse.  It threatens people.  It is a 
shame that this is even carried over to the provincial 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To obtain a licence in a province, whether it be for a 
restaurant or a liquor establishment, people basically have to 
beg forgiveness from provincial Liberals so that their small mom 
and pop operation are not shut down because they do not agree 
with the government in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shame on the government that it does not have control over the 
fisheries.  A number of governments over a period time have 
talked about the idea of Newfoundland having control over the 
fisheries and the resources of that province.  The fisheries are 
not the only resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about some of the other resources over which the 
people Newfoundland and Labrador do not have control.  As a 
result they continually have that held over their heads by this 
government which demands votes from them in order not to be taken 
advantage of any more than they are now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Offshore oil could be a great boon for the province of 
Newfoundland.  Once again the federal government went ahead and 
said that it was not within the jurisdiction of the province.  I 
will talk later about what Pierre Elliott Trudeau did to that 
province in some of his early discussions with regard to 
jurisdictional issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the issues of natural gas and hydro electricity 
which should fall under the purview of the province.  Instead, 
because of federal intermingling on these issues, the government 
stripped the ability of Newfoundland to provide, to look after 
and to control its resources.  As a result the fishery collapsed 
in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad that when there is no control there is little or no 
hope. People lose hope if they cannot be expected to have an 
actual say and a direct impact on resources that are close to 
them, and if the federal government goes ahead and lords it over 
them, takes control of those things and does not let them run 
things as they should be run in order to make sure the resources 
are sustainable.  That is exactly what has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the federal government do?  Rather than solve the 
problem so that 5, 10 or 20 years from now young people will not 
be leaving Newfoundland and seeking work elsewhere, it comes up 
with programs like NCARP and TAGS and keeps people beholden to 
those programs.  It doles out its pennies and nickels.  It keeps 
the people dependent and does not allow them local control over 
their resources.  Shame on the government for depriving the 
people of Newfoundland of hope, control and opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the whole issue of natural resources.  What 
about the Churchill Falls travesty?  The federal government could 
have had and should have had a responsibility to get involved in 
that situation.  Once again it did not take Newfoundland's side. 
It did not step in when it was supposed to do so.  As a result, 
Newfoundland loses $600 million in annual revenues.  If that were 
divided by every person in Newfoundland it would be some sort of 
an economic benefit, but the federal government did not take any 
responsibility for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre Elliott Trudeau refused to cede any jurisdiction to the 
province in offshore oil, claiming that it fell under the federal 
government's power to regulate the territorial waters of the 
country.  As a result Newfoundland has been suffering and the 
fishery stocks collapsed in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some other islands that have been able to succeed 
with regard to their fisheries.  Iceland, for example, had a 
crisis with its fishery and foreign fishing.  It was able to come 
back because it had control of its resource.  It was able to make 
the decisions.  The government and the people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador have not even had the support of the federal government 
to go ahead and turf out any of the foreign fishers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a crying shame that there are ships fishing offshore when 
the people of the Newfoundland cannot earn a living from 
something that had sustained them for hundreds of years.  It is a 
crying shame that the people of Newfoundland have to put up with 
a federal government that alienates them in that way.  It is 
ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The feds have mismanaged the largest resource in the province. 
They had better take responsibility for the fallout when it 
comes, unless it is willing to give that responsibility back to 
the province.  That is what the people of Newfoundland have been 
asking for and that is what they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland recently had its 50th anniversary of joining 
Confederation.  Some would say it was treated with some 
ambiguity.  That is a shame.  It is because of the alienation 
that province feels with regard to its control of natural 
resources and how the federal government has run roughshod over 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland and Labrador have a seal population to the tune of 
six million to eight million.  According to DFO statistics each 
seal gobbles up 1.4 tonnes of fish per year.  That alone accounts 
for two years of fishing on the coast of Newfoundland and 
Labrador.  They should be allowed to go ahead and look after the 
seals.  They are not even allowed to make their own decisions in 
that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked about Churchill Falls.  I could talk about Inco 
and the Voisey's Bay dispute.  I could talk about the Innu land 
claims or virtually any other dispute where the federal 
government does not directly benefit.  It shoved Newfoundland and 
Labrador out of the picture and did not allow them to make local 
decisions on these issues.  They are hurting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants to see a solving of the problem and 
fewer young people leaving the province, it has to look at the 
long term and not just at the next election.  That is where the 
federal government has failed the people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I leave it to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador to decide. 
If they want more of the same, they can continue to vote for the 
Liberals who have alienated them and have not allowed them local 
control.  They should vote for change.

idea of the abdication of responsibility and sovereignty.  The 
hon. member is referring to the north.  My speech was directly 
related to Newfoundland and Labrador.  As far as I can talk about 
abdication of responsibility and sovereignty, I will try to 
address that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the territory does not have a responsibility how can it 
possibly have any control or say over what is being done?  If the 
federal government takes responsibility and sovereignty away from 
a province or territory, or does not grant it in the first place, 
it has no local control.  We have seen that in Newfoundland and 
Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the abdication of responsibility in Newfoundland and 
Labrador, I believe the people of Newfoundland and Labrador would 
like to see more local control.  They are willing to take with 
that control sovereignty and responsibility for those resources. 
They certainly have not been managed well over the last 50 years 
by the federal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in this Chamber talking about this foolishness of the 
motion that was put forward today.  The Prime Minister even urged 
the Reform Party to put forward a motion on Kosovo today if that 
is what it wanted, but instead we are debating alienation.  It is 
what members of the Reform Party know.  So often they seem to 
look at the dark and dismal side of life, rather than what most 
Canadians enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alienation is the only thing that the Reform Party knows.  How 
else could one explain the blatantly anti-Quebec ads that party 
ran in the last federal election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back to the time of the referendum in Quebec.  People 
phoned my office and I talked to people on the streets, people 
who voted for the PC party, people who voted for the NDP, people 
who voted however they voted and they were all concerned about 
keeping this country together, but this party understands 
alienation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform leader has admitted that the Reform Party in its 
present form cannot form government because it alienates too many 
Canadians.  Perhaps the best name for the new party would be the 
Reform alienation party.  Now it appears that the Reform leader 
has managed to alienate at least 12 of his own members.  Having 
run out of normal Canadians to anger and alienate he has turned 
to his own caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a serious question to ask the member from cow town, which 
is a great town.  I love Calgary.  It is one of the finest parts 
of Canada, located in the foothills.  I love all parts of this 
country.  I have travelled it for the last 50 years.  I drove it 
for 40 years before I came to this Chamber and I respect all of 
its parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member is:  Do they not share the desire to 
represent the issues of all Canadians?  This is a party that 
wants to alienate and be a regional party.  I am proud to be a 
member of a party which represents all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rob Anders:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I felt some love in the 
Chamber when the member rose to say that he wanted to be tolerant 
and inclusive, but then he went ahead and accused me of being 
from cow town. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell him a bit about alienation, as the hon. member 
raised the issue.  I will change subjects for a second and talk 
about tax and spend Liberal policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about Transport Canada controlling the St. John's 
Port Corporation.  Oceanex, a company that does 84% of its 
business in that particular vicinity, said  “Don't go ahead and 
put money into a new building, put it into a port facility; put 
it into the actual structure so that we can do a better job with 
what we have”.  But, no, indeed, a Liberal appointed hack, Sean 
Hanrahan, went ahead, tore down the old building and put up a new 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are only 18 employees.  The building has 10,000 square 
feet, leaving each employee with an office bigger than that of 
the premier of Newfoundland.  The premier has to be jealous. 
Deep down in his bones I know that the premier of Newfoundland is 
jealous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did they build a new building?  One could say that maybe St. 
John's has almost no vacant building space.  As a matter of fact, 
the vacancy rate is higher than 20%.  Yet we have a Liberal 
appointee who went ahead and took all that money to build a new 
structure to give everybody in that particular corporation an 
office bigger than the premier's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is alienation.  That is Liberal tax and spend policies. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, 
Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to take part 
in today's debate.  As the chairman of the Prime Minister's task 
force on the four western provinces I must admit that I rise to 
speak today with mixed emotions.  On the one hand I welcome the 
extra publicity that this debate will give our efforts to consult 
with Canadians across the prairies and in British Columbia.  I 
did not expect this kind of a gift from the Reform Party of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, I cannot imagine a more frivolous use of 
parliament's time.  At a time when our nation is engaged in the 
most assertive military operation since the end of the Korean war 
the members of the Reform Party come forward with a motion that 
can only be described as silly.  I strongly believe that 
Canadians do not appreciate silly stunts and that perhaps 
explains the Reform Party's dismal performance in yesterday's 
byelection in Windsor—St. Clair.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, the Reform motion claims that this government has 
not addressed regional concerns and calls upon the government to 
rename the task force which I am honoured to chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion, however, speaks to much more than renaming a task 
force; it speaks to a fundamental difference between the Liberal 
vision of this country and the Reform Party's vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal vision is of one Canada, stretching from sea to sea 
to sea, with all Canadians confidently working together to build 
the greatest country on earth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform vision is one of petty regionalism, a vision in which 
one region competes with another for attention, a vision in which 
the politics of division are more important than the politics of 
unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, as Liberals, seek out the common threads that strengthen our 
nation, not the device of shards that would tear us apart.  We 
recognize that as the national governing party we have a 
responsibility to all Canadians, regardless of where they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that the timing of this motion has something to do 
with the fact that the Prime Minister's task force on the four 
western provinces recently spent a very rewarding Easter break 
consulting and meeting with many Manitobans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned yesterday, the response to the task force was 
indeed overwhelming.  In just three days task force members met 
with over 60 individuals and organizations from across my home 
province.  Manitobans shared with us not only their concerns, but 
also their dreams for tomorrow.  So popular were the meetings 
that we found it necessary to break into two teams to cover as 
much ground as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The response we had throughout Manitoba and the number of 
requests we had for meetings in other western provinces proves 
one thing:  western Canadians reject Reform's parochial 
regionalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians in the four western provinces, in fact Canadians right 
across this great land, want a national government, not a bunch 
of regional ones.  They want a national government that reaches 
out to all Canadians, regardless of where they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that whenever the regional parties, be 
it the Reform Party or the Bloc Quebecois, realize that they are 
becoming increasingly irrelevant to most Canadians, they try to 
play the regional card.  That is what we are witnessing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is sitting still in the polls.  In fact, in 
yesterday's byelection, as I pointed out earlier, Reform placed 
fourth overall, behind the third place Tories.  Combined, those 
two parties received a paltry 4,000 votes, compared to nearly 
14,000 for the winning Liberal candidate.  So much for the 
so-called united alternative.  Rather than uniting it is 
splitting apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's task force is being well received across 
western Canada.  I can only conclude that the Reform Party feels 
so threatened that once again it is trying to divide Canadians 
into “them and us”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's task force on the four western provinces 
was established to meet with and listen to western Canadians.  It 
is a mandate to build on the work of the government's western MPs 
and senators by simply providing western Canadians with another 
opportunity, one of many, to shape the national decision making 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what the Reform Party wants us to believe, there is 
actually really nothing new in the government's approach.  It is 
simply the time honoured practice of consulting, talking to 
people, listening to people and hearing their concerns.  There is 
no hidden agenda.  There is no radical departure from what this 
government has done in the past.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While we were meeting with Manitobans a similar caucus task 
force was meeting with and listening to Quebecers.  Another 
caucus task force was meeting with and listening to young 
entrepreneurs from across the country.  In fact we heard from the 
chairman of that task force about an hour or two ago in the 
Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, the year that we came to power, the government has 
established no less than nine such caucus task forces to meet 
with Canadians on issues as diverse as the impact of information 
technology on Canada and the future of our aging population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has made a regular habit of consulting 
with Canadians from every region of the country and it will 
continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why have we made it a habit to consult with Canadians?  Simply 
put, it is because the Prime Minister understands that we cannot 
run a country as large as this and as diverse as this from behind 
a desk here on Parliament Hill.  We have to get out and meet with 
the people.  We have to understand their concerns.  We have to 
understand their dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party simply does not understand that government has 
to consult with the governed.  That is why we are government and 
they are the opposition.  That is why they are wasting 
parliament's time today with this silly motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's record shows the influence that Liberal 
parliamentarians from across the west have in setting government 
priorities.  Every week western voices speak for the west in our 
national caucus meetings.  Western Canadians told us that we had 
to restore faith and credibility in the nation's finances.  The 
government listened and acted.  We introduced the first balanced 
budget in 30 years, reduced taxes by $16.5 billion in our last 
two budgets and began paying down the national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Western Canadians told us that we had to do something to ensure 
better access to education and improve the health care system. 
Again we listened and we acted.  The government introduced the 
millennium scholarship program and increased health care spending 
by $11.5 billion.  My province of Manitoba will receive $425 
million in increased health care funding.  When the farm income 
crisis erupted on the prairies we listened to western farmers and 
we acted.  We introduced a $900 million farm aid package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are these the actions of a government that is indifferent to 
regional concerns?  I do not think so.  As someone who was born 
and raised in western Canada, as someone who has lived and worked 
most of his life in western Canada and as someone who represents 
over 77,000 western Canadians in this place, I can assure members 
of the Reform Party that western Canadians are not interested in 
playing regional games.  They want a responsible national 
government that will help them create opportunities for the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Western Canada is a vibrant and exciting place.  The region has 
experienced strong economic and population growth.  The people 
have confidence in themselves and in their future.  They are 
comfortable with their regional identities, but consider 
themselves Canadians first.  The sooner the Reform Party 
recognizes this, the sooner the Reform Party will stop wasting 
parliament's time with silly motions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have heard a lot of arrogant things said in the House, but I 
think that speech really takes the cake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing more Liberal arrogance, from the top down, 
suggesting that a motion brought forward by 60 MPs who represent 
western Canada is somehow wrong because it does not show their 
silly alienation committee in a good light.  We are very sorry, 
but the fact is that if that member wanted to know how western 
Canadians feel he would listen to the debates in the House. 
Sixty Reform MPs were elected to tell the Liberal government 
exactly how the people in the west feel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member from Winnipeg should give his head a 
shake and simply look across the way.  We have told the 
government over and over again that we oppose its tax and spend 
policies.  We have told the government that we oppose its 
mandatory gun registration, which will do absolutely nothing to 
stop crime.  The hon. member knows that we are very upset about 
the wheat board issue in the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over and over again we bring these issues to the attention of 
this government and its solution is to take a committee across 
the west to ask if there is anything wrong. 
He should know that they lost eight seats in the last election 
because they would not listen.

that sending a travelling road show around the west will somehow 
fix the problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. John Harvard:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I just love the rhetoric. 
Let me tell the member for Medicine Hat something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Friday we in the task force went to Brandon, Manitoba.  I 
will tell him about a couple of witnesses we heard from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was one gentleman by the name of Bob Friesen from the town 
of Wawanesa, Manitoba.  I grew up 19 miles from Wawanesa.  Who is 
Mr. Friesen?  He happens to be the president of the Canadian 
Federation of Agriculture, the largest farm organization in the 
country.  I can say that Mr. Friesen appreciated the opportunity 
to spend more than an hour with us talking about farm issues, 
very relevant agricultural issues.  And he did not raise one word 
of concern about the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who else did we meet at lunch in Brandon?  A gentleman by the 
name of Don Dewar.  He is from the community of Dauphin, Manitoba 
and he is hardly a Liberal.  As far as I know I have never seen 
him walk in Liberal corridors.  Who is Mr. Dewar?  He is the 
president of KAP, Keystone Agricultural Producers, the largest 
farm organization in the province of Manitoba.  Does the hon. 
member think that he did not appreciate meeting with the Prime 
Minister's task force?  You bet your britches he did.  He 
appreciated every minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what these meetings are about. That is what 
consultations are about.  This is what we mean by going out and 
meeting people directly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, as 
the member has indicated that his own task force is not important 
enough for us to discuss in the House, I will ask him two quick 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, will he give a commitment that tomorrow his government 
will introduce the motion he wants to debate along with a full 
vote on the Kosovo situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, will he table in the House right now the schedule for 
the upcoming meetings of his task force if he is truly serious 
about consultation instead of releasing it a week after the 
meetings have happened? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. John Harvard:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I am absolutely flattered 
that this gentleman from North Vancouver really thinks I can 
table a motion which would have to be properly tabled by the 
Prime Minister of Canada. I am quite sure that when the 
appropriate motion has to be tabled, the Prime Minister will do 
that job very adequately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the hon. member for North Vancouver that all of the 
task force will be going to the beautiful province of British 
Columbia, a province where I lived for three wonderful years.  We 
will be there during the break week in the month of May. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still taking requests.  We are still taking submissions 
from people who want to appear before the task force. When we get 
the schedule all together, I will be more than happy to share the 
schedule and itinerary with the hon. member for North Vancouver. 
Let me say that if the hon. member for North Vancouver does not 
have an opportunity to make an oral presentation to the task 
force, I would be delighted to receive a letter from him.  I am 
sure that he can write.

opposite offers a hope that there will be some reason in my 
remarks today. I am afraid I may be a little less crisp than I 
like to be in the House as I have just gotten off a plane from 
Geneva.  It is a bit of a shock.  I am feeling a little bit of 
culture shock right now as I have been away from Canada for the 
last three weeks, and to drop back into the middle of this debate 
is a bit jarring.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I address the substance of the motion put forward, I 
would like to say one thing.  I had the opportunity over the past 
three weeks to travel to China.  I am in China frequently these 
days.  I followed that up with some time in Delhi and in Geneva. 
In Geneva I had the opportunity to spend some time with the 
people who are working on the human rights commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One does not have to get very far out of this country to realize 
what an absolutely incredible country this is and what a 
privilege it is to be a Canadian and how we are admired all 
around the world by almost every other country.  People in every 
other country want to be here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We show leadership.  I was absolutely astounded in Geneva to 
note that a little country like Canada provides almost 10% of the 
resolutions that are debated in Geneva in a community of 123 to 
190 countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear about disunity and division in our country but Canadians 
outside the country are doing an incredible job on behalf of all 
of us.  We all benefit from it enormously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think about the sense of the regional divisions.  In Geneva 
there are young francophones from Quebec working very hard and 
energetically.  They are very proud of their country and are very 
proud to be representing Canada in the very important work they 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are western entrepreneurs in and out of China all the time 
working hard to build relationships and expand trade.  I was 
pleased to note that there are New Brunswickers and Nova Scotians 
in China trying to forge some new pathways.  I even heard talk of 
some port building.  I believe there is some accommodation for 
the post-Panamax ships which will carry large quantities of 
containers into the Pacific Rim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are Canadians from all over the country who are working 
hard.  They are building upon the goodwill all of us have built 
for all of us to enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a little surprised to note the kind of querulous tone in 
the House today.  If the concern is that the government is not 
sensitive to the regions, one would think that with a task force 
going into western Canada and one going into Quebec people would 
be celebrating and saying that it is wonderful we are doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps some of the concern about it comes from something my 
friend from Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia is a little too 
modest to talk about, which is the tremendous success of the task 
force. He mentioned that the task force he chairs will be going 
to B.C. in May. The B.C. caucus has been touring the province. We 
all do that.  The Manitoba caucus holds meetings right around the 
province every three to four months.  It hears submissions from 
people, as members do in their ridings every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That information comes back and forms part of the information 
that builds the kind of consensus which allows the government to 
do the work it does.  The government has done some pretty 
remarkable things over the last five or six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>An hon. member:</b>  I wouldn't brag about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Reg Alcock:</b>  The member says he would not brag about 
it but I do.  I brag about it quite often and without any 
hesitation whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a desire in the kind of heated atmosphere which is 
created in this chamber to solve every problem immediately.  I 
used to enjoy debating some of my colleagues in the Reform Party 
by quoting a poster a friend of mine has in his office.  It reads 
“For every complex problem there is a simple answer and it's 
wrong”.  That is my feeling when the Reform Party raises the 
kind of debate it does in this House, quick, glib, easy 
criticisms to complex problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admire our Prime Minister. If you think about it, politics is 
one of the few businesses where we tend to devalue experience. 
What we are reminded of every day is that we have a leader who 
understands the country better than any other person in this 
House and who has served the country longer than almost everybody 
else in this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When confronted with an issue he knows when to act and when to 
watch.  He knows how to listen very carefully, not in a flashy 
way, not with a lot of bells and whistles, but very carefully 
step by step, issue by issue.  He has gone about the work with 
the full support of this caucus in continuing to build upon the 
foundation that makes this the best country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was first elected in 1993 I recall that we had a very 
serious economic problem.  We now have a surplus.  That did not 
come about easily.  It did not come about quickly.  It did not 
come about magically.  A lot of hard decisions were taken one by 
one, sticking to our guns and carefully keeping our eye on the 
target budget after budget.  Even when we got into a surplus, we 
continued to exercise restraint and continued to be careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the question of lack of co-operation with the provinces. 
Again, there was no national referendum.  There was no big task 
force running around.  We sat down and went issue by issue.  When 
we needed to look at a national child benefit we sat down and 
negotiated a way that we could do that in co-operation with the 
provinces and the provinces signed on.  We needed to look at the 
issue of training.  We sat down an negotiated a series of 
agreements.  Co-operation improves services to everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this was the crowning achievement.  I worked in social 
services for a great many years.  The social union framework 
represents to me the first time in as long as I have been working 
that we put aside all of the bickering and wrangling about 
jurisdiction and created an environment within which we could sit 
down, discuss, negotiate and come to an agreement on how we 
together can provide better services for the people in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That basically is what Canada is.  Canada is a partnership.  It 
is a partnership of regions.  It is a partnership of people. 
Partnership works extremely well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is able to do that because of the kind of work 
that is done by the member from Charleswood. Members in Quebec 
are doing this as well.  The member from Mississauga is doing the 
one on youth entrepreneurship.  We have had them on small 
business and on gas pricing.  Members are constantly talking to 
Canadians, listening to what they have to say and trying to 
incorporate those ideas in all of the other opinions which they 
receive from all over the country.  They bring that to caucus 
every week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister sits in caucus every week to listen to us. He 
insists that people be there.  He insists that it be an important 
forum for us to debate and discuss.  Every single week we hear in 
that forum members saying what they are hearing in their regions 
over and over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little saddened.  I have to make some comments to my 
friends to the Bloc as well as my friends in the Reform.  When I 
meet with my friends in the Bloc and with people in Quebec, I 
meet with people who are very interested in providing services 
and enhancing the quality of life for people living in their 
province.  They are energetic, smart, interested and not afraid 
of the challenges in this world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In western Canada we see the same thing.  The picture brought 
into this House by the Reform Party is not the western Canada I 
know.  Two of the wealthiest governments in the country exist in 
western Canada.  The front page of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
showed my province of Manitoba as having the lowest unemployment 
rate in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are doing very well.  We are doing very well in western 
Canada right now.  We are doing it because people have found a 
way to put aside the bickering and the battling.  They are 
focusing on making this an even better country.

BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the speech given 
by my colleague, with whom I worked on the human resources 
development and transport committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although his vision of Canada is a bit heavy on sweetness and 
light, I would still like to ask him a question to do with the 
fact that the disparities between the various regions of Canada 
have not in any way been eliminated, not since I have been an MP 
in any event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that could be said is that the disparities have grown 
more pronounced under the present Liberal government, one reason 
being EI reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberal government's attitude towards Canada's regions 
and the various provinces were truly open-minded—and I am not 
talking about the second part of the Reform Party's motion 
referring to a committee, as this part of the motion concerns me 
less than the first part, which says that the federal government 
has trouble identifying and addressing the regions' problems—would 
it not, when introducing the EI reform, have ensured rapid 
adjustment mechanisms? 
I am thinking of such notorious problems as the intensity rule, 
which penalizes seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it not have come up with a regional economic 
diversification policy so that the gas pipeline project would 
have had to go through the maritimes and eastern Quebec and play 
an important economic development role, rather than leaving 
things up to the market?  The gas is now going directly through 
Nova Scotia to the United States and we are left with the short 
end of the stick again and prevented from enjoying the benefits 
of this development tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberal government were truly interested in the regions, 
it would not have replied, as the Minister of Natural Resources 
did to me, that it was up to the market, that other factors 
could not be taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this sound like a central government sensitive to needs and 
concerns, that would allow the regions to develop equitably, 
which would avoid the present disparities?

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Reg Alcock:</b>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member pointed out 
that we worked together.  He, the hon. member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière and I served on the committee 
that looked at reforms in employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Travelling with them, meeting and knowing these members, gave me 
some very important and valuable insights into Quebec.  I have 
talked about some of the strengths and energy that I see in 
Quebec.  These things encourage me and excite me.  They make me 
feel positive about what is happening in Quebec. It is through 
knowing members who contributed forcefully and effectively to 
that committee that I feel that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two things went on at that time.  I remind the member that took 
place in 1994-95 when we were at the height of battling the 
deficit.  We were in the midst of trying to get government 
spending under control.  There were some very definite changes in 
the benefit levels.  Also a philosophical change took place which 
talked about active rather than passive measures and doing things 
to help people gain employment rather than simply sit in 
unemployment.  I think we have seen some of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to advice that was offered by members of other parties 
about what the unemployment rate would be doing by the turn of 
the century, we have seen the unemployment rate come down rather 
substantially over the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not nearly enough.  I share the concern of the hon. member 
for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques.  My 
friend from New Brunswick has been on his feet many times raising 
the concern about seasonal workers and the unemployed in rural 
areas of eastern Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues should be brought to the floor of the House. 
Frankly I would sooner be standing here debating that issue today 
than spending time digging around in the entrails of this 
supposed alienation.

I would like to begin by indicating that I am going to be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to take part in this debate on the motion of the 
hon. member for North Vancouver, whom I met this summer, and who 
spoke to me of his region.  Speaking as the Bloc Quebecois 
critic for regional development, on first examination the first 
part of the motion by the hon. member for North Vancouver 
strikes me as worthwhile, in that the Bloc Quebecois can share 
his point of view about the feelings, the perception we have 
concerning the Liberal government's neglect of the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, with regard to the Liberal committee on alienation, I 
shall leave that part for his comments.  Mine I shall reserve 
for regional development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three Liberal secretaries of state responsible for 
regional development agencies, as they used to be called.  Now 
they are Economic Development Canada.  In the case of Quebec, 
the changed occurred last year, not for the sake of regional 
development but to give the Liberal Party better visibility, as 
it insisted on adding the word Canada all over the place.  Now 
the trend is not to refer to regional development but to 
Economic Development Canada for the Regions of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were serious in its efforts on behalf of the 
regions, it would be putting more money in if for no other 
reason than to offset inflation and so on.  When we look at the 
figures, we can see this is not the case for these three 
agencies.  I will not provide details for each of the programs, 
but in the case of the agency for Quebec, the current budget is 
reduced by some $27,636,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, this 
year there is a $40 million cut, since last year it was $320 
million and this year it is $290 million.  For the west—and here 
I must express my agreement with the Reform member—the budget for 
western Canada economic diversification, which was $313,626,000 
has been reduced this year to $195,055,000, a difference of 
$118,571,000.  That means a significant reduction in this year's 
budget.  That is the budget for the three agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the west, a look at the changes in per capita 
income since 1961 according to Statistics Canada data, reveals 
that the Liberal government is not entirely mistaken, if we use 
the per capita income criterion.  I am looking at the figures 
between 1961 and 1986.  If we compare the west to Ontario, it 
went from 84% per capita to 98%.  By the west we mean the three 
central provinces and British Columbia.  In 1996, per capita 
income was within 2%, and now most observers say that all the 
western provinces have caught up with Ontario in economic terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the Atlantic provinces?  In 1961, their per capita 
income was 49% of Ontario's and since then it has risen slightly 
to 69%. 
Per capita income in Quebec, which was 76% of Ontario's in 1961 
had increased to 82% of it by 1996.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, if we look at the figures for the agencies I mentioned 
earlier, we see that, between 1994 and 2001—since we are already 
dealing with the 2000-2001 budget—per capita federal spending on 
regional development in the maritimes is $1,074.40. In western 
Canada, per capital spending is $285.30. Quebec, like 
Ontario—which was at 82% in 1996—still has a lot of catching up to 
do, since our province is only getting $325.20 per capita, or 
three times less than the maritime provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand the concerns and representations of western 
Canada. 
However, based on these two figures provided by Statistics 
Canada and on the official budget figures, we can see that 
Quebec and the maritimes are even worse off than western Canada. 
In our opinion, Quebec still has a shortfall of $749 per capita, 
compared to the maritimes. The federal government is treating us 
even worse than the maritimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now look at the situation inside the province. Is the 
money properly distributed in Quebec by the Canada Economic 
Development for Quebec Regions Agency? We have figures from last 
year, since this data is released three months after the money 
is spent. We can see that, in Liberal ridings, investments 
totalled $41,546,973, or an average of $1.5 million per riding. 
In the case of ridings represented by Bloc Quebecois members, 
the average amount is $1.38 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on, but time is quickly running out.  Earlier, 
I heard the Secretary of State responsible for the Economic 
Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec say that 
he did not want to indulge in petty politics, something he 
charged the opposition parties with doing.  He wanted to take 
the high road.  I therefore asked him whether he could assure us 
that he was not using the regional development budget to make 
political hay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the numbers for some ridings, it makes me wonder. 
The riding in Quebec that receives the most money is 
Westmount—Ville-Marie, the riding represented by the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration.  Westmount is in downtown Montreal. 
Questions are in order. 
The riding that gets the most federal regional development 
dollars is smack in the middle of Montreal, in Westmount, the 
richest area in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more.  In the two minutes I have left, I would like to 
mention that I asked the Secretary of State responsible for the 
Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec 
why, if he was going to talk about partnership, he was not 
trying to reach agreement with the provincial governments, 
Quebec in particular, which has a federal-provincial agreement. 
It has been ages since that was renegotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked him why he was not undertaking to respect the strategic 
plans of regional development councils in Quebec. 
Why does he not do so?  More locally, why does the Secretary of 
State for Quebec regional development obstinately refuse access 
to the boards of the CFDCs, these corporations that loan money 
to small businesses, to members of local development centres, 
which are structures on which all Quebec stakeholders, including 
the municipalities, are represented, and all other sectors. He 
refuses to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead he is looking for a parallel policy 
in order to ensure visibility, for example by making 
arrangements to provide local chambers of commerce with 
computers so they can provide the federal programs with 
information, instead of seeking to join forces with structures 
that really represent the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government that wants to reach agreement so as to forge 
partnerships ought to respect provincial policies first of all, 
second regional council policies, and third the agreements of 
citizens at the local level, who have joined forces with the 
local development centres in order to carry out projects.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</b> Mr. Speaker, 
I have listened to the member opposite's references to the 
CFDCs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing he neglected to mention.  These were created 
with the key companies in Abitibi—Témiscamingue in 1983 and put 
in place by the government in 1984.  Quebec turns up 15 years 
later with the CLDs.  Are there volunteers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec Minister of Agriculture Rémi Trudel described the CFDCs a 
number of years ago as “he finest forum in the regions for 
concerted efforts; it comes from the federal government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I have a question and this is what I want to ask the hon. 
member: After 15 years of efforts by the CFDCs using federal 
funding and the money of Quebeckers, this is the finest forum 
for concerted efforts and yet the member speaks of duplication. 
They are the ones who want to duplicate. 
Quebec wants to duplicate what the federal government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member referred to the CLDs, which have just been created. 
They have virtually no funds, while the CFDCs are well 
established throughout the province of Quebec, Abitibi in 
particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member whether all this has to be done away with? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</b> Mr. Speaker, I would first like to say that I 
notice the member wants to recover go back some 15 years, to the 
time he spent as a Progressive Conservative member. It is a fine 
effort, and we see what he is up to. The words are the same, the 
party is different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows very well that the CLDs are a replacement 
structure, with an expanded mandate, which serve as a complement 
to the existing economic councils, even those existing 15 years 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member speak of duplication by the federal government. It 
existed 15 years ago and still exists. The efforts of the 
Government of Quebec through various departments responsible for 
regional development mean the work done by the SADCs is 
recognized.  They do an excellent job, no one is criticizing 
them.  They act as volunteers on the boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have expertise we want to promote, on the condition that 
the minister agrees these people can work on a co-operative 
basis.  He is the one currently blocking things now.  He is 
busting his britches looking only for visibility for the Liberal 
government, for his party and for federalism.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I 
followed the debate and accessed some of the research points, and 
I think this goes to what the member has been saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider some of the examples respecting the western 
provinces like federal funding for Tri-University Meson Facility 
in B.C., $166 million; $670 million in Alberta in infrastructure 
projects; $359 million in Saskatchewan for infrastructure 
projects and another $1.5 billion for an aerospace industry 
initiative; and another $224 million in Manitoba in federal 
assistance to the Red River Valley fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the different initiatives the federal government 
has taken with regard to the provinces I have just talked about, 
we recognize very clearly the diversity of Canada.  Certainly 
Quebec has had its share of difficulties.  The federal and the 
provincial governments have come together to address the needs of 
the people of Quebec, especially at times of need and natural 
disasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member, in the brief time remaining, comment on the 
significance to him of the social union, and particularly the 
health accord to which the Premier of Quebec is a signatory? 
Would he view that as a sign of federal provincial co-operation 
which benefits all Canadians?

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</b> Mr. Speaker, the member said a lot of things. 
It is very easy for anyone in this House to take a series of 
figures, financial support here, a contract there and maybe a 
loan somewhere else.  It can make different impressions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are mixing apples and oranges.  Today's discussion is not 
about all the federal programs, but about regional development. 
The figures I quoted earlier are in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For fifteen seconds, I am going to comment on the social union. 
It is an agreement in which the provinces other than Quebec, 
wanting more money, sacrificed principles and jurisdictions for 
it, something Quebec was not prepared to do.  It values its 
jurisdictions, it values its principles and its objectives and 
it will not be bought. 
<P><A NAME="LINK274"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in the debate 
on the Reform Party motion, at the end of this opposition day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I partially agree with the motion, particularly its first part, 
which provides that this House should condemn the government for 
failing to identify and address the main concerns and issues of 
the regions of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to that first part of the motion, there are many 
issues, many realities which show that in Canada, since the last 
two elections, that is since the Liberals took office—and the 
membership of this parliament is a prime example—regional parties 
have a strong representation. 
These are parties that represent Canada's regions, because there 
is a great deal of frustration among our fellow citizens. Let me 
give you a few examples to support my point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is the whole issue of employment insurance. A few 
years ago, the government decided to completely change the 
unemployment insurance program and to transform it into what was 
called the employment insurance program. However, this is much 
more a program used by the government to fight the deficit, to 
try to pocket money as quickly as possible, without any regard 
for the impact on regional development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, a kind of social pact had been in place for quite 
some time, in fact for several decades. There was a major 
seasonal industry in resource-based regions, such as those living 
off the agricultural, logging or fishing industry, since there 
were no permanent jobs in those industries. 
An EI system was introduced that allowed people to work during 
periods when there were jobs and to have supplemental income 
during periods when there were none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A forestry worker cannot cut down trees year round.  It is the 
same for fishers; there is a period of the year when it is not 
possible to work.  Those who harvest peat, an industry in my 
region, have the same problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government decided to scrap this social pact.  It 
tightened up the EI program to the point where many people have 
no income at all for five, ten or fifteen weeks every year. 
Another result is that someone earning minimum wage will receive 
EI benefits that are actually less than welfare, and thus less 
than the minimum required to get by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not hypothetical examples.  I am talking about folks 
we see in our ridings.  Recently, I met with someone in this 
very situation, a 51-year-old man who had always had a seasonal 
job and was therefore being penalized.  He was losing 1% of his 
benefits for 15, 20 or 25 weeks every year.  This is completely 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For people such as these in our regions, the federal 
government's behaviour shows that it has no understanding of or 
sensitivity to regional development needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have other similar examples.  If the federal government were 
concerned about the needs of the regions, it would already have 
introduced a pro-shipbuilding strategy. 
It would listen to the suggestions of the member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière and this industrial sector could be 
revived in the regions where it once throve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its inaction and failure to understand what is needed to 
put things right, the federal government continues to ignore the 
needs of the regions, to stand in the way of their full 
development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is the millennium scholarships. Some will say 
that scholarships are far from being regional development.  In 
Canada, however, there are people, federalists, who consider 
Quebec to be a region of Canada. They tell the Quebec 
government, which is responsible for education, “Your loan and 
scholarship program, the best in Canada, will be shunted aside 
and we will create a plan for merit-based scholarships which will 
directly finance the university studies of certain students but 
this will be according to their academic success and not their 
financial need”.  This is in direct contradiction with the basic 
principles of the Quebec program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one more way for the federal government to show that it 
has solutions for everything and must, in order to raise its 
profile, trample on people's needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier there was a debate on the CFDCs.  No one has said that 
all federal government ideas are bad ones, but what is certainly 
bad is to have put in place and perpetuated for decades two 
regimes for local development, side by side.  Even if today 
there are the Community Futures Development Corporations, with a 
mandate and a community base, there are also CLDs, local 
development centres.  Why both, when each region could manage 
very well with just one?  Because the federal government insists 
on being involved in regional development, a sector clearly not 
its responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples of how the federal government violated, 
if you will, the social pact that united Canadians. We witnessed 
this with the income sharing program and the changes to 
equalization rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first part of the Reform Party motion obviously refers 
to people living in the various regions of Canada. Now, national 
policies are dictated by bureaucrats. This is not necessarily 
because elected representatives act in bad faith, but because of 
the huge bureaucracy that the government has allowed to develop 
in Ottawa over the past 20 or 25 years. Very quickly, those 
appointed to cabinet start speaking primarily on behalf of these 
bureaucrats, instead of representing their voters and the 
various regions of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must root out this evil in Ottawa. In that sense, the Reform 
Party motion is right on target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand why the Liberal Party of Canada is desperately 
trying to establish roots in various parts of the country, 
because there are some regions where no Liberals have been 
elected for a long time, which is also a reflection of public 
discontent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, how could people in Quebec's eastern region elect a 
Liberal candidate when, in recent years, the Liberal Party has 
reneged on its principles regarding how the unemployed should be 
treated, preferring instead to pursue the policies set in place 
by the Conservatives? People are not stupid. They know what they 
are doing when they vote. They are sending a message to the 
government, and the government should listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by describing what I think would be the way the 
federal government could show clearly it is listening to the 
regions.  Let us take the very real example of the gas pipeline, 
whose route, which was decided last year, could have been 
through eastern Quebec and northern New Brunswick and on to 
Sable Island.  The decision was to let market rules apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the Minister of Natural Resources blissfully told 
me in a letter “We have decided to leave the market 
rules,—to ensure the natural gas finds its way as quickly as possible 
to the United States—to let these people have a significant 
competitive edge”.  However, had the entire region between 
Bernières, the Rivière-du-Loup region and New Brunswick been 
provided with natural gas, there would have been a significant 
competitive edge that would have attracted business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Either market rules prevail, and gas service is provided 
where business exists, or the government plays the role of 
financial lever of economic development and gives the regions 
appropriate tools.  This is the sort of action the people in our

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 12 consideration of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</b>  When debate was

minutes remaining. 
<P><A NAME="LINK303"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</b>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to inform the House, as we finish this 
debate tonight, that my colleague and I are not holding any 
malice or prejudice.  We want something that Canadians are asking 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us in this House were elected to represent the people. If 
I did not go back often to my constituency and report to my 
constituents, I can imagine what their reaction would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When somebody has the honour of not only being elected but being 
appointed to the cabinet, which is an additional responsibility, 
we want and Canadians want that person to not only follow the 
code of ethics as an MP, as a cabinet minister and as someone 
serving in Her Majesty's government, but to also be more 
accountable to the people they serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of parliament are here to adhere to a code of 
ethics, a code that should be and is available to the public. 
However, the code of ethics which belongs to the executive 
branch, or the cabinet, is not made public.  We believe that to 
be a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a national trend around the country.  School boards and 
businesses are publishing a code of ethics.  We believe that it 
would be in the interest of not only the government but all 
Canadians to have a public code of ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last two weeks my office was able to obtain a ministerial 
code of ethics from the following countries:  Brazil, Germany, 
Israel, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and the 
European Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been asking the Prime Minister for over five years for a 
ministerial code of ethics.  Some great democracies have made 
their codes of ethics public.  As a matter of interest to 
members, many of these codes of ethics from our fellow 
democracies are on the Internet.  However, our country is keeping 
company with countries like China and North Korea who do not 
release any information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose the question that Canadians are most often asked is 
the question I want to ask the Prime Minister.  What about 
openness?  If he does not want his personal ethics and honesty 
called into account, why does he not just release the ministerial 
code of ethics to the public? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's world one not only has to be honest but one has to 
appear as honest.  We could do a lot of good in this country and 
have a better image of this institution, parliament, if indeed we 
had this code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote from an article in which the Prime Minister said 
the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect those who disagree with decisions I have made as Prime 
Minister.  I welcome honest debate about the policy directions 
set by my government.  But I will never countenance unwarranted 
attacks upon my personal ethics and honesty. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that to be a fair statement.  However, in the same 
article the Prime Minister goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 36 years I have conducted myself in an honest and ethical 
fashion and have tried to do my best for the people of my riding. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an admirable statement.  This Prime Minister could go 
down in glory. 
The Prime Minister could leave with real credibility when he 
retires by introducing a code of ethics.  It would be to his 
honour, to the honour of Canadians and certainly to the honour of 
all elected officials, including myself.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He is now in the position of not only being a Prime Minister who 
is responsible to his constituency, but he and his government is 
also in a position to make a significant change in how Canadians 
view their government.  He is in a position to make a significant 
change in how Canadians should want to see their cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two basic questions which must be asked.  First, is 
there a separate code of ethics for the cabinet?  Second, like 
other democracies, will the Prime Minister make that document 
public? 
<P><A NAME="LINK304"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</b> 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member for Souris—Moose Mountain 
for his motion and his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been much talk of ethics in politics of late, 
particularly in the United States, and I think it is something 
that bears discussion.  We know that when it comes to 
transparency and openness, these are just empty words to this 
government, and particularly to the Prime Minister.  They are 
about as worthless as red books No. 1 and No. 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arrogance of this government truly knows no bounds.  The 
Liberals cried foul toward the previous Conservative government 
for years.  The howls rained out from the Liberals, when they 
were in opposition, about patronage, conflict of interest and 
unethical behaviour.  Now that they are in government they 
continue to act in a completely irresponsible manner.  They 
continually distract the public's mind from their own public 
record by further perpetrating previously unoriginal untruths. 
They also continually make concerted efforts to soil the good 
names of their former political adversaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only need make reference as truth to this of the continuing 
national and international embarrassment known only as the Airbus 
affair.  This ill-conceived and maliciously politically motivated 
witch hunt continues and costs Canadians millions of dollars.  We 
know that the acts of omission or commission perpetrated by 
members of the government will eventually be exposed.  That is 
the only solace we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the actions of the Prime Minister and his minister, it is 
absolutely hilarious that we are in the House today debating a 
code of ethics that would apply to them.  However, if we consider 
it ethical to maliciously attack a former prime minister with 
unsubstantiated legal accusations, or if we consider it ethical 
to shut down a democratically elected House when it is trying to 
have a debate to decide whether to upgrade or continue our 
country's participation in a foreign conflict, that perhaps might 
be ethical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please pardon my sarcasm, but it seems to me that it is an 
oxymoron when we even try to mention the word “ethics” in 
respect to the Prime Minister and this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is the code of ethics that does exist, if it does 
exist, is not made public.  I will repeat that.  A public code of 
ethics does not exist when it comes to the Prime Minister.  What 
are some examples of strict ethical guidelines that would govern 
the conduct of our esteemed ministers?  Nobody knows.  I suppose 
Canadians could simply listen and watch the government and decide 
if their ministers and the Prime Minister are acting ethically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon looking at the action of the ministers, I guess one could 
say once again that for the Liberals an incident such as their 
decision on the Kosovo debate, or inaction on the Kosovo debate, 
might be deemed ethical, or perhaps we could look at the Prime 
Minister's own actions.  I think a leader should lead by example 
and allow his party members to follow in his footsteps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if, for example, Liberals would follow in the footsteps 
of their leader when it came to purchasing a money losing hotel 
in the Shawinigan area and then unloading it to convicted 
criminals who then receive hundreds of thousands of dollars from 
taxpayers?  I wonder if that would be an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there would be a chapter in this code of ethics that 
says it is morally and ethically acceptable to skip the funeral 
of a beloved and respected world leader.  Perhaps the Liberal 
supporters could tell us about Pierre Corbeil.  Maybe he could 
come in and lecture the cabinet about business ethics when it 
came to fundraising in the Quebec area.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, but not least, the Prime Minister could give an ethics 
class on the proper and ethical manner to use the national police 
force when it comes to furthering personal political vendettas. 
These moral and ethical standards that are not reached by the 
Prime Minister and the government are truly to the country's 
detriment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All sarcasm aside, it is obvious that a code of ethics for 
ministers should exist and it should be open and transparent to 
public scrutiny.  I humbly submit that if, in fact, the Liberal 
code of ethics does exist, then why would it not want to make it 
public?  As the previous speaker mentioned, why would it not want 
to benefit from the support the public would find in knowing this 
document does in fact exist? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the Liberals not want to try to increase the level of 
public confidence?  Why would they not want to bolster somehow 
the public confidence, or try to do away with some of the 
cynicism that in fact exists?  That is truly the situation in the 
country right now when it comes, unfortunately, to most 
politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians might then begin to have faith in their government and 
they could hold governments accountable for their actions by 
weighing in against the government on their own ethical conduct 
that they hold out as an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member again for bringing this motion 
forward.  It is high time that we started discussing things like 
this when it seems apparent that the public has lost so much 
faith in its elected representatives.  Once again, I support the

pleased to speak to Motion No. P-31, presented by the hon. member 
for Prince George—Bulkley Valley.  It requests that the Prime 
Minister table in the House his ethics code for ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made integrity and ethics a top priority for our 
government, as we promised in the 1993 and 1997 election 
campaigns.  We have done this by keeping our promises for new 
policies and legislation and for new standards of ethical 
behaviour. We have delivered on our election commitments to meet 
the needs of Canadians through new policies and programs.  Allow 
me to point out a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We promised to improve prosperity for Canadians and the 
unemployment rate is now at the lowest level since 1990.  In 
fact, in my area of Niagara, it is less than the national 
average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We promised to reduce the budget deficit and we did.  In fact, 
it is the first time this has occurred in almost three decades 
that we have a surplus.  It speaks to the commitment this 
government has to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent budget also contained important initiatives to 
develop Canada's international competitiveness in a 
knowledge-based global economy.  These are promises made and 
delivered on by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The integrity demonstrated by the government toward Canadians is 
not a paper exercise.  It is a reality.  It is an ongoing 
commitment we show Canadians each and every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leadership the government has shown in creating a government 
Canadians are proud of sets an example of what integrity in 
government really means.  We have kept our election promises 
about specific actions on integrity.  Allow me to elaborate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister tabled a new conflict of interest code for 
public office holders in the House on June 16, 1994, early in our 
first mandate.  It sets out principles and clear rules for all 
public office holders, ministers, secretaries of state, 
parliamentary secretaries, ministerial staff and full time 
governor in council appointees.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We also strengthened the Lobbyists Registration Act and a new 
ethics councillor was appointed in 1994 with responsibilities for 
administering the code and investigating complaints about 
lobbying activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have kept our election promises about new standards of 
ethical behaviour.  The conflict of interest code has clear rules 
for public office holders, including ministers, and the 
government is committed to upholding it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I oppose Motion No. P-31 which requests that the Prime Minister 
table his ethics code for ministers in the House.  As noted, the 
Prime Minister has already tabled the conflict of interest code 
in parliament.  It sets out principles and clear rules which 
apply to all public office holders, including ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All parliamentarians have a responsibility to gain and keep the 
trust of Canadians in government institutions.  This is an 
obligation that we take seriously.  It is an obligation that I 
know my colleagues across the way also believe is a pillar of our 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us cut through the smoke.  This motion is really about 
access to the Prime Minister's personal advice to ministers on 
government issues.  The Prime Minister provides personal 
instructions to his ministers on a wide range of governance 
issues.  Communications between the Prime Minister and the 
ministers by the nature of our system are confidential.  This 
type of advice is protected as a cabinet confidence under section 
69 of the Access to Information Act.  Parliament itself, in 
passing the Access to Information Act, decided that documents 
which constitute advice from the Prime Minister to his ministers 
are cabinet confidences and would be protected under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The heart of the Canadian system of government centres around 
collective responsibility.  This means that the government is 
responsible to parliament.  The government must maintain the 
confidences of the House in order to govern, but for ministers to 
fulfill their collective responsibility to parliament and 
Canadians they must be able to discuss their views frankly and 
fully.  Cabinet confidentiality allows ministers to debate issues 
openly among themselves and to concentrate on the objective of 
our system of government, which is to take good policy decisions 
for the benefit of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has already responded to the motion that we are 
debating by stating that information sought by the hon. member is 
considered a confidence of the Queen's Privy Council and in 
keeping with Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 446(2)(i) and 
section 69 of the Access to Information Act, I would ask the hon. 
member to withdraw his motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of

because my colleague from Elk Island, as I understand it, wants

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some hon. members here are new, so they may not know that in the 
previous parliament I was the Reform Party member on the special 
joint committee which studied a code of ethics for senators and 
members of parliament.  Of course, as we all know, members of 
parliament include senators.  We are all included in the term.  I 
had the extraordinary privilege of serving on that committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, it is another of those issues which is not 
black and white.  It is not a simple issue.  It is a very 
complicated issue in terms of what it is that we require public 
officers, cabinet ministers and, indeed, even ordinary members of 
parliament to disclose.  Generally, the principle, in my view, is 
that there should be no hidden features of one's life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when I was a young man and my wife and I moved into a 
little town in Alberta.  There were some 200 people in that town 
and some people said to me “How can you stand to live in that 
little town?  Everybody knows what you are doing”.  I said “I 
don't plan on doing anything bad, so it doesn't matter”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That really is the essence of it.  Generally speaking, people 
only want to have secrets if they are going to do something bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am aware that there are exceptions.  When people have 
business dealings, for example, sometimes there are things they 
do not want their competitors to know.  That is valid.  However, 
we have a rule in this country that members of parliament who 
become cabinet ministers have a higher code.  They must divest 
themselves of their interests.  They may not directly deal with 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a couple of issues with the Liberal government since 
1993 which have consumed us and have really put into question the 
whole integrity of it.  We have had a few issues lately with the 
Prime Minister himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember in the previous parliament a situation where there 
was an inappropriate use of a credit card by a cabinet minister. 
That puzzled me endlessly.  If a person has credit card 
statements which prove that what they did was not wrong, why 
would they not disclose them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked for them under access to information and they were 
denied.  In fact, they were not denied.  We got pages and pages 
of blank paper.  The heading was at the top and then everything 
was whited out.  Then there was a little code that said we could 
not have the information because it was personal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the point exactly.  A public credit card was being used 
for personal reasons, but we could not find out the details.  It 
was really very bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that one would be eager to disclose.  That is 
what I said to reporters at the time because I was grilled on 
this.  I said that the easiest thing in the world would be to 
simply bring out all of the statements.  They are all on record. 
Bring them out and make copies of them.  Show the reporters the 
originals.  Let them have a copy of them.  Here it is.  There is 
nothing wrong.  But as long as they are not disclosed, then the 
suspicion remains and there are all kinds of protestations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They went through this motion of tabling stuff in the House. 
When we looked at what they tabled, it had no relevance at all to 
the question.  It was just a snow job, if you will pardon the 
expression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have the question about the Prime Minister's code of 
ethics for his ministers.  This is a very important issue.  We 
know that it exists.  We know that we have not seen it.  It is 
not the public office holders' code, which is public.  The reason 
we know that is because in the debate with the Prime Minister 
over this issue at various times he has said “My ministers have 
seen it.  They have read it.  They understand it.  They obey 
it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot read nor understand that which does not exist.  So we 
know that it exists.  There was also a very clear indication that 
it was not just simply the public office holders' code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this motion for the production of papers calls for is 
simply that the code be made public.  For the life of me, I do 
not know why anybody on this side of the House, whose job it is 
to hold the government accountable, would be against this motion. 
Of course we want to know what that code is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would think that every Liberal member on the other side who 
really believes in the Liberal red book and its promises to 
increase integrity in government would also want to vote in 
favour of this motion.  Of course they would want to have 
openness in government.  They would want the people of Canada to 
know what the rules of engagement are for ministers of the crown. 
That is an essential part of rebuilding the trust of government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had some 30 years of Liberal and Conservative 
governments where the integrity of government has been questioned 
by Canadians.  That is why there is so much cynicism.  I think 
that is one of the reasons less than 50% of the people turned out 
in the recent byelection.  They are so cynical that they say 
“What difference does it make?”  It is time we restored to 
Canadians faith, trust and confidence in the integrity of the 
Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members on both sides of the House to vote in favour 
of this most important motion.  It is probably one of the most 
important motions that we will debate this evening. 
<P><A NAME="LINK307"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</b>  Mr. 
Speaker, I had not intended to speak to this motion.  It is just 
happenstance that I happen to be here.  However, I will say that 
I always like to support any motions or legislation which call 
for greater transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I do have to make a comment here because the flaw in the 
motive behind this motion, is basically that there is no 
code of conduct for MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was amazed when I came to this House from a background in 
journalism to find that there was no written code of conduct for 
MPs, in the same sense that there is for journalists.  At the 
Toronto <I>Star</I>, for example, there is a binder which contains 
page after page of descriptions on how expensive is an acceptable 
gift, how expensive is an unacceptable gift. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been incredibly surprised that there is no questioning 
whatsoever when MPs go on very expensive trips around the world 
which are financed by corporations.  It is one thing to travel 
with a parliamentary committee when one is supported by one's 
whip, but when one accepts freebies on the part of corporations 
one has to question the ethics of the individuals who are 
accepting those freebies.  Yet many in this House would see 
nothing wrong with accepting those freebies.  I can assure 
members that when it comes to gifts in the world of journalism 
there are very strict rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the problem with the reluctance to disclose a prime 
ministerial code of ethics is that we do not have a minimum 
standard of ethics that applies to MPs in general.  If we had 
that minimum standard I would suggest to the hon. member who is 
proposing the motion, whose intentions are very good, that there 
would be no need for the motion because then we could appreciate 
that the prime minister, any prime minister, might have a 
different level of ethics that he applies to his cabinet that 
pertain to the political ethics of the way members of cabinet 
conduct themselves both within this parliament and in the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would never like to find myself on the side of not supporting 
a request for transparency, but the reality is that we cannot put 
any prime minister in the position where his code of ethics, 
which deals with politics rather than fundamental ethics, would 
put him in the situation where he would be disclosing what indeed 
are potential cabinet confidences.  I think there is a real issue 
which pertains to the Access to Information Act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK308"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley,

Wentworth—Burlington has demonstrated that he can think for 
himself.  I appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that in his heart of hearts he sees merit in this motion. 
I also know that in his heart of hearts he does not truly 
believe the argument which he just put forward because it does 
not hold water.  The fact that there apparently is no code of 
ethics for regular MPs has no bearing on the responsibility of 
our Prime Minister, the leading political figure of Canada. 
It does not exempt him in any way from showing leadership and 
producing a code of ethics which would apply to the most powerful 
decision makers in the country.  We cannot compare the cabinet 
member's decision making powers with those of other MPs in this 
House.  There is no comparison.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is all about putting in place a code of ethics that 
would give Canadians confidence that the most powerful decision 
makers in this country, which are the cabinet members, have a 
code of conduct or guideline which they must adhere to in the 
performance of their duties and in their decision making 
exercise.  This code of ethics should be transparent so that on a 
daily basis Canadians can observe whether these powerful decision 
makers are operating in a manner which is respective and 
indicative of their jobs.  That is not rocket science to 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first reaction of most people who hear the opposition to 
Motion P-31 might be that the reason Liberal members of 
parliament and other MPs would oppose it is that they themselves 
lack a little trust in how the government's cabinet members 
conduct their jobs and how they conduct themselves in the 
performance of their duties.  If they had full confidence in the 
ethics and integrity of their cabinet members, then what on earth 
would they have to fear about having a very public code of 
ethics?  They would have no fear of their members breaking that 
code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal members are standing up to oppose the public 
presentation of a code of ethics for their cabinet ministers. For 
what reason?  One has to assume they fear that their cabinet 
ministers may not be operating in an ethical manner. That is the 
only conclusion Canadians who are watching this debate tonight 
can draw.  If they have nothing to hide, then put it out in the 
public.  That is what Canadians understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flaw is not that there is no common code of ethics for MPs. 
The Prime Minister has stood in the House and told us time and 
time again that there did exist a special code of ethics for his 
cabinet members, that his cabinet ministers have read it and they 
understand it.  The big flaw in the government is that the Prime 
Minister is not going to let the public know exactly what that 
code of ethics is.  How can the Canadian people have any trust in 
a Prime Minister who would withhold a code of ethics for his 
cabinet ministers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members to support this motion, including the Liberal 
members who will want to show the Canadian people that the

<P><A NAME="LINK312"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</b> Mr. Speaker, on February 
11, 1999, I asked a question in the House about the situation in 
Montreal, where people had to wait 48 hours before getting a 
hospital bed. In Toronto, authorities were thinking about 
transferring sick children to the United States. In British 
Columbia, $10 million were allocated to improve the situation. 
In Quebec, the figure was $20 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health said that we had to be patient, that the 
budget was coming, that funds would be available, because health 
was a priority for the Prime Minister. We did as the minister 
suggested and waited patiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1969, it will be remembered, the federal government paid up 
to 50% of hospital expenditures in the provinces. This year, 
before the budget was brought down, the federal contribution for 
hospital costs was down to 11%. With the new budget, it has now 
gone up to about 15%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is becoming difficult for the provinces. Since 
health is such a priority for Canadians, it is important to put 
the emphasis on this issue and to review the cost sharing 
formula between the federal government and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the federal government will say that it has invested <I>x</I> 
number of billions of dollars. 
Yet, at the same time, there are people waiting in the hospital 
corridors for care.  People go to the hospital and have to wait 
until there is a cancellation to get an operation.  Sometimes 
they have to wait as long as nine months for heart surgery, for 
example.  This is inhumane.  It is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I put the question on February 11 on behalf of 
Canadians throughout the country, so the government would invest 
a lot more and find solutions so that people—our parents, our 
grandparents, children needing health care—can get a hospital bed 
and are not put in the corridor.  We must have proper care.  We 
must make sure people with heart problems, cancer, or any other 
health problem, are treated as humans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to see people waiting as long as 48 hours in a 
hospital to be seen by a doctor and receive appropriate care. 
This should be given high priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members themselves said that health was a priority 
for Canadians.  I wish to remind the House again that, in 1969, 
the federal government paid 50% of each province's hospital care 
costs.  Today, it pays around 15%.  This is unacceptable.  It is 
difficult for the provinces to administer health care systems if 
they do not receive the transfer payments from the federal 
government to which they are entitled and which they need in 
order to be able to help people.

Health, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the 
member for Acadie—Bathurst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the hon. member that health is a shared 
jurisdiction.  The federal government is responsible for the 
Canada Health Act, health protection and promotion, and the 
safety of Canadians when it comes to health. The provinces design 
and deliver health services to the people of their provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Health answered the member's question in 
the House, he gave him a very good answer.  He said that in the 
budget we will be making a very important significant investment 
because health and health care is a priority to this government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget we saw the biggest single investment this 
government has ever made.  It went to increased transfers to the 
provinces and to the territories for health care very 
specifically. Other large investments as well went into many 
areas within the federal government's jurisdiction, our own 
programs which support the health of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget demonstrated the government's commitment to defending 
medicare in the country.  We are defending access to quality 
care, ensuring that care is available to all who need it 
regardless of their ability to pay. We have listened to the 
concerns of the people and to the provinces, and to the many 
groups who share as we do the concerns about the future 
directions of health care in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have told their governments they are concerned about 
health care and it is a priority to them.  We have responded.  We 
have listened.  We have acted because health care and the health 
of Canadians is a priority to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listened and increased the Canada health and social transfer 
payment by $11.5 billion over the next five years.  The hon. 
member neglected to mention the important tax points that have 
been transferred to the provinces which generate growing income 
every year. There are now billions of dollars available from the 
tax points that have been transferred to the provinces for health 
care.

not realize the hon. parliamentary secretary was just winding up. 
I thought there was another page to go and it seemed like a good 
time to interrupt.
