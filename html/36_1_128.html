</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have several petitions to present today.  The first 
petition draws to the attention of the House the definition of 
marriage as the majority of Canadians understand it. 
Accordingly, the petitioners call upon parliament to enact Bill 
C-225 to amend the Marriage Act and the Interpretation Act to 
define marriage as being between a single male and a single 
female.

Speaker, the second petition comes from a large number of 
constituents and concerns the decision of the Canadian 
Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission not to licence 
four religious television broadcasters.  The petitioners call 
upon parliament to review the mandate of the CRTC and direct the 
CRTC to encourage the licensing of religious broadcasters.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have two petitions to present this morning.  The first 
petition, with 175 signatures, comes from my constituency, 
primarily from the districts of Leader, Prelate and Mendham in 
Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners wish to point out that the concept of marriage 
is a voluntary union of an unmarried male and an unmarried female 
and that it is the duty of parliament to ensure that marriage as 
it has been known and understood in Canada should be preserved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore call upon parliament to enact Bill 
C-225, an act to amend the Marriage Act and the Interpretation 
Act so as to define in statute that a marriage can only be 
entered into between a single male and a single female.

<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the second petition comes primarily from residents of 
Mount Albert, Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners call upon parliament to recognize that Bill C-68 
was supported by misleading statistical data when it was 
presented to parliament, that there is no evidence that the 
criminal use of firearms is impeded by restrictive firearms 
legislation, that the enforcement of Bill C-68 would be a major 
burden on police officers and that the search and seizure 
provisions of Bill C-68 would constitute a breach of traditional 
civil rights and would be an affront to all law-abiding 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore call upon parliament to repeal Bill 
C-68 and all associated regulations with respect to firearms and 
ammunition and pass new legislation designed to severely penalize 
the criminal use of any weapon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings the tally to 4,026 signatures on petitions of this 
nature which I have recently presented in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to present a number of petitions calling for significant 
changes to the present Young Offenders Act.  Over 350 petitioners 
call upon parliament to make the protection of society the number 
one priority in amending the Young Offenders Act through measures 
such as reducing the minimum age of young offenders, publishing 
violent young offenders' names, increasing the penalties for 
crimes committed by youth and ensuring parental responsibility.

petitioners have asked that the House repeal Bill C-68 and 
redirect the funds for the registration and licensing scheme to 
more effective means of reducing violent crime and improving 
public safety, such as more police and crime prevention programs, 
women's crisis centres, suicide prevention centres and increased 
resources for fighting organized crime and street crime.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from September 21, of the 
motion that Bill C-3, an act respecting DNA identification and to 
make consequential amendments to the Criminal Code and other 
acts, be read the third time and passed; and of the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  Perhaps hon. members 
who are carrying on discussions in the Chamber could have them 
outside so the business of the House could resume.  I am sure 
there are hon. members who wish to debate this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with the Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been closely following both sides of this debate and I 
rise today to speak in support of Bill C-3.  As the former 
chairman of the Waterloo regional police I have a keen interest 
in this area and in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from several hon. members that a DNA bank will 
increase public protection for all Canadians.  The police 
community has told us that a data bank will help law enforcement 
agencies identify suspects where they have no leads, that it will 
assist in identifying offenders who commit serious crimes across 
all police jurisdictions in Canada, and that it will help prevent 
future violent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure the police have the most effective tool possible Bill 
C-3 has been drafted in accordance with the Constitution.  Bill 
C-3 will authorize the courts to order persons convicted of 
designated offences to provide DNA samples for inclusion in the 
data bank.  Upon conviction for a primary designated offence or a 
serious violent offence the court will issue an order requiring 
the offender to provide a DNA sample for the data bank, except in 
the most exceptional circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of a conviction for a secondary designated offence 
which includes robbery and break and enter, offences that 
Clifford Olson for example was convicted of in his early criminal 
career, the court upon application by the crown may issue an 
order for the DNA sample to be taken for data banking purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  An hon. member has 
the floor and it is very difficult for the Chair to hear the hon. 
member because of the loud conversations that are being carried 
on in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind hon. members that there are lobbies where these 
discussions can take place.  I invite members who are having 
discussions to please carry them on outside the Chamber so those 
who wish to hear the debate will be able to do so.  The hon. 
member for Waterloo—Wellington has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  In deciding whether to make an order in 
this instance the judge will consider the offender's criminal 
record, the nature of the offence and the circumstances 
surrounding its commission which are all relevant factors in 
identifying violent predators at a very early stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The data bank will capture penitentiary inmates who pose a high 
risk of future violent reoffending.  Bill C-3 will authorize DNA 
samples to be taken retroactively from designated dangerous 
offenders, repeat sex offenders and serial murderers.  The last 
group of offenders was added to Bill C-3 by the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights in response to concerns 
that offenders like Clifford Olson should be captured by the data 
bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By targeting offenders already in custody the data bank will 
offer the hope of solving long outstanding crimes where police 
have no leads.  It will make the most dangerous offenders think 
twice about committing a violent offence again because their 
genetic imprints will be in the data bank for future and quick 
identification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights studied Bill 
C-3 in depth and supported it.  Members of the House have closely 
examined it and have had an opportunity to study the expert legal 
opinions concerning its constitutionality.  The legal experts 
have advised us that Bill C-3 in its current form is consistent 
with Canada's Constitution.  However some members continue to 
discount this fact.  They insist on delaying passage of the bill 
by repeatedly arguing that it can be easily amended.  In so doing 
they are forgetting about the supreme court and the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amending the bill to permit the taking of DNA samples at the 
time of arrest or charge is a radical proposal that disregards 
the basic rights and freedoms guaranteed by the charter.  Any 
accused person in Canada has the right to be presumed innocent 
and protected from unreasonable search and seizure.  Bill C-3 
reflects a clear statement from our highest court that the taking 
of DNA samples constitutes a search and seizure which requires 
prior judicial authorization.  Before the police can search 
anyone's home or business premises they must first obtain 
judicial authorization to do so.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A search of a person's bodily substances is much more serious 
than searching a home or business because it interferes with 
bodily integrity and undermines human dignity.  Therefore the 
taking of a DNA sample for law enforcement purposes demands high 
standards of justification.  Taking a sample on the off chance 
that it might help the police crack an old and cold case simply 
does not meet those standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that the requirement for prior judicial 
authorization before DNA samples can be seized following 
conviction is one of the key features of Bill C-3.  It ensures 
that the charter rights of all Canadians are protected.  We must 
not overlook the fact that the police already have authority to 
take a DNA sample from a person for investigative purposes at the 
time of arrest or charge, or at any other time, as long as they 
first obtain a warrant allowing them to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DNA warrant legislation has been commended by the Supreme 
Court of Canada and has survived all constitutional challenges to 
date.  The most important reason the scheme has survived is that 
it provides for judicial oversight of the collection of DNA 
samples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be mindful that the police have never had an automatic 
right to search and seize in Canada.  This is because we have 
placed a high premium on our reasonable expectation of privacy, 
on the security and the dignity of the person, and on the right 
to be free from unnecessary state interference with those rights. 
It is these basic rights that make Canada one of the best 
countries in which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 builds on the solid foundation of the DNA warrant 
scheme and provides the police with the added capacity to compare 
DNA samples obtained from crime scenes with DNA samples from 
convicted offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, for example, we heard the misguided suggestion that 
taking samples upon charge would be constitutionally defensible. 
It is not.  On the contrary, the legal experts have clearly and 
emphatically stated that this is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last May the government publicly released independent legal 
opinions on this issue from three of the most experienced legal 
minds in the country:  former Justice Martin Taylor of the 
British Columbia Court of Appeal, former Chief Justice Charles 
Dubin of the Ontario Court of Appeal and former Chief Justice 
Claude Bisson of the Quebec Court of Appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These opinions are comprehensive and fully consistent with the 
views of the Canadian Bar Association and representatives of the 
Ontario attorney general, the New Brunswick attorney general, the 
Privacy Commissioner of Canada and the federal Department of 
Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to turn to what these eminent judges had to say 
about the proposal being put forth by the police community.  I 
quote the hon. Martin Taylor when he said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—I am of the opinion that legislative extension of police 
authority under Bill C-3 to sanction the taking of DNA samples 
without judicial warrant in the case of persons charged or 
arrested but not tried and convicted would be held contrary to 
the guarantees contained in one or more of ss. 7, 8 and 11(d) of 
the charter, would not be saved by s. 1 of the charter, and would 
therefore be found unconstitutional and of no force or effect 
under s. 52 of the Constitution Act. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. Claude Bisson said the following in his legal opinion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An enactment authorizing—the taking of bodily sample without a 
prior judicial authorization will not be, under the charter, a 
reasonable exercise of the power of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the guaranteed rights of a person by the charter 
having been infringed, the legislation would be invalidated 
because section 1 of the charter would not save such 
legislation—.There is no equation to be made between 
the—taking of fingerprints upon arrest and the taking—also 
upon arrest and without judicial authorization—of bodily 
samples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fingerprinting is not a search and seizure; the taking of bodily 
substances and samples is and, as such, should not be performed 
without the greatest safeguards, the first of it being a judicial 
intervention. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this is what the hon. Charles Dubin concluded: “the 
proposal to allow automatic seizure of bodily samples for DNA 
analysis upon arrest appears to me to serve little social 
purpose”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fingerprinting and DNA warrant provisions that already exist 
allow proper identification of arrested persons and provide 
police with the ability to obtain samples for DNA analysis from 
an individual who they reasonably believe is a party to a 
designated offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only additional purpose of automatic seizure of bodily 
samples on arrest would appear to be to increase a pool of 
contributors to the DNA data bank.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the significance of this law and the enforcement 
interest, based on the chance of a match between a person 
arrested and an unsolved crime, pales when compared with the 
intrusive nature of a seizure of bodily samples and does not 
outweigh the need for prior judicial authorization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians we cannot dismiss these legal opinions as 
being overly cautious, paranoid or even out of touch with the 
frontline police objective to better protect the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by saying we all share the goal of better public 
protection for all Canadians.  We also recognize the need to 
implement the DNA data bank quickly to prevent violent crime. 
Through the comprehensive review of Bill C-3 by the standing 
committee, our review of the legal opinions of the eminent judges 
and the extensive debate in the House the government has listened 
to all sides of the debate.  In the end the government has 
carefully balanced the competing views we have heard to develop 
proposals that will uphold the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a responsibility to give the police a tool they can work 
with, but we also have the responsibility to put forward a 
balanced piece of legislation that will not be thrown out after 
the first constitutional challenge.  Bill C-3 strikes this proper 
balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage all members of the House to join me in 
supporting Bill C-3 so we can move forward in implementing an 
effective DNA data bank for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
great interest to what my colleague said, still I have a major 
concern about this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles put forward are genuine, right and 
straightforward. The problem with this kind of evidence is that 
it is hard to contradict or rebut by ordinary citizens or 
lawyers defending themselves. This engineering evidence is so 
elaborate and complicated that it has to be made by a scientific 
consulting firm. Such means of rebuttal are generally not 
available to the defence. That is the danger presented by this 
kind of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am totally in favour of the principles, but we must ask the 
question. 
Recently, in Quebec, evidence was fabricated by crooked cops in 
the well-known case of the Matticks brothers. So, I wonder how 
the defence could rebut evidence like what would be required 
under Bill C-3 if it were dealing with, say, officers like the 
ones involved in the case I just referred to. That is my only 
concern. As for the rest, the principles, I am in favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore ask for reassurances concerning the tools 
available to an honest defence to rebut evidence made by the 
crown on the basis of Bill C-3. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
opposite for the question.  I certainly agree with his premise 
that this is a very complex issue and one that requires real 
balancing on the part of the government in this important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes it is very tricky to ensure the competing interests 
are balanced in a way that is fair and equitable, but I think in 
the great scheme of things we as a government have been able to 
do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to part of the hon. member's question, through my 
experience of 10 years with the Waterloo regional police I can 
say that the police of the country are great professionals who do 
a great job on behalf of all Canadians, wherever they may be. The 
police do the type of work that all of us should be proud of not 
only as parliamentarians but as people who live in this great 
land of ours, Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely crucial that we support the police whenever and 
however possible, knowing full well that they put their lives on 
the line for each and every one of us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to lend my 
support to Bill C-3, the DNA identification act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3, as it stands now, is a good first step in increasing 
public safety for all Canadians.  Protecting Canadians is and 
always has been a priority for this government.  I feel that the 
DNA database that will be created as a result of this bill will 
help police fulfil both aspects of their jobs.  It will help them 
to protect Canadians while upholding the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Extensive consultation went into the creation of this bill.  Law 
enforcement officers, legal experts and those concerned with the 
protection of privacy all contributed to Bill C-3.  The bill has 
been drafted to reflect their contributions and their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Granted, there are those who argued and who continue to argue 
that Bill C-3 needs to be stronger, that DNA samples should be 
taken at the time of arrest.  I have felt this way too.  However, 
in responding to this argument there are a few things to keep in 
mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, in order for this DNA databank to be effective in 
increasing public safety, it must be developed in accordance with 
the Constitution.  One former justice and two former chief 
justices all agreed that taking DNA samples on arrest or charge 
without prior judicial authorization would be unconstitutional. 
These legal experts and others have all said that if Bill C-3 
were amended to allow DNA samples to be taken at the time of 
arrest or charge the legislation would be found to be 
unconstitutional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill were to violate the Constitution it would fail, 
criminals would go free and this entire process of researching, 
drafting, amending and debating Bill C-3 would have been a 
complete waste of our time and of taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we must remember that the Criminal Code already allows 
the police to take a DNA sample from a person at the time of 
charge or any other time as long as they obtain a warrant to do 
so.  This legislation introduced in 1995 has been praised by the 
Supreme Court of Canada and has survived constitutional 
challenges to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 builds on the existing legislation by allowing samples 
to be taken from individuals once they are convicted of serious 
offences, including murder, sexual assault or break and enter, 
all heinous crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also allows for samples to be taken retroactively from 
those deemed to be dangerous offenders and from those convicted 
of more than one sexual offence or murder.  These are the 
criminals who could very well have committed crimes other than 
those they were convicted for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe it to the victims and to their families to explore every 
single option in catching the criminals who hurt them.  The 
retroactive taking of samples will enable us to see if the 
criminal responsible has already been caught.  Just think of the 
peace of mind that victims and their families would have once 
they knew that the criminal responsible for hurting them or their 
loved ones had already been convicted and was behind bars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, taking fingerprints and the collection of DNA samples are 
not the same.  We all know that police take fingerprints at the 
time of arrest.  However, the Supreme Court of Canada considers 
the taking of bodily samples to be a search.  To allow a sample 
to be taken based on a police officer's belief that a person is 
guilty of a given crime without the permission of a judge would 
be a warrantless search or seizure and therefore 
unconstitutional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Bill  C-3 is an important first step.  This is ground 
breaking legislation that requires a cautious approach.  Once 
this has been put into practice and tested we may be able to 
proceed further.  Taking samples for the databank when a criminal 
is convicted as opposed to when a suspect is charged will not 
prevent the police from doing their job.  On the contrary, it 
will provide them with an important and effective investigative 
tool that will allow them to do their job which is, as I 
mentioned previously, to protect Canadians and public safety and 
to uphold the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 is a good start.  Under this legislation young 
offenders will be treated in the same way as adults with the 
exception that their DNA profiles will be retained for a shorter 
period of time. 
This is in keeping with the length of time for which their police 
record is retained.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 allows law enforcement officers in Canada to co-operate 
with their colleagues in other countries for the purpose of 
criminal investigation.  This will allow Canadian police to 
access information in foreign DNA databanks to help solve crimes 
committed here in Canada and vice-versa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a parent I would never support a piece of legislation that I 
felt would put my family at risk.  As the member of parliament 
for Guelph—Wellington I would not support Bill C-3 if I thought 
it would not protect my neighbours and my community.  I am not 
one to be soft on crime or on criminals.  I firmly believe that 
people who are guilty should serve hard time if they have 
committed a serious offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I also believe that a person is innocent until proven 
guilty.  Canada is a democracy based on the principles of peace, 
order and good government.  The UN has recognized our great 
nation as being the best country in the world because of the wide 
range of opportunity and high standard of living we provide to 
our citizens.  To create a law that would violate someone's basic 
human rights would not only be unconstitutional, it would be 
un-Canadian.  That is something I could not support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good piece of legislation, one that will work to 
further protect public safety for all Canadians and one that will 
withstand legal scrutiny.  It will make the streets of 
Guelph—Wellington safer for my family, my neighbours and my 
entire community.  It will do the same for all communities right 
across this great land of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important first step, one that I hope the government 
will build on and I look forward to all members of parliament 
supporting the legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to voice my opposition to Bill C-3, an act respecting 
DNA identification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning we saw a very sad spectacle in the House of Commons 
where a closure motion was put on Bill C-3.  If I remember 
correctly, when those members were on this side in opposition 
they were the ones screaming the loudest when the former Tory 
government did the same thing with closure motions. Today what do 
they do?  The same thing, they put closure.  No wonder Canadians 
find respect for politicians at the bottom of professions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary did mention certain things as being 
the first step.  She said Bill C-3 was just a first step. 
However, as with Bill C-68, it will be watered down to where it 
actually becomes ineffective.  She says this bill if thrown out 
would be a waste of taxpayer money.  This watered down bill is a 
waste of taxpayer  money because was does it do? It does a half 
job.  It does not give our law enforcement agencies the full 
tools they need to fight crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has taken the position that she is tough on crime.  The 
record of being tough on crime is not there.  The Young Offenders 
Act is watered down.  Bill C-68 is watered down.  Bill C-68 has 
been changed to a degree where it is supposed to stop crime but 
it is not, it is infringing on the rights of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government transforms simple legislation into the most 
complicated legislation costing Canadian taxpayers a lot of money 
and does not do the job it is supposed to do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said Canada is the best place to 
live in the world as stated by the United Nations.  Yes, when you 
look at other factors, but Canadians today are demanding that 
streets be safe.  On that this government has a terrible record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am firmly committed to restoring confidence in our justice 
system.  Canadians need to know what it is to have a true sense 
of security.  This can be achieved only by strengthening our law 
enforcement agencies.  How do you do that?  By giving them all 
the tools they need to protect and apprehend the perpetrators of 
the most violent crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA identification is an example of one of those desperately 
needed tools.  If this process is used to its full potential, DNA 
identification could very well be the single most important 
development in fighting crime since the introduction of 
fingerprinting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We fully support the concept of DNA identification because it 
gives our law enforcement authorities one more weapon in their 
battle to combat crime.  However, if Bill C-3 is passed unamended 
it will give Canadians a false sense of security and therefore I 
cannot support this inadequate piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that Bill C-3 has such limited scope that I 
cannot in good conscience support it.  Bill C-3 requires those 
convicted of certain designated offences to provide samples of 
bodily substances for DNA analysis.  The problem with this is 
that the offender must be convicted prior to the processing being 
instituted.  This will result in the databank being of limited 
use to police for suspects and persons charged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Police Association has raised concerns over this 
specific issue too.  Police officers rightly point out that 
offenders arrested and charged with an offence would likely flee 
while on bail if they knew that DNA linking them to other 
offences would be obtained on conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has stated this is within the charter of rights 
and the Constitution.  I say it is more important to give tools 
to ensure that victims have more rights than criminals.  That is 
extremely important to recognize.  I say to the Supreme Court of 
Canada as well remember it is more important to recognize the 
rights of Canadians and victims than it is to recognize the 
rights of criminals which this government keeps doing time after 
time and destroying a good piece of legislation dealing with that 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 has offences that are split into two groups.  The first 
group automatically leads to DNA testing. Crimes listed under the 
first category include sexual assault, murder and sexual 
exploitation.  The second group permits seizure only if the court 
is satisfied that to do so is in the best interests of the 
administration of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the problem.  This is left to the courts again and we 
know the courts have been lenient with criminals.  The courts 
have been looking at the rights of the criminals over the rights 
of the victims and Canadians to make the streets safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that Bill C-3 has limited applicability in that it 
applies only to certain offences.  However, even for this limited 
list it is not guaranteed that the taking of DNA will be 
authorized.  It is clear that an effective, no-nonsense system of 
DNA identification is desperately needed in this country. Does 
Bill C-3 under the current act fulfil this needed desire?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By having a system that only applies to convicted felons who 
commit a narrow definition of listed crimes, we are truly doing a 
disservice to all Canadians seeking safer streets.  The fact of 
the matter is that DNA is a modern identification tool which is 
to the 1990s what fingerprinting was to the early 1900s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many American states have DNA data banks, including South Dakota 
which takes DNA testing once a charge has been laid.  A few years 
back Great Britain implemented a system that called for DNA 
seizure after a charge had been laid and the list of offences is 
far wider than what Bill C-3 covers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should never allow ourselves to be so stubborn that we could 
not turn our backs on a good idea simply because it is not a made 
in Canada idea.  Today we fingerprint all those who are charged 
for a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been saying, and this is where I differ, that 
a fingerprint is not a seizure.  A fingerprint is from our body. 
In here it is saying that taking bodily fluids is a seizure.  For 
the sake of crime and making streets safe, it is a justifiable 
seizure.  If this is the case then why can this government not 
expand the very little role it has given to the DNA collection? 
While it may be true that DNA seizure involves the invasion of 
personal privacy, it does serve a greater role in solving and 
controlling crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day parliamentarians must be able to look 
Canadians straight in the eyes and tell them that we have done 
everything in our power to protect them.  I do not see how we can 
do this by voting in favour of this legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the past speaker referred to 
the fact that the Reform Party cannot support this piece of 
legislation.  That makes me very sad.  This group of people claim 
to be law conscious and believe that we must move forward to try 
to do what we can to protect society. I understand this has been 
a very big plank in the Reform Party's platform. Again we see it 
breaking promises and moving away from the good of Canadians. 
That is a very sad thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government we know we have to enact laws that will 
withstand constitutional challenges.  We are told that at this 
time this bill will do that.  It is important to do that.  The 
Reform Party says to go ahead.  It will do anything.  It does not 
matter.  It does not matter if it is legal.  As a government we 
cannot behave like that.  We must work within a legal framework. 
We must be respectful of the law.  We must be respectful of 
Canadian citizens whom we represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is strange that the hon. member talked about the best place 
in the world to live.  However he said it with such disdain and 
negativity.  The Reform Party has made it also a plank in its 
platform to deal with the dark side, to fearmonger, to not move 
ahead.  That is unfortunate because we cannot continue to do 
that.  We have to move ahead.  We have to do things that are 
right for Canadians and that will help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform says that this is a false sense of security.  My question 
for the hon. member is, how could Reform possibly not support DNA 
identification for criminals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Madam Speaker, it looks like my speech 
went over the top of my colleague's understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said yes, we believe in this concept.  We agree that we need 
tools to fight crime.  The problem with the DNA bill is that it 
is a watered down bill that will not give us these tools. 
We support this concept.  We want the government to make this 
bill tougher so that Canadians feel protected.

have seen the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance not 
obeying the law of the land, specifically the Minister of Finance 
when he—

</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to the hon. member's question, I repeat again that the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil—Soulanges, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
over the last few months, I have followed this debate with great 
interest. As members of this House were told last week, Bill C-3 
will help the police in a number of ways, across the country and 
even internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having a DNA data bank will provide police with a strong tool in 
its fight against crime. It will also allow Canada to be a 
leader in the use of DNA identification technology and to then 
establish a national DNA data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Solicitor General of Canada deserves to be congratulated for 
the caution he showed in asking that the bill be carefully 
reviewed by a committee of the House made up of members from all 
parties. Personally, I also congratulate him for involving 
Canadians in the process, through a public debate on the 
subtleties and scope of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that Canadians be allowed to express their 
views and have a say in how their government operates. This is 
why the government held public consultations right across the 
country, before drafting and tabling its legislation last year. 
When the bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Human Rights before second reading, the committee heard over 
30 witnesses and diligently reviewed all the information 
submitted. 
Since it was introduced, Bill C-3 has been examined openly and 
transparently.  It really reflects Canadians' viewpoints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Genetic analysis is a powerful investigative tool, and the bill 
provides strong measures to protect against its possible abuse. 
The government has heard testimony from top experts, who said 
that genetic evidence can reveal much more about an individual 
than a breath sample, a finger print or even a blood sample. 
Given the power of genetic analyses, the issue of privacy is of 
considerable concern to our government.  We must therefore act 
with the utmost care.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards the protection of privacy, I would like to explain 
what the government considers to be the problems and how Bill C-3 
represents, in my opinion, a solid and balanced approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to raise the issue of keeping the samples. 
Scientists have put forward solid arguments showing that 
biological samples must be kept for the genetic data bank to 
take advantage of future technological progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, a forensic science expert from the RCMP told the 
committee last March that significant progress had been made in 
recent years in DNA identification technology. 
Smaller samples, including those found in decayed matter, can 
now be examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These technological advances prove that genetic analysis is 
clearly one of the most active and rapidly evolving scientific 
areas.  With developments in the technology, today's DNA 
profiles could become outmoded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 provides therefore that samples will be kept.  Canada's 
national DNA data bank will thus mirror the technological 
progress made the world over, and Canada will be able to send 
DNA information for medical and legal purposes to other 
laboratories and data banks throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of who will have access to the samples and to the 
DNA profiles arises. 
Drawing on the bill passed in July 1995 on warrants authorizing 
samples to be taken for DNA analysis, Bill C-3 includes 
protective measures and provisions on these samples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up to now, statutory provisions on warrants have withstood all 
legal challenges under the charter and have provided a solid 
basis for the creation of the DNA data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 therefore contains strict rules on biological sampling 
and DNA identification and on the retention of DNA profiles in 
order to protect personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, personal information will be protected under this law. 
The RCMP will be responsible for the secure storage of all 
biological samples.  Access to DNA profiles and samples will be 
limited strictly to those responsible for the operation and 
maintenance of the data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So that information is not misused, the bill provides explicitly 
that only the name associated with the profile will be supplied 
to police authorities during criminal investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill 
also makes it an offence under the Criminal Code and the DNA 
Identification Act to misuse any profiles or samples and 
provides for criminal sanctions against offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DNA data bank will respect the right to privacy of all 
innocent people at the crime scene or of law-abiding citizens who 
volunteer to provide DNA samples to the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the bill contains provisions for the destruction of 
information in the crime scene index pertaining to a victim or 
individual no longer considered a suspect after a police 
investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important safeguard designed to ensure that the data 
bank does not contain the DNA profiles of innocent people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also allows those required to give samples to state 
their preference as to the bodily substance to be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police must take these preferences into account, but are not 
in any way obliged to act on them, being required to consider 
other factors as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the Ontario Court of Justice ruled that the taking 
of hair samples violated charter provisions, and forensic 
experts said that blood was best suited to DNA analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 accordingly leaves it up to the police to decide on the 
most suitable samples to be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the bill has been drafted with extreme care. 
The Government of Canada is convinced of its ability to strike a 
balance between public safety on the one hand and the protection 
of privacy on the other.  In addition to the protective measures 
and sanctions set out in Bill C-3, there are other mechanisms 
aimed at guaranteeing that the bill will be applied in such a 
way as to maintain that balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the data bank is in operation, the Privacy Commissioner 
will be able to carry out an audit at any time.  He is already 
authorized by the Privacy Act to monitor the use of personal 
information in the hands of the federal administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Canadian forensic laboratories are in the process 
of drawing up accreditation standards. 
Once these standards are in effect, forensic laboratories can be 
audited by an independent body as well, in order to guarantee 
compliance with internationally recognized quality assurance 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are already provisions, such as those in the Privacy Act, 
to ensure that information, including DNA information, cannot be 
provided to another country unless an agreement is in place with 
that country.  The Privacy Act also prevents personal 
information from being provided to another country for any 
purpose other than law enforcement or investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the RCMP becomes responsible for the DNA bank, its 
operations will have to comply with RCMP internal standards, and 
these, I am proud to say, are among the most stringent in the 
world. 
In addition, the RCMP works in close collaboration with a number 
of international groups and committees in this area, including 
the FBI-sponsored Technical Group on DNA Analysis Methodology 
which provides Canada with state of the art technology and makes it 
possible for our country to ensure that its standards are in 
line with those in effect elsewhere in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to explain to you why sampling must be done at 
the time of sentencing, not at the time the person is arrested 
or charged, as some have proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have looked into this matter in great detail, both in the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights and as a 
government. 
During consultations on the bill, and during the committee 
hearings, many individuals and groups of experts told our 
government most emphatically that sampling at the time of arrest 
was problematical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA identification alone rarely leads to a conviction.  In fact, 
crime scenes do not always yield DNA evidence.  A number of 
factors—alibis, motives, fingerprints and eyewitness 
statements—are taken into consideration in criminal cases. 
However, in the face of insistence by the police community, 
which asked it to consider the possibility of amending the bill, 
the government consulted legal experts to find out whether 
samples could be taken without a warrant when an arrest is made 
or when charges are laid without contravening the provisions of 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three eminent former justices of the courts of appeal of Quebec, 
Ontario and British Columbia considered the matter in an 
independent investigation.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They unanimously upheld the government's position.  Under the 
law, taking samples during arraignment would contravene the 
provisions of the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, taking samples when charges are laid would contravene 
the provisions of the charter.  In Canada, the accused is 
presumed innocent and must be protected from all unreasonable 
searches or seizures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let there be no doubt on this point.  The government must 
continue to act cautiously and with forethought in this matter. 
We want to take the approach most favourable to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It serves no purpose to intrude in the personal privacy of 
everyone arrested, when genetic imprints may not even be 
necessary.  There is no point pondering this question further 
when the legal experts have told us on many occasions that there 
would be too great a risk of a challenge under the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we cannot endanger the establishment of a genetic data 
bank—whose purpose is to better serve Canadians—by being over 
zealous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sampling at sentencing will permit the effective application of 
legislation and protect individual rights during a criminal 
investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us therefore pass a bill that will be effective rather than 
a text that will surely not stand up to court challenges. 
The police know how easily the Constitution is used to dismiss 
charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that all members will share my view that it is contrary 
to public safety to have cases thrown out on technicalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore up to all members to play a constructive role in 
creating a DNA bank that will strike a balance between 
protection of the public and privacy rights under the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are obviously on the right track in our fight to protect 
Canadians against crime.  With Bill C-3, I believe that our 
government has struck the right balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore have no hesitation in supporting this bill and I 
recommend that all my colleagues in the House do likewise.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby—Ajax, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise and speak on Bill C-3, an act respecting DNA 
identification and to make consequential amendments to the 
Criminal Code and other acts.  I would also like to commend my 
colleague, the hon. member for Guelph—Wellington, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour. I agree with 
almost all the comments she made during her presentation this 
morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill represents the second phase of the government's DNA 
strategy. The first phase, Bill C-104, was put in place two and a 
half years ago when amendments were made to the Criminal Code to 
create a DNA warrant system.  That system provides for a 
provincial court judge to issue a warrant allowing police to 
collect samples of bodily substances when a person is suspected 
of committing a designated offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from those on the front lines who tell us that the use 
of DNA evidence has been a very powerful investigative tool.  It 
is already proven to be one of the most accurate methods of 
obtaining solid identification in criminal investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The warrant system is working well.  I remind members opposite 
that it can be obtained on arrest and charge.  With reasonable 
and probable grounds warrants will be issued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second phase of the DNA initiative further demonstrates that 
the government is committed to fighting crime, especially violent 
crime, as described in our safer communities agenda.  For the 
benefit of those who may not be familiar with this bill I would 
like to take the opportunity to outline some of its major 
components. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT16"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT16"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1155

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill provides the legal authority for the RCMP to set up 
and maintain a national DNA bank.  I know that all members of 
this House support the maintenance of a DNA bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This DNA databank will consist of two indices or databases. The 
first database is called the crime scene index and will contain 
DNA profiles from bodily substances found at the scene of a 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second database which is known as the convicted offenders 
index will contain the DNA profiles obtained from persons 
convicted of certain crimes.  Police will be able to cross 
reference information in one index and help one another to solve 
the unsolved crimes.  Hundreds of victims and their families who 
thought they would never see justice done will find the justice 
they seek through this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am supporting this legislation because it is preventive in 
nature.  At the committee hearings Chief Brian Ford, chair of the 
law amendments committee of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of 
Police, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Chair, members of the committee, we support Bill C-3. This 
is important legislation and we encourage you to favourably 
recommend its passage to parliament.  Bill C-3 is unlike other 
criminal legislation because it is fundamentally preventative in 
nature.  This makes Bill C-3 very special. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theory of prevention in Bill C-3 is that when a person 
actually knows that his or her DNA has been recorded this person 
is unlikely to reoffend, knowing that the prospects of detection 
and conviction are so high.  This deterrent is pure prevention. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So in passing this bill, parliament should know that it is 
preventing crime, not just giving police more tools to 
investigate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with Chief Ford.  Should the prevention of crime not be 
our first responsibility as law makers?  Our police forces need 
this bill.  I am an ardent supporter of the police and I am 
supporting this legislation because it gives them the tools 
necessary to fight crime and keep Canadian communities safe. I 
know, and as I have said before, all Canadians agree that we need 
a DNA databank in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quoted Chief Ford and I would not want to mislead members of 
the Canadian public. While Chief Ford indicated that this bill 
was worthy of support, he also was very forceful in indicating 
that the police associations feel it does not go far enough.  I 
have felt this also. I believe there is some merit to what they 
are saying but as the member for Guelph—Wellington pointed out 
earlier, have to be very mindful of our Canadian Constitution.  I 
am not willing to put the excellent aspects of this bill in 
jeopardy through a constitutional challenge. I think that is 
something we need to work out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main disagreements that have been articulated by Chief Ford, 
Scott Newark, Neal Jessop, members of the Canadian police 
associations arise when we are talking about when DNA samples are 
collected.  I think there is a certain amount of merit in being 
able to say that when there is probable cause, whether the person 
has been convicted or not, the collection of DNA samples may be 
proper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members of the House that currently as a result of the 
first part of legislation talking about DNA, this is available to 
police.  It is not automatic as they would wish but if they could 
show probable cause, then the police are able under the current 
warrant system to collect the DNA samples they feel they need. 
They can be run with the inclusion of this new bill through a DNA 
bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently police will tell us that the warrant system is working 
very well but it lacks one major component and that is the actual 
creation of a database.  Bill C-3 creates this database that will 
allow police to take what has already been working well, the 
warrant system of collection, one step further.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the police association and others, most particularly 
members of the Reform Party, argue that the scope of offences for 
automatic DNA data banking should be expanded.  I think they have 
valid concerns.  I would like to see the scope of those offences 
for which automatic DNA testing is done expanded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I have a great deal of sympathy, I do not feel that the 
concerns raised are enough to provide opposition to the bill. The 
creation of the data bank is vital and this bill brings it to 
fruition.  We need to support it and, as legislators, we need to 
work with the police and other law enforcement agencies to 
strengthen the bill in the future.  However, I think we have to 
do it one step at a time.  I would hate to see the bill thrown 
out simply because it does not go as far as some people would 
hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to examine the proposal that DNA sampling is no 
different than collecting fingerprints.  I would argue very 
fundamentally that while the actual process may not seem 
intrusive, the data collected is very different from that of a 
fingerprint.  A fingerprint is one form of identification and it 
is very narrow in its scope.  Once we have collected a DNA 
sample, then a person's entire genetic make-up is available for 
one and all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This also raises other concerns.  I have reviewed much of the 
testimony that went on at the committee meetings.  I would remind 
members that this debate is not one day in the House of Commons. 
This has been going on for a long period of time.  The scope of 
the committee has made it possible for all members from all 
parties to talk to the minister and to cross-examine witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have raised some very valid points, but I continue to say 
that as much as I support many of the points and would like to 
see this bill go a lot further, that is not sufficient to delay 
passage of a very important tool in the hands of police 
authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, how much time do I have left? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Eleven minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Judi Longfield:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will not be using 
all of the 11 minutes remaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results of DNA testing could bring some very difficult 
questions forward.  If as a result of DNA testing it was 
discovered that someone had AIDS or another communicable disease, 
what is the liability of police enforcement agencies or those 
taking the samples to then get that information out?  This raises 
some questions that need to be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been some very critical issues raised.  I am a strong 
supporter of giving police the tools they need to protect us 
because that is the role of law enforcement agencies.  However, I 
would remind members that as legislators it is important that we 
also protect the rights of the innocent.  One of the pillars of 
our justice system is that everyone is innocent until they are 
proven guilty.  We have to remember that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that we need to continue to monitor.  I think 
it is worthy of continued debate as we go along.  I would like to 
congratulate the members of the committee.  I hope that all 
members of Canadian society realize that we on the government 
side are very concerned and want to see things progress in a fair 
and logical way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now turn over the remainder of my time to my colleague, 
the hon. member for Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Colleague, I am 
afraid it is too late for you to ask for that privilege as you 
went over the 10 minutes allotted to you, unless you would like 
to ask the House to agree unanimously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Judi Longfield:</B>  Madam Speaker, when I asked how long 
I had and you said 11 minutes, I assumed you thought I was taking 
20 minutes. 
I have 10 minutes left in the 20-minute allotment, the other 10 
to go to my colleague.  If it requires unanimous consent, then I 
would ask for unanimous consent.

<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I must admit that I am somewhat surprised there was 
unanimous consent, but I am also appreciative of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is really a fundamental Canadian issue and I think we 
should look at it from that perspective.  I appreciate some of 
the concerns that some of my colleagues have expressed on this 
side of the House, as well as in opposition, about the timing of 
the collection of DNA material and the issue surrounding whether 
or not it should be available upon charge or only upon 
conviction.  I appreciate that there have been concerns expressed 
about that and much of the debate around this whole legislation 
has been on the timing issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something very fundamental about Canada and it is 
probably one of the main reasons we continually get rated as the 
best country in the world in which to live.  I know some members, 
particularly members opposite, get tired of hearing us talk about 
that, but it happens to be a reality.  One of the fundamental 
reasons that we achieve that success, that rating in 
international circles, is the fairness that exists in our laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not perfect.  There is no question that if allowing the 
police to gather DNA evidence on every charge would prevent 
certain crimes from occurring, then one would say, from a common 
sense perspective, not necessarily from a legal point of view or 
a constitutional point of view, that that might have some merit. 
I understand that.  But when one balances that with the basic 
premise that innocence is clearly one of the rights in our 
justice system, until proven guilty, how far does one go?  I 
guess that is the real issue that the government is wrestling 
with, that human rights activists wrestle with, that lawyers and 
obviously parliamentarians wrestle with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular bill will go some distance toward ensuring that 
at least those who are convicted of a crime—and this is 
critical—will have information in a data bank.  I think that 
will help in terms of repeat offenders or those who have served 
their time and paid their penalty to society.  The data bank is 
there to help the police in their investigative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that one of the most important fundamental aspects of 
this is that it will provide a balance for police forces, both 
the national force and local forces right across this country, to 
access information and to access it quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who among us would not like the opportunity to prevent some of 
the tragedies we have seen in the past, such as the Bernardo case 
and the Homolka case?  However, in that particular case would a 
DNA bank with information filed upon a charge have assisted the 
police? In fact when hon. members study the entire case they will 
note that the arrest was not made and that charges were not 
filed, so there would not have been an opportunity to know in 
advance or to have this information on file in advance.  Upon 
conviction is a totally different story.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could we think for one minute about filing this information upon 
arrest or upon charge?  That would be the other point.  Should it 
simply be done upon an individual being detained?  What do we do 
concerning people coming into this country?  There is potential 
for abuse when someone is held in detention and a DNA sample is 
put in the data base to be compiled in some central bureaucratic 
computerized storage compartment and used in whatever capacity. 
The potential for abuse is serious.  It is not a step we need to 
take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That's a red herring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  It is not a red herring.  The member 
opposite said that it is a red herring.  That is one of the 
differences in this country.  It is one of the reasons we are 
judged to be such a well balanced country.  We do not knee jerk. 
We do not have an over reaction or a simplistic solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national data bank proposed in this bill will help police to 
better protect Canadians.  Will it solve all the problems?  No. 
But it is time we used the technology and the modern method of 
collecting this data to help police do their job.  We believe 
that this may not be a panacea, that in a simplistic world 
members of the Reform Party might think this would be an easy way 
to target everybody, to number everybody, to put all their data 
into a file.  I do not want to be an extremist or a radical by 
using terms like police state because I do not think it applies, 
but I really think that we have to analyze the benefits and the 
purpose of data collection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code already allows police to take a DNA sample 
from a person at the time of charge or any other time as long as 
they first obtain a warrant to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to talk about red herrings, let us go back to the 
debate on gun control which members opposite love to do.  The 
issue they like to fly is that the police will be able to knock 
on doors at any time they want, day or night, because they 
suspect the person might have a loaded pistol and want to do a 
full search.  Members opposite know that is not true, yet through 
their association with the American gun associations and the gun 
lobby in general they continually put out this kind of 
information.  It gets people all excited and whipped up.  We saw 
the demonstration on the front lawn of Parliament Hill last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amount of misinformation about issues like that is quite 
astounding.  Members opposite know there is a requirement for a 
warrant to be issued, or you open your door and allow them to 
come in.  There is none of this jackboot mentality where police 
officers can show up at three in the morning, kick the door down 
and run into the homes of law-abiding Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case there is a definite comparison.  The DNA sample 
could be taken if permission were granted.  Perhaps that issue 
could be dealt with.  Clearly, the sample can be taken if police 
obtain a warrant to do so.  What is involved in the process?  The 
police must go before a judge, a man or woman that I presume the 
Parliament of Canada has some faith and trust in, to seek a 
warrant to collect the sample at the point of a charge being 
laid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really believe that innocent until proven guilty is one of the 
fundamental tenets of democracy and freedom in Canada.  That does 
not mean that in any way whatsoever we would condone or be soft 
on crime.  Quite the opposite.  Some of the changes in the 
justice ministry of this government are absolutely 
groundbreaking, precedent setting and are saying to criminals 
that we are not prepared to allow them to take control of our 
streets and our communities.  We are going to be tough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will put in place a data collection system for DNA 
samples taken appropriately, taken in fairness and taken in 
justice.  It will ensure that Canada is still a wonderful, safe, 
free and democratic country but with strict rules.  We will fight 
crime with this legislation and other bills as they are needed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, does the member understand what is in the bill?  I 
believe I heard him just say that the bill would allow for DNA 
samples to be taken at the point of the charge being made. In 
fact the problem with the bill is that the DNA sample, as he 
should know, will be taken at a time of conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I said red herring a couple of minutes ago is very 
straightforward.  He was trying to make out that anybody who is 
held, like for example the student who was held by the RCMP at 
the APEC fiasco for 14 hours, would have his DNA taken.  I 
believe the example he used was that when somebody comes into the 
country, perhaps through the refugee process and is being 
detained, the DNA sample would be taken.  That is why I said his 
comments were a red herring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are asking for, what the Canadian Police Association is 
asking for and what any responsible, reasonable Canadian is 
asking for is that the DNA sample be taken at the time of a 
charge, not as the member was putting forward as though there 
would be a DNA sample taken just because a person was taken into 
custody and held for a period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conclusion of his speech was quite enlightening when he 
referred to the concerns there are about Bill C-68.  I am saying 
that there will not be a jackboot mentality and that the police 
will need some probable cause for the terribly onerous law and 
the provisions in Bill C-68.  His justification of that is 
exactly the justification that we make for having the DNA sample 
taken at the time of charge.  I believe the police forces in 
Canada are typically very responsible in the way they enforce the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For him on one side of the coin to say it is bogus, that the 
police will not be doing things under Bill C-68, under the 
so-called gun control law, and make a case for that is to make a 
case for our point that in this instance the samples should be 
taken at the time of charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the member square the round peg he has created? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
comments but as usual the member and some of his colleagues tend 
to be rather selective in their hearing process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not say at any time—and <I>Hansard</I> will so 
record—that this bill allows the police to take DNA samples.  I 
said the Criminal Code of Canada already allows police to take a 
DNA sample from a person at the time of charge if they have a 
warrant.  That is the critical distinction the member so easily 
overlooked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that we are creating a framework for storing DNA 
samples and for using that information in the investigation of 
serious criminal offences.  If a convicted criminal—and I 
emphasize the word convicted—reoffends and his DNA samples are 
in a database, the police will be able to identify the 
perpetrator at the crime scene through the use of modern 
technology and the database of DNA samples.  They will know who 
they are looking for.  If that person was convicted, is now out 
either on parole or has completed a sentence and reoffends, it 
will allow the police to use this facility to expedite their 
investigation dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite should not try to interpret my comments in 
this place in any way other than the spirit in which they were 
given, which is that innocent until proven guilty is a 
fundamental tenet of the Canadian justice system and one that I 
support.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
this bill is very interesting in that it has direct connection to 
Bill C-68 and section 745, which was to change the whole issue as 
to when a convicted murder could apply for parole.  Bill C-68, 
section 745 and DNA are all inextricably linked in a pattern. The 
government has shown us that it is weak-kneed when it comes to 
making streets safe for law-abiding Canadian citizens and to 
protecting Canadian citizens and their property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my judgment the most contentious part of this bill lies in 
the comments of the solicitor general when he was before 
committee.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking samples after an offender has been convicted of designated 
offence balances our concern for the safety of all Canadians with 
our need to respect the rights protected by Canada's Charter.  We 
cannot ignore that the accused has the right to be presumed 
innocent and protected from unreasonable search and seizure. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speakers this morning have been waxing rather eloquent. They 
have said that taking these samples would “undermine human 
dignity”.  I am not sure what that meant, but that is what they 
said.  Another speaker said that it would not only be 
unconstitutional but un-Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hyperbole or extreme statements are sometimes part of the 
rhetoric in the debates that happen in the House, but for Liberal 
members to pretend for a split second that we are making extreme 
statements and calling this un-Canadian when they should be 
taking action to create safer streets and protect victims and 
society at large is a bit thick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at the connection between Bill C-68, section 
745 and DNA.  In the Bill C-68 issue I note that Liberals go out 
of their way to constantly quote the Canadian Police Association. 
At the time when debate on Bill C-68 was at its peak, the 
Canadian Police Association, after much internal wrangling, 
decided that it would come out in favour of and in support of 
Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting that at exactly the same time there was also 
a debate with the former justice minister who is now Canada's 
Minister of Health.  The former justice minister also had on his 
plate demands from Canadians at large that section 745 of the 
Criminal Code be repealed.  Section 745 permits a judge to say, 
as a consequence of a first degree murder, that the person has 
been convicted of first degree murder—we must remember it is 
premeditated murder—and as a consequence sentenced to 25 years 
or life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public at large assumes that means 25 years.  How wrong they 
are.  The judge may even say as a result of a particularly 
heinous crime that it is with no chance of parole for 25 years. 
Again wrong.  Because of the historic soft-headed approach of the 
Liberal government going back to the time of Warren Allmand who 
brought this in during the late sixties, the whole approach has 
been to say maybe the presiding judge did not know what he was 
talking about or maybe the person has changed over this last 
period of time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 745 the murderer convicted of first degree murder 
is permitted to apply for parole after 15 years.  The justice 
minister at that time brought forward a half-hearted motion, 
which unfortunately was passed, where if persons were convicted 
of more than one first degree murder they could not apply. 
However, if it was just one first degree murder they could apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the leaders of the Canadian Police Association at that 
time were really upset by this half-hearted measure to take away 
section 745.  I believe they were influenced by the justice 
minister saying that if the association would give him its 
unqualified support for Bill C-68 he would see what he could do 
about section 745. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is pure speculation on my part because I am sure I do not 
know what was going on behind closed doors.  It strikes me as 
passing strange that no matter whom I spoke to in the Canadian 
Police Association, particularly members in the lower levels, 
they were all saying that the application of Bill C-68 and the 
cost of the useless registry was a stupid way to spend money. Yet 
they flipped and said they supported Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically the government has said its support for Bill C-68 
comes from the Canadian Police Association.  The Canadian Police 
Association knows what it is talking about.  Whether the Canadian 
Police Association was influenced or not by some behind the 
scenes talk about section 745 we will never know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the same Canadian Police Association 
which the government quotes in support of Bill C-68 had this to 
say about Bill C-3 in a letter dated September 16 to members of 
parliament.  The signatory, Neal Jessop, the president of the 
Canadian Police Association, wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am writing to you in relation to Bill C-3 and the creation of a 
national DNA data bank.  As you know, Bill C-3 is awaiting third 
reading and it is our understanding that it will likely pass such 
a stage shortly after parliament resumes this fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Police Association represents approximately 35,000 
frontline police officers across Canada.  It is because of our 
practical, hands on experience that the government has come to 
rely on our advice on issues such as gun control, search warrants 
and parole reform.  It is the same experience that leads us to 
the conclusion that Bill C-3, as currently drafted, is seriously 
flawed, and will needlessly allow Canadians to be put at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPA has lobbied for the creation of a DNA data bank for many 
years.  Since the beginning, we stressed the important impact a 
bank could have on public safety, a goal that we worked towards 
every day whether it be on the streets or on Parliament Hill.  We 
said then, as we say now, that for this initiative to work 
samples must be taken from suspects when arrested.  In doing so, 
we will maximize the potential crime prevention aspects of the 
bill which is a goal we all share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  A properly structured DNA data bank will save 
billions of dollars, but more importantly it will save lives and 
significantly reduce victimization.  This, in our opinion, should 
be the goal of any criminal justice legislation the government 
passes.  As an elected official, this should be your main 
consideration when you are called upon to vote on Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider the following scenario.  In the Ottawa area, there are 
currently a number of unsolved outstanding cases of homicide or 
sexual assault.  Assume that a person is arrested for a break and 
enter and, unknown to the police, is responsible for some of 
those unsolved crimes.  Like 90% of all offenders, this 
individual is released on bail without DNA samples being taken 
(if C-3 is enacted).  Knowing that he faces detection on the 
other charges if he returns, the offender flees to B.C. and a 
warrant for break and enter is issued by the Ottawa court.  Two 
months later he is picked up on other matters by police in B.C. 
who check CPIC and discover the existing B and E warrant.  When 
they check with Ottawa to see if he should be returned, the 
answer according to today's practices will be no. 
Remember that police do not know whom they are dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any woman this individual encounters will be at risk. This is 
unacceptable because it is entirely preventable.  While this may 
be a mere anecdote for some, it is a reality for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is paramount to Canadian police officers, and by 
virtue the CPA.  We have obtained an independent (unlike the hand 
picked judges who wrote decisions supporting the government's 
position) legal decision that states our position on this issue 
is constitutionally sound. We attempted to work with the 
Department of Justice and they were unable to understand the 
significance of our position, perhaps because they have never had 
to look into the eyes of a sexual assault victim or a grieving 
family member. We now turn to you, our elected representatives, 
to do what is right for Canadians.  If you choose not to, we as 
police officers will be forced to explain to that grieving family 
member that his or her government had the information and the 
ability to prevent such an act of violence, but they chose not 
to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not underestimate the importance of this issue to the CPA. We 
are not, and never have been, averse to take every public 
opportunity to inform the public when the government creates and 
passes flawed legislation.  We will do that again regarding Bill 
C-3. We will make sure that Canadians understand that their 
government is risking their lives.  We will make sure that if one 
of your constituents is harmed because of this flawed 
legislation, they will know who to ask for an explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please accept our offer to work with you and develop legislation 
that would enhance public safety and still remain 
constitutionally valid. Despite contradictory rhetoric from the 
Department of Justice, it is an achievable goal.  As an MP, we 
urge you to take this opportunity to come to your own conclusion, 
not that as dictated by the Prime Minister.

simply, if the CPA is right, and I do not believe it is, but if 
the CPA is right in its support of Bill C-68 and if the 
government is going to continue to quote that source, why will 
the government not quote the source, the CPA, and the CPA's 
position on Bill C-3? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because the Minister of Justice and the Solicitor General, 
working under the Prime Minister of Canada, are taking directions 
from him.  He has said that this bill will pass as it presently 
is. It is a real shame that there is not the ability within our 
parliamentary process as currently constructed by the Prime 
Minister for there to be legitimate dissent within his own ranks. 
It is a real shame that the Liberals are whipped into a position 
by the party whip to make sure that they vote that this 
ineffective bill will end up passing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For someone to say the bill is unconstitutional is an opinion 
that may be backed up with some fact.  But to call the bill 
un-Canadian when the purpose of the bill, of taking the DNA 
sample upon charge, is going to give us the opportunity to 
interdict people and create a situation where we can return them 
from various jurisdictions as required, is beyond my ability to 
comprehend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To show how the spin works, it was interesting that about six 
weeks ago the spinmeisters for the Liberals were going on about 
the fact that if we take the sample and we actually conduct the 
lab tests, it is going to be far too expensive.  It is going to 
cost $5,000 each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this number to be somewhat suspicious.  I say that 
because this is the same government that told us in order to come 
up with the registry program on Bill C-68 that the cost was only 
going to be $85 million, whereas now it is actually admitting 
that it will cost at least a quarter of a billion dollars.

Liberals a million here, a million there pretty soon adds up, but 
it was only $85 million.  They got a fair number of people on 
side with that lowball number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Either the government was incompetent and did not realize how 
much this useless registry is actually going to cost, or it was 
not giving Canadians the facts required to know that it will cost 
at least a quarter of a billion dollars.  As a matter of fact, 
estimates are in the neighbourhood of $1 billion to $1.2 billion 
for this registry program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government can fudge and exaggerate the figures on the 
justification for the registry program under Bill C-68, I can 
imagine what it is doing to scare people off with a high figure 
on being able to actually conduct the lab work when the sample is 
taken.  We can see there is within Canada, as there should be, a 
fair lack of trust of the numbers the government chooses to use 
to justify its actions from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame when Canadians who the justice minister herself 
said are concerned about their safety on the streets.  The 
justice minister herself has said that Canadians are losing 
confidence in Canada's justice system.  As a matter of fact I 
choose to call it Canada's legal system.  We have to get some 
justice back into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have lost faith.  To those who still believe there is 
some hope the Liberals will come around and actually work to put 
the protection of law-abiding Canadian citizens, their well-being 
and their property ahead of the rights of criminals, I have a 
bridge in Brooklyn I would like to talk to them about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will be passed today because the Prime Minister has 
said so.  Shame on the Liberals for being whipped into shape to 
pass this bill as presently constructed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the member is probably right that this bill will be 
passed.  However it will be passed today not because someone has 
dictated from on high but because Liberals want to see a DNA bank 
in this country to improve the enforcement of the laws against 
criminals who perform acts that are contrary to all decency and 
humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reformers obviously do not want to see that type of a system 
because they have made it clear they intend to vote against the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to make a comment. I too have 
discussed with the Canadian Police Association that it would like 
the legislation to allow samples of blood to be taken before 
someone is convicted. I have a big concern with this and would 
like the member to comment on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we tell Canadians 10 years down the road if this 
legislation, with that provision in it which is constitutionally 
risky, is challenged and defeated in the Supreme Court of Canada? 
The result would be that 10 years of convictions of possible 
murderers and sexual assaulters would be overturned.  There would 
be nothing we could do to go back and recoup those convictions 
which had been based on what the courts in ten years might decide 
was tainted evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want a DNA bank so we can deal with those horrendous crimes. I 
am not prepared to risk 10 years of convictions.  And I am not 
prepared to vote against the bill because it does not have a 
provision in it that would do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member would comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I really respect the 
intervention by the member.  I know she feels very strongly that 
way.  I commend her for her conviction and I know she is sincere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It strikes me that within the criminal justice system many 
aspects of it are handcuffed by virtue of our Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms.  The vast majority of Canadians highly value 
that document, as they should.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is that the Canadian charter in some instances 
does get in the way not only of good law, such as this would be 
in strengthening this DNA data bank, it even gets in the way of 
Corrections Canada.  The inmates are running the show as a result 
of the charter of rights. There is going to have to come a day 
when, and perhaps this bill would be as good a one as any, 
whether we call it the notwithstanding clause or whatever is 
brought into effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The charter with all of its good points has unnecessarily 
handcuffed the ability of peace officers, whether they are in 
Corrections Canada or are police officers, from being able to do 
what is fair and reasonable.  We therefore have a charter 
industry populated by some very expensive, hundreds of dollars an 
hour lawyers who are constantly digging this thing up and taking 
things apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It strikes me that the safety of the people of Canada, their 
families and their property should come before these other 
considerations.  I realize and admit that this is a rather 
extreme statement, but we have to reach a point where we are 
going to have to ask who comes first, the criminal or the 
law-abiding citizen? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened to the previous question with great 
interest, even more so than the response by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ongoing government position really astounds me.  It 
reflects the charter constipation that seems to exist on the 
government side of the House when it comes to certain important 
pieces of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fear that somehow these judges may decide to strike 
down a piece of legislation because hypothetically a lawyer out 
there somewhere in Canada lurking in the bushes might decide to 
challenge based on a constitutional infringement. That is 
absolutely asinine.  I can guarantee that it will happen because 
that is what lawyers do.  In this instance, with regard to this 
particular bill, to fear that this might somehow be challenged 
under a charter infringement is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member is with regard to the use of DNA 
data banks and when and at what point in time should the police 
be permitted to take this piece of evidence and use it not only 
in the investigation they are pursuing but also use it in 
comparison to the DNA data bank that will eventually come into 
fruition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we in this House not pursue the goal to arm the police 
rather than to give them a toothless piece of legislation, one 
that goes to some degree in the direction that we want?  Why 
would we not go all the way with DNA?  Why would we in this House 
not like to give the police an opportunity to do their jobs, to 
do the very best they can to protect Canadians in their 
communities and to do the very best they can to raise the alarm 
and work toward a justice system that truly does reflect the will 
and desire to protect people in their communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is a very good 
question but I do not have a clue what the answer is.  Look at 
the window dressing about Bill C-68 for example where the 
government keeps on claiming that it is going to make the streets 
safer.  I am sure I do not know how. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the chagrin, the problems and the pressure there was on 
the families of the victims of Clifford Olson when he went 
through that circus and those families were put through the 
excruciating parole hearing under 745.  Just to keep the record 
straight, if the justice minister of the day had done his job in 
a timely manner, Clifford Olson would not have been able to put 
those victims on the spot the way he did.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I lay that completely at the feet of the former justice

another half measure.  I have absolutely no idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me state our position very clearly.  The protection of the 
people of Canada, the law abiding citizens, their persons and 
their property must be the primary and paramount objective of 
this Chamber.  Until we get rid of this bunch on the other side, 
I do not have any hope that is ever going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B> Madam Speaker, I could not help but notice 
that in the remarks by the hon. member there was reference made 
to Bill C-68.  That bill can be compared to the faint hope clause 
because it really should be called the false hope clause.  In 
fact, this bill is not going to do exactly what we are talking 
about here, protect law abiding citizens, because it is aimed 
specifically at law-abiding citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the hon. member think or what is his party's position 
with respect to the application of the infrastructure that is now 
in place with respect to gun registration, the computer 
terminals, the hook-ups, the incredible spiralling cost that we 
now know exceeds $135 million or $134 million and is going to 
perhaps double again by the time that this is actually 
implemented, even with the delay that we have seen in 
anticipation that the Alberta Court of Appeal will strike it down 
some time within the next few days? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the hon. member would say to the suggestion of 
applying this infrastructure, the computers, to the use of 
registering criminals under this new Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think that is an 
outstanding idea, absolutely.  There is going to be at least a 
quarter of a billion dollars uselessly spent according to the 
numbers provided by the Liberals on this useless so-called gun 
control program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking even a small portion of that money and putting say, $100 
million toward a proper DNA registry program is clearly the route 
to go.  That is an effective and intelligent use of Canadian 
taxpayer money.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time.  I am pleased to speak in support of 
Bill C-3 which proposes the creation of a national DNA databank 
which will be maintained by the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some discussion recently about the timing of the 
taking of bodily samples in order to supplement the databank.  In 
my view this is an area which clearly demonstrates the great care 
that has been taken to ensure that the national DNA databank 
meets all constitutional requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus of my remarks today will be on that one aspect of the 
bill, the timing of the collection of the DNA samples for the 
purpose of the national DNA databank. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, law enforcement officials, both in Canada and 
throughout the world, are turning increasingly to DNA 
identification in the fight against crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But as the Ontario Court of Appeal recently observed in 
Terceira, it is important to remember that matching DNA profiles 
in the context of a criminal proceeding does not resolve the 
ultimate question of the accused's guilt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does, however, make it possible to establish important 
circumstantial evidence that can be considered along with other 
evidence in support of the crown's contention that the accused 
was at the scene of the crime and committed the offence. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA sampling is an important and powerful investigative tool. 
However, its intrusive nature has been clearly recognized by the 
highest courts in the land.  As such, Bill C-3 must reflect the 
state of our constitutional law.  In other words, the taking of 
bodily substances must be done in accordance with constitutional 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As originally introduced in the House, Bill C-3 stipulated that 
bodily substances would be taken after the person is convicted, 
discharged under section 730 or, in the case of a young person, 
found guilty under the Young Offenders Act of a designated 
offence. 
Some organizations came before the committee to urge that the 
bill be amended to provide the police the authority in 
legislation to take DNA samples on arrest or at the time charges 
are laid similar to the authority they have to take fingerprints 
without prior judicial authorization under the Identification of 
Criminals Act.  In their view there should not be the 
intervention of a judge to decide whether it is appropriate to 
seize the bodily samples.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proponents of this proposal believe that if the police could 
take DNA profiles from persons charged with designated offences, 
the databank would be more effective simply because it would hold 
more DNA profiles.  They question why it was necessary to wait 
for a conviction to take the DNA samples for inclusion in a 
national DNA databank when this was not the case in the United 
Kingdom.  They also contended that the collection of bodily 
substances for forensic DNA analysis is no more intrusive on a 
suspect's privacy than is the collection of fingerprints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, other parties came before the committee 
seriously questioning the constitutionality of this proposal and 
they presented firm views that the taking of bodily samples 
without prior judicial authorization constitutes a seizure that 
is likely to be unconstitutional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 11, 1998 the committee heard from officials of the 
Department of Justice who had carefully reviewed the legal issues 
relating to this proposal and they stated that the taking of 
bodily samples from an accused constitutes a search. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Department of Justice officials also stressed that the supreme 
court has established a clear distinction between fingerprinting 
and the taking of physical evidence for DNA analysis.  They 
argued that the court had assigned great importance to the 
invasiveness of the second type of procedure and had expressed 
its great respect for physical integrity and the individual's 
right to retain control over his or her bodily substances. in 
Borden, 1994, and Stillman, 1997. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fingerprinting and taking bodily samples for the purpose of DNA 
testing are simply not the same and they cannot be equated. In 
other words, one should not contend that the taking of bodily 
substances upon arrest is constitutional on the basis that the 
taking of fingerprints in those circumstances has been ruled 
constitutional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To permit the taking of such bodily samples simply on the basis 
of a police officer's belief that the person has committed a 
designated offence without complying with the requirements that 
there be prior judicial authorization would constitute a classic 
example of a warrantless search or seizure which would prima 
facie be unconstitutional. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice officials were not the only ones raising the point that 
there was a very strong possibility sampling at the time a 
suspect was arrested would be considered unconstitutional.  The 
same reservations were expressed by the criminal section of the 
Canadian Bar Association, and representatives of the solicitors 
general of Ontario and New Brunswick, among others. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opponents of the proposal were clear that it would have been 
inconsistent with existing constitutional authorities and would 
have jeopardized the viability of the national DNA databank.  In 
the end on this issue the committee approved the bill as it had 
been originally drafted.  The taking of samples would occur only 
following conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that did not end the matter.  The proponents of the 
collection at charge option continued to press for amendments to 
the bill at report stage to provide for the collection of DNA 
samples at the time of charge.  In an attempt to make this more 
palatable it was suggested that the samples would not be analyzed 
until a person was convicted or unless that person failed to 
appear at trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunate statements were made suggesting that if the bill was 
not amended the legislation would be useless.  Similarly it was 
stated that without these changes long unsolved crimes would 
never be solved.  These arguments were intended to scare 
Canadians and could of course lead to the worst excesses all the 
way to the end justifies the means.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only was this wrong, it seemed to miss the point.  Bill C-3 
is not meant to allow warrantless searches for the purposes of 
supplementing the databank.  Bill C-3 is meant to create a 
databank through appropriate, legitimate and constitutional 
means. It is a databank which can produce leads which the police 
can pursue in order to solve serious crimes without fearing any 
evidence resulting from such information would be found 
inadmissible at trial because it had originated from an 
unconstitutional search. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that these kinds of statements were exaggerated because 
they imply that the large number DNA profiles from dangerous 
criminals would be lost to the databank if they were not taken at 
the time of charge.  There is a considerable difference between 
being charged with an offence and being convicted of an offence. 
Moreover, the very same DNA samples could be taken later in the 
criminal justice process under Bill C-3 from those persons 
convicted of a designated offence.  The only advantage, 
therefore, considering that under Bill C-3 or the new proposal 
the bodily samples would not be analyzed until after the person 
was convicted, would be administrative convenience.  This would 
not be sufficient justification to permit the violation of one's 
privacy and of a seizure of one's genetic material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that under the scheme set out in Bill C-3 the 
police will be equally able to solve long unsolved crimes because 
the DNA analysis would occur only following the conviction in 
either case. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I listened with interest to the member's speech. The people of 
Okanagan—Coquihalla strongly support the taking of fingerprints 
in criminal cases.  They also strongly support a relatively new 
technology, the taking of DNA samples when it comes to the 
possibility of solving a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the member on the issue that these measures are 
intrusive.  There are literally hundreds of unsolved cases of 
rapes and murders in Canada that police could go now and find the 
evidence if they were able to use the DNA system to solve these 
crimes.  As the member has pointed out, that would work only if 
they are a felon or if they have had a criminal record before. 
That is the only way the Liberal DNA databank system is going to 
work, if it is a previously convicted felon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had to jump up when I heard another Liberal member stating 
that the Paul Bernardo case could have been solved sooner.  Paul 
Bernardo did not have a criminal conviction.  He would not have 
been in the DNA databank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the Liberals on this.  They are afraid of a 
constitutional challenge in the supreme court. The Government of 
Canada, if it did happen, should on behalf of the people of 
Okanagan—Coquihalla and other Canadians fight for a simple and 
very understandable rule, that the rights of law abiding citizens 
of Canada outweigh the rights of the perpetrators of crime or 
those accused of crime.  Taking a hair sample or a saliva sample 
or a blood sample is not out of the question.  To think it is is 
totally irrational and not serving Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is exactly the rights 
of law-abiding Canadian citizens that the charter of rights is 
there to protect. Those are the rights of innocent people we are 
trying to protect from the invasion or intrusion of the taking of 
samples without any conviction and on suspicion only of a police 
officer or a crown attorney.  The government is proposing in this 
bill that the samples be taken only after conviction so that the 
rights and liberties of those innocent law abiding Canadians are 
protected.

Speaker, as we try to put some logic and common sense into some 
of the bills before the House, I hear once again from the 
government side the argument about the legal community and the 
Canadian Bar Association, but I do not hear the argument on 
behalf of victims, victims' rights and the law-abiding Canadian 
citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the member opposite thinks about the 
notwithstanding clause in the Constitution.  Notwithstanding the 
comments he has made about the Constitution, why could this 
government not stand up for a change and say “Notwithstanding 
what we perceive might be a problem, we are going to proceed in 
this way and we are going to take DNA samples at the time we have 
an accused”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again I can see the 
Reform Party is engaging in lawyer bashing.  It was joined by the 
hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough in a similar 
practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  I am a lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B>  That gives you a prerogative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the point.  The point is that the rule of law 
applies, that due process applies.  That may be inconvenient and 
it may get in the way of the plans and aspirations of the Reform 
Party in certain cases, which is joined by the Tories in this 
case.  However, that is what the charter of rights is there to 
protect.  Those are the rights of all Canadian citizens whom we 
are trying to protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once a person is convicted, then certainly the DNA would go into 
the data bank.  That will be a very effective tool for police in 
future crime solving. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in this 
debate.  It gives me occasion to raise with all members what I 
think is quite an important issue which spins off from the debate 
about DNA sampling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will first address the DNA sampling issue as I see it.  If I 
were on the other side of the Chamber and if I were listening to 
groups like the Canadian Police Association, I would indeed take 
the stand I hear from those on the other side.  Fair is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some good grounds for believing that if DNA samples 
were taken on charge there would be advantages in tracking down 
criminals and bringing more safety to our streets.  I do not 
think there is any doubt that the more tools we can give our law 
enforcement officers, tools which they demand and want, the 
better they can carry out their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I must be frank with members opposite and tell them why 
I cannot support that position.  I sympathize with what they are 
saying, but I cannot support it.  And this is me speaking, not 
the government.  The reason is that DNA sampling takes personal 
identification to a much higher level than just fingerprinting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard people say earlier in the House that DNA sampling on 
charge is not much different from taking fingerprints.  They said 
that taking fingerprints had not been a problem with respect to 
the charter of rights.  Actually, there had been a problem.  When 
the breathalyzer test procedure was first introduced it was 
challenged before the supreme court, which found that while on 
the surface it would appear that forcing people to give breath or 
blood samples appeared to be contrary to their charter rights, 
there was an element of reasonableness in the procedure, the good 
it did for society, which permitted the courts to uphold the 
principle of taking a breathalyzer test or a blood sample at the 
time of charge, or at least forcing them to be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go from fingerprinting to breathalyzer testing to DNA 
sampling, we go into an enormous domain that goes much beyond 
simply blowing into a container.  The problem with DNA sampling 
is that it is the ultimate fingerprint.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA sampling is based on the fact that each one of us as 
individuals contains unique sets of DNA markers on our 
chromosomes.  Consequently, any sample is believed, at least so 
far science tells us, to be uniquely identifiable with an 
individual.  One can see where this could be an enormous crime 
fighting tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But a DNA sample is like a tattoo that we all carry.  All that 
has to happen is for an authority to peel away a tiny bit of 
skin, reveal the tattoo, put it on the record and there it 
remains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where the difficulty comes about.  It was only 55 years 
ago that a similar tattooing procedure existed in Europe.  I do 
not want members opposite to get excited about this because I am 
not casting aspersions on their position.  But the reality is 
that at one time in European history tattooing became a useful 
tool of the police forces to keep track of undesirables in 
society.  These undesirables were Jews, gypsies and the mentally 
infirm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know where that led in the end.  That led to a genocide that 
this world has not forgotten and I hope never will.  It was a 
systematic genocide.  It was conducted with the agreement of the 
state, using police forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that when we come to something like the absolute 
identification of us as individuals, we become that much closer 
to that type of state interference in our personal and private 
lives which led to the atrocities that finally occurred in Nazi 
Germany. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that this could happen in Canada, although we 
have to always remember in a democracy that there is always the 
danger that if we allow the state too much intrusion into the 
privacy of the individual, into the identity of the individual, 
we run the very serious risk of becoming a cipher, of becoming a 
tattoo, and if the state or the police get a little out of 
control, then the rights of citizens can indeed be destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an ethical issue that disturbs me.  I am not saying that a 
DNA sampling at charge is necessarily not the thing to do.  What 
I am saying is that it is too early for us as as a parliament to 
make that grand a decision.  We have to go out into the community 
and, over time, talk to the people who are concerned about ethics 
in society:  talk to the church, talk to all those who are 
worried about the human dignity of being an individual, rather 
than a number.  When we look back at the tattooing that was done 
during the period of Nazi Germany, what distresses us most is not 
just the death it led to, it is the fact that human beings were 
reduced to numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that DNA itself is nothing more than a human bar code of 
the 1990s.  Before we engage in using this as a tool for the 
police we have to have a very serious debate, not just with 
parliamentarians, not just with the police, but also with church 
leaders and others.  I would think the Jewish community might 
have something to say about this whole question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, the real point that I came before the House to 
discuss was not the DNA sampling because it is an ethical issue. 
I did not expect to change the minds of those opposite because 
they are charged to be in the opposition and to speak in 
opposition to government bills.  But one of the things that 
disturbs me in this whole debate is that I, like every MP, 
received correspondence from the Canadian Police Association, 
lobbying heavily to have DNA sampling accepted at charge rather 
than after conviction.  I have no problem with the Canadian 
Police Association lobbying for this because it is very concerned 
about successful law enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where I have the problem is that the letter I received from the 
Canadian Police Association contained a threat.  What it 
basically said was that if I as a parliamentarian did not agree 
with the Canadian Police Association, that if I chose not 
to—that is, not to support the position of the Canadian Police 
Association—the letter tells me that “we as police officers 
will be forced to explain to the grieving family members that his 
or her government had the information and the ability to prevent 
such an act of violence but chose not to”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening is that the Canadian Police Association has 
taken it upon itself, in this instance and in other instances, to 
apply political pressure on the people in this Chamber to do what 
the Canadian Police Association thinks is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also I refer to the campaign that was conducted by the Canadian 
Police Association during the last election in which it took out 
huge billboards showing pictures of known murderers and compared 
those people to the local Liberal MPs who rejected the private 
member's bill that would have made retroactive the legislation 
regarding the faint hope clause.  It would have made it 
retroactive so that no convicted killers could go before the 
early parole procedure which then existed.  Our justice minister 
changed that provision but did not make it retroactive.  The 
billboards occurred during the election campaign.  They were 
propaganda and they lied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During an election we accept a bit of stretching the truth.  It 
occurs not only among politicians during an election, but among 
the special interest groups that back one political party or 
another.  We accept that.  However, what was happening in this 
case was that we had a police body engaging in an attempt to 
influence politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue of great concern to parliamentarians.  The 
British parliamentary tradition is that the legislators, the 
courts and the police are supposed to be separate.  I cannot 
interfere in a police investigation or with the courts.  The 
courts cannot interfere with the politicians, and so it should 
have been with the police.  It has always been our tradition that 
the police do not attempt to put direct pressure on politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is now occurring in Toronto as well.  The Toronto police 
association is attacking local politicians over their attitude 
toward the special investigation unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that this is a serious threat to our fundamental 
democracy in parliament and every parliamentarian has to be very 
concerned.  The reason we have our own police force in the House 
of Commons and not a state police force, the RCMP or any other 
body, is because of the tradition that parliament has to keep the 
police and the military separate from politics.  I hope the 
police association hears my remarks and considers very carefully 
what it has been doing in the past.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting to hear the hon. member 
opposite from the Liberal Party talking about the arm's length 
independent relationship between the RCMP and the Prime 
Minister's Office and government given the facts that are now 
being examined regarding the APEC summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question specifically relates to this legislation.  I was a 
member of the justice committee when we debated the bill at that 
level.  We know that DNA evidence is inculpatory as well as 
exculpatory.  It is evidence that can be used to free 
individuals, not only to convict them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate over intrusiveness has drawn a lot of fire from both 
sides of the House.  Intrusiveness for whom?  Intrusiveness for 
an individual charged and arrested?  I would think that many 
individuals in this country, given the opportunity to clarify the 
situation, would voluntarily want to give their DNA if they truly 
felt they had nothing to do with a particular criminal matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question specifically surrounds the assertion that this type 
of evidence is going to protect Canadians to the full extent that 
it could, given the fact that if an individual is picked up on a 
charge in one part of the country, this legislation, in its 
current form, will not allow the police to take a DNA sample to 
cross-reference it to an outstanding matter to which there may be 
DNA evidence at the crime scene that was entered into the DNA 
data bank.  This hypothesis was brought forward by the police 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an individual is picked up in one part of the country and 
charged with an offence, the police cannot take the DNA.  If 
there is existing DNA at another crime scene, a murder or a rape, 
the individual will be released because presumably there will be 
no evidence to hold him based on the seriousness of that 
particular crime.  We do not have returnable warrants in most 
parts of the country, so the person can then flee the 
jurisdiction and therefore be held unaccountable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This scenario is a real one.  It is something that will happen 
without a doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member to address that situation and tell us how 
that gives any assurance whatsoever to Canadians that this 
legislation goes far enough to address that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member was so 
lengthy in framing his question it was difficult for me to follow 
it. The danger with extending the legislation as proposed by the 
opposition to taking samples upon charge is that it would 
encourage police to go on a fishing expedition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to protect the rights of the people who may be assumed 
to be the type that would commit crimes.  We believe in this 
country that you are innocent until convicted and we must not 
lose sight of that.  We must be very careful on how wide a 
mandate we give the police as far as their powers of arrest are 
concerned. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I think Canadians in general listening to the member's comments 
that somehow Nazi Germany and tattooing are associated with DNA 
testing would think that is a stretch.  I think it is totally 
irrational. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side of the House we will continue to fight for 
increased health care so people can get the help they so 
desperately need.  I think that is a principle we can all agree 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question whether seizing DNA is really an invasion of a 
person's privacy.  DNA samples is like the member said, it is 
using a series of numbers from the chromosomes to make an 
identification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very similar to fingerprinting, for instance.  The 
difficulty here is that you cannot see that it is very similar to 
fingerprinting in that sense because it is more precise.  It is 
the new technology we have available today and Canadians believe 
it should be used to solve crime.  It is probably one of the best 
tools we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does this government continue to mislead the public in 
suggesting that this is an invasion of a person's privacy when it 
is not?  It is a sample of hair or saliva.  It is not going to 
give any information except whether that person matches the DNA 
found at a crime scene.  It does not talk about their mental 
health, their health in any other way or release any other 
personal— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid the time for questions 
and comments is about to expire.  The hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington can have a brief reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, following that logic, why 
should the government not take DNA samples of every individual at 
birth and order DNA samples from every individual that exists so 
that any time a crime is committed that tattooing mark is 
available to the authorities? That is too big a power for police 
to have and that is too big a power even for government to have. 
I would not support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It is my duty to inform the House 
that the five hours allotted for 20 minute speeches with 10 
minutes for questions and comments has now expired.  We are into 
10 minute speeches without questions or comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
how come the House leader of the official opposition misses out 
on the 20 minute part? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have heard it all in here today.  I want to talk a 
little about some of the comments in a minute. What a lot of 
people do not understand here is that the DNA legislation does 
not apply to some 14,000 prisoners currently sitting in our 
prisons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the government feels that it is not quite appropriate 
to take DNA samples of those people.  I will tell members the 
effects that will have on our country. It does, however, say it 
will take DNA samples of prisoners currently serving time for 
multiple murders, multiple sex offences and dangerous offenders. 
Keep those three categories in mind here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seven federal penitentiaries within half an hour's 
driving distance of my house in Abbotsford, British Columbia. We 
have around 100 released prisoners on day parole, UTA and ETA at 
any given time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Sumas Centre is a day care facility with no fences, no guards, 
and the inmates are basically walking our streets. They have a 7 
or 8 o'clock curfew at night.  I have long talked to the 
government about increasing security there. In the last 10 
months, from April 14, 1997 to February 1998 we have had four 
sexual attacks in my area by residents of this facility.  We have 
had well over 55 unlawfully at large from that facility and not 
one of them has had a DNA sample taken from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person who sexually assaulted a lady and robbed her store was 
from this facility and had 63 prior convictions.  There was not 
one DNA sample taken from this person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I stand up here I ask what part of this message do they not 
understand.  Perhaps they do not have enough prisons in their 
ridings.  Perhaps it has not affected them like it has many of 
us.  However, this DNA sample is important.  It is important to 
victims of crime and important to people who will become victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sit here in the House and listen to members across talking 
about constitutional issues, the Canadian Bar Association and on 
and on it goes, what if, maybe, could be, but I never once heard 
a discussion about victims or potential victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess it does not come as a surprise to anybody why we still 
have the faint hope clause in this country, section 745, why 
prisoners now vote, why prisoners are entitled to overtime pay, 
and why we outlawed pepper spray for the law abiding Canadian 
citizen yet we use it on university kids if they get in the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong over there with the mentality?  Let us look at 
some of this mentality and some of the quotes I just heard. 
“This could lead to the atrocities of Nazi Germany”.  I cannot 
believe Liberal members actually believe that.  I am telling this 
government here and now that every day in my community the people 
walking out of prison are sex offenders, murderers, drug addicts 
and bank robbers.  They are all sitting in there at night and 
come out in the day but the government does not have the courage 
to take a DNA sample of these people. In my community we have 
people who are victims every single week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how anybody can compare tattooing with DNA.  That 
is out of the blue.  A Liberal member opposite says it is too 
early in this stage of parliament to make such a decision.  When 
is the time to make a decision?  How many people in my riding 
have to suffer as a result of indecision?  When is it, the year 
2006, 2010, when enough victims are stacked up in this country so 
that the public puts on the pressure and then there is change?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Are all these opposition parties here crazy?  Are we making 
these stories up? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made a presentation after forcing this government to have a 
review on the Sumas Centre in my riding.  At that time in March 
there were approximately 43 unlawfully at large prisoners. We had 
all types of robberies committed by these individuals, three 
sexual assaults, no notice being taken.  It fell on deaf ears 
over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to the review commission and I asked why not stop here 
and do something. DNA would be a good idea. Then when these 
individuals walk out and perpetrate a crime we will know 
immediately.  In fact, many of them do not get caught 
perpetrating crimes so we would probably find out faster if, when 
and where these people were.  Nothing happened with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I spoke to them just a few short months ago we have had 13 
more unlawfully at large prisoners. Some are sex offenders.  We 
had not taken DNA samples of them.  Why?  They were not multiple 
sex offenders.  Two qualify and one does not.  There is a 
brilliant concoction of reasoning to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>James Armbruster has 63 prior convictions, one sex offence 
relating to his grandmother, and he is not DNA sampled. Why?  He 
did not have two victims. But now he does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if it makes much sense trying to convince those in 
a majority government when they refer to the potential of this 
leading to the same atrocities of Nazi Germany. How do you argue 
with that kind of reasoning?  It is absolute nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are sincerely in trouble in this country with logic such as 
this from across the way that is so illogical to victims of crime 
and potential innocent people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have been following the debate today on this bill to 
adopt legislation which would create a DNA databank for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a major piece of work for us sitting on the House of 
Commons justice committee earlier this year. As have all 
colleagues on the justice committee, I have had an opportunity to 
look at the legislation from several perspectives and now we have 
a debate in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite useful to all of us in the House to have an 
opportunity to look at the different aspects of the bill from a 
public interest point of view.  I think we have done our very 
best to make this bill as good as we can, as good as it can be, 
so it will serve the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The perspectives of the opposition are useful here today. 
They like the principle of the bill, but they are suggesting the 
bill could be better.  That is the way the opposition is supposed 
to operate around here, and I urge them to continue. All of us 
here in government and in opposition are listening and looking 
for ways to improve the content of our legislation all the time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the bill do?  We have heard that it creates a DNA data 
bank for the first time for Canadians.  We have not had one up 
until now.  We do use DNA in criminal investigations and in court 
prosecutions.  We have embarked on that road.  We have made 
amendments to our Criminal Code, and successfully so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to remember that although we are setting up a 
DNA data bank for certain classes of DNA samples, we do have 
outside of that DNA data bank a process for obtaining DNA samples 
on warrant for criminal investigations.  That will continue. Just 
because the DNA data bank proposed here will not have a DNA 
sample from a particular class of convicted criminals or some 
other category, it does not mean that the police are not using 
DNA in criminal investigations and in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that the manner in which the DNA data 
bank is being created here is, from the point of view of 
government, reasonably cost effective.  There are methods of 
approach here that we could have spent a bundle on, but the 
minister and the Royal Canadian Mountain Police have made a real 
attempt to get the data bank up and running in a cost effective 
way and I think we should take note of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dominating the discussion and leading up to this point in the 
House has been concern over the charter or civil liberty 
implications of the data bank.  In fact it is true to say that 
those concerns have shaped the data bank itself, the design of 
it, and how the DNA will be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say right away and I think all members accept that the 
privacy provisions contained in the bill are as good as we can 
make them.  Doubtless there are always privacy concerns, but the 
protection of the information is as watertight as we can make it 
in the public interest.  The DNA analysis and the samples do have 
to be used for the purpose intended.  That means real people 
doing real jobs.  The police community will have to have access 
to the sampling and to the analysis, but there are serious 
penalties attached to the misuse of that information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I accept, and colleagues all around the House note, that a DNA 
sample is capable of revealing an awful lot of information about 
a human being.  Its use in the data bank is solely for the 
purpose of identification, nothing else.  The material will have 
to be monitored and disposed of as quickly as the public interest 
will allow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the charter concerns?  I want to focus on the big one 
because I think there has been some misunderstanding of what the 
charter hurdle has been.  Why were we not able to construct a DNA 
data bank that allowed the taking of a sample at the time of 
charge or at any time for that matter?  Why did we insist that it 
be taken only at the time of conviction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the privacy concern.  We have a privacy concern here 
no matter who the sample has been taken from.  Whether the person 
is a convicted person or not, we still have a privacy issue. It 
is not privacy that is our hurdle.  I believe the big charter 
problem, the big hurdle is the current intrusiveness of the 
sampling process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point in time in order to get a DNA sample something 
actually has to be physically taken from the human body.  It has 
to be scraped, it has to be gouged, it has to be expressed, a 
hair has to be yanked out by the root.  The physical integrity of 
the human body has to be intruded upon in order to get that 
sample. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am comfortable with the concept that at this point in our 
history our charter protects our bodily integrity from that type 
of state intrusion, unless we consent to it or unless the law 
allows it in some other way.  I do not think we have made a case 
here that will allow under our charter the state to gouge or pull 
or scrape or express a piece of a person's body simply because a 
person has been charged on the basis of reasonable grounds.  That 
is the hurdle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about what the future may bring.  It may come to 
pass, it may already be here or we may be very close to it, that 
technology and science may allow the taking of a DNA sample 
without that degree of intrusiveness.  The simple pressing of a 
finger or a palm against a plate may allow the taking of a DNA 
sample. If that is the case, if that is the degree of 
intrusiveness, then we may indeed have something similar to a 
fingerprint.  We take fingerprints now not on conviction but at 
charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to get to the point where the sampling process is simply 
not intrusive, as non-intrusive as the taking of a fingerprint, 
and we are not quite there yet.  There are half a dozen ways to 
get a sufficient sample for an analysis here and none of them are 
quite as simple as the thumbprint.  We have not got that yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told and at committee we seemed to have information which 
indicated that technology is moving at a pace now where we may be 
able to extract a sufficient DNA sample from something similar to 
blowing into a breathalyser or taking a palm print.  When we get 
there, society and the law may accept that we can take DNA 
samples at charge or at birth or whenever.  This is an issue 
Canadians doubtless are going to have to address in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave the subject matter there.  The 10 minutes has run 
by rather quickly.  As a legislator, if I am still around in this 
place in a few years, one never knows, but the House will 
doubtless have an opportunity to enhance and upgrade the DNA 
provisions of the Criminal Code just as we have done for the last 
five or 10 years.  We will get another kick at the cat, and no 
offence to the cats of Canada.  I hope we do get there and I hope 
the DNA data bank created by the bill gets off and running 
quickly so the RCMP can do their best to enhance public safety as 
intended by the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
just a couple of points I would like to put on the record in this 
final reading debate of Bill C-3.  I would like to follow up on 
the closing remarks of the hon. member for Scarborough—Rouge 
River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the examination of the bill by the justice committee of 
which we were both members, the record will show that the justice 
officials who appeared before the committee on two different 
occasions indicated there was a necessity to go slow on the 
taking of DNA samples.  There must be some degree of reluctance 
to move into the area we are asking the government to take the 
bill.  At a later date we could do that. I think this was the 
inference by my hon. colleague who spoke last, let us give this 
some time and let us advance the bill into these areas after some 
time has elapsed.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me the inference of this is that the judges may rule 
something unconstitutional today that they are going to rule 
constitutional tomorrow. If that is the case, then I would 
suggest the three independent legal opinions that were submitted 
late by the government on this bill are simply redundant and 
meaningless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I add as well that I have listened to many of the speakers 
today.  They do not seem to understand that their concerns over 
the intrusive nature of taking a blood sample, a hair sample or a 
saliva swab have already passed the constitutional test. It is 
there in the Criminal Code now for something that is not always 
tried by indictment, impaired driving. At least one of the former 
judges who submitted a legal opinion on this bill referred to 
that fact.  If it is not a constitutional violation to take a 
blood sample in connection with an impaired driving charge which 
may be tried by indictment or summary conviction, then why would 
it be unconstitutional now to take a blood sample, the most 
intrusive of three methods of taking a DNA sample from a human 
being? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We examined these two very strongly presented arguments against 
going beyond what the bill does now, which is the intrusive 
nature of it as well as the privacy of the individual. We heard 
many times from witnesses as well as from members of the 
committee.  I believe we heard it here today during this final 
debate that the extensive nature of the information gained from a 
DNA sample is what causes people to be concerned about allowing 
this to occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know every day there are blood samples taken and lodged in 
clinics and in a bank somewhere.  The detrimental or negative 
impact of having those samples somewhere in a data bank has not 
resulted in the negative aspects which many witnesses and members 
of the government have put forward would occur if we went beyond 
where the bill takes us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Scarborough—Rouge River referred to another 
point, the rapid advancement of the technology to take DNA 
samples.  There may come a day when we will leave a sample on the 
barbershop floor that will be suitable for DNA testing. We know 
that a blood sample is taken when every child is born. The sample 
is lodged somewhere in a data bank at least for a certain period 
of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we examine the privacy aspect and the intrusive nature, and 
I can refer hon. colleagues back to the record of the witnesses 
who appeared before the committee, there is just not an arguable, 
sustainable, logical, comprehensive debate on either of these two 
issues to deny further advancement of the taking of DNA samples 
at the time of charge.  It simply does not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from the Tory party who sits on the committee 
has touched upon the real reason we are not going as far as we 
should be going to satisfy the needs of the Canadian Police 
Association and other law enforcement spokespersons as well as 
members in the opposition parties. There is fear and concern and 
a degree of timidity with regard to what the Supreme Court of 
Canada will say.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to my opening comments.  If we are to go slow or to go 
into the area we want the bill to cover at a later date because 
of a fear that if we bring it in too early the supreme court will 
strike it down, we are really saying that what it declares 
unconstitutional today it will not declare unconstitutional 
tomorrow as it gets used to it and as it becomes part of our 
legal system, the legislation and the process.  That is wrong. 
What is constitutional today must be constitutional tomorrow. How 
can what is constitutional today be unconstitutional tomorrow? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand or comprehend that argument.  Inasmuch as we 
have opened the door and entered the room of taking samples from 
those who are convicted and incarcerated for designated primary 
offences, we have taken that step and will take samples from 
certain individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the difference in going beyond that?  Why is there a 
reluctance to go beyond that and include all primary designated 
offences in that category?  I do not understand.  When we asked 
that question before the committee the answers were not 
comprehensible to me and were not justifiable in refusing to move 
further into that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrap up my comments by saying we all know the bill is moving 
in the right direction.  However, the role of the opposition is 
to leave its concern indelibly marked on any document it does not 
feel is in the best interest of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is to move this bill forward and it will pass.  I 
hope members of the Senate will take a hard look at what we have 
been asking for, what the Canadian Police Association has been 
asking for and what others have been asking for.  Some good work 
comes out of the other place regardless of our feelings about its 
make-up and constitution.  When it gets to the Senate I hope the 
committee that looks at it will examine our concerns and why 
opposition members could not endorse the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the government is right.  Perhaps in time all our 
requirements will be met.  The problem is that it is a matter of 
safety, of concern and of providing the police with the tools 
they could have now but will not have on the passage of the bill. 
This is a shortcoming we cannot accept and must object to.  We 
will do so by the way we vote on the bill in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham—Kent Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege for me today to speak to Bill C-3 
which provides for the establishment of a national DNA data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DNA identification act will make Canada one of only a 
handful of countries in the world to have a national DNA data 
bank.  I am pleased to inform the House that the ground breaking 
legislation this measure supports will signify Canada as a mover 
in the world community on a very special base as one of a handful 
of countries that has gone forward with this type of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new legislation strengthens our commitment to combat crime, 
especially violent crime in Canada.  The plan that was developed 
early in July 1995 gave provincial judges the power o put 
together warrants which allowed police, after they collected 
samples, to identify people who had committed serious offences. 
We have stepped forward today by adding a law which will usefully 
put together a framework for DNA samples in a data bank.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another concrete step toward protecting Canadians from 
violent criminals.  We should make no mistake.  Bill C-3 gives 
Canadian police access to a powerful tool in its fight against 
crime.  As we all know, forensic DNA analysis has been 
instrumental in securing convictions.  It has also been crucial 
in helping to exonerate wrongly condemned people, but it also 
raises potential privacy and charter concerns because it has the 
ability to reveal much more of a person than what a fingerprint 
would reveal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the magnitude of these issues surrounded by the use or 
potential misuse of DNA information, the government has taken 
steps to ensure that a detailed and careful study of the 
legislation has taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation was referred to the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights before second reading.  The government 
also went to Canadians to hear what they wanted to say.  Bill C-3 
reflects the views of Canadians across the country.  The 
reflections came from a broad spectrum of Canadians which 
included police associations, victims groups, legal 
organizations, provincial attorneys general, academics, privacy 
experts and medical people.  The committee was vigilant in making 
sure it heard from those with concerns over the charter and from 
those whose overriding concern was public safety.  The goal has 
always been to protect Canadians from violent criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some other issues were discussed as well.  The data bank will 
include two indexes: a scene of the crime index containing DNA 
profiles from actual crime scenes and a convicted offenders index 
containing profiles of offenders convicted of designated 
offences.  With this structure, stored DNA information can be 
cross-referenced in order to identify linkages and to help solve 
serious crimes in any police jurisdiction anywhere in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sharing information is the key to successful arrests of 
offenders.  Bill C-3 sets out the circumstances where samples can 
be taken and stored in a data bank.  Where a person has been 
convicted of a primary designated offence the court will, except 
in most exceptional circumstances, make an order requiring that 
person to submit bodily substances for data bank purposes.  Where 
a person has been convicted of a secondary designated offence and 
where the crown makes an application to the court, the bill lets 
the judge make an order requiring the offender to provide bodily 
substances for DNA banking purposes.  In making that order the 
court must satisfy that it has the interest of administration and 
justice in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary and secondary designated offences listed in the bill 
were developed on the basis of the serious nature of the offences 
and the likelihood of finding DNA evidence at the scene of the 
crime.  DNA samples are most likely to be found at crime scenes 
of primary offences like those of murder and sexual assault.  On 
the other hand, DNA evidence is less likely to be found at the 
scenes of secondary offence crimes such as those of robbery or 
arson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking samples after an offender has been convicted balances an 
overriding concern for the safety of all Canadians.  It also 
takes into account the need to respect the rights protected by 
Canada's charter.  The accused has the right to presume innocence 
and protection from unreasonable search and seizure.  I think 
members would agree with that statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of when DNA samples should be taken has garnered much 
attention throughout the development of the bill.  The vast 
majority of Canadians we spoke with said that taking samples from 
convicted persons is the only way to respect the rights of all 
Canadians under the charter.  The majority of those consulted 
also took the position that taking samples at the time of arrest 
or charge would pose a very serious risk of being struck down as 
unconstitutional.  Legal experts from the Department of Justice 
and three of Canada's most eminent justices have told the 
government that taking samples before a conviction would be 
unconstitutional. 
I think we can all agree developing legislation that will be 
thrown out by the courts is not useful for the justice system and 
not useful for Canadians who look to parliament to develop 
appropriate legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 will not only capture serious offenders following 
conviction.  It will also permit DNA samples to be collected from 
high risk violent offenders under penitentiary sentence who were 
convicted before the bill comes into law.  Samples will be taken 
retroactively from the designations of dangerous offenders, 
repeated sex offenders and murderers who have killed more than 
once.  Collection of DNA samples from these offenders will give 
police valuable information to help them solve outstanding 
criminal cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young offenders will be treated in the same way as adults with 
respect to taking DNA samples for the purpose of data banking. 
The DNA extracted from a sample will be analysed with the 
resulting profile entered into the convicted offenders index of 
the data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 authorizes the RCMP to establish and maintain a data 
bank.  It is worth noting that access to DNA profiles contained 
in the convicted offenders index and the samples themselves will 
be strictly limited to those directly involved in the operation 
of the data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that this law is very appropriate at this 
time.  It will provide a service to Canadian police officers so 
that they will be able to pursue and follow up in a much more 
scientific way on actions of violent crime in the country. I 
recommend that every member of the House support the bill in the 
name of criminal justice.

of our oceans and of the vital nature of the marine world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Lower St. Lawrence region, the marine world impacts on 
our cultural and social reality, and it is an essential 
component of our economic life, partly because of its fishery 
resources and its potential for the tourist industry.

field of marine sciences. 
In addition to the Institut maritime du Québec—the only 
institution to provide a college education program—we have 
distinguished professors and researchers at the INRS-Oceanology, 
UQAR's department of oceanography, the Fisheries and Oceans 
Research Centre, and the Maurice-Lamontagne Institute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While respecting and preserving marine resources is definitely a 
collective responsibility, the government must act as a leader 
in improving management, at the international level, of the 
world's oceans.

seven years ago James Mills was murdered while a prisoner of the

a crime but he was not condemned to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For seven years the Mills family has waited for justice to be

file over to the crown prosecutor and recommended that charges be 
laid.

<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the law on employment insurance is clear.  If there is a 
surplus because the government has been overcharging employers 
and workers, then the money belongs to them and it is illegal for 
the Prime Minister to take that money and use it for something 
else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister not obey the law and give those 
excess funds back to the workers and employers to whom they 
belong? 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is a debate going on at this moment in preparation 
for the budget and how to deal with the finances of the nation in 
the next budget.  Some representations have been made to the 
government that it would be more advisable perhaps to cut income 
tax than to do that because it will go into the pockets of the 
taxpayers and not to the corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a debate.  I know that the Leader of the Opposition 
does not want that money to be used to cut income tax.  We know 
that.  It is part of the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, why is the government even contemplating breaking the 
law?  If the Prime Minister loots the employment insurance fund, 
who precisely is he taking this money from?  He is taking it from 
the small business person, the factory worker, the construction 
worker, the clerk, the waitress, to whom these funds belong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will stand up for the rights of these workers and employers 
if the Prime Minister will not? 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is pretty nice to have a problem like this one when 
we have run the nation in such a way that we have a problem with 
surpluses.  If we had operated a government the way that it was 
operated before, we would still be at a 11.4% unemployment level. 
Now we are at 8.3% and it is going down, and 1.2 million new jobs 
have been created in Canada in the last five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the problem that the government has probably been too 
good to the satisfaction—- 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. Leader of the Opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are talking about to whom do these surpluses belong. 
We are talking about obeying the law.  We are talking about funds 
that were contributed in trust.  We are not talking about general 
revenues and we are not talking about some Liberal slush fund 
that the government can spend however it pleases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister tell his tax addicted finance minister 
to keep his hands off the employment insurance fund? 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I think that the Minister of Finance has been pretty 
good.  I see that we have reduced the deficit from $42 billion to 
zero.  I see that we have less than 1% inflation.  I see that the 
<I>Financial Times</I> of London has said that in terms of finance 
management, we are the top dogs of the G-7. 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
government is calling for a debate to cover up its planned raid 
on the $6 billion EI overpayment.  We are no more entitled to 
debate the raiding of the EI fund than we are entitled to debate 
the raiding of the Prime Minister's own personal RRSP.  The EI 
fund is not his money to spend. That is what the law says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister not respect the law and give workers 
and employers that money back?  Respect the law. 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the consolidation of this fund with the consolidated 
revenue of Canada was done long before we formed the government. 
There is no slush fund. It is just the money available to the 
government for the operation of the government. The Minister of 
Finance and rightly so is doing something that did not exist 
before, having a public debate before preparing his budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker,

their hands on taxpayers' money.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, instead of trying to 
change the law to raid the money they are not entitled to by law, 
why do they not just obey the law and give that money back to 
workers and employers?  Obey the law. 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there are some people who think it would be better if 
the money was to go into the taxpayers' pockets rather than into 
the coffers of some corporation. Sixty per cent of the money is 
going to the corporations and 40% to the taxpayers.  Some think 
it might be better to give it to those who earned the money 
working on an hourly basis.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
the Minister of Finance was caught helping himself to the EI 
surplus, the only excuse he has managed to come up with is that 
a broad debate is necessary to determine the use to which this 
surplus should be put. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister admit that the real debate, the one that 
is urgently required, is not about what to do with the money 
lifted from the pockets of workers, the unemployed and small 
businesses, 
but about why the Minister of Finance took money that was not 
his to take? 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would point out to the hon. member that, if we had stuck with 
the legislation passed by the Conservative government, premiums 
on January 1, 1994 would have been $3.30 on every $100, but we 
reduced them in successive budgets to $2.70. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before taking any further decision, the Minister of Finance 
wants to have everyone's opinion.  But apparently the Bloc 
Quebecois would like the money to go to companies rather than 
employees. 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
reading of the situation is that the Minister of Finance—aided 
and abetted by the Prime Minister—dipped into the pockets of 
workers, the unemployed and small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should realize that the only reason there is a surplus is 
that there are unemployed workers who no longer qualify for 
benefits, even though they have paid their premiums, and that 
some workers are paying more than they need to.  These are 
average folks whom the Prime Minister probably does not know, 
having spent so much time on Bay Street. 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
people understand that 1.2 million new jobs have been created 
since this government was elected in 1993.  They understand that 
the level of unemployment has dropped from 11.4% to 8.3%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And they understand that, because the fund has been very well 
administered, we now have a surplus, which we are going to 
administer, as we have always done, with care so as to serve the 
interests of all taxpayers.

Development said in this House that he was trying, with the help 
of Statistics Canada, to figure out why the participation rate 
in the employment insurance system has been dropping, to the 
point where only two out of every five Canadians out of work now 
collect benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does not the minister not yet realize that, while he is trying 
to find out why an increasingly smaller number of unemployed 
persons qualify for benefits, his colleague, the Minister of

how to spend money what belongs to the unemployed? 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all, we must

are not made exclusively by workers, but also by employers and 
major businesses. So, enough of the Bloc's demagoguery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are fully aware that we must take—

for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All workers in this country pay employment insurance premiums. 
Despite their contributions, however, three out of five 
unemployed persons do not receive any benefits. Yet the 
Minister of Finance is drooling at the prospect of getting his 
hands on a slice of the employment insurance pie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before he gets his hands on the whole thing, has this government

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister,Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and myself have said we want a debate on what should 
be in the next budget. There are all kinds of ideas on this. 
Some people feel the best thing to do would be to make the fund

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 800,000 
Canadians who are unemployed in this country today are not 
receiving any employment insurance benefits.  That is because the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister talks about choices, about a debate of what

mismanagement in government.  We find that there are millions of 
social insurance cards circulating in Canada with no legitimate

found that one-third were being used to defraud the government of 
millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of National Revenue.  Will he 
tell Canadians how many millions of dollars we are paying on

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

there are only 200,000 legitimate users in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already heard the minister say they are going to fix 
this, but why has this not already been fixed?  We have spent

Mr. Speaker, last night the Prime Minister proved once and for

said that his government had never been involved in scandal in 
the last five years.

be independent.  I do not accept that premise and I do not think 
Canadians accept it either.

<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I met 
Gilles Rocheleau in 1990.  I had heard about him long before 
that, however, because he had been active in politics for many 
years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was a municipal councillor in Hull from 1967 to 1974, mayor 
of Hull from 1974 to 1981, an MLA and then a minister in the 
Quebec government from 1981 to 1988.  He served as a Liberal MP 
in Ottawa from 1988 to 1990, and then as a member of the Bloc 
Quebecois from 1990 to 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing never changed.  Gilles Rocheleau was a forthright man 
who always said what he thought.  An admittedly sometimes rough 
exterior concealed a sensitive man who took a close interest in 
those around him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Maison des Citoyens, of which he was rightly proud, was 
built while he was mayor of Hull, and its agora today bears his 
name. 
Gilles was a man of discipline, who defended his point of view 
with determination, but knew when to step back into line when 
his views were not shared.  And step back into line he did, but 
not without good reason, for if his beliefs were questioned, 
Gilles Rocheleau did not hesitate to set aside his personal 
interests and take up the challenge.  So it was that he joined 
the Bloc Quebecois in 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a path many Quebeckers have taken.  Gilles Rocheleau was 
therefore also, if not primarily, a fighter.  Sovereignists were 
happy to have him on their side, having seen what a strong 
opponent he could be.  The militant federalist Gilles Rocheleau 
became a staunch sovereignist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gilles Rocheleau was also a man of some experience, having 
worked in many arenas, but he always kept the respect of his 
friends. 
He was not afraid to speak his mind, to put it mildly.  He would 
not stand for duplicity and his tongue sometimes got away from 
him, but never out of spite. He was not politically correct, but 
he said what he was thinking, whether he was right or wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer my condolences to his children, and to Hélène Roy, his 
wife and partner, who is with us today.  I know that all those 
who knew him will never forget him, especially the people of 
Hull.  On their behalf, I thank him.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and Minister

public life to the service of his fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gilles Rocheleau served the City of Hull for 14 years as 
alderman and mayor.  He then went on to represent his fellow 
citizens in the Quebec National Assembly for seven years, 
serving first of all under Claude Ryan and then as a minister 
under Robert Bourassa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in 1988, his fellow citizens elected him to this 
Parliament to defend their interests on the federal scene. 
Gilles, as he was fondly referred to by everyone in the 
Outaouais, was a man with definite ideas and no hesitancy to 
express them, but he will long be remembered by all, primarily 
for his love and legendary devotion to his fellow residents of 
west Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Government of Canada, I offer sincere 
condolences to his wife and family.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A native of Rigaud, Quebec, Gilles Rocheleau devoted his life to 
serving the people of the Outaouais region.  He was mayor of 
Hull from 1974 to 1981, and was elected to the House of Commons 
for the Outaouais region in 1988, where he sat until 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He represented the riding of Hull—Aylmer in the Quebec National

Rocheleau sat with the Bloc Quebecois and contributed to that 
party's advancement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 
my party, I would like to pay tribute to Gilles Rocheleau, who 
was the member for the riding of Hull—Aylmer in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I knew him well, because we were both members at the same time. 
I recall that he was a two career man.  He was a business man 
for many years and then he was in politics for 25 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I am not mistaken, he was a provincial MLA in Quebec City and 
mayor of the fine city of Hull.  He then became a member of the 
House of Commons for two parties:  the Liberal Party and then 
the Bloc Quebecois, of which he was a founding member, along 
with Lucien Bouchard and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was a good MP, and I think the Outaouais has lost a great 
defender.  He was widely known.  For a number of years, when I 
came to Ottawa, I lived in Aylmer.  He was very popular, widely 
known and a strong defender of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my party, I offer my condolences to his family and 
friends. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I pleased to say 
a few words about Mr. Rocheleau on behalf of the Progressive 
Conservative Party.  While I did not have the opportunity to 
work within the same party with him, I can say he deserved our 
full respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to review his career, because my colleagues 
speaking before me have so.  What struck me especially about him 
was his involvement, at a very early age, in the social and 
economic activities of his region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At 27 or 28, he was I believe the chairman of the Association 
des hommes d'affaires.  This was an indication of his passion in 
the defence of the interests of his region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He then became involved at various levels of government, in 
Quebec City, among other places, and then in Ottawa. 
His involvement was marked by the effectiveness of his 
interventions.  People who had dealings with him when we were in 
government found his work to always be constructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party I extend my 
condolences to his family and hope that Mr. Rocheleau will agree 
to pass on to us from above some of his fine qualities.  What 
struck me most about him, obviously, was his huge 
disappointment—it was existential—at the failure of the Meech 
Lake accord.  I think all Quebeckers working to bring about 
national reconciliation at the time were struck by the decision 
Mr. Rocheleau made.  I think we could learn something from it for 
future use.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I also 
want to pay tribute to Paul Tardif, a former member of this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Tardif was not a member of Parliament in 1978, when I 
was elected, because he did not run in that election, but I 
clearly remember his good reputation as a member who represented 
his riding well and he was well respected by everyone here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was first elected in a 1959 byelection and re-elected in 1962, 
1963 and 1965, while John Diefenbaker was in power. If I am not 
mistaken, he was deputy speaker of this House for a time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my party, I wish to extend my condolences to his 
family and to his many friends.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, on August 3 
of this year Canada lost a fine example of excellence in 
citizenship.  Paul Tardif held office as a school board trustee 
and an Ottawa city alderman before serving as a Liberal member of 
this House for the riding of Russell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Success in Russell was not to be ours during Paul Tardif's 
watch.  In light of the fact that he was known for his keen mind 
and jovial wit, I know he would take it as high praise if I 
referred to him as a thorn in the side of the Progressive 
Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was first elected in a 1959 byelection, just one year after 
the Diefenbaker sweep.  He followed that up with three successive 
election wins, each with an overwhelming majority.  The electoral 
success he enjoyed is only possible when candidates are able to 
transcend the process and compel people to vote with their 
hearts.  In the hearts of the people of Russell and Ottawa is 
where Paul Tardif remains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the PC Party caucus I would like to extend our 
thoughts and prayers to the family of a man who defined the term 
public servant.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>DNA IDENTIFICATION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK195">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-3, an 
act respecting DNA identification and to make consequential 
amendments to the Criminal Code and other acts, be read the third 
time and passed; and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, we 
can hear the jackboots marching.  A time allocation measure has 
been brought in on Bill C-3 and there is absolutely no good 
reason for it.  Indeed, we did not have a situation where the 
opposition was trying to run up as many members as possible to 
speak to this bill.  This was clearly a matter of the bill being 
earnestly debated because we saw honest problems with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House how many times the government has brought 
in time allocation and I will point out how useless this last 
measure was.  In the 35th Parliament some sort of restriction was 
brought in, either time allocation or closure, 35 times.  In the 
last Parliament there were 32 time allocation motions and three 
closure motions, which brings the total to 35, which matches the 
35th Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first year of the 36th Parliament there have been seven 
time allocation motions.  That means that this government has 
brought in either time allocation or closure 42 times since it 
took office in 1993.  There have been 39 time allocation motions 
and three closure motions.  There was absolutely no good reason 
for it.  The government is shutting down honest debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear the comments of people with regard to this bill I 
think of my seatmate.  He was a member of the RCMP who has said 
that the police in this country should be able to effect these 
tools immediately.  He says that they should not have to have a 
loophole or a restriction with regard to the use of some of this 
technology.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He brings forward a legitimate complaint, something that I know 
he has brought forward in committee a number of times.  I know 
that his concerns are absolutely legitimate.  I do not question 
anything he has to say with regard to this because I know that 
his interests are at the heart of the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Langley—Abbotsford talked about the people in 
his riding who are suffering as a result of the seven 
penitentiaries that are within a half hour drive of his riding. 
He talked about honest, legitimate concerns that he has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do people across the way talk about?  They talk about what 
the bar associations and the lawyers want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition is not running on and on about this.  All we 
wanted to ensure was that there was legitimate debate on this 
bill.  Everything I heard this morning brought forward by all 
opposition parties were legitimate suggestions to improve this 
legislation.  It is a step in the right direction but it needs to 
be better.  The idea to bring in time allocation on something 
like this is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members need to hear the questions that are important 
when we consider things like time allocation, restricting debate, 
or when we pass any piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What fruit will it bear?  What fruit does it bear when there is 
not a long list of people who want to run on with the debate, 
when perfectly legitimate points are being made with regard to 
Bill C-3 and the DNA data bank?  What type of fruit does it bear 
when they try to restrict debate?  They bring forward closure. 
They end debate.  How does that serve the Canadian public?  How 
does that improve the legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our job as the official opposition to question the 
government and to try to improve legislation.  Forty-two times 
since the government was elected in 1993 it has brought in time 
allocation and closure to restrict our freedom of speech, to 
restrict our ability to constructively criticize government 
legislation and to make it better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It fits in with what it did at the APEC conference in Vancouver. 
It likes to restrict freedom of speech.  It is certainly doing it 
to members of parliament and to the opposition in the House 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who wants it?  Who wants some of these things with regard to 
time allocation?  Who does it serve?  Nobody but the government. 
It is a public relations exercise to try to quell the debate on 
an issue, to try to silence it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of Bill C-3, maybe it serves the bar associations or 
the odd lawyer or two who happen to feel they are going to get 
more money or more cases from this.  It certainly does not help 
the average citizen and the victims of crime.  They do not want 
it.  The Canadian taxpayers do not want it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will slip through the cracks as a result of some of these 
things?  That is another fundamental question.  For example, the 
people who have been assaulted once, if they have been assaulted 
by somebody who has committed only one rape or one murder.  Those 
are the types of people who are going to suffer.  There are a lot 
of people out there who are included in that category of victims. 
By improving the legislation we would be able to address those 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not want to hear that.  It wants to close 
its ears and stifle the debate.  Maybe it feels that it has done 
its duty, that it has come through with this legislation.  Even 
though there are good and legitimate arguments that the 
opposition is putting forward to make this legislation better, it 
wants to ram it through and not take any of those things into 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victims slip through the cracks.  The police officers who 
want the tools to do the job slip through the cracks.  The 
taxpayers who are being ill-served by this type of thing slip 
through the cracks.  The opposition falls through the cracks as 
well because our ability to do our job is restricted by these 
closure and time allocation motions.  The press, whose job it is 
to provide information to the Canadian public, slips through the 
cracks.  Nobody benefits but the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will it solve the problem it intends to address?  This 
legislation is a move in the right direction, but we were trying 
to make it better than it is.  That is our job.  All of us in the 
House have an interest to try to improve the country and make it 
a better place.  Canada is number one in our hearts and concerns 
and we were trying to make the legislation better than it is. 
Time allocation and not accepting some of the amendments and 
suggestions the opposition has made with regard to Bill C-3 does 
not solve the problem that the legislation can be better. 
Indeed it brushes it over and tries to rush it through.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are they attacking a strawman?  The government always tosses in 
a strawman.  It says that the opposition, for example, is not 
addressing real concerns.  Real Canadians are victims of crime. 
They toss a strawman or a red herring into the argument by saying 
that there may be some potential problem with a constitutional 
aspect or some sort of suggestion on behalf of a bar association 
or a group of lawyers that do not happen to like something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can guarantee that in a large enough group of lawyers, as a 
matter of fact two, there will be some disagreements on opinion 
and if they have enough money to fund it they will continue with 
the debate for as long as it takes for the money to run dry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That alone, the whole idea of a red herring or a strawman, is 
not enough to stifle debate on Bill C-3.  I have heard very good 
arguments on behalf of the opposition side of the House today for 
why we need further debate and why improvements need to be 
included in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty-two times closure and time allocation have been used in 
the House of Commons since the Liberals took power in 1993.  It 
is a shame that it has happened on something like Bill C-3 
because there was absolutely no justification for it.  The types 
of arguments that are being put forward by the opposition were 
merely to improve the legislation to make it a better piece of 
work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea—Gore—Malton—Springdale, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to rise to speak in 
support of Bill C-3 which, when it comes into force, will permit 
the creation of a national DNA data bank in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has already been much public debate on the need for such 
legislation.  I believe there is consensus in the House and 
across the country in support of the creation of a national DNA 
data bank as proposed in Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that in 1995 parliament enacted amendments to the 
Criminal Code which introduced the DNA warrant scheme into our 
criminal law.  This legislation has been successfully used in the 
three years since in the investigation of serious crimes such as 
sexual assault and murder.  Criminals who might otherwise have 
gone undetected and unpunished have been brought to justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not intend to use my time today to add to the reasons we 
should all agree that Canadian law enforcement should be provided 
a tool which will allow it to take fuller advantage of forensic 
DNA science.  Rather my comments today will focus on one issue, 
perhaps the most controversial issue dealt with in this important 
legislation, the timing of the collection of bodily substances 
for inclusion in the national DNA data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret that the Canadian Police Association and the 
Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police would have favoured a 
scheme which permitted police to take DNA samples for the 
purposes of the DNA data bank from suspects at the time of charge 
rather than following conviction.  This is what the government 
proposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both organizations have appeared before the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Human Rights.  Both are sincere in their views and 
both believe that a DNA data bank would be more effective if it 
was broader in scope.  With respect, both have closed their eyes 
to the constitutional dangers of what they proposed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police has taken the 
high road on this issue, the Canadian Police Association has 
persisted in a questionable campaign against Bill C-3.  The CPA 
claims that if the bill is not amended in keeping with its wishes 
it will only be a matter of time before the government will be 
blamed for a murder or a rape or a child sex scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a letter recently written to all members of parliament the 
CPA had the nerve to criticize the independent legal opinions 
concerning this issue which were obtained by the government 
simply because they were obtained by the government.  Or, was it 
simply because they support the legal advice provided to the 
standing committee by the justice department experts when they 
appeared before it and that of their counterparts from the 
ministry of the attorney general of Ontario and the department of 
justice of New Brunswick?  Or, was it because they cannot bear 
that the legal opinions completely discredit the ones obtained by 
the association? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPA seems to suggest that the government's outside legal 
opinions are less independent than the one obtained by the CPA. 
Is it suggesting some indirect pressure was brought to bear on 
the legal minds that provided the government with their opinions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday, May 1, 1998, the Department of Justice released the 
legal opinions of three of the most respected legal minds in 
Canada, three former court of appeal justices, regarding the 
issue of when DNA samples can be collected for the purposes of 
the national DNA data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former Justice Martin Taylor of the British Columbia Court of 
Appeal and former Chief Justices Charles Dubin of the Ontario 
Court of Appeal and Claude Bisson of the Quebec Court of Appeal 
each concluded independently that the proposal to permit the 
police to take DNA samples from persons at the time of charge for 
the purposes of the national DNA data bank would not survive 
charter scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPA has chosen to close its eyes and ears to the advice of 
legal experts.  It continues to urge changes to the bill which 
would clearly be unconstitutional.  It ignores the clear signs 
which exist for all to see.  It is as though it has embarked on a 
high speed chase on black ice in a school zone and ignored the 
signs that warn of a school crossing ahead as it hurtled 
carelessly forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot act dangerously.  It has the duty to 
anticipate the results of the legislation it presents to 
parliament and to consider that if the legislation is found 
unconstitutional the results in terms of justice will be tragic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider, for example, that any evidence resulting from a 
match of DNA profiles in the national DNA data bank would likely 
be thrown out in a criminal case.  As well, persons convicted on 
the basis of such evidence could ask to have their convictions 
overturned and they might seek compensation for having been 
wrongly convicted. 
It is clear that the DNA profiles of these persons would have to 
be removed from the data bank.  Canadians would be shocked by 
such a disaster, especially when it could have been avoided.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close my remarks by saying that Bill C-3 promises the 
proper blueprint for a national DNA data bank in Canada, one 
which is respectful of constitutional requirements and effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The views of the police in this matter are self-evident. Members 
of the House must carefully weigh, in deciding how they will vote 
on the legislation, the likelihood of the government's proposal 
surviving an obvious constitutional challenge as opposed to the 
chances of the police scheme meeting the existing constitutional 
requirements. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to take the opportunity to 
speak about two aspects of what has happened this afternoon and 
to Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I will speak about time allocation which the government 
has used once again.  I cannot believe the government would 
continue a practice that it started in the last parliament. There 
were 32 time allocations in the 35th parliament, and government 
members have already done it seven times in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is abhorrent to me and to Canadians that we have a government 
that is afraid of free speech, afraid of the opportunity for 
elected parliamentarians to come into the House to debate issues 
that are important to Canadians.  Canadians deserve their elected 
officials having the opportunity to debate these issues, to 
debate government legislation, to make sure that the end product 
is the best that it can be for Canadians.  If the government 
cannot stand criticism and is afraid of being honest and open 
with Canadians then government members have no business sitting 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 establishes a DNA data bank.  I do not think Canadians 
have any problem with establishing a DNA data bank.  However, I 
think Canadians including the people in my riding have a problem 
with a data bank only collecting DNA samples from people who have 
been convicted.  After the fact will not help the police solve 
the crime.  I know people in my constituency would like the 
police to have everything at their disposal, everything that is 
available to them by way of modern technology, to find some 
conclusive evidence to convict people and bring them to court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill falls far short of providing our law enforcement people 
with the facilities and the analysis they need to bring some of 
these cases to conclusion.  It is hard on families who know that 
only for DNA samples a suspect may be wandering the streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the government that DNA is no different from 
fingerprinting.  In the past when the government of the day 
wanted to institute fingerprinting as a normal investigative tool 
I am sure there was an outcry that it was an infringement on a 
person's right to have their fingerprints taken.  I am sure a 
similar debate went on at that time and that it was considered to 
be the most intrusive measure on an individual's person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also suggest that it is now a matter of course, a matter of 
fact.  It is just a natural thing that happens: suspects are 
charged, fingerprinted and become part of the collective 
knowledge of our system.  We are overreacting to the business of 
DNA being intrusive.  It is not intrusive to take a fingernail 
clipping.  It is not intrusive to prick a finger to get a drop of 
blood.  I mean, come on.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about a hospital stay overnight.  We are not 
talking about cutting a finger open. That is not what we are 
talking about.  It is very simple and easy to get the required 
sample. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the day will come.  Perhaps this government 
will not be the vehicle that will institute it but the day will 
come when DNA sampling is banked, when it is part of the normal 
course of investigation once a charge is laid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we wasting time?  Why are we reluctant to take that 
step?  Is it because it may be challenged in the supreme court? 
So what?  Is the government not going to make legislation on 
behalf of the Canadian public, legislation that is good and 
beneficial for the future of this country because it is afraid it 
might end up in the supreme court? The role of this House, the 
role of the legislators who sit here is to make the law.  If we 
are not going to make the law because we are afraid of the 
courts, then there is something serious here that we had better 
address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have a government that is going to refuse to address the 
issues of the day and be aggressive and forthcoming in solving 
the problems we face in this country because of fear, then it 
does not deserve to be here.  The government does not deserve to 
take this country into the 21st century if it is living in the 
19th century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are looking for a government that has guts, that has 
some fortitude to challenge things that are wrong in the Canadian 
system and to do things in a progressive manner, to move into the 
21st century and provide our police with a tool that is available 
from technological advancement.  Are we going to be driving 
horses and buggies, walking around, taking trains rather than 
flying and going to the moon? Technological advancements such as 
DNA offer us opportunities. We are remiss if we do not take 
advantage of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in law enforcement should have this tool available for 
their use in investigating crime and in laying charges, not just 
for use i after a person has been convicted.  It is a little bit 
late to wait for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will consider the arguments. It would be 
unusual for the Liberals to do so.  They have invoked closure so 
they are obviously not willing to listen to the other side, not 
willing to listen to a debate and not willing to listen to logic. 
They have made up their minds.  They really do not care what 
Canadians think.  It is typical of the arrogant attitude of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that members on the government side will stop, look at 
the legislation, realize that it is a missed opportunity, that 
there is something there, that the timing is such that we can 
move on and will change their minds and make some adjustments to 
the bill.  It has never happened before to my knowledge.  I do 
not expect this government to be any different from the previous 
government. It would be nice if Canadians could feel that open, 
honest debate occurred in this House and that the government 
really took into account the comments, the positive and creative 
criticism from the opposition, and would make some attempt to 
improve legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good idea but it needs to be broadened and expanded. I 
am remiss in saying that I doubt there will be anyone in the 
official opposition who will be supporting it, simply because we 
feel it is not good enough to support.  It is bad legislation. We 
do not get anywhere by supporting something that is not going to 
meet the needs of the law enforcement community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we support this bill and if it is enacted, which it probably 
will be anyway, then the government will put it aside and leave 
it alone.  It will miss the opportunity of doing something very 
constructive in allowing our law enforcement people to have 
another tool to help them in protecting Canadians on a day to day 
basis.

improving this legislation.  Make it a piece of legislation that 
will actually do some good for the Canadian public.  It may be a

listening.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lou  Sekora (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to address the House today 
on third reading of Bill C-3, which provides for the 
establishment of Canada's national DNA data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 will make Canada one of only a handful of countries in 
the world to have a national system of this kind.  It is 
important to recognize that this is ground breaking legislation 
and a major milestone of the government's safer communities 
agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public safety is a priority of this government.  To that end, 
Bill C-3 is an important part of our commitment to Canadians.  We 
know that Canadians want a data bank for better public 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intention of this legislation is to create an effective law 
enforcement tool, one that stands the test of time.  We must be 
careful in creating this data bank so that it is a tool that 
balances public safety needs with the privacy rights which are 
highly valued by Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has heeded the call from those on the front lines 
who have told us that this new law must help them to do their 
jobs.  We have taken the advice of those who have told us that it 
must not infringe upon basic rights under the charter.  We have 
listened to those who have told us that we must get on with the 
business of putting this valuable enforcement tool in place. I 
believe that we have found the right balance in Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the bill was introduced last year, members of this House 
have proceeded cautiously in their consideration of this proposed 
legislation. The government has welcomed this debate.  Given the 
scope of the issues surrounding the potential misuse of DNA 
profiles and samples as well as the legal and ethics concerns, it 
is vital that a bill of this nature be debated thoroughly, taking 
all views into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the very reason why Bill C-3 was referred to the 
all-party Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights before 
it proceeded to second reading.  The solicitor general did so at 
the time of introduction because he had the very expectation that 
we would come out of this exercise with a better bill. He 
expected that amendments would be made to improve it and in fact 
encouraged the committee to focus on making the bill better.  In 
my view, this is exactly what has been achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee examined this bill thoroughly. The policing 
community, those on the front lines included, provided their 
views.  This government listened to those views and we acted on 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week we heard from critics in this House who asked the very 
same questions that were brought and debated before the 
committee.  We have heard those same concerns time and time 
again.  We have addressed them in the amended bill before us 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not lose sight of the benefits of Bill C-3 and of the 
value it will bring as one of the most powerful investigative 
police tools to date.  To do that, we need only to reflect on the 
development of Bill C-3 from the time it was introduced one year 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From there we can easily see how it has been improved as a 
result of extensive consultations at every stage along the way. 
Perhaps more important, it becomes apparent why this bill 
provides that bodily samples be taken for DNA testing at the time 
of conviction and not at the time of arrest or charge.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of the DNA identification act marks the second 
phase of the government's DNA strategy.  The government 
recognized early in the process that the first important step 
involved laying out the requirements for when DNA samples could 
be obtained in order to be used in criminal investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result in 1995 amendments to the Criminal Code allowed 
police to obtain DNA samples from suspects by using a warrant. 
That first step provided the police with an extremely effective 
tool that has helped them solve many serious crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been effective because it has been used to help eliminate 
suspects and secure convictions.  It has been effective because 
it has been instrumental in obtaining guilty pleas therefore 
sparing victims the trauma of testifying.  It has been effective 
because it has helped to reduce overall court costs. It has also 
withstood constitutional challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the DNA warrant legislation now firmly in place in Canadian 
law and in the police investigation process, the government is 
now in the midst of the next phase of its DNA initiative. We are 
now creating the framework for storing DNA samples and for using 
that information in the investigation of serious crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national DNA data bank will be an important tool to help 
police link a suspect with evidence left at a crime scene.  The 
ability to store and later retrieve DNA profiles will shorten 
investigations and help prevent further violence by repeat 
offenders.  This means better public safety for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 will authorize police to collect DNA samples from 
offenders convicted of designated criminal offences.  These 
include the most serious personal injury crimes such as homicide 
and sexual offences.  They are crimes that are most likely to be 
associated with DNA evidence found at the crime scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Samples will be analysed with the resulting profile entered into 
the convicted offenders index of the data bank. The data bank 
will also have a crime scene index containing DNA information 
retrieved from crime scenes.  The purpose of having this 
structure is to ensure that the DNA profiles in each index can be 
cross referenced and a match in the system can be identified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits of using the system like the one we have laid out 
in Bill C-3 are very clear.  Stored DNA information will help the 
police more quickly identify suspects where they may otherwise 
not have had any leads.  It will allow them to identify repeat 
offenders no matter what police jurisdiction they are in. It will 
also have a deterrent effect as criminals will know that because 
their DNA profiles are already in the data bank they can no 
longer slip through the cracks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the development of Bill C-3 the federal government 
has sought the advice and expertise of many groups and 
individuals.  I want to make the point that those on the front 
lines have been consulted from the very beginning and throughout 
the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition the standing committee held 15 hearings on the bill 
and heard from representatives of 17 different organizations. 
Those 17 organizations, which included police, victims, and 
officials in our legal communities, represented thousands upon 
thousands of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is true that one of the critics of this bill, the 
Canadian Police Association, may represent 35,000 front line 
police officers, we have heard from even more who support this 
bill wholeheartedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have considered all views represented in our country.  Our 
consultations revealed strong support for the creation of a 
national data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were also a number of concerns about fundamental values 
that make Canada unique and are reflected in the rights 
guaranteed to all Canadians by our charter. These include 
individual rights to privacy and equality under the law, as well 
as public protection. To respond to those concerns and to improve 
the strength of the bill, a number of amendments were made since 
the legislation was first introduced.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share some of those concerns and changes. 
Various interest groups, including the privacy commissioner, the 
Barreau du Québec and the National Action Committee on the Status 
of Women, have suggested that the bill did not contain sufficient 
safeguards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows:  the hon. member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, 
Railways; the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst, Employment 
Insurance; the hon. member for Davenport, Environment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill C-3 with mixed emotions. 
I say that because this bill does not go far enough in addressing 
the concerns of the law-abiding citizens of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I was elected to this House in 1993 I have listened to 
hon. members on the other side of the House who have stood here 
time after time to proclaim how concerned they are about the 
judicial system in this country, how concerned they are about the 
victims of crime in this country, how they are going to work 
toward stopping crime in this country.  Since 1993, I am sorry to 
say, I have seen them do absolutely nothing with regard to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have come up with Bill C-3, respecting DNA.  We all agree 
that DNA sampling is good.  It has to come into play.  There is 
no argument.  But when we go through the bill and we see again 
our caring, sharing Liberal government on that side decide that 
the rights of criminals far outweigh the rights of victims, I 
have to wonder exactly what it is doing and how it keeps getting 
away with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said time and time again that the first priority of any 
government has to be the protection of its law-abiding citizens. 
I will say it again in this House.  This government has no 
intention of supplying that.  To me this bill shows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill there is the authority to deny the taking of DNA 
samples from any individual if it is believed that by doing so it 
will impact the individual's privacy and security.  This is 
somebody who has been picked up with regard to a crime.  The 
government says they do not have to take this.  The government 
says it infringes upon their constitutional right.  Never mind 
the rights of the victims, it infringes upon this individual's 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I am picked up, accused of committing a crime, and I know I 
am innocent, I will be the first one there to roll up my sleeve. 
I will let them take the hair.  I will let them take 
fingerprints. In fact they can take fingerprints today.  Is that 
not an infringement?  They take breathalyser tests for drunk 
drivers.  Is that not an infringement?  They take blood samples 
today.  Is that not an infringement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to shake my head at the stupidity of what is going on 
here.  The Liberals does not seem to understand. 
They forget the many victims who have come into this House, the 
many victims who have been to their offices and talked to them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak of the concerns of the rape victims in this 
country who have had to sit and wait.  They can sit and smile 
over there, but they know it is true.  The victims have been to 
their offices to beg and plead for something to happen with 
regard to this DNA bill so they can go on with their lives. They 
want to know whether they have been infected with a disease or if 
there will be an impact on their families.  They do not want to 
wait 12 months for the results.  That is what this bill does not 
allow.  This is the sharing, caring government of this country? 
It is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have information from the police associations that this bill 
does not go far enough.  It is a joke.  The government gets 
support, the screaming and the hollering from the criminal 
lawyers, and it decides that maybe it can pick that up and run 
with it.  It tries to offset this because it might be against 
somebody's constitutional rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals stand day after day to say that Canada has been 
voted as the best country in the world in which to live.  By 
being here today the Liberals are pulling off a sick, sad joke on 
the law-abiding citizens of this country.  We have seen it time 
after time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a democracy, a great democracy.  The Liberals like to 
tell us about this great wondrous democracy called Canada.  In 
this House of Commons, to which we have been sent, duly elected 
by people in our constituencies to represent them, we have today 
a thing called closure in regard to this bill.  It is by the same 
bunch that sat over here and said they would never do what the 
Conservatives did when in power.  That same bunch has moved time 
allocation and closure in this House more times than any previous 
government in the history of Canada.  Some democracy. That is 
some way to look after the law-abiding taxpaying citizens of this 
country.  They are the people who pay the government's wages and 
it shuts the door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals will stand and say they do not understand how we 
could not vote in favour of this bill, that there is a little 
section in the bill that is good.  There is a little section that 
is good, that can be covered in four words, while the remaining 
36 pages are total garbage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want us to accept this.  They would love us to stand here 
and sell out our principles for those three little words that are 
good in this bill.  I absolutely refuse to do that.  It is a 
shame that they play politics this way.  Maybe it is time it 
changed.  I think in the next election it will change because 
people are sick and tired of things like this coming down the 
tube. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  They can laugh all they want over 
there, but the time is coming.  Even some of them have not agreed 
with this.  They will go along with it because they are whipped 
into shape to do it.  It is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a multitude of unsolved crimes in this country.  We 
spend hundreds of millions every year trying to solve these 
crimes.  Yet with DNA sampling, most of these crimes could be 
solved at a minimal expense and it would clear up a whole 
backlog.  It would clear up our courts.  It would clear up a 
multitude of sins that have been committed in this country.  But 
not for this government.  It would not like to see that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I have to come back to whether the government's first 
concern is for the criminal lawyer or whether it is for the 
law-abiding citizens of this country.  I do not think I have to 
ask too many people on this side of the House who it is for. They 
do not leave too much doubt over here.  I would sincerely like 
the people from the other side of the House to sit down with some 
of these victims when they come to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen:</B>  Been there, done that.

<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor—St. Clair, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the self-righteous prattle is certainly coming hard and 
strong from the other side.  I wonder if the last speaker and the 
other speakers from the Reform Party on this debate today have 
ever heard of the Constitution or the charter of rights and 
freedoms because there is a balance that has to be struck here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have struck this balance before.  Recently we struck a 
balance with Bill C-68, which was upheld today by the Alberta 
Court of Appeal, in spite of Reformers telling us last week, loud 
and strong, that they thought it was going to fail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government respects the constitutional balance that has 
been created in this country between parliament and the courts, 
and it respects the fact that the charter of rights and freedoms 
exists to protect all Canadians, including Canadians who are 
accused of crimes but who have not yet been proven guilty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This balance is seen in Bill C-3.  While the debate on Bill C-3 
has interested me, I must say it is about time that we see an end 
to it.  It is time to bring this debate to close.  It is time 
that we move to make this bill law.  We know that Bill C-3 will 
place Canada at the forefront in the use of DNA technology in 
criminal investigations in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will become one of only a handful of countries to have a 
DNA data bank.  We know that once that bank is in place it is 
going to be a major milestone in policing technology and 
investigative procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public safety is a priority for this government, but public 
safety and privacy rights have to be balanced, understood and 
seen to be in sync with one another.  To that end, Bill C-3 is an 
important part of our commitment to Canadians.  It is a major 
achievement, a significant part of our government's safer 
communities agenda, and safer communities, after all, are what 
all Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want the police to be able to use a tool like the DNA 
data bank to help ensure that safe communities stay that way. 
However, Canadians do not want to give police powers that violate 
their rights to privacy and their rights pursuant to our 
Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intention of this legislation is to create an effective law 
enforcement tool, a tool that will stand the test of time.  I 
believe that Bill C-3, as written today, will do just that.  I 
also believe that legislation of this kind needed to be developed 
very carefully and was developed very carefully.  It was also 
studied very carefully in the justice committee last term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my view that Bill C-3 balances the needs of Canadians who 
want public safety as their top priority with the need to take 
into consideration the privacy rights that Canadians value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminal penalties have been included as a safeguard for any 
misuse or abuse of this data information bank and I do not think 
the Reform Party is objecting to that.  However, in addition to 
that, the bill was drafted in accordance with Canada's 
Constitution.  It has been drafted to ensure that the rights of 
all Canadians will not be infringed.  It upholds one of the 
primary considerations in our legal system, one which I think the 
rhetoric today has left behind, and that is that an accused has 
the right to be presumed innocent and to be protected from 
unreasonable search and seizure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 reflects the views of the highest court in the land 
which has said that the taking of DNA samples constitutes a 
search and seizure that requires judicial authorization.  We see 
this in the most straightforward searches that police now conduct 
of homes or offices.  Even for those, police must first get a 
warrant to search. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When asked for a bodily sample to be taken from an individual 
person, the importance of the court's authorization cannot be 
understated.  A search of a person's bodily substances needs to 
be taken more seriously than the search of a home or an office 
because it involves bodily integrity and it undermines human 
dignity.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court has made that clear.  Therefore, taking a DNA 
sample from a person for investigative purposes clearly demands a 
high standard of justification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA samples taken from every suspect without a warrant, as the 
opposition would suggest, no matter how minor the offence not 
only would waste valuable law enforcement time and resources, but 
also would not meet the standards that have been clarified by our 
courts.  We cannot forget the fact that police can already take a 
DNA sample from a person at the time of arrest or charge so long 
as they obtain a warrant to do so.  Reform does not raise this 
because it does not fit its assault on the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that that DNA warrant legislation came 
in in the last parliament.  It has been used very successfully in 
a wide range of cases.  Warrants have been given upon the right 
grounds being ready. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code already provides a way of allowing police to 
obtain a DNA sample from a person they suspect of having 
committed a very serious offence, by using a DNA warrant. This 
provision is consistent with the charter, giving the police the 
assurance that their case will not later be thrown out of court. 
It gives individuals the assurance that indeed it is taken very 
seriously by police when they are about to invade someone's 
privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleagues are obviously overlooking the fact that DNA 
warrant legislation has been in place for three years.  They are 
ignoring the fact that the Supreme Court of Canada has commended 
that legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA warrants are well used by police.  They have been helping 
investigations tremendously.  They have been used to eliminate 
suspects and secure convictions.  They have been instrumental in 
obtaining guilty pleas, thereby sparing victims the trauma of 
testifying.  They have been cost effective because they have 
helped to reduce overall court costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DNA warrant legislation has also survived all constitutional 
challenges to date.  It has survived those challenges because the 
legislation provides that judicial authorization be obtained for 
the collection of DNA samples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that over the past few years we have made 
enormous progress in our efforts to contribute to a safe, just 
and peaceful society.  The addition of forensic DNA analysis and 
the ability to store DNA profiles will help us target those who 
commit the most serious of crimes and hold them accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can continue to enjoy the safety of their streets and 
have a sense of security knowing that police forces across the 
country have access to some of the most sophisticated tools 
worldwide, but have restraints on their actions so that they 
cannot violate the privacy of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to support Bill C-3 so that we 
can proceed to create Canada's first national DNA data bank. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After listening to my hon. colleague's comments, we certainly 
understand her concerns and the concerns of others from the 
government and those civil libertarians who suggest that the 
taking of DNA is somehow a gross infringement on people's rights 
and has to be taken in a very narrow definition.  This is what 
Bill C-3 does.  That is the part we actually oppose.  We believe 
that the taking of DNA samples as defined in this bill is too 
restrictive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the larger public good.  That is what we are 
talking about and where a great deal of disagreement concerning 
this bill exists between our party and the government. The 
government feels that the taking of DNA should be restricted to 
very narrow circumstances, such as multiple murderers and people 
who have committed sexual offences.  In these cases DNA samples 
can only be extracted after the conviction has taken place. This 
does not help the police.  It does not help the victims groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We suggest that DNA samples be taken beforehand. Why?  It serves 
two purposes.  Number one is very important in that it helps to 
exonerate the innocent.  We have not heard much about this from 
the other side.  It is a double edged sword.  One would argue 
from the other side that this is restricting people's personal 
freedoms.  We would argue that there is a larger public good 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The larger public good refers to the protection of innocent 
people and the conviction of the guilty.  The only thing Bill C-3 
does in its current form is it helps to convict those individuals 
who have committed the most heinous of crimes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the bill is configured, it can act as a shield behind 
which the guilty can hide themselves.  It does little to protect 
the innocent. If we were more aggressive with this bill, if we 
were able to take DNA samples from people before they were 
convicted, then those DNA samples could be used to exonerate the 
innocent and convict the guilty. That is what we are trying to do 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this party are trying to put faith back into the justice 
system.  When we speak to Canadians, they have lost a lot of 
faith.  It is not that they have lost faith in the Canadian 
police departments and the RCMP. They have a lot of faith in the 
men and women who put their lives on the line every day to 
protect us and keep us safe.  It is in the process and the 
management of our justice system and the implementation of the 
laws of this land that the Canadian people are having less faith 
in all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 could be a strong bill.  Members from my party have put 
forth constructive suggestions, such as that the DNA be taken 
right from the word go, right from when a person is picked up and 
is suspected of having committed a crime, and that the breadth 
upon which the different types of offences that this can be 
applied to be extended beyond multiple murderers and multiple sex 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had we had this bill a few years ago and had it been 
appropriately applied, Clifford Olson would not have been able to 
kill the number of people he killed.  He committed 80-odd 
offences before he even murdered one person.  If this bill had 
been in place in the manner in which we would like, Clifford 
Olson would have been behind bars and a lot of people's lives 
would have been saved. A lot of families would not be enduring 
the pain and suffering that they endure to this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill needs a number of other amendments.  The data bank 
that exists today is far too limited.  The data bank should be 
formed in such a way that the information is kept a long time 
after the person is convicted.  That does not exist in Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information, if utilized, would enable the police to pick up 
somebody very quickly if their bodily fluids were found at the 
site of a crime, in which case again we would be preventing 
further crimes from occurring. The government somehow fails to 
see this.  Although we understand its concerns in dealing with 
civil liberties, we would argue that a higher good and the 
greater good is the protection of innocent civilians, including 
those who are falsely picked up for a crime they never committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a positive side to this bill in that it can be used to 
protect and also release the innocent.  We would not get cases 
such as the Guy-Paul Morin case, which has been such a tragedy 
for him and the Morin family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of other aspects with respect to Bill C-3 can be dealt 
with here.  I would ask that the government listen to the police 
departments who would like to see the DNA data bank go forth, as 
we would, but in a much stronger and effective fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to pursue the issue of crime prevention. 
The Minister of Justice to her credit recently implemented a 
crime prevention strategy dealing with kids from zero to six, I 
believe, in Edmonton.  This is a head start program.  I would 
strongly urge the government to implement our motion that was 
passed in May of this year calling for a national head start 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the great things that one can do, and the cabinet 
ministers can certainly take advantage of this in their position, 
is to take the leadership role that is desperately needed. 
Although the rights and responsibilities of various areas are 
divided up and parcelled off among three levels of government, 
the federal government has the unique opportunity to call 
together its provincial counterparts in a number of areas, put 
their minds together and come to the table to develop a 
comprehensive plan which people across the country would benefit 
from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those areas is in the justice area and is associated with 
Bill C-3.  It is the national head start program.  The Minister 
of Justice along with the Ministers of Health and HRD, can take a 
leadership role.  They can call together their provincial 
counterparts here in Ottawa or anywhere in this country and look 
at what is already on the table with respect to early detection 
and crime prevention strategies.  Keep what is good, throw out 
what is bad, use existing resources and deal with crime 
prevention.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This should not be done when a person is 13, 14 or 15 years of 
age when they may be suffering from conduct disorders, have run 
afoul of the law, have endured years of sexual abuse, violence or 
perhaps have been subjected to alcohol while in utero with 
resulting fetal alcohol effects.  It should be done before that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to have an effective crime prevention strategy, it has 
to start in the first eight years of life.  We know 
scientifically that in the first eight years of life the building 
blocks of a normal psyche are developed.  Events such as being 
exposed to sexual abuse, violence at home or improper nutrition 
damage the building blocks of a normal psyche and at adolescence 
it is very difficult for that child to engage appropriately with 
the environment.  Unfortunately many run afoul of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Programs such as the Moncton head start program, in which the 
member for Moncton has taken such a leadership role, the programs 
in Hawaii and the Perry Preschool Program in Michigan have 
clearly demonstrated that early intervention programs can be 
highly cost effective.  On balance these programs save about 
$30,000 per child.  They lower dependence on welfare and keep 
kids in school longer.  They have lowered teen pregnancy rates. 
They can have a dramatic effect at lowering child abuse.  The 
program in Hawaii reduced child abuse by 99% in a cost effective 
fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the fragmented nature of social programs in the country, 
the federal government has an enormous opportunity to work with 
its provincial counterparts to implement a provincially managed 
but shared funded national head start program. One message apart 
from what we have spoken about in Bill C-3 would be to implement 
the program using existing resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could do what was done in Hawaii.  It could use 
trained volunteers and the medical community starting before a 
woman becomes pregnant.  Trained volunteers could be used for the 
child at birth up to age four and the schools could be used when 
the child is between the ages of four and eight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government did that we would have a dramatic positive 
effect in decreasing youth crime and in improving the social 
welfare for the most underprivileged in the country.  It would 
save the taxpayer billions of dollars and provide a more secure 
and safe environment for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, in 
the last 10 days I think I have heard it all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I truly wonder if there is no depth to the rhetoric, the 
repetitive redundancy of the Reform Party members.  They told us 
on the one hand last week that it is not okay to ask people to 
register deadly firearms.  Today they tell us it is okay to take 
bodily fluids from a potentially innocent person.  This is from 
one end of the spectrum to the other. I am absolutely amazed. 
They cite time and time again examples from the U.S.  I cannot be 
any clearer on this.  This is not the United States.  It is 
Canada.  We do things differently here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am extremely proud to stand up and show my support for 
Bill C-3.  This is a good bill.  As we have heard in the House 
time and time again, DNA analysis cannot be compared to a 
fingerprint which involves only a minor intrusion on privacy or 
the removal of bodily fluid.  An argument that equates 
fingerprints with DNA is simply a flawed argument.  Fingerprints 
only reveal an impression of a person's extremities and allow 
that person's identity to be confirmed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA samples reveal far more.  A DNA sample is a part of a person 
and it contains that person's genetic blueprint.  Because of that 
important distinction, Bill C-3 ensures that DNA information is 
safeguarded and used only for the purposes of forensic DNA 
analysis.  In doing so it sets out very limited and controlled 
access to the data bank. It prohibits any improper use of 
information and limits access to only those directly involved in 
operation and maintenance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition in the House seems to think the police have 
automatic rights to search and seizure.  That has never been the 
case in Canada because Canadians place a high priority on a 
reasonable expectation of privacy, on security and dignity of the 
person, and on the right to be free from unnecessary state 
interference in those rights.  Taking samples automatically when 
a suspect is charged would be constitutionally indefensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only has the government taken the advice of those who have 
said that the legislation to create a national DNA data bank must 
not infringe upon our charter of rights.  We have also listened 
to those who have said that it is important that this legislation 
be put in place as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has seen introduction and reintroduction.  It has been 
the subject of thorough review by the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights, yet I hear my Reform colleagues talk 
about closure and time allocation.  They talk about limiting 
their right to offer constructive criticism to the bill, yet they 
spend 70% of their speeches talking about time allocation rather 
than actually talking about Bill C-3.  If they have something 
positive to add, why do they not add it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has been reviewed by some of Canada's most respected 
judges.  The opposition seems to be dismissing the validity of 
the intense scrutiny under which Bill C-3 has been developed.  We 
cannot lose sight of the fact of the benefits of Bill C-3 and the 
value it will bring as one of the most powerful investigative 
police tools known to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government and the police community have the same 
objective:  to provide Canadian law enforcement officials with 
practical and effective access to DNA technology to solve crimes 
and to protect the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national DNA bank will be an important tool to help police 
link a suspect with evidence left at a crime scene.  The ability 
to store and later retrieve DNA profiles will shorten 
investigations and help prevent further violence by repeat 
offenders.  This means better public safety for Canadians, 
something that quite obviously Reform is prepared to compromise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DNA data bank will let police quickly identify suspects 
where they have been unable to do so in the past.  They will be 
able to match profiles in the system to find repeat offenders no 
matter what jurisdiction they are in.  Other suspects could be 
eliminated more quickly and the information will be stored so 
that police have access to it when it is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the government is satisfied that Bill C-3 has been 
carefully drafted and on the basis of extensive consultation with 
various interest groups.  Contrary to what we have heard in the 
House, taking samples for the data bank at the time of conviction 
will not prevent police from doing their job.  Instead it will 
give police an effective investigative tool that will comply with 
our constitutional requirements as defined by the Supreme Court 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Bill C-3 is a much stronger bill as a result of the 
extensive consultation and debate that has taken place.  As it 
currently stands it is the government's view that Bill C-3 is 
fundamentally sound.  There is no question that the use of DNA 
evidence has been a significant breakthrough in the criminal 
justice system.  We must not forget that we are dealing with a 
powerful tool and one that must be safeguarded against potential 
abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of a data bank that can be upheld in the courts 
will go a very long way toward protecting Canadians from violent 
and repeat offenders, and that is what we are here to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also no question that Bill C-3 has been and will 
continue to be an important priority for the government.  Public 
safety is one of the government's top priorities.  We will stand 
behind that commitment 100%, unlike our Reform colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe all parties are motivated by the same goals:  to 
establish a national DNA data bank system that helps our law 
enforcement personnel protect the public.  The question is how do 
we get there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's position is prudent, responsible and ultimately 
the best one for Canadians.  It is a position that balances the 
need of law enforcement to protect the public safety, the 
interests of human rights and the democratic values of all 
Canadians, something time and time again my Reform colleagues 
seem to lose sight of.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal opinion of three former justices from three different 
provinces are entirely consistent with the opinion of the 
Department of Justice and legal opinions, including legal counsel 
for several provinces who testified before the standing 
committee.  The legal opinions underline the danger of including 
provisions in Bill C-3 which would not withstand a charter 
challenge.  To effectively implement a DNA data bank, we need to 
do it right, and that is what the government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is better to have a law that works than one that is certain 
to be struck down by the courts, which the Reform seems to have 
no regard for.  I am confident that Bill C-3 finds the 
appropriate balance and I support it.  I urge the members of the 
House to support Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enough of party propaganda, enough of arm twisting and using 
special interest groups.  Support it.  It is a good bill.  We can 
proceed and create one of our nation's most valuable policing 
investigative tools to date.  This is a good bill and I am proud 
to stand here today to speak to it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is certainly a pleasure to rise today to speak on 
behalf of my constituents of Battlefords—Lloydminster regarding 
Bill C-3, the DNA data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party continues to be firmly committed to restoring 
confidence in our justice system and providing Canadians with 
true security in their homes.  This means providing the law 
enforcement agencies with the latest technological tools to 
detect and apprehend criminals.  DNA identification is certainly 
this type of tool.  If used to its full potential, the DNA data 
bank could be the single most important development in fighting 
crime since fingerprinting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3, in its present form, denies police the quality tools 
they need to fight and solve crime.  At best Bill C-3 is a half 
measure aimed to placate Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA data banks are currently in use in the United States, Great 
Britain and New Zealand.  DNA forensic analyses have been 
instrumental in securing convictions in hundreds of cases in 
Canada and have helped in the release of wrongly convicted 
persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 in its current form gives law-abiding Canadians a false 
sense of security.  The Reform Party cannot support the bill in 
its current form because of that.  We do support the creation of 
a DNA data bank, but the current scope of the bill is much too 
limited.  It seems the government would rather protect the 
interests of criminals over those of law-abiding citizens, not an 
equitable trade-off I am sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cites finances as one of the reasons why it is 
not willing to expand the DNA data bank and allow for samples to 
be taken at the time of charge rather than conviction.  The 
Reform Party proposed that samples be taken at the time of charge 
and not analysed until conviction.  This would have satisfied the 
concern of the Canadian Police Association regarding offenders 
who are released on bail pending trial and constitute a flight 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total cost of the DNA data bank, we are told, would be in 
the $15 million to $18 million range.  We see Bill C-68 
implemented at a proposed cost of $85 million on the premise that 
it may save one life,  The costs have now escalated to two, 
three, four times that.  No one is sure.  Again in order to save 
one life we are wondering why the implementation of a DNA data 
bank, which has proven to save lives and convict criminals in the 
long run, would not be a good buy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike Bill C-68 costs can be recouped.  The conclusive nature 
of DNA evidence often results in substantial savings for police 
in their investigations and the courts since that investigation 
can be narrowed down and a trial simplified.  Therefore in the 
long term this is a cost effective tool and a great protection to 
society.  By analysing the DNA of all persons charged with 
violent offences we could have numerous samples in that data 
bank.  We should think of the added security this would mean to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are hundreds of unsolved assaults, rapes and homicides 
where DNA evidence has been left at the scene.  DNA 
identification now offers us an unparalleled opportunity to solve 
many of these cases.  They have a real opportunity to strengthen 
our hand-cuffed justice system and they refuse to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People's lives are at stake here as well as their quality of 
life living in safer neighbourhoods.  It is interesting to note 
that the taking of a blood sample in the case of a suspected 
impaired driver does not raise much concern.  In fact society 
applauds that policy.  Why is it different, then, in the case of 
DNA samples left at the scene of a crime?  We take blood samples 
for purposes of determining impairment.  There is no difference.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The invasion of privacy has already taken place.  The Criminal 
Code looks after that.  Is there a difference here?  I think not. 
The authority to take samples is already in the Criminal Code and 
overrules the privacy issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Police Association prepared and submitted a legal 
opinion to the justice committee concluding that there would be 
no constitutional concern about taking samples at the time of 
charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all want to fight and reduce crime and reduce the time it 
takes to solve a crime.  We have a tremendous backlog in our 
courts.  If the fear is over the data bank and the keeping of 
blood or fluid samples, we just have to look at the thousands of 
samples taken by doctors and nurses each day and kept in some 
sort of bank.  These bank files are not being exploited so why 
would a DNA data bank constitute any more of a risk? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is certainly a major and very important piece of 
legislation.  The government must justify to the Canadian Police 
Association and Canadian voters the reasons for invoking time 
allocation for the seventh time to ram through a work in 
progress.  Canadians deserve better from their elected officials. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to speak to Bill C-3 representing the constituents 
of Edmonton East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member earlier in the House compared data bank registering to 
tattooing during World War II.  I thought at that time it was an 
outrageous comparison.  How could this possibly be compared to 
something that evil done during the war?  More likely I would 
compare it to the simple registering we have with our social 
security numbers.  I think that would be a more apt comparison as 
a reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we need to wait for another Olson before the government gets 
serious and insists on a sample from all persons charged with 
indictable offences?  The legislation is based on the false idea 
that DNA is useful in investigating some offences, mainly sexual, 
but does not help others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that offenders like Clifford Olson commit both types 
of offences.  He was convicted of more than 80 offences before he 
killed his first known victim.  DNA, if taken on these previous 
charges, would have linked him to the first victim and led to his 
arrest.  None of the convictions were for charges that the 
legislation covers.  They were for theft, break and enter and 
armed robbery.  Police and victims groups favour making the 
legislation more inclusive, but the government does not listen to 
their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Samples should be retained in the same way fingerprints are kept 
on file, essentially forever.  Samples should be taken on charge 
just as with fingerprints.  Collections of samples should be the 
same for the same offences as for fingerprinting.  We should 
obtain DNA as routinely as we obtain fingerprints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We take blood samples in certain cases.  We utilize blood 
samples in the case of impaired driving and other charges.  We 
take breath samples for liquor offences.  Taking breath samples 
is a permanent record because the result of being over in the 
test will go on a permanent record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must make the best use of this tool but the Liberal bill is 
unduly restrictive.  It costs only $50 to $60 to get a sample 
into the database.  This is a drop in the bucket when compared to 
the costs, even the estimated costs, of what the gun registration 
program is expected to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obtaining DNA is not an onerous process and involves no real 
invasion of the privacy of the person.  It can come from saliva 
or from a single hair or a drop of blood.  DNA identification 
does not endanger privacy since the information is just a series 
of numbers and tells nothing about the person's health or mental 
capabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA can also exonerate a person suspected of a crime.  I think 
that point is one of the most important.  It can clear those who 
are falsely accused.  It can clear them quickly and clear the air 
forever.  It will absolutely clear the person of having something 
hanging over his head of which he has been accused and the 
thinking that he just may possibly be guilty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 15 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-284, an act to amend the Criminal Records Act and the 
Canadian Human Rights Act (offences against children), be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to stand here this evening and speak in 
the final hour of debate on the private member's bill put forward 
by my colleague from Calgary Centre.  It is of profound 
importance for the health and well-being of our most important 
resource in Canada, our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments at all levels often say that they recognize the 
importance of children's welfare for the future of the country, 
but they often have a strange way of showing it.  Our income tax 
structure encourages two income families and common law 
relationships, although there is overwhelming empirical evidence 
that both these situations are among the least desirable for the 
healthy development of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members of this House have probably bought into United 
Nations documents that are supposed to protect the rights of the 
child.  Because of manipulation by special interest groups, many 
subsidized by the Canadian taxpayer, these charters actually seem 
to undermine the ability of and the responsibility for parents to 
guide and nurture their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent news article the Secretary of State for Children and 
Youth said “We feel our activities are child centred.  Our main 
concern is what happens to children, and the issue of parents is 
very, very, I would say, controversial”.  If the concern really 
was for the child, then the well-being of parents and their 
families would be front and centre, not considered an annoyance 
by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term “child centred” also appears in education literature 
that was popular a few years ago.  The philosophy that letting 
kids decide what they wanted to learn, when they felt like 
learning it, was somehow going to lead to happier, well adjusted 
students.  The result, as we now know, is that a lack in 
direction and in an appreciation of the responsibilities that 
adults were supposed to provide them, many children felt no 
obligation to learn at all.  Many jurisdictions across Canada are 
retreating from the failed experiment of trying to turn innocent 
children into miniature adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not claiming that there is a direct connection, but the 
policy of absolving adults of their responsibilities to behave 
properly seems to be the other side of the coin.  We seem to have 
forgotten the social impact of giving individuals a free ride 
when it comes to the consequences of their actions.  We often 
seem so concerned about the rights of the convict that we 
completely ignore the loss of dignity, privacy and the enjoyment 
of life that these criminals visit upon their victims and 
families.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The administration of justice requires not only a presumption of 
innocence for the individual charged with a crime, but that any 
punishment that results from a rightful conviction must fit the 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a process in place for dealing with criminal activity 
that has to include mitigating circumstances.  We may stop a lot 
of thieves by ordering their hands to be cut off, but our society 
has decided that sort of punishment is too extreme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in mercy and we believe that people should get a 
chance to atone for their transgressions at a later date.  At one 
time these were a couple of elements among many in our justice 
system, but these days many Canadians feel that they have become 
the driving force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians feel that the balance has been upset and now the 
justice system assumes that criminals are always remorseful and 
will automatically respond to things like day parole and 
psychiatric counselling.  Far from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rightly or wrongly, the perception has been created that the 
justice system has been skewed to give every consideration to the 
criminal and little is being done to heal the wounds of the 
victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians have expressed the desire to see more done on the 
side of prevention.  They want more police officers on the 
street, more direct and immediate consequences for all criminal 
acts, more onus being placed on parents for the actions of 
minors, a greater emphasis on making criminals pay the full price 
for their crimes and less of a push to get them back on the 
street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While opposing sides may argue about the efficiency of 
incarcerating versus rehabilitating criminals, police are aware 
that a rash of property crimes, for example, usually points to 
the recent release of a criminal who favours that sort of action. 
It is a fact of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no end of statistics to show the tendency of various 
criminals to reoffend and these are often used by people to prove 
their pet theories about justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to get into a numbers game, nor do I want to argue 
whether criminals need more or less jail or whether one kind of 
punishment is more effective than another.  That is not what Bill 
C-284 is all about.  It is not about tormenting a particular type 
of criminal for the rest of their life or imposing more jail time 
on someone who has supposedly served their time and is now trying 
to make a life for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that Bill C-284 does target a particular kind of 
criminal and seeks to put at public disposal an item of personal 
information that our system has a method of keeping from the 
public under ordinary circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may interpret this as being unnecessarily intrusive, but 
this bill seeks to safeguard a particular kind of victim and is 
an attempt to bring balance to the system on that victim's 
behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that criminals have certain rights and that the 
criminals who have served time for their crimes may have earned a 
certain relief from further punishment.  However, the victims who 
we are concerned with here, like many victims who survived the 
violation against them, often serve a lifetime sentence 
themselves.  They carry those emotional scars for life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victims who this bill concerns itself with are usually 
helpless, vulnerable and find it difficult to comprehend or deal 
with what is done to them.  These victims are our children and 
our families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The perpetrators of this most hideous crime are known as 
pedophiles or sex offenders.  Despite what our deepest revulsion 
urges us to do to these people, we try to remember that we must 
have balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of this House should understand that Bill C-284 is 
not about the punishment of that individual based on suspicion or 
prejudice, it is about directing convicted criminals away from 
situations in which they have proven they cannot be trusted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not asking that pardoned sex offenders be barred from 
society, but that people in positions of responsibility over 
children be given the opportunity to discover the true history of 
the potential employees they are looking at hiring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does not call for the public broadcast of anyone's 
criminal history.  It merely allows for responsible parties to 
find out if an individual had ever been pardoned for a sexual 
offence, and then only if that individual actually applies for a 
job working with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider the words of Correctional Services Canada that 
there is evidence of a substantial increase in the risk for 
sexual re-offending for that group of offenders with a prior 
history, and when we discover that the National Parole Board does 
not even keep track of the more than 16,000 pardons it hands out 
by type of crime, then we can say that there is a very small 
price to pay in terms of curtailing the freedoms of this group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to close by saying that the solicitor general 
already has the legal authority to override a pardon if it is in 
the interest of the administration of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is only just that we work to prevent the tragedy of 
child victimization any way that we can, and this bill gives us 
one more tool to accomplish that end.  I urge everyone in this 
House to support the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to address a very important issue on behalf of the 
residents of Waterloo—Wellington.  It is obvious the hon. member 
for Calgary Centre has worked very hard to bring this matter to 
the attention of the House as a votable item.  His desire to 
improve the law, to redress the anomaly he perceives in the 
legislation and his suggestions for reform outlined in the bill 
before us today are examples of the impact private members can 
have in the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is doing the House and the government a service 
by identifying an area of the Criminal Records Act that affects 
the process of granting pardons and the subsequent treatment of 
both the pardoned records and the pardoned individual. He points 
out that the current provisions of the act could favour the 
pardoned individual to the possible detriment of society at 
large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It follows therefore that the proposals put forward by the hon. 
member may adversely affect Canadians with criminal records even 
after they have successfully turned their lives around and been 
given the benefit of a pardon.  Therefore by proposing solutions 
as he has done the member is contradicting the apparent intent of 
the legislation which at its inception was duly considered and 
approved by those who went before us and by the members of the 
other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we might all benefit from his industrious example and 
emulate his thoughtful efforts, we must carefully consider what 
he is saying.  He clearly believes that the reasoning applied in 
drafting our current Criminal Records Act and indeed the human 
rights act was somehow faulty.  This is a level of intervention 
we must all take seriously.  I find that my attention is 
immediately engaged when it becomes necessary to amend our human 
rights act to accomplish a legislative change that is otherwise 
put forward as a positive reform.  Most often we discuss issues 
in terms of generalities or as they say now at the macro level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in our jobs there can be insufficient time to respond 
fully to the concerns of individual constituents.  This is 
particularly problematic when the issue concerns those citizens 
who do not have experience in dealing with the mechanism of 
government and who feel powerless in the face of bureaucratic 
rules.  Also left out are those who do not have an organized or 
sophisticated proponent to speak loudly for their rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Calgary Centre has taken the time to be just 
such an advocate by responding to reports of harm done in a few 
individual cases.   I am not saying for a moment that harm has 
not befallen Canadians or that individual tragedies are 
unimportant.  They are.  In particular I recognize the level of 
concern we must bring to bear on the protection of young 
Canadians from sexual predators.  Nothing that may occupy our 
time in this place is more important than the safety of those 
least able to defend themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, difficulties may arise from the pursuit of 
solutions based on specific experiences however distressing and 
tragic.  I could offer as examples some of the most recent cases 
of deplorable, repeated and devastating child sexual abuse where 
the predators had no previous record to be found, pardoned or 
otherwise.  In others, the organizations responsible for the 
offenders' involvement in positions of trust had not only made no 
effort to investigate the offenders' backgrounds but also had 
actively shielded them from complaints and possibility of 
investigations. In light of these examples, it is possible that 
the proposal put forth through Bill C-284 may be either 
incomplete or somewhat misdirected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that more and more the role of the private member may 
be to respond to the needs and aspirations of individual 
citizens.  This is why I believe the effort of the member for 
Calgary Centre in identifying a possible source of inequity and 
harm and in proposing legislative solutions is so important.  By 
sponsoring the initiative before us today, my honourable 
colleague has fulfilled his most important obligation as a 
private member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What problem has my colleague identified and what solutions does 
he propose?  The purpose of Bill C-284 is to amend the Criminal 
Records Act to provide for the automatic revelation of the 
pardoned criminal records of offences relating to the sexual 
exploitation of children should the offender thereafter seek a 
position as a caregiver, coach or in another role in which he or 
she might have power and influence over young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-284 is limited in focus to a single primary objective. It 
seeks to address concerns over the current act which requires 
that the records of those who are granted a pardon be sealed and 
set aside to be revealed only in a very particular circumstance 
and only on the approval of the Solicitor General of Canada.  The 
proposal suggests a pardon that could be set aside in a much more 
casual way at the stroke of a bureaucratic pen. 
We must proceed very cautiously in this regard.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that regardless of the disposition of a 
criminal record reference to the particulars of a case may exist 
in various locations and be under the control of various 
authorities.  When the Criminal Records Act was passed the 
limited effect of pardons granted under its auspices was 
acknowledged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I am sure other hon. members will mention, only the release 
of federal records is directly constrained through the granting 
of a pardon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be local court and police records that persist and 
certainly the original media coverage and local knowledge of the 
crimes in question remain unimpeded except by the passage of 
time.  Such historical records are becoming more available 
through the search capabilities of our society's increasingly 
sophisticated electronic research tools.  The benefits of a 
pardon are limited but the hon. member nonetheless seeks today to 
remove even this relief from certain pardoned offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague's proposal for the revelation of records in a 
narrow and specific fashion may prove difficult to implement. 
I reiterate that there is no single exclusive record keeping 
system in the country.  Due to the federal nature of our 
political arrangements, records of criminal occurrences including 
records of arrest, trial, conviction and conditional release and 
supervision may exist in many places.  As mentioned, media 
reports are more likely to exist in cases that may be of such a 
serious and shocking nature that they may lend themselves to 
media sensationalization.  These are the records the hon. 
member seeks to remove from the protection of pardons under the 
Criminal Records Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further complication is that the pardoned record sought in the 
interest of a children's safety offence may form part of a series 
of charges and dispositions.  Should these more or less related 
convictions also come to light?  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the most significant flaw in the hon. member's bill is 
that it ignores that the Criminal Records Act already provides 
for disclosure and indeed revocation of pardoned records where 
necessary and appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 6 of the act the solicitor general may at any time 
disclose a pardoned record to any person where the minister is 
satisfied that it is desirable to do so in the interests of the 
administration of justice or for any purpose related to national 
or international safety or security.  This is a very broad test 
if not an onerous standard to meet.  Any person or organization 
may make an application for the unsealing and disclosure of an 
ex-offender's pardoned record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, under section 7.2 of the act a pardon will be 
automatically revoked if the person is ever again convicted of an 
indictable federal offence.  It does not end there. Under section 
6.2 of the act there can be limited disclosure of the existence 
of a pardoned record to police forces under specified 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention all of this because the bill before us today seeks to 
provide corrective solutions to a factor that may not be as 
problematic as it first appears.  Let us be clear that there are 
already a number of straightforward mechanisms for disclosing or 
revoking a pardoned record in appropriate circumstances.  Many 
people have advocated more substantial reform during the past 
decade.  Specific proposals have been developed which identify 
other provisions under the current act which would benefit from 
review and amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of some provincial governments have made their 
views known, as has the voluntary sector active in the criminal 
justice system.  These wider reforms are intended to address 
identified inconsistencies as well as important areas of possible 
improvement which have been put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the outcome of the member's work to date has been that the 
government is moving ahead to complete a review of outstanding 
issues focusing particularly on the areas to which my friend has 
drawn our attention, I suggest this has been an indication of the 
close collaboration between private members and the government. 
This would amount to proof of the effect that one member speaking 
for the rights of private citizens and constituents can have in 
changing the laws in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In wrapping up I return to a theme which I commented on earlier, 
the important role of private members' bills and the often 
unheralded accomplishments of those members who identify 
problems.  I thank the hon. member for bringing that to our 
attention.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the aim of Bill C-284 is to provide for a specific instance where 
public interest so requires for a limited disclosure of a record 
of conviction for an offender who has been pardoned where the 
conviction was for a sexual offence against a child.  Thus when 
a sexual offender applies for a position of trust with respect 
to a child or children, the employer could have access to the 
individual's criminal record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before looking at the individual clauses in detail, I think it 
would be a good idea to look at the clauses individually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 1 amends the preamble to the Criminal Records Act by 
providing for an exception whereby a criminal record may be 
disclosed where public interest so requires it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 2 amends section 6 of the Criminal Records Act by 
requiring—and this is very important—the minister to disclose 
information on the criminal history of a job applicant pardoned 
for a sexual offence against a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 3 amends the Canadian Human Rights Act by providing that 
a hiring policy based on a criminal history is not 
discriminatory where the job involves young children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of Bill C-284 is to protect society and especially 
children against potential repeat offenders. 
Crimes involving violence against young children are probably 
the most repugnant of all.  People find such acts both shocking 
and incomprehensible.  It is difficult to comprehend how an 
individual can sully youth in this manner and, more importantly, 
then want to put themselves in a position to repeat the offence 
with young people in a job involving the care of children or 
such like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary Centre is legitimately attacking this 
scourge.  He proposes that someone who has committed a sexual 
offence against a child be never permitted to obtain work that 
would put children in his care or put him in a position of 
authority over a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already examined this in the past.  Society has already 
looked as these problems, but there are perhaps loopholes in the 
law, and the hon. member's work is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our community recognizes that everyone has the right to be free 
from all forms of discrimination on the basis of social 
conditions. In this respect, section 2 of the Canadian Human 
Rights Act states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this act is to extend the laws in Canada to give 
effect—to the principle that every individual should have an 
equal opportunity with other individuals to make for himself or 
herself the life that he or she is able and wishes to have, 
consistent with his or her duties and obligations as a member of 
society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by 
discriminatory practices based on—conviction for an offence 
for which a pardon has been granted. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec charter of human rights and freedoms more 
specifically provides that individuals may not be discriminated 
against upon hiring on the basis of criminal background. 
Let me read you section 18.2 of the charter, which provides for 
an exception that is extremely important and interesting in 
relation to our debate today. It reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one may fire, refuse to hire or penalize a person in any 
other way in his or her job by reason solely of the fact that 
this person has been convicted of a criminal or penal offence— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What follows is very important. I read on: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—provided this offence has no relation to the job or a pardon was 
granted. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The phrase “provided this offence has no relation to the job” is 
extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, the right to non-discrimination is not an absolute 
right; in some cases, the lawmaker saw fit to include 
exceptions. For example, section 15 of the Canadian Human Rights 
Act states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a discriminatory practice if (<I>a</I>) any refusal, 
exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or 
preference in relation to any employment is established by an 
employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means an employer may refuse to employ an individual who 
does not meet the skill requirements without this being 
considered a discriminatory practice. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, recognition of the employee's right to not be 
penalized for having committed a criminal act under section 18.2 
of the Quebec charter does not prevent the employer from acting. 
In fact, where the alleged offence is related to the job, the 
employer may take appropriate measures to bypass or sanction an 
employee whose duties are directly linked to a criminal past. 
This applies to positions considered ones of trust by the 
public, such as those held by peace officers, teachers and even 
lawyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Criminal Records Act, rehabilitation and pardon are 
synonymous.  It is therefore to be expected that an individual 
who has been given a pardon may enjoy unrestricted freedom. 
Rehabilitation should ensure that such an individual is no 
longer a threat to public safety.  However, this is not always 
the case, even where rehabilitation has occurred.  Certain 
illnesses, as I shall mention, are hard to treat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, as responsible lawmakers, we must make sure that 
rehabilitation does not lead to recidivism.  For example, some 
experts say that pedophilia is incurable and that no 
psychological treatment can correct this deviance.  If this were 
true, all penal corrective measures would be ineffective.  Given 
that pedophiles are not in prison for life, it is reasonable to 
fear that on their release some form of recidivism is possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is probably because of this uncertainty, which young people 
could pay for, that the lawmaker established ways to supervise 
and monitor sexual criminals after their release. 
I think the government member covered this earlier, but 
unfortunately, this monitoring and supervision is not foolproof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 161 of the Criminal Code provides that the court may 
prevent a sexual offender from taking or keeping a job or 
volunteer work that would put him in a position of trust or 
authority with persons under 14 years of age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effectiveness of the process in section 161 of the Criminal 
Code is, however, contingent on the good faith of the offenders 
who want to comply with the court order.  One only has to visit 
the courthouse on days when the court is sitting to realize that 
many orders are breached.  Section 161 is a good section, it is 
a start, but it is too discretionary.  It puts the onus on the 
offender to declare certain things. 
Follow up is a problem, because follow-up is based on the good 
faith of the offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A question arises here: Are we to enable employers to anticipate 
the bad faith of certain offenders by allowing them to have 
access to offenders' records and to deny employment as a result? 
I think this is a question raised by the bill, and with all I 
have said, we must say yes to this question in order to protect 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, non-discrimination implies the right to not be 
subjected to an illegal distinction based on criminal offences 
for which one has been pardoned.  Non-discrimination is not, 
however, an absolute concept. 
Public safety may justify specific measures which take 
individuals' characteristics into consideration, their criminal 
background for instance, as well as giving consideration to 
those whom we wish to protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Bill C-284 introduced by the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre, those we wish to protect are children, and I 
wholly support that objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the safety of children necessitates unceasing vigilance 
and since the right to non-discrimination is not an absolute 
concept, in that the public interest could justify restriction 
of that right, a controlled disclosure of the records of sex 
offenders could be justified.  For this reason, I can tell the 
hon. member introducing this bill that the Bloc Quebecois is in 
favour of it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, it is with 
great interest that I take part in the debate on Bill C-284. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say from the outset that this bill should get the 
unanimous support of the House, on behalf of all the children in 
this country.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to praise the member for Calgary Centre for 
tabling such a pertinent piece of legislation.  Bill C-284 which 
proposes to amend the Criminal Records Act and the Canadian Human 
Rights Act with respect to sexual offences against children is 
important in the sense that it focuses on one of the highest 
priorities this assembly should have: the protection of children 
from abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, as parliamentarians we have the responsibility to fulfil 
the fundamental role of government to ensure the protection of 
our citizens.  This is especially true for the most innocent in 
society, our children. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of them, throughout the country, are counting on us to 
find the path that will safely lead them to the adult world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the innocence and the openness that are their trademarks, 
children successfully meet sports, recreational and educational 
challenges; they take part in community activities with 
enthusiasm and creativity; they fill us with joy and contentment 
and give meaning to the role of guide and protector that society 
has bestowed on us, today's adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not betray the trust that children put in us. Better 
still, we must earn that trust. 
To this end, it is imperative that we shield their efforts and 
their valuable contribution to the building of tomorrow's 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, children are all too often the victims of the 
trust and the authority they bestow upon us with such 
spontaneity and candour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a mother, I am always disturbed by statistics such as those 
telling us that one girl out of three is the victim of a sexual 
assault before reaching the age of 18, and that one out of every 
six boys suffers the same fate before the age of 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is even worse when you consider that we, in this country, 
have the means to deal with sex offenders who, as you know, have 
one of the highest recidivism rate among criminal offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These statistics suggest that we are sorely failing as 
legislators. 
The bill proposes a way to increase our vigilance by creating a 
fair balance between the right of offenders to return to 
society, and the right of our children to remain full members of 
our society and to be safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may wonder about the right to privacy. As the sponsor of 
this bill explained when he introduced his legislation in the 
House, the privacy commissioner has already ruled that the act 
he administers does not prevent the disclosure of personal 
information when this is done in the public interest. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is without a doubt in the public interest for children not to 
be exposed to those who have abused them in the past and who are 
likely to do so again in the future as the relevant statistics so

</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is targeted by this initiative? Any adult convicted of a 
sexual offence against a child who applies for a new job and 
could again be tempted to use a position of trust and authority 
to abuse, once too often, young victims placed under his care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the only purpose of this bill. The proposed changes are 
explicitly aimed at people applying for a position of trust and 
authority with respect to children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who among us has never had to put a loved one under the

</I></B></P><P align=left>This reputation, which is crucial to the survival of any 
organization dealing with children, can easily be tarnished by 
unscrupulous individuals who readily take advantage, to commit

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would enable those responsible for children to make 
fully informed decisions about whom they hire by having the 
capacity to identify and eventually keep out those who present 
more of a risk when in a position of trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  Bill C-284 does not propose that sex offences 
against children can never be pardoned.  It does not propose 
either that if one makes a mistake such as this it should be 
forever on one's criminal record.  What the bill proposes is that 
if one sexually abuses children the person could effectively be 
prevented from holding a position of care or authority over 
children again. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children must remain our absolute priority.  They are the ones 
that will have to deal throughout their entire lives with the 
often painful and sometimes disastrous effects of an experience 
they should have and could have been spared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Permit me, if you will, to point out the government's position 
in this regard: “The experiences of Canada's children, 
especially in the early years, influence their health, their 
well-being, and their ability to learn and adapt throughout their 
entire lives”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This quote from the speech from the throne brings us back to the 
point and encourages us to assume our responsibilities towards 
those who represent our nation's future. 
I therefore encourage the government to support this bill, which 
invites us to assume our responsibility as lawmakers and to help 
all victims according to the widely shared principle of 
prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, we will recall that the government made a 
commitment to provide an additional $850 million annually to 
improve the Canadian child tax benefit.  I congratulate it on 
this, although I maintain that the benefit should be indexed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, would it not be ironic to hear our leaders say, on 
one hand, that they want to invest in our children while, on the 
other, refusing to take the measures necessary to protect this 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet there is no point in hoping that the government can 
successfully build a true partnership with the private and 
volunteer sectors for the development of our children, if it 
does not first and foremost take the necessary steps to protect 
both the organizations in question and the young people they 
serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out, if I may, that this bill dovetails 
perfectly with the youth justice strategy announced by the 
Minister of Justice this past May. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, one of the recommendations she made was 
publication of the names of all young offenders convicted of 
serious sexual assault charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is being proposed here is merely an extension of that 
measure to adults, along with a framework for doing so.  People 
must not draw the conclusion that what is involved is a blanket 
disclosure. 
On the contrary, these amendments would apply only within the 
context of an offender's applying for a position of trust with 
respect to children.  As well, disclosure would not be done 
without his knowledge, because the bill stipulates that 
applicants are to be informed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I am calling on all members of this House for 
unconditional support of Bill C-284, hoping that we can place the 
interests of our children foremost, before any partisan 
differences.

<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is an honour to be able to speak in support of my 
colleague's bill, Bill C-284.  The member for Calgary Centre has 
done a lot of hard work on this very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many in society are concerned about the safety of our children. 
Many are concerned about ensuring that those responsible for 
children will not abuse their position of trust.  Many are 
concerned about how difficult it is for children's organizations 
to know whom it is they are hiring and to be sure they are not 
putting children at risk.  These are the concerns which Bill 
C-284 intends to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would enable those responsible for children to make 
fully informed decisions about whom they hire.  Bill C-284 will 
give parents with children and third party care the assurance 
that those responsible for looking after their children have not 
abused this position of authority in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-284 is specific in its intent to better protect our 
children from those who have been abusive toward them in the 
past.  Bill C-284 proposes to allow for the limited disclosure of 
an individual's criminal record if the individual has been 
convicted of a sexual offence against a child and later applies 
for a position of trust with respect to children. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1830"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a disclosure will include an individual's criminal record 
for a previous sexual offence against a child or children, even 
if one had served one's sentence and had later received a pardon 
which had removed the notice of conviction from the individual's 
criminal record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to note that this is a votable bill and that so many 
members are speaking in favour of this very important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly in the public interest for children not to be 
exposed to those who have abused children in the past and are 
more likely to do so again.  It is in the public interest for 
parents to have confidence in those who are caring for their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former teacher and child care worker I know the importance 
that working with children has and the position of trust 
individuals in those positions are entrusted with.  I emphasize 
that the limited disclosure, which I mentioned earlier, will only 
take effect when an individual applies for a position of trust 
with respect to a child or to children, a point which we hope the 
government takes note of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also support this bill for other reasons.  This bill does not 
propose that sex offences against children can never be pardoned. 
This bill does not propose if one makes a mistake such as that, 
it should be forever on one's record.  Rather, Bill C-284 
proposes that if one does sexually abuse children, that person 
should effectively be prevented from holding a position of 
authority with children again.  Those responsible for children 
will be able to see that a job applicant has abused such a 
position of trust in the past and thus be more judicious in their 
hiring practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is Bill C-284 necessary?  Essentially it sends a message 
that the protection of our children is of paramount importance. 
What more valuable resource do we have, as other members have 
alluded to earlier in this chamber, than our children?  Not only 
as individuals, as families, but as a society we must protect our 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that many statistics and reports have been made that show 
that individuals who have committed these types of offences are 
more likely to offend again.  I am not saying that all do, but 
research shows that individuals are more likely to offend again 
if they have committed these types of offences before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to mention the point of privacy which was 
brought forward by the government member.  In a May 1996 
discussion paper the Privacy Commissioner explained that the 
Privacy Act does not prevent the release of personal information 
if it is in the public interest to release such information.  In 
fact the act specifically permits the release of personal 
information in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1996 an RCMP protocol manual said that they defined 
public interest as evaluated on the basis of whether it is 
specific, current and probable, and where there is a possible 
invasion of privacy balanced against the public interest 
consideration may be given to who would be receiving the 
information and whether any controls can be placed on the further 
use or release of this information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit to members of this House that the disclosure 
provisions of Bill C-284 fall well within the accepted protocol 
for the release of personal information of which one's criminal 
record is a part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to close by noting a particular case that happened 
in the town I lived in when I was a youngster.  In fact, this 
story was brought to mind by an article written in the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> back in November of last year by an individual 
whose name is Abby Drover. For those who have suffered from 
sexual abuse, she characterized it as a life sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember this particular case because of its gruesomeness. I 
do not want to go into the details of it, but just say that those 
who would commit such offences against children violate not only 
our children but us as a whole and as a society.  We must put the 
emphasis on protecting our children because they are the most 
valuable resource that we have.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the father of four young children, I speak strongly in 
support of this bill.  I urge all members when we vote on this 
very important bill next week to give it their full support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I was wondering if it would be agreeable to the House 
that I might seek unanimous consent to conclude debate on this 
particular bill in the time remaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank all hon. members for the support that has been 
given to this bill.  It clearly demonstrates that we can work 
occasionally in a non-partisan way.  I also appreciate the 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just conclude on some of the points that were made here today 
and give a clarification on some key themes that were repeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada today almost 99% of those who apply for pardons 
actually get a pardon.  It is almost a case that if you want one, 
you get one.  Currently there is no information kept as to what 
kind of crimes are pardoned and which ones are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know for a fact that pedophiles have a high rate of 
recidivism and we put people at risk who are in their care, 
particularly children of course.  This is what the bill is trying 
to address which is what we have talked about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another key thing we have talked about is that this is in the 
public interest, so much so that it overrides the privacy 
concerns of the Privacy Commissioner and he has even said so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important bill to support.  Sometimes what happens with 
specific bills like this is that the government says it has to do 
a much more comprehensive review of the issue.  Things go on hold 
and we live with the status quo.  Sometimes when we go with the 
comprehensive review, the idea is that it is too comprehensive 
and something more specific is needed so nothing ever happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, if it can help one child being delivered from abuse 
and not having to experience the life sentence that abuse is, is 
worth us putting in place.  If we want to do a more comprehensive 
review on a go forward basis, I have no problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My appeal to the House is that even if this just stops the abuse 
of one child then is it not worth it to move this bill along and 
make the larger changes if need be in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Pursuant to an order 
made earlier today, the question is deemed put and the recorded 
division is deemed demanded and deferred until Tuesday, October 
6, 1998 at the expiry of the time provided for Government Orders.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, on June 2 I urged the transport minister to ask CN 
for a standstill on rail line abandonments until Justice Estey's 
report is received at year end.  This question was precipitated 
by CN's announced closing of the Imperial subdivision in my 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transport minister said he was counting on the goodwill of 
the railways not to abandon lines until the grain transportation 
review by Justice Willard Estey was complete.  So much for 
goodwill.  Both CN and now the CPR have announced their intention 
to close branch lines under the new process implemented with 
changes to the Canadian Transportation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This request seemed reasonable because every day in question 
period the government told us it was waiting for the MacKay 
report on the bank mergers.  Well why wait for MacKay but not 
Estey?  That is what I want to know and so do the farmers in 
Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record, the mandate of Justice Estey's review includes 
“ensuring that Canada has the world's most efficient, viable, 
and competitive grain handling and transportation system to meet 
the ongoing and long term expectations and demands of all 
customers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess there are a number of ways to do that but the way the 
Liberal government has approached the entire grain transportation 
system is not one of them.  Here is what the Liberals did 
instead:  They spent millions of taxpayers' dollars to upgrade 
CN's rail lines.  Then they privatized the CN.  Then CN announced 
it would abandon those lines for a salvage value of between 
$25,000 and $80,000 per mile, lines that will cost $1 million per 
mile to rebuild.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government also changed the Canadian Transportation 
Act to remove the federal transport minister's ability to say no 
to rail line abandonments.  Now when asked to support a 
standstill he can say “my hands are tied”.  It is a great 
trick. Houdini ties his own hands.  Just like Houdini, maybe the 
minister could untie them again by making amendments to the CTA, 
like the ones suggested by the Government of Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have time to go into the list today of what the 
government has proposed, but if there is no action from the 
Liberal side of the House, I will introduce a private members' 
bill to deal with those amendments myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A major cost associated with this policy of rail line 
abandonments is the increased wear and tear on Saskatchewan, 
Alberta and Manitoba highways.  Justice Estey during public 
consultation meetings in Saskatchewan said that roads are the 
biggest single issue facing this review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial transportation ministers agreed at their May 
meeting on a proposal for federal participation in a national 
highways program.  Canada is the only OECD country without one. 
They suggested that the federal government take the $300 million 
it already spends on various highway programs, add $500 million 
more from the debt reduction fuel tax, for a total of $800 
million which the provinces would then match.  This proposal was 
endorsed by the premiers.  As yet we do not know what happened to 
it from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of new developments have occurred.  A number of recent 
developments on the rail issue should be brought to the attention 
of the House today.  It concerns me because it makes it seem like 
the tail is wagging the dog a bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sask wheat pool announced the closure of 235 elevators in 
170 locations on September 15.  Then the CPR announced six branch 
line closures on September 17.  Then the transport minister told 
his provincial counterparts on September 25 that there can be no 
official moratorium on rail line abandonments.  But CN officials 
told me months ago which elevators the wheat pool would be 
closing.  The wheat pool told CN that it would not tell me as a 
member of parliament and it did not announce it for another four 
months publicly.  I wonder, did they tell the transport minister? 
Did they tell Justice Estey? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I believe that most participants in the grain 
transportation system have confidence in Justice Estey's work. 
That is why we should wait for the report.  I worry that the 
federal government is undermining his work though by letting the 
railways get away with announcing closures now and that the wheat 
pool is doing more or less the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the Minister of Transport to step up his efforts 
with the railways, consider amendments to the transportation act 
to give himself back some clout in this regard, and to keep 
fighting the Minister of Finance so that we can get a national 
highways program in our country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to respond to 
the matters raised by the hon. member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake 
Centre on June 9, 1998 regarding the discontinuance of operations 
over railway lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Estey, who is studying all aspects of the grain industry in 
western Canada, has been asked to recommend ways to ensure Canada 
has the world's most efficient, viable and competitive grain 
transportation and handling system to meet the ongoing and long 
term expectations of our customers.  Mr. Estey's recommendations 
will not affect the economics of the operation of any prairie 
branch lines.  Those lines with low or declining traffic owing to 
the closures of elevators by the grain companies will remain 
classified as uneconomical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the rail network rationalization process was designed 
to encourage commercial purchases of low traffic density lines. 
In the event that commercial transfers are not possible, it will 
allow for provincial and municipal governments to preserve these 
lines by purchasing them at net salvage value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rail network rationalization in Saskatchewan is to be driven by 
the decisions of the grain companies.  As grain companies divert 
grain to newer or expanded loading facilities, country elevators 
are closed and traffic disappears from these branch lines. The 
province of Saskatchewan has not exercised its right under the 
Canada Transportation Act to acquire these lines at net salvage 
value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would emphasize that the rail rationalization 
process has proven to be very successful.  At the urging of the 
Minister of Transportation, the railways have not proceeded with 
the discontinuance of lines if community groups have expressed 
interest in acquiring them.  For every line discontinued six 
lines have been transferred.  Therefore, the government does—

<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, last April, 
I asked a question about employment insurance eligibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem in the maritime regions with all the cuts in 
cod and crab fishing quotas and even a moratorium on cod 
fishing. We have talked several times, here in the House of 
Commons, about the hardship experienced by fish plant workers. 
For the past three years, the federal government has had to send 
money to the provinces for what is called the black hole, which 
stretches from February to May. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People wonder if they will have to live like that for the rest 
of their lives. Will fishers and fish plant workers have to 
experience that kind of hardship for the rest of their lives? 
Will all seasonal workers have to experience that kind of 
hardship for the rest of their lives? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who can live on $165 a week? Not the Minister of Finance, I can 
guarantee that. Neither the Minister of Finance nor the Prime 
Minister can live on $165 a week less taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, in fact, I asked the Prime Minister a question. In 
February 1993, when he was in opposition, he had taken the time 
to send a letter to a Canadian. 
In it, he said that when—he did not say if—he was elected in the 
fall, he would make sure that something was done about EI, as 
well as the GST and pay equity.  But what kind of Prime Minister 
do we have?  What are the Liberals now doing for Canadians? 
They are making find-sounding promises that they cannot keep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI fund belongs to workers.  It is not there to reduce 
taxes.  It belongs to workers and businesses.  Is it not their 
fund?  Morally, the government has no right to touch the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disgraceful what is happening in our country, how the 
government wants to grab the money in the EI fund so that it can 
proudly tell us how it has balanced the budget. It has balanced 
the budget and reduced the deficit to zero.  How has it done 
this?  On the backs of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not true that workers will put up with this.  It is no 
different from an insurance company.  Suppose that today you 
purchase an insurance policy for your car and that, ten years 
from now, you have an accident.  You have paid insurance for ten 
years, and when you go to collect, you are told:  Sorry, the 
insurance company has used the money for something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an insurance policy that belongs to workers.  It is time 
the Minister of Human Resources Development stopped letting the 
Minister of Finance push him around. 
He should stand up to him, do the job he is supposed to do, and 
assume his responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unacceptable.  Today the Prime Minister told me I did not 
know what I was talking about.  I would encourage the Prime 
Minister to pay a visit to my riding.  We would love to see him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let the Minister of Human Resources Development come to my

comments regarding access to EI, let me point out that nearly 80%

contrary to what the member continues to assert.

to help unemployed fishers and fish plant workers in Atlantic 
Canada.  Rather than trying to set up temporary programs for 
those affected by the collapse of the fishery we are trying to 
give workers the tools and programs they need to get on with 
their lives.  This summer we announced $730 million in fishery 
restructuring and adjustment measures for the Atlantic 
groundfishery.  These measures include early retirement, active 
employment measures and economic development.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have the transitional jobs fund which has been very 
beneficial to Canadians living in areas of high unemployment. The 
transitional jobs fund has already created over 31,000 jobs. In 
New Brunswick alone we helped create over 2,300 jobs for New 
Brunswickers and we expect to create more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply providing passive income support through regular EI 
benefits is not a sufficient response to the unemployment 
problem.  That is why we have worked with the provinces and 
territories to develop labour market arrangements tailored to 
local and regional needs.  These arrangements are aimed at 
providing real solutions for unemployed Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to remind the member that we are transferring $228 
million over three years to the Government of New Brunswick so 
that New Brunswickers can access programs that better respond to 
the particular labour market challenges of New Brunswick than was 
possible in the past.  In addition, many social assistance 
recipients will have access to these programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just a highlight of the steps we have taken to help 
Atlantic Canadians and Canadians in the member's own province, 
and I can assure the House that we will continue in our efforts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
last summer Canadians suffered from increased smog levels causing 
breathing problems, increased hospital admissions and premature 
deaths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Smog results from the burning of oil and coal creating nitrogen 
oxides and volatile organic compounds together with other 
substances which lead to the formation of ground level ozone 
which is then part of the smog phenomenon.  Scientists identify 
nitrogen oxides from the burning of fossil fuels not only because 
it forms smog but also because it is a component of acid rain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have here a domestic problem as well as an international one 
because at the Lennox plant in eastern Ontario, Ontario Hydro has 
not installed the equipment needed to reduce nitrogen oxide 
pollution.  In addition new United States pollution regulations 
designed to reduce smog could force Ontario Hydro to install 
emissions abatement equipment if it wants to export power to the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Selective catalytic reduction technology is available to reduce 
smog and Ontario Hydro should bite the bullet and install it. 
From an international perspective one must remember that in 1991 
Canada and the United States signed the air quality agreement 
whereby each country is responsible for the effects of air 
pollution it causes in the other country.  Canada and the United 
States also agreed to consult and deal with any existing 
transboundary air pollution problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore what we do in Canada to reduce nitrogen oxide is 
desirable not only to improve air quality and prevent health 
problems but also to make a case to the United States that it 
should do its part in reducing air pollution.  However the 
reverse also applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week we learned of a significant announcement by the United 
States Environmental Protection Agency that 22 eastern United 
States will be required to cut nitrogen emissions by 28% starting 
in the year 2003.  Such steps could lead to a substantial 
reduction in smog formation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will Canada reciprocate?  This is why I am asking the Minister 
of the Environment what progress has been made to ensure Ontario 
makes every effort to minimize air pollution through the 
reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately Ontario Hydro has apparently made the decision not 
to outfit an oil burning power plant in eastern Ontario with the 
next generation of pollution control devices which permit the 
reduction of nitrogen oxides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I did on March 30, I would like to inquire of the 
parliamentary secretary whether the Minister of the Environment 
will ask her Ontario counterpart to intervene with Ontario Hydro 
and see to it that its decision is reversed; that the nitrogen 
oxide reducing equipment is installed at the Lennox plant, thus 
permitting Canada to keep its international commitment; and to 
reciprocate to the United States Environmental Protection Agency 
initiative of issuing new tough standards for emission of 
nitrogen oxides aimed at reducing smog levels as reported today 
in a national newspaper.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
Environment, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
Davenport for raising this important issue which the Minister of 
the Environment has taken seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1997 the federal Minister of the Environment 
expressed her concerns regarding the Ontario Hydro situation in a 
letter to her provincial counterpart, Norm Sterling.  She 
encouraged Mr. Sterling to ensure that Ontario Hydro took full 
account of environmental issues as it developed its recovery 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House may know, Ontario has laid up some of its nuclear 
power plants and is using more of its fossil fuel fire power 
plants like the Lennox plant to ensure Ontario's energy demand is 
met.  The member will be pleased to know that Ontario Hydro has 
indicated that it plans to modify two of the units at Lennox so 
that they will operate on natural gas, which of course is a 
cleaner fuel than oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Mr. Sterling's response to the minister he ensured that they 
would look at the mitigation of the environmental impacts of 
Ontario Hydro's recovery plan and that it would be a major 
consideration for the all-party select committee on Ontario Hydro 
nuclear affairs formed by the provincial government as would the 
investigation of the economic and environmental viability of 
alternative energy supply options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Minister of the Environment is prepared to discuss this 
issue again with Mr. Sterling to further impress upon him the 
need to ensure that the electricity supplied by Ontario Hydro is 
generated in a manner that is both safe and environmentally sound 
and to encourage him to consider actions to further reduce air 
pollution in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Sterling's ministry has placed a cap on nitrogen oxides and 
sulphur dioxide emissions from Ontario Hydro facilities and the 
company has indicated that it will continue to meet those 
demands.  Minister Sterling is also aware that further reductions 
in those emissions will be necessary in order to address both 
domestic and transboundary acid rain and smog issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The motion to adjourn 
the House is now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m. pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.57 p.m.)
