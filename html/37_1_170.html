	Mr. Speaker, as you know, the House is reviewing a bill that aims to recognize the Canadien Horse as Canada's national horse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadien Horse is a perfect symbol for Canadians.  It is tough.  It has infinite stamina for its small size but is very gentle by nature.  Like all immigrants to this great land, throughout its long history in Canada it has adapted to Canadian conditions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that many of our colleagues have not had the opportunity to meet an example of this little iron breed of horse. I am pleased to announce that outside Centre Block this afternoon Canadien Horse carriage rides are being offered to all interested parliamentarians and their staff.  All are welcome to join me for “Canadiens on the Hill” and come out and see this fine breed of Canadian horse.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, for many years now Canada has been experiencing a growth in its economy and an increase in the number of working Canadians. Much of this success is a direct result of the significant work of the Canadian tourism industry and its 159,000 businesses.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently 99% of tourism businesses meet the Statistics Canada definition of a small or medium sized enterprise.  A full 97% of these are small companies. The Canadian tourism industry is a major pillar of the national economy, outperforming the general economy both in terms of revenue generated and employment growth over the past decade, an impressive record.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the tourism industry on its contribution to the Canadian economy and commend the tourism representatives present here in the House today for their dedication to the viability and sustainability of this dynamic industry.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, last week marked the Grands Prix du tourisme de la Montérégie, and the city of Rougemont in my riding of Shefford did very well for itself.  The Cidrerie Michel Jodoin and the Théâtre de Rougemont both came away with awards in the tourist attraction category.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cider makers, Cidrerie Michel Jodoin, added one more award to the many they have collected over the years for their work, their quality products and the touristic visibility they bring to the region.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Théâtre de Rougemont, they have brought us six years of entertainment with the top quality plays they stage, and their audiences are constantly growing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest a trip to our area along the cider route, with a visit to the Cidrerie to taste their delicious nectar, followed by one of the productions of the Théâtre de Rougemont.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, my sincere congratulations to the award winners.  I also wish them good luck in Hull on May 10, when they will be competing in the Grands Prix du tourisme for all of Quebec.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the tourism  industry has a significant impact on the Canadian economy. Last year tourism spending, despite having the worst quarterly decline in 15 years due to the tragic events of September 11, continued to grow from the previous year and totalled $54.6 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tourism industry employs more that 500,000 Canadians directly.  In fact, from a government perspective the tourism industry produces estimated revenues of almost $17 billion in taxes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Tourism Industry Association of Canada is hosting a Talking Tourism Symposium whereby tourism representatives from coast to coast to coast have come to Ottawa to discuss their dynamic industry.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grantham Lions Club has always accepted the challenge of turning concern for others into active assistance. Since its inception in 1952 hundreds of volunteer members of the Lions Club have given unselfishly of their time and talents to such worthwhile programs as Camp Trillium for children with cancer, Camp Dorset for dialysis patients, Lake Joseph Camp for the blind as well as numerous sports programs at the Grantham Lions Sports Park.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charter, which is displayed on the walls of our homes, schools and offices, sets out our rights and our freedoms, our responsibilities and our democracy.  It has contributed to defining who we Canadians are, and is the means for expressing our identity, our shared convictions and the values we hold dear.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day, parliament and the various legislative assemblies and courts fine tune its meaning and its effects on us as individuals and as members of society. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we mark these  20 years under the charter's protection, we need to pause a moment, reflect on its influence and celebrate together one of the greatest of Canadian achievements. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, on April 17, 1982, the Government of Canada patriated the Canadian Constitution unilaterally, excluding Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years later, the consequences of this patriation, and particularly Quebec's exclusion, are still being felt. What is worse is that ,based on  this constitution, Canada—mostly the Liberal government—has since disregarded  Quebec consensus on numerous occasions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has decided to build itself by ignoring the aspirations of the Quebec nation, by creating a strong central government and by refusing to recognize Quebec as a nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why no political party recognized in the National Assembly, no Quebec government, regardless of its political stripes, has wanted to sign this constitution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec is a nation. It respects other nations and their citizens. We would ask for the mutual respect of Canadians in turn.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, today marks a very significant anniversary.  Twenty years ago the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a piece of paper that enshrined our fundamental rights as Canadians, became a reality but not many Canadians realize the battle women and men of our nation had to fight in order to ensure equality for all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After one long week of negotiations with provincial leaders, women's organizations and Canadians, section 28 guaranteeing that rights and freedoms apply equally to male and female persons was included in the charter in 1982. It took three years, thousands of petitions from Canadian women and a group of female politicians who crossed party lines to ensure these rights were guaranteed to all Canadians regardless of their race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, mental or physical disability, or sex.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of this battle that the Government of Canada remains committed to the principles stated in the charter relating to equality for women.  Canadians should celebrate not only the inclusion of this section in the charter but also the power of all Canadians to make an impact on their nation in a very positive way.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, last night some 30 members of parliament from across party lines met with representatives of law enforcement.  The reason was to discuss the fallout from the recent B.C. Supreme Court decision which acquitted John Robin Sharpe of possession of child pornography.  The court found that Sharpe's writings of violent sexual fantasies involving children, although repugnant, did not counsel offences against children and had some artistic merit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants in the roundtable discussion were shown a very short but extremely graphic slide show of young children including infants being subjected to the most degrading acts of perversion imaginable.  Experts in the field maintained that writings such as Sharpe's, far from being artistic, actually contribute to the sexual abuse of children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us in this place anticipated this decision immediately following the initial ruling in January, 1999 and have fought since then for change.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice attended last night.  Perhaps he can convince his boss that Canada's children need our protection now.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, today marks a rather remarkable historic convergence.  It is the 54th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel and the 20th anniversary of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Each have generated their own revolutions:  the founding of the state of Israel as a revolutionary event in Jewish and human history with the reconstitution of the ancient Jewish people in their aboriginal homeland; and the Canadian charter of rights with its revolutionary impact on the promotion and protection of human rights in this country and its rayonnement internationally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, there is one generic right in the charter, article 7 which speaks of the right to life, liberty and security of the person, that also underpins the right of the Jewish people to self determination, a foundational international human right, and to individual and collective security. It underpins the corresponding right of the state of Israel to live within secure and recognized boundaries free from any threats or acts of force, at peace with her neighbours.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hebrew numerology the number 18, <i>chai</i>, means life.  The number 54, connoting the 54th anniversary of the state of Israel, means life as a threefold blessing. May the right to life, liberty and human security in charter law and international human rights law resonate as a blessing for Canada, Israel and peoples everywhere, and may the prayer for peace so urgently yearned for be realized.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, today we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Throughout this period of reflection around the 20th anniversary much will be said about former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and rightly so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he himself was not unwilling to acknowledge, one of his formative influences was Frank Scott, a McGill University law professor and one of the founding members of the CCF, the predecessor of the NDP. Indeed, a constitutional charter of rights was a continuing demand of the CCF and the NDP in the decades leading up to the adoption of the charter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who was in parliament 20 years ago and who was privy to much of the dialogue between the NDP and the Liberals at that time as the charter proceeded from draft to reality, I give credit to my leader at that time, Ed Broadbent, and to the NDP caucus of that parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political fact of the matter, as you may recall, Mr. Speaker,  was that Prime Minister Trudeau wanted our support and was prepared to make changes in his proposals to get that support and keep it. As I remember it, the NDP among other things wanted changes to the charter including stronger language with respect to equality of women and recognition of aboriginal rights. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, the charter is with us and the supreme court has delivered an interesting variety of judgments on it.  Canadians it seems are attached to the charter.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, while the federal government is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, for most Quebecers, April 17 is the sad anniversary of the unilateral patriation of the Canadian constitution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This patriation struck a blow to Quebec, weakening its rights and sapping the powers of its government and its National Assembly, and propelling it into a constitutional system to which it never agreed, nor will it ever agree.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government knows all this and that is why it is omitting any mention of the unilateral patriation of the Constitution without Quebec's consent during the celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the charter. This is a black mark on the history of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From two founding peoples, Canada became one Canadian nation, based on the principle of equality of the provinces, yet Quebec has never been a province like the others, but a nation with its own unique cultural, economic, and political  heritage.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With support from the DFAIT human security program, Alternatives, a Montreal based NGO, hosted a series of public, civil society and government consultations from April 6 to 9 in Montreal and Ottawa. The discussions engaged over 700 civil society and government representatives as well as interested members of the public on the difficult topic of the role played by energy politics in the conflict in Afghanistan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatives has been supporting peace building efforts in south Asia for over a decade by working with various civil society organizations in the region. This necessary dialogue has helped promote a better understanding of the social and political conditions in south and central Asia through a discussion of the risks and outcomes of the conflict in Afghanistan, particularly the issue of oil and economic development.  The participants welcomed new perspectives on how to deal with this many sided crisis, with the aim of assisting the people of Afghanistan in the complex task of reconstruction and peace building.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues critical to conflict and peace building in central Asia, such as the role energy politics play in conflict and how to preserve the independence and economic viability of the central Asian republics without triggering economic and political upheaval, are crucial to human security. By continuing to work together we can build lasting peace and stability in a volatile region. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate Alternatives on this successful conference.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the number of foundations is a matter of public record.  There are no secret bank accounts.  All  the foundations provide annual public reports that are available.  Every time one of the foundations makes a grant, it is a matter of public record.  The fact is  the whole operation of foundations is done in a very open and very transparent way.</p>

That is $5,000 per Canadian family that has been socked away out of sight of the auditor general, out of sight of parliament and out of sight of everybody but the Liberal Party.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, since the government was first elected our military has lost twice as many troops as it has brought in.  National defence has lost 31,500 troops and only gained 14,700.  That is a scary number.  That is a lot of engineers, a lot of pilots and a lot of doctors.  The problem will only get worse.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I had a hard time hearing all  the question. We have had a very solid recruitment program in the last year.  We have reached about 50% higher numbers than the year before, successfully recruiting some 10,000 people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are working on certain occupation groups, such as engineers, to  attract more of them into the system; more flexible terms of reference and various other means of attracting people that we need, as well as retention.  Our retention is working quite well because our attrition rate has substantially lowered some 20% in the last year.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, actually the truth speaks something else.  The auditor general has reported that these problems go all the way back to 1990. What has happened?  More Liberal cuts and Liberal mismanagement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is in the numbers, and the auditor general reported that even the recruiting centres were short of recruiters, which is probably why they missed their goal of 4,800 new soldiers by almost 25%. These shortages are a direct result of the government cuts in the mid-nineties and it will take 30 years to recover.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why has the minister not given the department the resources it needs to do the job?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the government has given the resources to the Canadian forces on recruitment. The auditor general went in last fall to do the audit before the recruitment year.  Since then we  have recruited a considerable number of people and have bettered the target in many different occupations.  We still have more to do in terms of engineers, doctors and various other trades.  We are working on those areas.</p>

The conclusion of that risk assessment was that there was no unreasonable risk to health. That is why no consumer alert was issued.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reassure the hon. member, as of 1995, a very strict level for lead in raisins has been established and there have been no raisins imported into this country since November 1995 that exceeded that established level. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to mark, with all hon. members, the 20th anniversary of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hours ago I had the pleasure of attending a special anniversary celebration of the charter, which featured a group of students who were not even born when the charter was proclaimed on April 17, 1982, who have never known a Canada without a charter, who have no memory of the great drama and debate that surrounded its creation.   For someone who was very much involved, as I was, that is  very hard to believe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I reflected on this, I was reminded of some words of the Right Hon. Pierre Elliott Trudeau.  In a speech in 1968 he said that law making is a way “to improve the lot  of flesh and blood human beings”.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For someone who has been celebrated more for his intellect and sophistication than for his common touch, these words showed a very down-to-earth understanding of his role as a legislator. And ours. Everything that we do in this place is about people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the almost 40 years that it has been my privilege to be a member of parliament, I can think of no act or legislation that has better served the interests of the Canadian people than the charter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charter is, first and foremost, a profoundly empowering document. It places the fundamental rights of all Canadians above governments. And it gives them the tools to protect their rights against the arbitrary acts of those governments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charter is also a profoundly Canadian document. It acknowledges that the freedom and equality of all citizens is the brick and mortar of our society. But it also affords protection to unique aspects of our national identity and story: English and French minority language communities; aboriginal peoples; multicultural communities; and the principle of sharing prosperity and opportunity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since being entrenched 20 years ago today, the charter has also become a Canadian trademark in the world. In countries who are moving toward principles of good governance, our experience in formulating the charter has given us much sought after expertise.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  benchmark of the charter as a document for the people is the way that the people of Canada have embraced and made use of it. Without their collective will to take ownership of the charter, to make it their own, it would surely have faded into obscurity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am indeed fortunate to have had a role in achieving this landmark in Canadian history.  We had, as the member from Winnipeg mentioned earlier in the House, a fabulous debate in the House that lasted for months and months.  It was approved by a very big majority of members of parliament including, and he was right, 74 out of 75 members  elected by Quebecers to this parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charter has worked because it is about  people.  As we celebrate its 20 years and look to the future let us continue, in the words of Pierre Trudeau, “--to put our faith, first and foremost, in the people of Canada who will breathe life into it”.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in recognition of the 20th anniversary of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Canadians can trace their origins to groups of refugees and immigrants who came to this country over the past hundreds of years.  Many came to escape religious and political persecution by oppressive authorities, including my own family who came to Canada to escape the injustices of the brutal Soviet regime of the 1920s. These experiences are not easily forgotten by the collective memory of their descendants.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even in Canada the descendants of these immigrants and refugees learned through bitter experience that such matters as education and religion were not always guaranteed.   Indeed aboriginal Canadians as well know that the government has sometimes hindered their development as equal partners in Canadian society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms has proven to be a powerful check on the power of government to unreasonably intrude on our rights and freedoms.  Canadians today give their overwhelming support to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  What Canadians from all regions say they like most of all about the charter are the aspects that promote unity, such as the protection of minority rights and the promotion of equality rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the charter is not a cure all for all the injustices of our society.  Canadians have often disagreed with some of the changes the charter has affected in our society as a result of certain court decisions.  These include, for example, the case of John Robin Sharpe and the court's conclusion that freedom of expression and artistic merit include the production of material glorifying the violent sexual exploitation of children by adults.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed the charter is not a perfect document.  Certain fundamental rights such as property rights are not entrenched in the charter.  As a result, under such legislation as the species at risk act the federal government would be able to legally expropriate land and resources from Canadians without full, just and timely compensation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the advent of the charter there is a growing reluctance on the part of politicians to advance legitimate political initiatives or substitute their political opinions for those of the courts.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the charter of rights does allow parliament to temporarily overrule the decisions of the courts by the use of the notwithstanding clause, the hesitation of politicians to use this clause arises out of a concern that to do so would be seen as a failure to respect the constitution.  As a result, politicians are simply accepting judgments that prefer the narrow interest of individuals even where these decisions are contrary to the interest of society as a whole. As parliamentarians we must continue to be watchful that the charter does not become a device that limits the effectiveness of democratic institutions including parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a nation we need to be mindful of the concern that in protecting our individual rights and freedoms we do not destroy our responsibility to nurture and protect broader societal values.  Our ability to live together in a civilized society demands our continued vigilance.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, for most Quebecers, April 17 is the sad anniversary of the unilateral patriation of the Canadian constitution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This patriation is the result of Canada's will to build itself based on its own values and its own priorities; Quebecers recognize the right of all nations to build themselves as they wish, while respecting  neighbouring nations. This approach is the basis for harmonious and constructive relations between nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, since 1982, Canada has been carrying out its nation building  while disregarding the hopes of the Quebec nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1982, no Quebec government, regardless of political stripe, has agreed to sign this constitution that was imposed on Quebec. This situation will not change. Quebec will not sign the 1982 constitution; no Quebec government  will ever deny  the existence of the Quebec nation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Canadians, Quebecers want to build their nation as they wish. On numerous occasions, they have tried to do this within the Canadian federation, but without success.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, far from benefiting from it, Quebec has had to cope with policies designed to create a strong central government. Quebec stands nothing to gain from this, because it is not a province like the others, it is a nation that wants it own tools for development, like any other nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec's historic refusal to sign the 1982 constitution reflects the bad feelings that the unilateral patriation of the constitution still stirs up today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these bad feelings, the federal government has deliberately chosen to emphasize the 20th anniversary of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the existence of a charter of rights is important in a democratic society. It is so important that Quebec passed a Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms back in 1975, well before Ottawa, seven years ahead of the federal government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But beyond the charter, the consequences of the unilateral patriation of the constitution are still being felt today, as Canada builds itself at an ever faster pace.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a legal framework that makes it virtually impossible to make constitutional changes that would give more powers to Quebec, the Canadian nation has, in recent years, disregarded Quebec consensus on political and social issues on numerous occasions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legal framework is supported by a philosophy that determines the political direction  taken by this government. This has created intense dissatisfaction among Quebecers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us mention, for example, the issue of young offenders. While Canadians want a punitive approach, Quebecers prefer a preventive approach. With millennium scholarships, Canadians wish to favour the elite, while Quebecers are more interested in accessibility. As for parental leave, Quebec would like to offer such leave to all young parents, because it recognizes that the work reality has changed for young people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Quebec, which wants to manage its social programs based on its own needs, did not want a social union that advocates the establishment of Canada-wide standards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is going increasingly further in its desire to give itself the tools to implement its policies, the federal government now has much greater financial leverage to support its vision of Canada's development, this thanks to the fiscal imbalance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these Canadian nation building policies do not take into account Quebec's aspirations and they isolate it. This situation does not benefit anyone, because Quebec's isolation has constantly undermined both the Quebec and Canadian societies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years after the unilateral patriation of the Canadian constitution, it has become obvious that Quebec's aspirations can no longer be fulfilled within Canada. Everyone can see that attempts to correct the situation, including the Meech Lake accord, have failed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, regardless of what the Prime Minister may say, history shows that the presence of a federalist or sovereignist government in Quebec City does not change anything about the fact that Quebecers are no longer considered as a founding nation by Canada. Rather, they are seen as belonging to a province like any other, a province that can be ignored, if necessary.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the government proposes to mark the 20th anniversary of the charter of rights. I propose that we also mark the 20th anniversary of the unilateral patriation of the Canadian constitution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must do so, because Quebecers still remember April 17, 1982, as the time in history when Canadians chose to give themselves a country that resembles them. Canadians have the right to do so. I hope, and I am working to that end with my Bloc Quebecois colleagues, that some day Quebecers will be able to do the same. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, today we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  The charter, added to our constitution when the British North America Act was patriated from Britain in 1982, is an essential tool for the protection of the individual against an unjust government and the protection of minorities against an unjust majority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout this period of reflection around the 20th anniversary of the charter, much will be said about former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and rightly so. But as Trudeau himself was not unwilling to acknowledge, one of his formative influences was Frank Scott,  McGill University law professor, poet, social activist and one of the founding members of the CCF, the predecessor party to the NDP. Frank Scott fought throughout his academic and political career for the rights of individuals and minorities and was a strong advocate for a charter of rights.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed a constitutional charter of rights was a continuing demand of the CCF and the NDP in the decades leading up to the adoption of the charter.  A  charter entrenched in the constitution was correctly seen to be a huge qualitative advance over the largely symbolic bill of rights adopted by parliament under Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, although credit is due to Mr. Diefenbaker for helping the idea along.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who was in parliament 20 years ago and who was privy to much of the dialogue between my party, the NDP, and the Liberal government of the day as the charter proceeded from draft to reality, I want to give credit to my leader at that time, Ed Broadbent, and to the NDP caucus of that parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you may recall, Mr. Speaker, and as the Prime Minister may recall, the political fact of the matter was that Prime Minister Trudeau wanted NDP support and was prepared to make changes in his constitutional proposals to get that support and to keep it.  As I remember it, the NDP among other things wanted changes to the charter, including stronger language with respect to the equality of women and a recognition of aboriginal rights.  Both of these were achieved, although the language on aboriginal rights was watered down during the final negotiations with the premiers.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the charter itself was changed at the last moment with the adoption of the notwithstanding clause.  Debate continues to this day about that clause, whether it is an unacceptable violation of the charter ideal or an appropriate parliamentary check on judicial power.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, the charter is with us and the supreme court has delivered an interesting variety of judgments based on it.  Canadians it seems are attached to the charter, even though they may not like some of the rulings based on it.  They see it for what it was intended to be: a friend of the powerless, of minority rights, of  equality, of the rule of law, of democracy, of mobility rights and of fundamental freedoms. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who worry about the erosion of parliament's power by the courts would be better off protecting the democratic power of parliament from the undemocratic nature of various trade agreements.  At least the supreme court is a Canadian institution interpreting Canadian law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 20th anniversary of the charter is certainly worth celebrating and the NDP joins with others in doing so.  We also look forward to the day when we will have something like a charter of social, economic and environmental responsibilities for the guidance of business, government and citizens, so that not only rights and freedoms might prevail, but also social justice and sustainability.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, let me begin by acknowledging the central role of the current Prime Minister in achieving the adoption of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  It is fair to say that no other minister, including the late Mr. Trudeau, played a more vigorous role.</p>


	<A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1525)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appropriate that the Prime Minister, in turn, has acknowledged the impact of parliament on the charter—not just in the extensive hearings and debate, which he mentioned, but in forcing upon the government amendments respecting the equality of men and women, and aboriginal rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manner in which the patriation and other constitutional changes, including the charter,  were achieved, was profoundly divisive. Je me souviens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supreme court found that the government broke the constitutional conventions of the country. The imposition of those changes fuelled the sentiment of independence in Quebec. That, too, is part of the legacy of April 17.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charter was a landmark in our law.  For many Canadians it is  part of the definition of our country.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to remember that the principles of the charter run much deeper than the law passed in 1982.  However imperfectly we have achieved the goal, Canada is a society that has always aimed to respect both the rights of individuals and the reality of our communities. They are unquestionably part of the promise and the aspiration that drew people here from around the world in search of freedom and respect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charter reflects that tradition, as did Mr. Diefenbaker's bill of rights before it.  The test for us today is to step beyond celebrating anniversaries and ensure that respect for the defining values of Canadian democracy is reflected in our actions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should address the tension between the role of parliament in passing laws and the role of the courts in interpreting the charter. The most recent instance is the Sharpe decision in British Columbia.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to do that, as we have proposed, is to require parliament, before it passes legislation, to receive independent legal advice on the impact of the charter on that legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reform would be to provide that, if a law is struck down by the courts, it should be referred immediately to a parliamentary committee that would recommend what action, if any, parliament should take.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most significant change in a time when unquestionably the power of the courts is increasing would be to also increase the power of parliament to act independently of the government and to hold the government accountable here in this place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rights guaranteed by the charter itself could also be extended to protect the right to privacy and to protect the right to property.  These are issues that fell by the wayside in 1982.  Parliament should consider them unfinished business.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These would not be easy changes, but neither was it easy to introduce the charter or to amend and improve it 20 years ago. Governments can initiate as well as celebrate.  The best way to commemorate the rights and freedoms of Canadians would be to extend them.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,I move that the third report of the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs, presented to the House on Wednesday, November 7, 2001, be concurred in.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a great day to have this motion concurred in because   it would seem that the Americans have announced  a continental defence plan without the knowledge of the Canadian government.  Canada was not mentioned at all in any of their releases and yet      mention was made   in one of their release    about how they were dealing with the Russians now and one of their generals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals say that they know a little about it and  that they have been talking about it but it is quite obvious they do not know what the Americans are planning and they do not know what is going on.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence report being tabled today is  the November 2001 report of the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs.  The report was produced by the committee in advance of the December federal budget with a view to influencing government policy in the budget.  The majority report had the support of every Liberal member of the committee, every NDP member, every Tory member and every member of the Bloc Quebecois.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance issued a minority report in an effort to make the recommendations stronger.  The reports states:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue is the treatment of parliament:  </p>

<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The report was drafted in secret by a committee of officials working under the direction of the Chairman. The first opposition members learned of the report’s existence was when a Committee meeting was called for November 5 to discuss a report none of them had even heard was being drafted. Committee members were not permitted to see the report until 7 pm on the evening of November 5. They were then given less than an hour to read the report and agree or disagree with specific clauses and recommendations. No consultations were permitted with respective caucuses and members of the committee were told that whether they supported the recommendations or not, the report would be immediately adopted and referred to the House of Commons finance committee. It was simply impossible for the official opposition to unreservedly endorse the majority report in the time that we were given.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This whole process of being given a few hours notice, being called   in the evening to read the report and endorse it is so unparliamentary but not unusual of this government that has become extremely arrogant.  Its arrogance is beyond anything I have witnessed in my 30 years in politics.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence policy of Canada exists to protect the security of all Canadians.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1535"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1535)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest possible effort must be made to ensure that defence policy reflects the consensus of parties in the House of Commons.  This must include adequate consultation between all political parties, as well as an opportunity for real discussion and debate. Only in this way can we ensure that consistent and credible policies will be adopted which reflect and real and long term national consensus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using parliament simply to rubber stamp decisions that have already been made should not be acceptable in this time of crisis that we have had over the last few months. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can certainly tell by the rubber stamping ideals of the government why the auditor general has issued two reports in a row that are extremely critical not only in areas of defence but in other areas of this government. Too many things are done without proper investigation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forget the exact amount but I think    about $174 million was invested in a satellite system  that never  came out of the box.  For the average Canadian it is unbelievable to think about $174 million.  When one says it quickly it does not sound like much money but it is a tremendous amount of money.  The minister had the nerve to stand in the House yesterday and say that the government brought in another system temporarily which  worked out to be better so it never had to use the $174 million system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine how the soldier in Afghanistan feels when he eventually reads a copy of <i>Hansard</i> or is lucky enough to be sitting next to a satellite dish in the evening watching question period and sees the minister who is in charge of our forces stand up and make an excuse like that when soldiers cannot even get a porta-potty delivered to their army base. It will be even worse when that soldier  hears that the defence department bought the government new jets costing $101 million when the military could not even get  new helicopters.  These new jets have nice toilets with gold faucets and soldiers cannot even get a porta-potty.  This government is arrogant.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need is a clear and specific commitment to  increased defence spending.  It is not only my party that has been asking for that but the auditor general,  someone every Canadian and every member respects as an officer of the House and who reports  to parliament, said yesterday that it could take 30 years for the military to recover. That is just too long.  It is too long for our children, our grandchildren and for the security of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we are being ignored by our American friends to the south. It is shameful to me to see ministers stand up and talk about Canadian sovereignty and say that they will  do their thing.  They forget that 80% of the trade in this country is done with our American friends across the border. They should be our friends not just  in trade but in defence and how we secure our borders in North America. However they are not calling on us because this government has chosen to ignore them. I am sure President Bush remembers the comments our Prime Minister made about his father when he was the leader of the opposition here in Canada, shameful comments about not wanting to deal with the Americans. Now we will  have to live with those comments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority report makes important references to the serious underfunding of the Canadian forces.  This reflects what witnesses repeatedly told us about the steady erosion of capability due to consistently scarce resources.  Even so, the majority report makes no specific recommendation with regard to increasing defence spending.  Instead it alludes to the $750 million to $1.2 billion annual shortfall in the operations and maintenance budget described by several witnesses and an additional $5 billion to $6 billion deficit in the equipment budget noted by the auditor general, without actually recommending any specific increase in spending.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,   I could probably use that 24 minutes very well to inform the Canadian people of the weaknesses of the defence system in Canada.  I hope  some of the people who sit in your chair over the afternoon will be enlightened by some of the great work that has been done by the research people in my party  and my staff.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the necessary resources are provided, the Canadian military commitment to the war against terrorism will not be sustainable.  It may not be any way beyond the next rotation since the shortfalls in both the O and M as well as the equipment budgets have been clearly spelled out.  The need for a minimum and immediate $2 billion increase in the budget based on the Department of National Defence should have been made clear.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been made clear by the auditor general who said that we need another $2 billion in the military.  It has been made clear by the official opposition in the House that we need another $2 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed even  this modest increase may now be inadequate since representatives of the Conference of Defence Associations have informed the committee that at least $1 billion in additional money should be added to the defence budget based in each of the next five years.  When we listened to the auditor general's report today, it talked about 30 years if we do not come up with the proper funding for our military. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisis confronting the Canadian forces is now so serious that we can no longer expect that half measures will suffice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us address the issue of demilitarization.  On May 8, 2001, one of Canada's foremost soldiers, General Lewis MacKenzie, told the standing committee:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--if I were an enemy force commander, I would much prefer to fight the Canadian army of today than the Canadian army of 10 years ago...I have no doubt that the individual soldiers are up to the task in spite of declining standards in physical fitness and discipline at the alter of individual rights and political correctness...If [the Gulf War] happened today we couldn’t send a brigade. It doesn’t exist...You can’t just throw a few bits and pieces of new high-tech equipment together and say ‘We’re more operationally capable’. Fighting, as outlined in your own direction for this Committee, at the combat level requires more than just a day’s worth of equipment. There has to be some sustainability </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a scathing indictment of the consequences of political interference in the Canadian forces.  General MacKenzie is well respected.  He is a great Canadian.  He does not make statements like this lightly and we should listen to him.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee heard from numerous witnesses who addressed the steady erosion of training standards and the resulting collapse in the esprit de corps and morale in the Canadian forces.  Some have referred to this as a demilitarization of the Canadian forces from within, yet apart from one big reference to political correctness, this issue is not seriously addressed in the majority report.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the crisis that we now face, we simply cannot tolerate unjustified political interference in the military which is gradually lowering our combat effectiveness. Indeed, one of the principal reasons that we now have an inadequate ability to respond rapidly and effectively to emerging threats is that crass politics resulted in the disbanding of the airborne regiment in 1995.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee has responded by recommending substantial enhancements in the capability of   JTF2.  The political conditions that led to the loss of this capability are ignored in the majority report.  If they are not addressed, politicalization of the armed forces will remain a problem and our forces may well be unable to rebuild their cohesion and effectiveness.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion of part of that majority report was that the present crisis demands a resolute and united response from parliament.  The majority report represents a step in the right direction but if we are to effectively rebuild our national defence we must be prepared to go still further.  This requires both open and honest discussion as well forthrightly addressing all relevant issues, no matter how politically painful they may be.</p>


	<A NAME="T1545"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1545)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance will be seeking to do just that as we work toward a full operational readiness report early in the new year.  We know that the Canadian people will demand no less. This is the substance of what we said in the minority report.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the government's response to our minority report and to the unanimous recommendation of every other opposition and government member in the majority report?  The reaction was to ignore what it had been told by the parliamentarians on both sides of the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The December budget was totally inadequate to address the crisis of the Canadian forces.  Again, I keep on repeating, we only have to look at the report of  the auditor general of yesterday, and the one previous.  They make these points as well,  if not stronger than the opposition because at least she has the chance to review the books and look into the details which opposition does not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander of the army, General Mike Jeffery, told the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs a few months later that the December budget fell short of the expectation of the Canadian forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would anyone like to be the person in charge of those forces, fighting in so many locations and peacekeeping in other locations and our soldiers, the brave Canadian men and women working for us, having to listen to their boss being told by the political heads that no, there is no money for them, but that they have money for $101 million for jets for cabinet ministers to fly around in?  They can put a $174 million satellite dish in a warehouse because the replacement they bought worked so well they did not need the other one. This goes on and on.  I will mention a few more of these later as I go along. It has to be pretty frustrating to be a soldier in this country with a government that so ignores the military.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money provided is barely enough to keep the forces on life-support. The auditor general reported in December that the forces still faces an annual deficit of $1.3 billion.  There are further shortfalls in the equipment budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is at war, yet the government is ignoring the needs of the Canadian forces.  It prefers to rely on the Americans when it is convenient.  As a result, Canada's international reputation continues to slip.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has no money to meet our military needs, but it has that $101 million which it looted from the defence budget to pay for two new Challenger aircraft to fly the Prime Minister and cabinet ministers all around this country and on vacations. This project, approved in only 10 days, is an absolute disgrace.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military itself said there was no need to replace the existing Challenger aircraft.  That is not the opposition which takes that position.  That is the military personnel, the people who fly these airplanes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However it took 10 short days. In this place we cannot get things through in 10 years, positive things that need to happen in this parliament do not get through that quickly. However, when it comes to the comfort of the people who sit on the government side, things can happen very quickly.  I remember a few short years ago, when they were in opposition, all the hues and cries about the Taj Mahals and the Guccis in the closet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our military men and women know that they have to fly around in Hercules transport planes that are more than 35 years old.  They have to fly in Sea King helicopters that are nearly 40 years old, so old they require 40 hours of maintenance for every hour they spend in the air.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, do members know how long the project office for the Sea King replacement has been open?  It opened in 1981.  Yet the Challenger decision was made in 10 days.  That is an absolute disgrace.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Twenty years to ten days.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Reynolds:</b> One of my colleagues says 20 years  and the military still has not got what it wants, but in 10 days the government got those jets. The management of defence policy is obviously a mess.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do we go from here?  I want to outline what the Canadian Alliance wants to see included in the final operational readiness report that will be produced by the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs next month.  I want to reference the submission made by our senior defence critic, the hon. member for Lakeland, to the defence committee. He made some great suggestions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has suggested that the following recommendations be made by the standing committee on national defence and they are. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the committee should condemn the government for its mismanagement and neglect of Canada's national defence.  Why?  The December budget and the government's responses about the committee's interim report in November and last year's report on procurement are a slap in the face to every committee and Canadian forces member.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee must recommend a minimum increase to the defence budget of $2.1 billion per year  to address the critical shortfalls identified in the operations and equipment budgets and even more, to rebuild our military.  Why is that necessary?  It is necessary because the committee's majority report released earlier this year alluded to the  $750 million to $1.2 billion annual shortfall in the operations and maintenance budget described by several witnesses but without actually recommending any specific increase in spending.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be clear in what we are recommending.  Vague references to increases are not enough.  The latest auditor general's report should be enough to let us know that.  Promises are not good enough. We have to get behind our military.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defence spending totalled $9.7 billion, which is $1.6 billion or 14% less than the $11.3 billion in the 1993 budget.  This is not my figure.  It comes right out of public accounts.  Yet we have heard the minister I do not know how many times in the House talk about what the government puts into the military, how that is improving, how things are just great.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us just go back to 1993.  Members of the House were probably making about $45,000 a year.  We now make $135,000 a year.  Yet in defence, one of the most important elements of our country, especially since the terrorism activity, we have a budget that is 14% less than it was in 1993 or $1.6 billion less.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we blame the soldiers in our military when they say that we look after ourselves first?  Not at all. We do not ask ourselves to fly in 40 year old airplanes or 40 year old helicopters.  We take our 16 year old Challengers and upgrade them with brand new ones with all the luxuries.  That is shameful.  Every member of the House has to be ashamed, even though we do not have a say in what the government has done. I have talked to many members in the military and they are not very happy about how the government is looking after them.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence budget would have to increase to $12.6 billion just to bring inflation adjusted defence spending up to the 1993 level. That is a major increase.  We might say, where is the money going to come from.  If we look at the reports of the auditor general, she has about $16 billion in the last two in waste.  I am sure we can find that money and make sure that in the future our American friends will realize we are serious about what we are spending on defence and serious about working with them in a North American secure perimeter.  However  it is a shame that now they make announcements without even talking to us, without even being side by side to say that we are working together.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the necessary resources are provided, the Canadian military commitment to the war against terrorism will not be sustainable. It may not be anyway beyond the next rotation.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is entirely justified on the basis of what the auditor general has told parliament.  These are not my figures. They are the auditor general's figures.  The auditor general said in her 2001 report that the Canadian forces needed a minimum of $1.3 billion added to the budget yearly just to make up for the current shortfalls and that  to meet equipment replacement requirements over the next five years, the capital budget alone would actually have to be doubled in that period, from $6.5 billion to $11 billion or $11.9 billion per year.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must replace this shortfall immediately  to maintain the military at its current levels and replace the additional equipment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, $1 billion per year must be added to the budget base of the Department of National Defence to improve and strengthen the military.  In fact the Liberal dominated Senate defence committee has actually called for a $4 billion increase in defence spending.  We agree that this is the direction in which we must go, and we do not often agree with the Senate about too many things. Those independent senators are as frustrated as the opposition is in Canada about what the government is doing with defence spending.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals claim that they have already increased the defence budget. We hear this continually from the Minister of National Defence. What is the real truth? The truth is that the Liberal budget is at least $1 billion per year short of what is needed. In the December budget the Liberals announced $1.2 billion for the DND budget, but only $500 million of that is allocated to our military spending over the next five years. Even if it were a genuine increase, it is well short of the $1.3 billion minimum that the  auditor general's 2001 report stated was required just to maintain the Canadian forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality the majority of December's  budget has nothing to do with actual military spending. In fact more and more non-military spending is being applied to the defence budget. For context, keep in mind that the government has not significantly increased defence spending by adding $1.2 billion over five years, but in fact is spending most of it in the first two years on Afghanistan's Operation Apollo, for example.  By spending nothing at all in the following years,   the government will do nothing to stem the long term decline of the Canadian Armed Forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us compare what Canada is doing in national defence to what our allies are doing. The consequence of drastic Liberal military cutbacks is that Canada now spends half the NATO average of 2.1% of GDP. This points to the need to add at least $2 billion immediately to the budget base of DND, or $10 billion over five years, and to provide additional temporary funding to support deployments necessary to help fight the war on terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is embarrassing to think that  with all the benefits  we have in Canada,  the great resources, the great spirit of Canadians, the support that we gave this world in the first and second world wars, that our military is dwindling like this. To see that we are spending less than half of what our NATO partners spend on defence, is shameful. The government should be embarrassed, but it is not doing anything about it so I can only assume that it is not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance has long called on the Liberals to add at least $2 billion per year immediately to the budget base of national defence or $10 billion over five years. Additional money is also required to support our deployments to fight the war on terror. Such increases however, would just be enough to stop the erosion in military capability. Canada must increase funding from the current level of 1.2% of GDP to the NATO average, which is currently 2.1% of GDP, as suggested by the Senate defence report.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisis confronting the Canadian forces is now so serious that we can no longer expect that half measures will suffice. Yet I do not see any action on the other side to start solving this problem. We see the waste and the arrogance, but no assistance for our military. </p>


	<A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1600)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else will the Canadian Alliance be recommending? We have said that the joint task force or JTF2 commandos who are doing a superb job should be retained as an elite, relatively small force. JTF2 should not be expanded past 400 members, and even this should be considered in the context of a comprehensive defence review that addresses other serious problems in the Canadian forces. Canada requires a real and rapid reaction capability similar to the airborne which the Liberals disbanded in 1995.  Such a rapid response capability should be added to the Canadian forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the defence committee's interim report being tabled only one witness recommended Joint Task Force Two  be increased in size.   He did so with a caveat. He said it was  important  that in a larger mandate there must be doctrinal changes for the use of troops as well as greater oversight over special operations and their activities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witness made it clear that there are generally two classes of special forces: those tasked primarily with VIP protection, hostage rescue and other duties that would fall primarily to a reactive force; and those tasked with conducting deep penetrations into enemy territory for scouting, apprehension and potentially combat operations. As Canada has only one group of personnel trained for special operations, the witness recommended rewriting JTF2's mandate to perform more long range penetration style missions.  In this context he said more manpower would be needed and he recommended an increase in troop numbers.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the majority report of the defence committee in November recommended that JTF2 be increased to nearly 1,000 members.  Why is that?  We believe JTF2 should not grow to more than 400 members.  As JTF2 is accountable only to the defence minister the unit is capable of carrying out foreign missions which must be subject to careful public and parliamentary scrutiny. That is one of the keys here, parliamentary public scrutiny.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A force which operates under a veil of secrecy under certain conditions is necessary.  However the JTF2 should not be expanded beyond 400 members.  Under its current mandate an  increase in size would be dangerous.  Without a comprehensive defence review in the context of a clear foreign affairs policy Canada should not commit to increasing the size of this highly secretive force beyond 400. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTF2 is similar to the British special air service, so we would be competitive with Britain. Again, what Canada needs is a rapid reaction force similar to the British or Dutch marines or the Belgian paracommando brigade, able to perform many of the operations the airborne did.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Foreign Affairs recently talked about the need for a defence and foreign policy review.  This is clearly necessary.  Our influence internationally has slipped so badly under the Liberal government that we can do little else. The defence portion of the review would have to address a great many issues, but we in our party believe it should especially examine what it would take in terms of resources, training and equipment procurement to establish a brigade size special force for Canada. Until 1995 Canada maintained a special service force which was equipped as a light brigade, about 5,000 troops, with mostly light equipment.  We need to look at re-establishing such a force and providing it with the air and sea transport required to respond to emergencies in Canada and overseas.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for light mobile forces has been recognized in Canada since at least the 1964 defence white paper. Since that time the government has gone part of the way toward establishing and maintaining such a force. However  the resources to acquire the transport that would be required have always been lacking, mainly because of the government's lack of interest when it comes to national defence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  government's pending defence review should examine what it would take in terms of resources, training, equipment and procurement to establish a brigade size special force for Canada. The government should then come to parliament with its proposals and work to secure the endorsement of every political party represented in the House of Commons for the policy.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a white paper to be meaningful we need the signatures of the finance minister and the Prime Minister on the document.  Unified parliamentary support is the only way to ensure defence policy is approached in a non-partisan way with guaranteed funding.  That is missing in the House. The opposition has been offering support to the government but there is no communication or working together.  We would like there to be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliamentarians on the defence committee have shown themselves willing to support a sound defence policy. The government should be prepared to seriously engage them in the policy process. We in the Canadian Alliance believe the defence committee's pending report must emphasize that every independent witness who has appeared before  the committee since April, 2001 has lamented the state of readiness of the Canadian forces.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote what a few of the experts have said. On May 10, 2001 Lieutenant General Roméo Dallaire said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>I would contend that right now we have limited abilities to sustain any war-footing capability without mobilizing. This does put a squeeze on the ability or desire of this nation's government and its people to be able to be a participant in a war, even as Strategy 2020 articulates a niche position in those wars....This in itself is a complex problem to face when we look at the responsibilities and the risks our nation faces in its own defence, and in its participation in alliances like NATO and NORAD, and/or under alliances of a single-led nation like the United States in the Gulf War.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Dallaire went  on to say:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>It presents a problem too for us to actually be a player in the world security dimension of classic war or overt warfare.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we wonder why the Americans are making announcements today without Canadians at their side it is because of what General Dallaire has pointed out. However we have not listened to him. Is it not a shame that we are not standing shoulder to shoulder with our American allies,  our top trading partners, neighbours and friends, for  a major announcement like this concerning the security of North America?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Dallaire also stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>I would contend that we would even have problems in meeting the upper scale of conflict resolution--some would call the Gulf War the upper scale of conflict resolution, not a real war where the nation is at risk or the nation is at war.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to say:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>We just spent ten years burning out the forces, particularly the army. We've sucked dry the reserves. We now have reservists going over twice or three times. My contention is that the troops have been committed, have gone through the risks—some have been casualties—and have gained skills in conflict resolution, but they're tired because there's not enough of them to sustain it.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that not a damning statement? Yet In the House yesterday the minister said the government was meeting its commitments. The auditor general said it was not.  Today the minister is still trying to tell our critic the government is meeting its commitments.  It is not true.  It is a big sham.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we get people of the quality of General Dallaire saying these things I sometimes wonder.  I see what the media  chases after.  This is becoming a major issue for our country. I hope that what the Americans have done today in announcing this new security measure will  shake up Canadians and the media.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is not standing beside its biggest trading partner, neighbour, ally and friend. It is because the government has not put up the money necessary to maintain our forces. As Leader of the Opposition I should be saying this. Instead generals and people in the forces are saying it. The only ones who do not seem to understand it are members of the government. The government has millions of dollars to waste on big objects like jets, security systems hidden away in lockers, and other things. It has generated tens of billions of dollars in waste as the auditor general has pointed out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government should get its act straight. Some of that money should be going into our military. The rest should go into MRIs. The $101 million would probably have bought 50 MRIs across the country and shortened the list for a lot of people who have to wait months to get into hospital for medical treatment. I am sure they are thrilled to know the Prime Minister and his crowd have golden knobs on their toilets and can fly anywhere in the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 8, 2001 Major Gen. Lewis MacKenzie said if he were an enemy force commander he would much prefer to fight the Canadian army of today than the Canadian army of 10 years ago with all the bits and pieces, high tech equipment and small numbers that have been introduced into the Canadian forces, particularly the navy and air force, over the last 10 years. I mentioned this  before but it was so shocking I had to cite it again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> We have good people in the military.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Reynolds:</b> The people in the military are excellent. However we are reading about things like a meeting a few months ago in Cornwall where the general told reservists and personnel from across Canada that the truth had to start getting out to the Canadian people. We are getting apologetic letters from military people saying they do not like to get involved and make political comments but they have to  because they are suffering. It is time to act. That is why we are moving the motion today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government wants to debate the species at risk act which would allow it to seize property without giving compensation. We would rather be talking about this because we think it is more important, especially in relation to what happened today with the United States and over the past few days with the government purchase of  jets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 26, 2001 the Conference of Defence Associations  said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are at about two-thirds of what the strength used to be. When I read what the association is saying I understand that the Liberal government is probably number one in the history of our country at spin doctoring. It spins out the message and Canadians believe it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:  </b> They are the best at that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Reynolds:</b> I have never seen anyone as good as the Liberal government at spinning messages. However the facts are coming home to roost in  terms of the arrogant way the government spends money. It is not good for Canada but in the next election it might be very good for Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conference of Defence Associations appeared again at the committee on November 5. It said “We conclude that because of insufficient funds in the Department of National Defence budget, the Canadian forces cannot fulfill their commitments beyond a marginal level within the resource stipulations and the time limits specified in current plans.”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another expert, Dr. Douglas Bland, told the committee on April 3, 2001 that:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>I want to conclude by questioning the assertion made by some senior officers—and by the minister at times, I believe—that the Canadian Forces today is more combat-capable than it has been at any time in the last 10 or 20 years. This is a very important and critical assertion, and it may be true, but I have seen no evidence of it in reports, studies, or recommendations from the headquarters and staff on whom such an assertion is based. I'm sure, or at least I hope, that those kinds of documents are available someplace within the defence establishment. But I think it would be a dangerous idea to make those assertions without a detailed assessment of what our capabilities were ten years ago, how they've changed and improved, and what they are now...I know of no experienced military officers or experts who can stand by that remark.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other experts are telling us the sad story of the government's underfunding and lack of support for the military. On April 5, 2001, the auditor general's office said that in the year 2000 it had found that the force structure had been cut significantly.  We have been told by the minister it keeps on going up, but this is the auditor general telling us the facts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that point the department had gone to ministers to say it was out of   manoeuvring room and that it was under severe pressure.  Our belief is that force structure, modernization and current readiness are still not being balanced.  There is  a discrepancy across the various pillars and hard choices still need to be made.  One has to make a reduction someplace or add more funds to balance out the current set of objectives.     This was a year ago, yet those funds have not been made available and another report, which I will quote later in this discussion, condemns the government even more.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked on October 25, 2001, if Canada could handle replacing the U.S. in Afghanistan and continue its Balkan commitments John Thompson answered:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>We're scrapping the bottom of the barrel right now. For example, if we were presented with an Oka-style crisis again, we couldn't respond to it.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that not a scary thought? If we were to have a serious problem, because of our commitments around the world, we could not handle that responsibility at home. Is it any wonder the Americans today announced a major program with no mention of Canada?  They are moving forward with others because we do not have the money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot remember  when an American ambassador has ever  criticized the Canadian  government.  This one keeps telling us the U.S. wants the Canadian government to spend more on the military.  It want us to bring up our average to the rest of the NATO countries and for us to get our act in gear.  He has not had much success but we will keep cheering him on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will keep  having discussions like this one in the House of Commons and doing everything we can to force the government's hand so our military men and women will know that at least the opposition parties in the House support what they are doing.  We are trying to get them more money and better equipment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Got new Challengers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Reynolds:</b> Madam Speaker, someone mentioned the Challengers.  I have mentioned that a few times.  I  thought today that  was why the government  had ordered those two Challengers. With  the North American defence system the Americans did not want us to support, the government members wanted a couple of faster planes so they could get into a few more places where they could hide.  They can get into 55 new locations with the jets.</p>

Even the members on the other side must be embarrassed today when they see the Americans announce their major security perimeter for North America and they talk about how it includes Mexico, Canada, the Caribbean.  We are not even there.  They just ignore us.  Their ambassador is asking us to put more money into military to do our  fair job around the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We read about all these wasteful projects in the auditor general's report. Some of those things happen, we have to be realistic about that, but not $174 million for a security system.  That is a little much.  Everyone can make mistakes in expense accounts but that is a ridiculous one.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> The Tories bought it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Reynolds:</b> The member says the Tories bought it.  If the Tories bought  it why did they not get rid of it the first year they were here?  They got rid of a lot of other things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is literally unbelievable the December budget ignored what every one of these experts said.  Canada's security needs and the Canadian sovereignty itself have been placed in a perilous position.  Why?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one, we can no longer pull our weight in international coalitions, thus reducing our influence and our credibility.  Nothing was more evident than that today and what happened just before the House sat for question period.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our navy is unlikely to be able to sustain its task group deployment beyond six months due to personnel shortages and other gaps in naval capability. The navy only has two operational support ships left, making it impossible to sustain a task group in the Indian Ocean and still support our ships in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did we hear yesterday?  One of our ships is sitting idle in Victoria Harbour. If it were sitting in the harbour in Montreal or somewhere a little closer in central Canada it might be put into use but it is in British Columbia.  The Prime Minister has only visited B.C. for 15 days in the last couple of years usually for Liberal fundraising dinners.  He had 39 days in Florida, Jamaica or wherever.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John O'Reilly:</b> The Prime Minister did a fundraising dinner for you.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Reynolds:</b> The then prime minister did do a fundraising event many years ago and we did quite well too. He did not fly out on a government jet either.  In those days he flew out on a regular airplane as I still do as Leader of the Opposition and get along quite fine.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that the ship is probably sitting empty  in Victoria Harbour because it has been forgotten.  It is in western Canada and Liberals have a tendency to forget about us in western Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> These eastern Canadians--</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Reynolds:</b> We do not beat up eastern Canadians.  I am one of them.  I was born in Ontario and raised in Quebec.  I am just saying it is the government that has ignored western Canada, the fastest growing area in the country. It really is a shame.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sea King helicopters now require 40 hours of maintenance for every hour in the air, seriously impeding the navy's ability to maintain an effective air  element to support its ships at sea.  Forty hours of maintenance for every hour in the air, which is about what it takes for my friend across the way to get a couple of good hours in the House every week.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army cannot sustain even 750 soldiers in Afghanistan for a second six month rotation without impairing our ability to maintain our commitment of 1,600 troops in Bosnia. Some of our units face the prospect of spending almost back to back rotations overseas.  What does this mean to someone who is in a reserve going overseas for an additional rotation?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched an interesting program on  <i>60 Minutes</i> or <i>Dateline</i> a few months ago about a young man who was in the Vietnam War and did the same thing.  He did about three rotations and then disappeared.  He was discovered 30 years later in Australia leading quite a normal life.  The whole program was about how his family thought he had died but because he had received a ticket from police in Australia  they found out where he really was. It was all about how messed up his mind was from doing three rotations in the Vietnam War.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we doing to young people in the reserves by sending them back two or three times?  Do we really know what is happening there? Would it not be better to implement a major program encouraging young people to join the forces?  I commend the few ads that are on now but we could be doing a lot more to encourage people in this country to do military service.  We should make sure our forces are up to scratch, that they all have uniforms and that people are not having to do unnecessary triple rotations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air force could not air lift our troops overseas because it has no heavy lift aircraft.  Its medium lift aircraft are aging and often break down. If it does not have heavy lift aircraft it has to be rented, whether from Federal Express or whoever. I do not know if that company is used for those types of things but the government is chartering from someone or borrowing American airplanes or doing what it does. Yet it can still buy two jets to fly its members  around when it has four that the army says work fine.  It is a pretty sad commentary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deployment of CF-18s overseas, as occurred during the gulf war in 1991 and in Kosovo in 1999, has become increasingly difficult given the decision to run down the number of total CF-18s to just 80 aircraft from 120. We will not be able to defend our own air space and still meet possible international commitments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have serious difficulty simply responding to internal emergencies in Canada.  That is another key thing.  We need people internally. Do we have them?  Most people say no. The air force only has 32 C-130 transport aircraft of which at least 75% are unavailable at any given time.</p>


	<A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1630)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is an unbelievable figure. If  Avis rent a car had 75% of its  fleet unavailable, it would be broke. What kind of encouragement is that to anyone in the forces? It is like an old comedy routine where there are 100 planes on the tarmac, they all run out and only 25 take off. It is just not good enough.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, since 19 of the 32 C-130s are more than 35 years old, these aircraft are subject to periodic breakdowns. The Challengers were only 16 or 19 years old, babies in comparison. We have no strategic or tactical heavy lift aircraft or helicopters. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 1998 ice storm, American aircraft had to lift troops and supplies from western Canada to eastern Canada in order to respond to the emergency. We are  lucky that today it is about 30 degrees outside  and there will not be an  ice storm this year anyway, but it could happen again next year. However  we are in  Ottawa so we had better watch out because it could happen this weekend.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the Oka crisis in 1990, the army deployed nearly a full brigade, several thousand troops, to deal with that emergency. Given the fact that the total strength of the army is down to less than 19,000 troops of which only 9,000 or so can be considered front line, it is very difficult for the army to sustain its overseas commitments and simultaneously respond to emergencies, especially multiple ones, internally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total strength of the army reserve is now less than 14,000, perhaps as few as 11,000, most of whom are poorly trained and equipped. They can provide little support to the regular army and would not even be able to guard vital points in Canada, such as power plants and pipelines, in an effective manner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protection of Canadian sovereignty is increasingly compromised. The flying time for the Aurora aircraft, our main sovereignty protection aircraft, is being reduced to just 8,000 hours per year. That is 3,500 hours below that recommended by the chief of the air staff.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister the other day in an answer to me about flying from Gatineau instead of the Ottawa airport because Gatineau is 10 minutes closer to Sussex Drive, said that he does not make those decisions, that the RCMP makes them for him. The Prime Minister gave that answer in the House and I will accept it as accurate. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is the case, when the military recommends 11,500 hours a year and the government reduces it to 8,000 hours a year, why are we interfering with the military? Why is the government interfering with members of the military, reducing what they say is necessary to give us the protection we need in Canada? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government cannot have it both ways. It  cannot say “We are going to spend an extra $20,000 for the Prime Minister to get on an airplane in Gatineau because of security reasons, but we are not going to give it to the army overseas because we do not think the hours they want are correct”. They are correct and we should follow the recommendations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations were made by the chief of the air staff, Lieutenant General Campbell, in 1999 when he commanded 1 Canadian Air Division. He gave us the minimum acceptable level to make commitments on the Aurora flights over the Arctic and they dwindled to just about zero. That is shameful.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> They are needed more than ever up there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Reynolds: </b>They are needed more than ever. Today  the Americans made their announcement on the security perimeter for North America and we do not have anyone flying over the north. It is absolutely shameful.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasingly we are failing to pull our weight in Norad. As noted, the air force is reducing the size of its CF-18 fighter force by one-third. This will necessitate increased reliance on American aircraft to protect Canadian air space.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government today got a standing ovation  from members in the House after saying “We are going to be Canadian first, we are independent”, but it has reduced our force by one-third and now we have to rely on American aircraft. I have no problem with that because  the Americans have a big force, but we should be working with them. When they make an announcement like the major one they did today, I would like to see our minister standing next to their minister and our Prime Minister standing next to their president.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found it interesting that just a few weeks ago when the Prime Minister was in Africa, the prime minister of England was in the United States dealing with the war, dealing with the serious issues. Our Prime Minister was trying to build a legacy in Africa with a different story in every country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are increasingly failing to pull our weight in Norad, as I said. As noted, the air force is reducing the size of its CF-18 fighter force by one-third and this will necessitate increased reliance on American aircraft.  We already know that U.S. aircraft played that role in many parts of Canada on September 11.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our navy has no presence in Canada's third ocean, the Arctic.  Our sovereignty claims there, which are not recognized by the United States, are largely unenforced. The continual delays in offering political support to the United States on national missile defence mean that the Americans are moving ahead without Canada in this area.  This imperils the future of Norad which is central to monitoring  Canadian sovereignty and which is funded by the United States to the tune of 90%.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these threats to Canadian sovereignty and security will only become more serious in the coming years due to the  shortfalls which presently exist in the equipment and operations budgets of the Department of National Defence. Increasingly the armed forces will be unable to maintain even present levels of capability.  The result will inevitably be growing dependence on the United States and almost no credibility or influence abroad on security matters.  This scenario is the greatest threat to sovereignty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is imperative that the government act soon.  There is simply too much at stake for the government to continue to sit on its hands. </p>

Free trade was another one.  It never did that.  However,  Mulroney ordered the helicopters and the Prime Minister did it for that reason.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said he would never fly the big Airbus that Mulroney had made for the Prime Minister.  I think they still use it a little bit, but he has stuck to his word most of the time. I think that is more of a legal problem because the airplane is there and it is a good airplane.  We did not need to buy two $101 million Challenger jets.  We could have used this other airplane for longer flights.  It is certainly good enough for the Governor General.  It is good enough for the Prime Minister.  It is a shame, that  political decision on that day darn near 10 years ago, because our forces today could have had the most modern helicopters and a force that could have offered assistance to our allies in this war against terrorism, but here we are today still debating  the issue of helicopters, still wondering why we have two new Challenger jets with gold faucets and the fancy toilets and no new helicopters.</p>

However, the process to replace the Labradors has at least been initiated in Canada and the date when the new helicopters will arrive has been fixed. The situation is more uncertain with respect to the Sea Kings, whose replacement  is still many years away. As a result, major modifications, including the replacement of the centre section of the airframe at a cost of $500,000 per aircraft, are being made to ensure that these helicopters will continue in service until 2005. The T-58 engines are also being upgraded by Acro Aerospace of Canada to improve their reliability as well as their performance. Some new equipment has also been purchased to improve the Sea Kings' ability to carry out surveillance and other military missions.</small></td>

<td><small>In its report Security in a Changing World, issued on October 1, 1994, the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons  on Canada's Defence Policy recommended early action on the purchase of new shipborne and rescue helicopters to replace the Sea Kings and Labradors. In his response to the report, dated 1 December 1994, the Minister of National Defence noted that virtually all the committee's recommendations were reflected in the 1990 Defence White Paper issued the same day. Indeed, the white paper noted that the options available for the replacement of the shipborne and rescue helicopters were currently under consideration.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is an interesting chronology. On June 26, 1986, treasury board approval was given for the start of project definition phase for new shipborne aircraft to replace the Sea Kings. On March 15, 1991, the Department of National Defence merged planning for NSA and new search and rescue helicopters. On April 30, 1992, a Labrador crashed in British Columbia during a rescue operation, killing one search and rescue technician. On October 8, 1992, the Canadian government signed contracts with E.H. Industries Ltd. and Paramax Canada for the delivery of 50 EH-101 helicopters to replace Sea Kings and Labradors. On February 27, 1993, a Sea King ditched in the gulf of Mexico after suffering an electrical systems failure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will inject here another relevant fact in this timeline. On April 3, 1993, the Toronto <i>Star</i> carried a quote from the then leader of the Liberal opposition in the House. He said, with reference to the Mulroney government's announced intention to replace the then already too aged military helicopters, “I am sure when the cabinet made that decision that day, probably all the ministers, not only Charest, Campbell, were smoking pot. It makes no sense when we see so much poverty in the streets”. That was the leader of the opposition of the day, now the Prime Minister. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well there is still poverty in the streets. There is poverty in the military. Our good soldiers have had to line up at civilian food banks, and over in the Prime Minister's office the air is still cloudy. Probably it is smoke still rising from the machinery of government that went into overdrive when the Prime Minister decided that he and his cabinet needed brand new luxury flying Taj Mahals to get to the golf courses even faster than they did with the jets they had before, which obviously were in perfect flying order according to the military that said the planes were in great shape and did not need to be replaced.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too bad that their priorities are out of order.   That $100  million   would have gone a long way to keep our military safe in new helicopters.  It sent a tragic signal to a lot of people that the money they send here is treated a lot like sewage, something we want to get rid of as soon as possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should mention too that we also spent $120,000 last year on golf balls and $15,000 on tees. I doubt too many of the solders overseas are getting golf balls and tees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1993 the new Liberal government announced the cancellation of  contracts with E.H. Industries and Paramax  Canada for EH-101s. On  April 28, 1994, a Sea King crashed in New Brunswick killing two crew members and injuring two others.  On August 18, 1994, the Sea King fleet was temporarily grounded for the inspection of fuel leaks.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, on April 28, 1994, the Sea King fleet was temporarily grounded for the inspection of fuel leaks following an emergency landing by one aircraft. On October 31, 1994, a report of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons of Canada Defence Policy recommended quick action on the acquisition of new shipborne and rescue helicopters. On December 1, 1994, the white paper on defence policy indicated that the government would go ahead with the replacement of the Sea Kings and Labradors in the near future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 31, 1995, the Canadian government and Unisys GSG Canada, one of the prime contractors for the EH-101 contract, reached an agreement on the payment of $166 million as compensation for the work done by the company prior to the cancellation of the contract. On May 1, 1995, a Labrador based at CFB Greenwood in Nova Scotia made an emergency landing because of mechanical problems. On September 20, 1995, a Sea King made an emergency landing because of mechanical problems. On November 8, 1995, the government announced its intention to proceed with the acquisition of new search and rescue helicopters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 9, 1995, the Minister of Public Works and Government Services announced an agreement in principle had been reached with EH Industries on the termination costs of the contract for the EH-101 airplanes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 23, 1996, the government announced the termination costs for the contract with EH Industries for the EH-101 airplanes were $157.8 million. On March 8, 1996, the Minister of National Defence said the decision on the shipborne helicopter project would be deferred for an additional year. On August 23, 1996, three of Canada's fleet of helicopters were grounded, pending the inspection and repair of cracks found in the tail section of the air frame. On November 27, 1996, the government issued the request for proposals from aircraft manufacturers for the rescue helicopter project.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 13, 1997, a Labrador made a crash landing in the Georgia Strait after a fire had broken out on board.  This was one of the most serious of several emergency landings made by Labradors and Sea Kings in late 1996 and early 1997. On May 5, 1997, four manufacturers met the deadline for proposals for the new rescue helicopter:  Agusta-Westland, Boeing Helicopter and Sikorsky.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 5, 1998, the Minister of National Defence and the Minister of Public Works and Government Services announced that EH Industries had been selected to supply 15 Cormorants to replace the Labrador search and rescue helicopters. On April 23, 1998, the Department of National Defence announced the signing of the contract with EH Industries and a cost of delivery of 15 Cormorants at $580 million. On October 2, 1998, a Labrador helicopter  413 Squadron based at Greenwood, Nova Scotia, crashed in the Gaspé Peninsula, killing all six persons aboard.  The remaining 12 Labradors were grounded as a precaution. On October 15, 1998, all 30 Sea Kings were grounded after the discovery of a fuel leak in one of the aircraft.  All but one returned to flight operations on October 18.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us shift here and talk a little about the latest budget. From the point of view of the Department of National Defence and the Canadian forces, the federal budget is highly unsatisfactory.  Although it professes to address the post-September 11 environment, it largely ignores the urgent requirements of an essential component of national security, namely, the armed forces. There are two main concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional funding assigned to general military capabilities and to operational readiness comprises only $510 million over two years.  Whereas annual shortfalls in the DND budget, computed by the auditor general and others, far exceed that sum.  The manner in which funding for defence is presented lacks clarity and could be misleading for those interested in defence issues but not well informed on budget procedures.</p>


	<A NAME="T1730"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1730"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1730)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In raw terms the budget allocates $1.2 billion to DND and its agencies over a five year period starting in fiscal year 2001-02 to 2006-07.  Full details are available on the Department of Finance website, www.fin.gc.ca.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over a five year, plus this year, horizon amounts from the above are assigned as follows:  expand anti-terrorist capacity, $119 million; nuclear biological chemical threats, $513 million; and contingency, $100 million.  The balance is assigned over two years including this year as follows:  supporting Canada's military, $510 million.  That is $1.2 billion.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members should note that the budget document, budget plan 2001, also includes $396 million for emergency preparedness which is on page 92 of the document.  In fact this amount will be assigned to and disbursed by other departments and agencies and is not included in this analysis.  Much the same applies to the $513 million for NBC threats although some of it will remain in DND.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional funding is useful but only $510 million is available for application to conventional military capabilities and the commitments assigned under the 1994 white paper on defence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover the $510 million is specifically assigned as follows and therefore not available to address the long list of short hauls in the operation readiness of the CFC and these have all been pointed out not only in this speech today but by the Auditor General of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operation Apollo anti-terror coalition operations is $210 million, capital purchases $300 million.  The funds for Operation Apollo have already been spent and will not contribute to stopping the decline of the operational readiness in the Canadian forces as a whole.  The $300 million for capital purchases will be applied mainly to payments for projects already underway.  For example, the lease to purchase payments for the new fleet of Victoria class  submarines  will relieve some pressure in future years in the DND capital program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expanded anti-terrorist capacity noted above refers to raising the strength of joint task force 2, JTF2, as well as providing it with appropriate equipment. Funding this new specific task will not alleviate the general malaise of the forces and in terms of the additional manpower requirements will impose further strains on an organization already pushed to the breaking point.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently a number of agencies  issued reports and studies in which they analyzed the problems arising from the failure of the government to provide the funds necessary for DND and the Canadian forces to implement the policy set out in the 1994 white paper on defence.  They were:  the Royal Canadian Military Institute, the Federation of Military and United Services Institutes of Canada,   the Conference of Defence Associations, Canadian Defence and Security in the 21st Century, and the House of Commons Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government ignored what the committee of the House requested the House of Commons to do. I know the defence committee is one of those in which members  work closely together because it is such an important issue for Canada.  It is probably one of the most non-partisan committees where we work together as Canadians like foreign affairs.  It made recommendations which have been ignored by the government.  We should all be ashamed of that.  The House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance has also made recommendations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these reports and studies listed serious problems within the Canadian Forces arising inter alia from a lack of trained manpower, insufficient training, rusting out equipment and inadequate logistic support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 7, 2001, the Auditor General of Canada issued her annual report.  It verified and supported the findings of other reports listed above.  In particular, it noted there was an ongoing deficit in the end operations and maintenance  of $1.3 billion per annum.  This meant that over a two year period DND would need $2.6 billion merely to clear the deficit as shown above.  The 2001 federal budget provided only $510 million over two years. That amount is already spoken for in other areas. </p>


	<A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1735)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In previous reports the auditor general identified an additional $6 billion to $10 billion over the next decade which would be needed for major equipment replacement.  Yesterday in her report she talked about taking 30 years to catch up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, DND has managed to survive by reprioritizing and reallocating resources.  The so-called rob Peter to pay Paul approach, considering the failure of the 2001 budget to provide significant new funds, is no longer viable.  It is therefore likely that a defence policy update scheduled for release in early 2002 will direct further downsizing of the Canadian forces, with associated elimination or reduction of combat capabilities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget plan 2001 lacks clarity in addressing the above situation.  For example, it sets out to illustrate incremental defence funding from 1999 to 2001.  It provides information in a manner that could mislead the reader.  The following statement from  page 99 of the budget plan 2001 illustrates the point:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The $3.9 billion of new funding in the budgets of 1999 and 2000, together with the more than $1.2 billion of new funding in this budget, means that the government will have increased DND funding by $5.102 billion over the next five years.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total of $5.102 billion is computed as follows: budget 1999, $550 million; budget 2000, $3.35 billion; and budget 2001, $1.202 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has already been shown in earlier paragraphs from this memo that only $510 million of the $1.202 billion allocated to DND budget 2001 would be available to support existing military capabilities of the Canadian forces. Moreover, this amount is designated in advance for specific purposes.  The $550 million from the actions taken in budget 1999 is being applied to quality of life projects.  It is very necessary, but not directly applicable to the rehabilitation of military capabilities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could also be critiqued in the same vein as illustrated in the next paragraph. It is, however, the totals of $3.35 billion shown for budget 2000 and the grand total which is 1999, 2000 and 2001 of $5.102 billion that are most questionable in the manner in which they are represented.  The problem lies with confusion over approved rises in the base of the DND budget in a given year versus cumulative totals shown for succeeding years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first rise is indeed an increase in funding which raises the level of the budget base.  However, the government refers to the ongoing insertion of the rise over a period of years as an investment.  This may be correct, but there is also an implication that the level of the base has continued to rise past the first year.  When that is not the case there are clear differences in meaning between the two terms, raise the base and total investment.  These are explored in detail. Paragraph 2 on page 99 of the budget plan states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>This budget therefore commits substantial funding to enhance emergency response on preparedness.  It allocates more than $1.6 billion over the next five years to improve the government's ability to detect, prevent and respond to threats, and to fund Canada's military participation in the international coalition against terrorism.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with this quotation it should be noted that the form of budget 2001 is quite different from previous practice.  Instead of making allocations directly to government departments and agencies, it assigns money to the number of agendas.  DND and the Canadian forces are included in the security agenda.  For this reason, most of the $1.6 billion would not be available for DND expenditure as already noted above for the emergency preparedness allotment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, DND allocation funds are assigned to objects of expenditure in advance.  Many are outside of the DND, for example, nuclear, chemical, and biological threats.  The political intent of the above quotation may be interpreted as follows: to respond to public concerns regarding economic downturn and terrorism, to channel most of the new DND funds into local economies,  and to deflect criticism by allies and analysts that the Canadian forces, including elements assigned to Operation Apollo, are not battle ready.      Elsewhere the government has recognized this deficiency by stating that Operation Apollo would not be committed to combat operations.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see that today  in the operation announced by the Americans. There was nobody from Canada standing in that room and they were talking about defence for North America. We have no respect. We are losing it because the government has no respect for the military. It has no respect for the traditions of Canada in working with our allies to the south, our best friends and  biggest traders. It is very unfortunate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of budget 2001 indicate the  operational readiness of the Canadian forces would continue to decline mainly as a result of underfunding. That is not just the opposition complaining which the opposition tends to do. It is the Auditor General of Canada, the one person we must respect who checks the books and keeps us in line. She said our military is in dire straits. We have ships with nobody to man them and  officers without uniforms. The government can have fancy toilets in its  jets, but Canadian soldiers do not get porta-potties over in Afghanistan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of underfunding there is a lack of trained manpower, the progressive rusting out of equipment and inadequate logistic support. The government does not intend to raise the defence expenditures above the level of 1.1% of GDP and therefore the policies stated in the 1994  white paper on defence would remain largely unaffordable in the context of government priorities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recommend the government initiate at once a broad national security review comprising a comprehensive public and parliamentary examination of Canada's needs in the realm of foreign  and defence policy. At the conclusion of the process it should publish a new white paper on defence with a government commitment to adequate long term funding written into it. This process was recently undertaken and implemented in Australia. If we were to have a white paper, we must have the commitment from the government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sense in starting any studies  unless the government says   in advance that when this is done and it goes through a committee of the House of Commons that the  government would support it with the necessary funds. That would right away improve the morale of our forces. Even if it took us a little while to get that done, at least  they would know that we would sit down, put together a white paper that talked about where we would go in these areas and that the government would be committed to fully fund it after a full debate in  committee and in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figures and explanations provided on page 99 of the budget plan document are  most contentious in terms of misleading the reader and the public. To analyze them one must understand the basic framework of departmental budgets. The latter should be perceived in two parts: the foundation and a smaller superstructure, both of which exist for only one year and which must be rebuilt at the start of each new fiscal year. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foundation is known as the base and the superstructure comprises sums of money added outside the base during the year. The complete structure is described in the annual departmental estimates.  Recently, in the case of DND, the so-called fiscal framework budget, it is running about $9.5 billion per annum, and the estimates at about $11.5 billion. It is important that the DND budget base be set high enough to fund the commitments assigned to the Canadian forces in the 1994 white paper on defence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An adequate budget base provides stability, allows coherent forward planning and keeps the Canadian forces in an effective state of operational readiness. If there were no federal budget to provide additional money to DND or if a given budget does not provide an additional allocation, then the central agency should  build a base as it did in the previous year and, with approvals from cabinet, Treasury Board, Department of Finance and Privy Council Office, should add the superstructure as required, for example, in supplementary estimates for expenditures approved during the year. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important point is that the base is made up of individual bricks, most comprising increases approved for the base in previous years. Hence, if a base increase is not approved in a given year, it must be inserted again in each succeeding year. Therefore it is only a real increase in defence funding the first year it appears. In succeeding years it is merely reinserted to keep the base at the approved level. Since the last base increase in budget 2000, this brick has become known as the program, integrity or sustainability.</p>


	<A NAME="T1745"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1745)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fiscal year 2000-01 it was set at $400 million.  Since the additional funds allocated to DND in budget 2000 total $3.3 billion, including subsequent extrapolations out to fiscal year 2006-07, one may ask why the brick is only worth $400 million. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the answer is that the $3.3 billion represents cumulative funding originally plus yearly insertions over that extended period in fiscal year 1999-2000. As well, other funds were designated and applied directly to such objects of expenditure as provincial disaster relief and the war in Kosovo.  These and other factors meant that in the end, the brick of real new money applied to the base in the first year was only $400 million. A similar analysis could be applied to the brick for quality of life added in  budget 1999 and amounting to $140 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the base raising brick of $400 million approved in budget 2000 has subsequently received approval to appreciate in a limited amount over the period  to  fiscal year 2007.  This will raise the budget base incrementally during that period by an amount totalling $300 million.  This means that between 2001 and 2007 the DND budget base will rise by $400 million plus $300 million for the equivalent of $700 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's interpretation of this situation differs from the above analysis.  The government adds up all the bricks, the initial one plus the annual reinsertions in a cumulative fashion, and calls it a total investment in defence amounting to $5.1 billion.  This could mislead those unfamiliar with budget procedures into believing that the government has made additions to the DND budget base when it has really only made insertions to the budget.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the government's logic, it could be said that the cumulative DND budget allocations for 2001 to 2007 totalling some $60 billion are also an investment in defence.  The annual insertion of bricks serves to preserve the new level of money originally approved in any given budget, but afterwards it is not an increase in funding. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is not acknowledged in the cabinet situation is the fact that the foundation is not large enough to address the annual ongoing DND deficit of $1.3 billion per annum identified by the auditor general in her report of December 2, 2001. What is required to resolve the severe underfunding problem within DND is the addition of  a new and larger brick to the DND budget base in the order of $1 billion per annum in each of the next five years to bring the budget base up to a steady rate of some $14 billion to $15 billion.  Until that happens, to use another analogy, any lesser increase in real funding will only serve to maintain  life support systems rather than to cure the patient.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to quote a comment one of my colleagues, the hon. member for Lakeland,     has raised in the House on many occasions:</p>

<td><small>Canadians have been asking the same question. Not only the Canadian public but the government's own defence committee, military analysts from coast to coast, retired servicemen, the auditor general and even some of our allies have been urging Canada to provide a greater commitment to the military. The answer they all keep getting is no, the government is not committed to the military and is failing the men and women of the armed forces.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military was virtually ignored in the December budget in spite of the fact it was called a defence and security budget.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general made it clear this week that we need a minimum of $2.2 billion a year to sustain the military at the current level and more to rebuild. The government offered less than 5% of that to the military.  That is unacceptable.  It shows the kind of  commitment  the government has made to the military.  It is unacceptable to the men and women who put their lives on the line every day and  who are  certainly putting their lives on the line for our country in the mission in Afghanistan.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote the Prime Minister's response to the criticism of people who care about the military.  He said over the Christmas break “There is a bunch of guys who are lobbyists who are representing those who sell armaments, who tell you of course they will give you a better lunch if they had more comments”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the Prime Minister's response when asked to comment on people who genuinely care about the military.  It is shameful that our Prime Minister would point the finger and blame it on people who really care.  Their only fault was pointing out what is really happening in the military.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder who lobbied to get those two jets the Prime Minister needed so badly, those new fancy toilets in a jet that goes a little farther. I wonder who lobbied to sell the government the $174 million satellite dish that is sitting in a warehouse and which nobody is using.  I wonder who lobbied to get all those grants that are going out with kickbacks to the Liberal Party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has an absolutely shameful record on the military and  is  arrogant and corrupt.  There are court cases  right now with two people convicted in Quebec for doing things the wrong way with grants.</p>

	The government wants to knock anybody who talks about the realities of life.  We continue to get the assurances of members of the government and the Minister of National Defence that the troops are well equipped for the mission.  They say they have all  the necessary resources to do their job and they are doing it safely.  They say everything has been well planned and thought through and that the government has learned from past mistakes.  These are the things we are told by the Prime Minister and  the Minister of National Defence on a regular basis. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is in the auditor general's report. It is too bad I am running out of time because I have a lot of pages from the auditor general's report.  There is enough in it to talk for hours about the auditor general's report, about the waste in the government, not only in defence but in other departments.  Is it not a shame that it takes the auditor general to tell the government not just last year, but this year it is even worse, what the government is not doing for our military.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is  time for a change in the country.  It is time for a new younger vision, a younger leader and he will be sitting on this side after September 13. The country needs a change.  It is so obvious by the auditor general's report.  It is so obvious from the arrogance on the other side of the House.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, a colleague over there said be careful of guys with white hair.  I have  white hair but I can say I am anxious because I have a party with young members in it, with ethnic diversity, with a new young leader who will excite the country and make sure our military is well funded.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will bring us back the respect from our American allies and our friends around the world.  The country is losing the respect we have had with our American colleagues.  We need to build it back and we will build it back under the Canadian Alliance with  Stephen Harper as the leader of our party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank members in the House for listening.  I hope all the Liberal members  will go back to their cabinet colleagues to make sure they listen to what we have said today.  Let us look after the people in our military the way they deserve to be looked after.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to draw to your attention, and  I am sure you noticed,  that a large number of members walked out after the first vote. When the bells rang, we came in  and voted on the amendment on Bill C-344. After that, you saw, and everybody else saw, a large number of members walking out of this place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You had an obligation, Mr. Speaker, to ring the bells for half an hour and call the members in before you started to read the motion and to vote on the main motion of Bill C-344. Therefore, I would ask that you rule the last vote null and void and out of order.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, thank you very much for the ruling.  I am not challenging the Chair's ruling but I think the Chair missed the point that we have a definite rule that the members shall be called to vote.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells rang and we came in and voted on the amendment to Bill C-344.   As the Chair and everyone saw, a large number of members left the Chamber.  Therefore the Chair had, in my opinion, an obligation to call in the members again and to allow the bells to ring for 30 minutes to summon them back.  That did not happen, as the Chair knows.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members who had left the Chamber did not have an opportunity to return because when they left the Chair had not risen to read the main motion.  Therefore it can be said that they did not know a vote was to be held and the bells should have been rung for 30 minutes.  Since they were not, the vote was out of order. The proceedings were not out of order but the vote was.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, with deference to the Chair, I still think the Chair is missing the point. Of course we can walk out.  Of course we can sit in our chairs and not be recognized to vote, as perhaps some of us did in the vote. However that is not part of the issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that the Chair knew a large number of members were not present. In order to allow us to exercise the democratic responsibility of voting in the Chamber the Speaker has an obligation to ring the bells for 30 minutes, or 15 minutes if it is a deferred vote. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that the bells should have been rung.  That is what I am trying to say. Because the bells did not ring and the members were not called into the Chamber the vote is out of order.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-203292"></A><a HREF="#Int-203293"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-203291"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair): </b>

	I am of the opinion that there was  agreement among the House leaders that once a deferred recorded division is scheduled for a specific date and everyone knows in advance that there will be a vote on  the amendment followed immediately by a vote on the main motion, there are no bells in between the vote on the amendment and the vote on the main motion.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I again apologize for my multiple interventions. We all know  many things go on in the House on an informal basis but there are formal procedures and rules to ensure things are done properly, legally and judiciously.   The issue here is that members be called for a vote.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chair knows a large number of members walked out of the House. They left in protest or for whatever reason.  However because a large number had walked out they had to be summoned back because there was another vote that had not started. The motion had not been read. The Chair had not stood to read the motion.  It had not been introduced for a vote, therefore the Chair had an obligation to call the members back in.  The bells should have been rung, which did not happen. The members were not summoned back or given the opportunity to return to the Chamber.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. With all due respect to my hon. colleague, it is clear that once members of the House come here to vote  they have an opportunity and the responsibility  to stay and vote.  Hon. members who decided to leave the House this evening in protest or for whatever reason had the opportunity to stay.  They all knew there would be a  vote after the first one.  They decided not to be here for it.  That was their choice.  If they did not wish to stay for the vote it was their choice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member suggests we have to sit here and waste the House's time by ringing the bells for half an hour for no reason other than some members want to play games. That is certainly not a valid objection.</p>

If some members of his party decided to walk out, that was their decision. The House still had to proceed with the vote without bells because it was agreed to 10 days ago.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased the hon. member for St. Albert talked about behaviour that is proper, legal and judicious because earlier this evening we saw behaviour that was exactly the opposite. In an affront to the dignity of the House and an assault on its order and decorum a member of parliament from the opposition attempted to seize and remove the mace from the table. There could be no more serious affront to the dignity, decorum and order of the House than that.  </p>

I will put the argument before the House that this is a question of privilege that deserves to be dealt with, and I wanted to give notice at the earliest opportunity.</p>

	moved that Bill C-388, an act to regulate conflict of interest situations for ministers and to provide for a code of ethics for ministers, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, I would have liked to have started by saying that I am happy to speak to this debate on Bill C-388, the result of just over two years of work. However, I can only conclude, after the sad spectacle  the government treated us to, that the amount of work and the number of years we spend working on a bill do not count for much here in the House.   This is a grievous affront to private members' business and to the rights of parliamentarians to raise in the House issues of concern to their constituents.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, I will go through the motions of my presentation because I believe  this bill contains provisions that deserve to be heard, even though, unfortunately, we will not have the opportunity to vote on it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summary of the bill states that:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The purpose of the bill is to regulate the conduct of ministers with respect to conflicts of interest and post-employment. It is primarily based on the Conflict of Interest and Post-Employment Code for Public Office Holders and the Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament of the United Kingdom.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this bill is to regulate the conduct of ministers with respect to conflicts of interest during the exercise of their duties and post-employment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that end, it provides for the introduction of a code of ethics, primarily based on the Conflict of Interest and Post-Employment Code for Public Office Holders and the Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament of the United Kingdom, which would henceforth be part of Canadian legislation. Any breach could then be the subject of penalties.    </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill begins with a detailed description of how ministers' assets are to be managed.  A clear definition is provided of the difference between exempt assets, which are the assets for private use of the minister and his or her family, and assets which must be divested,  such as companies and publicly traded securities, which must be disposed of or administered by a third party, such as a trust.   Over and above the question of assets and regulatory  statements relating thereto, the bill also defines the pertinent family relationships in order to avoid any confusion. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the information on ministers' assets disclosed under the provisions of this bill would be made public, thus guaranteeing the transparency of the system, a sine qua non which ought to allow the public to regain a degree of trust in our political institutions and the integrity of its key figures, that is the ministers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public's cynicism about public institutions, which is already very much evident from the polls, is translated in election after election by a growing disaffection and a more and more anemic voter turnout.  A government can hardly pat itself on the back if it is elected by close to 40% of the 60% of people who bothered to turn out to vote.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A phenomenon such as this is evidence of  a sick system, one that must not be accepted with complacency because it suits us, but rather must be a cause of considerable concern. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major changes concerning ethics and conflict of interest are therefore more indicated than ever, particularly since the muddled affair of Auberge Grand-Mère and the precipitous departure of Alfonso Gagliano for Denmark, after allegations of nepotism and favouritism.  These incidents have only further eroded the already shaky confidence our fellow citizens have in politicians.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, clause 3 of Bill C-388 clearly describes the purpose of this initiative, and I quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The purpose of this Act is to enhance public confidence in the integrity of ministers and in the decision-making process in the federal government:</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that such a measure can only increase public confidence in the government and change the very negative impression that our fellow citizens have of politicians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the weekly <i>La voix de L'Est</i>, reported on February 25 that a survey conducted by Léger Marketing shows that public confidence in politicians has never been so low. The article referred to: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">

<td><small>—a historic low of 18%—</small></td>

<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The pollster noted that people “trust a car salesman more than a politician”. Indeed, politicians come last in the 20 professions mentioned—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can  see and feel, public confidence in us is at an all time low. Personally, I think this situation is extremely serious and we should be concerned as parliamentarians, because it is probably the worst threat that our institutions have faced in a long time. This threat is all the more insidious, because it may seem trivial, temporary or cyclical.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I already mentioned in the House, democracy is a blessing that must never be taken for granted and that must always be cherished.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, measures that require a bit more transparency on the part of cabinet members, as provides the bill before us this evening, should not only be concerns, but should also be part of the government's legislative agenda, this as quickly as possible. We all know that this government truly needs to improve its image with the public, in terms of integrity and credibility.</p>


	<A NAME="T1900"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1900"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1905"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1855"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1900)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By adopting a code of ethics regulating the conduct of ministers while they  hold office and post-employment, the House of Commons would acquire a useful tool with respect to public integrity, which could only earn the respect of our fellow citizens. This would always be a good start in winning back their trust.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members of society, we must take responsibility for  our actions, as well as assume the obligations resulting from our choices. As responsible citizens, members of government must act in the public interest, and not with their own personal interests in mind. In order to ensure that ministers always act in the public interest and with integrity, their responsibilities and obligations should logically be part of Canadian legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the oath of office which they must swear before taking up their duties, ministers would be formally called upon, under this bill, to file a confidential statement and a statement of divestment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Bill C-388 would create the position of commissioner of ethics, a real one. This individual would be appointed by the House and accountable to it. He would be appointed for a term of seven years, renewable once only, and his duties would  essentially be, and I quote:</p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commissioner would therefore have a real power of investigation and could launch an investigation on his own initiative or at the suggestion of parliamentarians or even ordinary members of the public, if he felt that the facts uncovered warranted it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the annual statutory meeting provided for in this bill, the commissioner of ethics could at any time request a meeting with a minister, and vice versa. At such a meeting, the commissioner would provide advice and issue directives to the minister, who would be required to comply with them or face a penalty. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to point out, for the benefit of those following this debate, that bills and motions introduced in the House of Commons  by members are examined by a sub-committee of parliamentarians, the Sub-committee on Private Members' Business of the Standing Committee on  Procedure and House Affairs.  It is mandated to decide which items will be votable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had numerous debates on this matter, that is on whether it would be appropriate to have all private members' business votable, but unfortunately  the recent mini-renovation, or modernization, of the standing orders will not allow us to go any further in that direction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a member to have his or her bill or motion declared a votable item, it must comply with  a series of six mandatory criteria, from which I will spare you except for the one that reads:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Bills should concern issues not part of the  current legislative agenda  of the government or that have not been voted on or otherwise addressed in the current session of parliament.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that the bill we are debating here has been deemed not to be votable by the Sub-committee on Private Members Business, because it did not meet the above criterion.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance,  we are told, moved a motion on the same subject as that raised in Bill C-388. Could I have forgotten, when I was working on the bill, work that took more than two years, incidentally,  to check if my bill met all six of the criteria used to determine if it would be deemed votable?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think not. After numerous inquiries and lengthy research, all that I concluded was that there was no other motion moved by the Canadian Alliance or any other party that proposed establishing a bill to regulate the conduct of ministers, with respect to conflict of interest and post employment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was, however, a motion moved by the Alliance, which may have produced this error. This motion, which was moved by the member for Okanagan--Coquihalla on February 8, 2001, and voted down on February 13 by the Liberal majority in the House, read as follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That this House adopt the following policy from Liberal Redbook 1 and call for its implementation by the government: “A Liberal Government will appoint an independent Ethics Counsellor to advise both public officials and lobbyists in the day-to-day application of the Code of Conduct for Public Officials. The Ethics Counsellor will be appointed after consultation with the leaders of all parties in the House of Commons and will report directly to Parliament”.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understandable that, to some people, the terms used in that motion may be confusing, since it includes similar terms  such as “code”, “counsellor” and “conduct”.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Canadian Alliance motion was simply to ask the Liberals to keep one of their own promises and to make good on it. Incidentally, the government  amended that motion, to avoid having to vote against its own election promise. Our credibility with the public can only suffer whenever the government resorts to partisan schemes and tries to avoid  keeping its promises. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be very deceitful to try to convince anyone that Bill C-388 and the Canadian Alliance motion are similar, and to argue that the House has already dealt with this issue in this session. This evening, we had a unique opportunity to meet the expectations of the  public, which would love to put its trust in our political institutions, if only we would show  some will to ensure greater transparency and integrity in the decision-making process.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this is a missed opportunity, because once again, the Liberals will have manoeuvered  to skirt the issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, the Liberals had made the commitment, before being elected, to increase the level of confidence in our institutions by making integrity and public accountability the cornerstone of their election campaign. In fact, in the spring of 1993, the Prime Minister said, and I quote, “Giving a job to my barber, his wife, the person who took care of the kids when we were not home or my favourite innkeeper, that will not happen again”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This type of behaviour, which favours friends of the government at the expense of other people, can tarnish the reputation of the government itself, that of ministers and that of  MPs as a group but, above all, these actions undermine  the very foundations of our democracy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet public expectations that were created by these previous comments by the Prime Minister and certain ministers, we must put in place without delay one or several mechanisms  to ensure transparency and accountability on the part of this same Prime Minister and his ministers. That is exactly what Bill C-388 proposed to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must prevent embarrassing situations such as the Auberge Grand-Mère scandal, the allegations of patronage  still  hanging over the former Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Alphonso Gagliano, and having taxpayers pay three times for the same report, as was the case with the Groupaction report, from happening again and again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is high time the government acted to save the reputation of ministers and that of their political party for the benefit of all members of this House, the public and our democratic institutions. It must  impose a strict and clear code of conduct to legitimize its actions in the eyes of the public. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to the bill introduced by the member for Verchères--Les Patriotes on a code of ethics for ministers.  I would first  like to congratulate him for having raised this important and serious matter of values and ethics in the House. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important matter for all members of the House.  We all have a responsibility to this House and to Canadians for maintaining the highest standards of conduct. The government has made values and ethics a top priority since its 1993 election. In my view the bill before us would have the effect of undermining the progress we have made in restoring values and ethics in the last decade. The summary of the bill states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>It is primarily based on the Conflict of Interest and Post-Employment Code for Public Office Holders and the Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament of the United Kingdom.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one  hand the bill is based on something we already have in place for ministers in Canada, a code  the Prime Minister revised and strengthened in 1994. These revisions clarified existing obligations and added new guidelines for government decision making.  Preferential treatment to persons or groups based on the individuals hired to represent them was prohibited.  Public office holders now must provide reports on the assets and outside activities of their spouses and dependants. The Prime Minister tabled this code  in parliament.  We do not need a law to bring this code into effect, it is already part of the way government works.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand the bill says it is based on the Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament of the United Kingdom.  In fact the bill only deals with ministers and not all members of parliament.  The U.K. code is just that, a code, not an act of parliament. There is nothing in it that is legally enforceable.  It derives its authority from  resolutions of the house, not statute or common law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-388 would override the Prime Minister's responsibilities for ministerial ethics. All members of this House should be proud of our traditions as a parliamentary democracy.  Parliamentary democracy means the Prime Minister and ministers are accountable to parliament, as we see every day during question period.  This includes the ethical behaviour of ministers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our system of responsible government the Prime Minister is accountable for the conduct of ministers.  He sets the standards of conduct and makes sure they are met.  As the Prime Minister has said, the buck stops with him.  Bill C-388 would  take that responsibility away and  make the House responsible for the conduct of the ministry, which is not the practice in the U.K. and other countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.K. parliament has a guide to the rules relating to the conduct of members to accompany its code.  This guide states explicitly that additional guidelines and requirements for ministers are given by the prime minister and are not enforced by the British house of commons.  That is because in the U.K., as in Canada, the prime minister not the house of commons is responsible for the conduct of his or her ministers as the case may be.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 refers to the fact that the purpose of this bill is to bolster public confidence.  I congratulate the hon. member who, like the government, wants to enhance public trust in elected representatives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, the Prime Minister declared before this House that, since the 1993 election, “no goal has been more important to this government, or to me personally as Prime Minister, than restoring the trust of Canadians in their institutions”.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is accountable to parliament on integrity in government and has taken action. The Prime Minister tabled a revised and strengthened conflict of interest and post-employment code for public office holders, and appointed an independent ethics counsellor to administer the code following consultation with the opposition on the selection of that ethics counsellor.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of the ethics counsellor on ministerial conduct is clear.  He acts independently and he is the Prime Minister's adviser on matters related to conflict of interest and the ethical conduct of government officials including ministers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government brought forward amendments to increase transparency and strengthen the Lobbyists Registration Act.  We moved the lobby industry out of the shadows and into the light.  We gave the job of ethics counsellor real teeth and strong investigative powers and made sure that his reports under the act were tabled in parliament.  The ethics counsellor can also be asked to appear before parliamentary committees and has done so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the leadership and direction of the Prime Minister the government has an excellent record of promoting openness and integrity in government. In fact one of the amendments to the Lobbyists  Registration Act when it was before the House was made by an opposition member, the member for Elk Island.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We made it possible for there to be more opportunity for policy debates in the House and have innovated with pre-budget consultations. The auditor general used to report only once a year, as we all know.  The government made it possible for there to be four reports in a year.  We saw one of those four reports yesterday.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995 we created a special joint committee to establish a code of conduct for members of parliament and senators.  Unfortunately, we were unable to get the support of opposition parties to make the code a reality. The government took measures to reform the pension plan for members of parliament and senators and stop double dipping.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the government established guidelines on donations made by crown corporations to political parties. We improved the Canada Elections Act so that the influence of third parties would not be disproportionately greater than other stakeholders in the electoral process. The guidelines on ministers' dealings with quasi-judicial bodies were strengthened.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensuring public confidence in government remains a guiding concern for us today.  Now in 2002 the government is developing new guidelines with respect to ministers' dealings with crown corporations.  The government has also taken steps to strengthen integrity at all levels of government.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the leadership of this government, the public service has taken a number of tangible measures, including the following: in 1996, there was a study and a report on public service values and ethics;  an Office of Values and Ethics was created in the Treasury Board Secretariat; the deputy ministers, co-champions of values and ethics, undertook a sustained dialogue in order to enlist the co-operation of all public servants; employee training and information modules were developed. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today consultations are under way on a draft statement of principles for the public service to help set out and enshrine its values and ethics.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is committed to restoring integrity and public confidence in government.  I am confident that our comprehensive program of initiatives has served and continues to serve Canadians.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not forgotten the depth to which public confidence in government sank during the government of the Conservatives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter MacKay:</b> You have taken it to a new low.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Geoff Regan:</b> I hear the House leader for the Conservatives commenting on my comments. We have not forgotten, nor has the public, the depths to which the confidence in government fell  when his party was in government some years ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this government the Prime Minister and his ministers have been and remain accountable to parliament for their policies and their ethical behaviour.  However beyond undermining the Prime Minister's personal responsibility for his ministers, the bill would also undermine accountability and our system of responsible government in general.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, we must congratulate the member for Verchères--Les-Patriotes on raising the issue of the integrity of public office holders in the House. As everyone knows, public office is a matter of trust. In 1994, the Prime Minister told the House that “the trust in institutions... is as vital to a democracy as the air we breathe”.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standards the government has kept since 1993 have raised the bar for ethical conduct and Canadians have placed their continued trust in the government by re-electing it in 1997 and 2000. The bill would work against the progress we have made since 1993 and would undermine the principles of democratic government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is also contrary to the United Kingdom's approach to ministerial ethics, which is what the bill claims to be based on.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I cannot support the bill.  I urge all hon. members to do likewise.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-203323"></A><a HREF="#Int-203327"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-203319"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to fulfill the wish of the hon. member who spoke previously that I rise and speak to the issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had a compelling interest in the matter of ethics and trying to restore the belief of Canadians in the integrity of their government.  I have had that interest since before I ran for parliament.  When I was elected I came here and had an opportunity to serve on, among other things, a joint House of Commons Senate committee on a code of ethics for parliamentarians.  We went through a very interesting process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must ask the question:  What is it that builds trust? I have encountered a number of people in my lifetime whom I trusted implicitly.  There have been a number of others whom I did not trust.  What is the difference?  The difference lies in judging the record.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were to think of the individuals I trust, and there are a number of them whom I will not bother to name, I would probably start with my own dear father. He is now 90 years old and I have trusted him implicitly all my life.  I have never once observed him treating someone unkindly. Nor have I ever observed him trying to take advantage of or cheat someone.  It has been just the opposite.  He has always bent over backwards to give people a good deal.  I learned from him that to be trustworthy one must simply be trusted.  That is what we need in government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all due respect to the hon. member for Verchères--Les-Patriotes, having a code is important because it restrains and controls those who are not trustworthy.  That is the only reason we need it.  For people who are already trustworthy we do not need a code because they will do what is right.  It is only for those who are untrustworthy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Canadians look at parliament why should they trust it?  Why should they trust its members?  Unfortunately we wear the coat that is placed on all of us. I heard a very bad joke some time ago.  A friend of mine said “Do you know what is wrong with politicians?”  People are always poking fun at politicians, but   like a total idiot I said “No, what?”  I should have passed.  He said “The thing that is wrong with politicians is that 95% of them give the other 5% a bad name.”  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is just inaccurate.  It is not my observation. When I look around at the members I work with, not only in my party but in all the other parties, I believe in the integrity and trustworthiness of by far the majority of the people here.  Unfortunately members of the public keep in their minds breaches of trust and attribute them to all of us and the institution itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of breaches of trust come to light.  For example, I consider it a breach of trust when the auditor general gives a report of the kind that was given here yesterday.  It is a breach of trust to Canadian taxpayers who work hard, skimp and save to make ends meet and pay all the bills to find the government has totally mismanaged and wasted their money.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to address the issue of financial management in government in a  big and real way. It  is a huge task. There is no doubt about it.  We have heard the minister of HRDC proclaim that the problems in her department are being looked at and say  she is trying to improve them.  I want to trust in that. I really do.</p>


	<A NAME="T1925"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1925"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1930"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1920"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1925)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see the results of it.   The auditor general, whose job it is  to report, has come up with all these examples of mismanagement, improper accounting, unauthorized payments and foolish things being purchased.   We have heard that in some cases  the government paid twice for a phantom report. That builds distrust. We need to stop that at all costs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also depends on openness. I am appalled when the auditor general, who I do not think has any vested interest in giving a statement or an evaluation to the House and to Canadian people of the mismanagement of the financial affairs, reports that  money was misspent or mismanaged.  The Minister of Finance answered a  question in this regard.  Instead of answering yes, that the auditor general had pointed out the problem and that they were going to do what they could to fix it,  he flustered and blustered and said that the opposition party was always looking at negative things. No, we just want to get it fixed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thing I would like to say is that we need an independent ethics counsellor. The parliamentary secretary who just spoke talked about the fact that the government brought in an independent ethics counsellor. It  has not. I have met Mr. Wilson. He is a fine man and  I really want to trust him. However the government and the Prime Minister have shackled him by not giving him the freedom to report independently like the auditor general does. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also made a statement which I do not think is accurate. He said that the ethics counsellor tabled reports regularly in the House. I have never seen one. I have been here for eight years and the government has been in power for eight years.  In  its platform it said there would be an independent ethics counsellor. We have looked for those things. We had a supply day motion that was  along the line of the motion today and the government voted it down. It said it would not have an ethics counsellor who would report directly to parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask why not? In the event that the Prime Minister and his dealings in Shawinigan are on the up and up and fair and square, I would welcome an independent ethics counsellor who is totally free of any implied control by the Prime Minister. Instead  the hands of the ethics counsellor are tied. He can only report to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister puts his spin on it, and we still do not know whether things in that area are right or wrong. When we call for an independent investigation, the Prime Minister  has the ultimate call on it. He is the one who calls on his members to vote. They vote against an independent investigation, so it is never done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am innocent, I want an investigation because I will be declared innocent and set free. If I am guilty, then I do not want it because then I will be exposed. When the government in its lack of wisdom, decides that there will not be an independent ethics counsellor, it is actually doing just the opposite of what it wants to achieve, and that is to build the trust  of Canadians in our institution and in us as individuals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot state strongly enough that we need to have an independent ethics counsellor. I urge all members to be the kind of honourable people that our title gives. When we call each other hon. members, let us actually be honourable. Let us have a code that looks after those who unfortunately do not have the built-in level of morality.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, first I would like to thank the member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes for all the work he has done on this bill.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not help but think, as I was preparing some notes on the bill, that there should be some criteria for any conflict of interest and a code of conduct. On my own I made up those that I thought should be in the bill, and the hon. member for Verchères--Les-Patriotes had covered all of them and a number more.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I thought about how I would address these issues, one has to put the proposed bill in a historical context.  The history of some of the abuses that went on in the government  that was in power from 1984 to 1993  to a great extent resulted in the election of the current administration  in 1993. Those abuses  led to a great feeling of distrust of politicians generally and certainly of  a number of cabinet ministers more specifically. That distrust has not waned in the country as a result of the promises that were made by this administration when it was outside of government and which showed up quite forcefully in its first red book. One of those promises  has not been met.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red book was very clear about what the Liberals would do to deal with some of the ethical considerations that had arisen in the prior administration, the one from 1984 to 1993. They breached that trust and  broke the promises  they made to the Canadian electorate. One can stand in the House, as we have heard tonight from the speaker for the government, and say that they  got re-elected. That is not a satisfactory answer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the level of trust in our politicians go up since 1993? It is obvious from the size of the votes we now get, the decreasing number of people who vote and the general cynicism. As the member for Elk Island said in his joke, that level of cynicism has not gone down. If anything, under this administration, it has increased.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at what is contained in the proposed bill, it cries out for support from both sides of the House. It is obvious we will not get it from the government side. It speaks in a number of ways to the point about rehabilitating our reputations as politicians in this country. It goes very directly to that in a number of ways. I want to address some of those specifically.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sets out very clear guidelines of the conduct that we expect from our ministers, our members of cabinet. It addresses very specifically what they have to do about divesting themselves of certain assets that will put them in a conflict position. It sets out very clearly other members of their family,  their family relations and how they have to deal with those. It sets out a code of conduct, and  government members in particular should be looking at this part of it, as to what is permissible and what is prohibited conduct vis-à-vis constituents, other members of this country or anybody else and  what the minister is allowed to do and what the minister is prohibited from doing. If that conduct had been in legislation, perhaps we would never have had the  Grand-Mère affair.</p>


	<A NAME="T1935"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1935"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1940"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1930"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1935)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill sets out very clearly what has to be disclosed by the minister. It establishes an ethics counsellor who    will    be appointed independently and it makes it very clear that the ethics counsellor will be  independent and will   report to parliament not to cabinet nor the Prime Minister. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  was some very good work on the part of the member for  Verchères--Les-Patriotes. His bill sets out very clearly the role that the counsellor should play.  The counsellor would  have the right to consult with individual cabinet ministers and direct them in their course of conduct. It would allow  the counsellor to investigate and conduct enquiries.  All   these points are covered in detail so there is no  question as to  the role of the ethics counsellor and how extensive it is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-388 would allow the counsellor to make rulings to a cabinet minister on  what is prohibited conduct and what is permissible conduct.  For example, if a cabinet minister has some question as to whether he or she can sit on a board or be on a committee of a non-profit nature, a charitable group of some kind, the counsellor can make a ruling as to whether it is prohibited or permissible. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill  provides some guidelines but also provides in a very concrete fashion some ability for the counsellor to be  a support for  the cabinet member who is uncertain as to what is   inappropriate course of conduct.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also deals with the question of gifts and the provision of hospitality for cabinet ministers, such  what is permitted and what is prohibited, and  it allows the counsellor to rule on them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major point  that has always bothered me is the role that a cabinet minister can play  once he or she leaves cabinet.  This bothers me perhaps because I live in Windsor and I have been  influenced in many ways by the American experience in politics.  Over the years I have seen a number of abuses in this specific area.  Cabinet ministers, both at the state and federal level in the U.S., move,    in my opinion,   at least historically although it has tightened up somewhat, much too easily between their former cabinet positions to the private sector where they are very clearly in conflict.  This does not leave a good appearance for the general electorate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bill were ever to become  law there must be meaningful and effective penalties for offences.  Bill C-388, after all the work the member has done, does address that issue.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to praise the member for Verchères--Les Patriotes for the work he has done on the bill.  It seems to me that his bill is comprehensive and it covers all the points we have  dealt with in terms of abuse over the last two administrations   and it does it in a very effective way.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am also very pleased to have the opportunity to take part in this debate. I want to congratulate my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois. I think that he has worked very hard on this bill. It is a most important issue for parliament and for the country. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to acknowledge the comments of other members, particularly the previous speaker from Windsor who consistently brings a very thoughtful and insightful approach to the debate at all levels in this place. This is without a doubt subject matter that is very troubling for many, given what has transpired in recent years and what has transpired very recently with respect to the record of the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to take great umbrage and great offence to the parliamentary secretary who continues to add to the hints, hyperbole, veiled illusions and broad strokes with which he likes to paint the former administration. This is consistent with the pathological pursuit of a former prime minister with respect to something that has never been proved. In fact we have seen probably enough paper used to cause another softwood lumber crisis to try and substantiate something that simply is not true, which  is that the former prime minister was involved in some kind of illegal activity. Yet both the government and unfortunately the  Alliance Party like to contribute to this common myth. Stevie Cameron has written much fiction about this as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I caution the parliamentary secretary because he is really on thin ice. I take some personal offence to the perpetrating of this myth because my father was part of that administration. Again I take great exception to the broad tarred brush that he and others in his administration would like to use.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring it back to some facts when we delve into the issue of ethics. Some of those facts include things like Pierre Corbeil, a Liberal fundraiser in the province of Quebec who was out tollgating. Armed with HRDC lists of grants and contributions he went to potential contributors who were on that list and said “Pony up a little money for the Liberal Party of Canada and we will see that those projects are approved”. That is a fact. It is a fact because he was convicted of influence peddling. That is a fact.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other facts to which I could allude. I could allude to the admission by the Prime Minister that he went to the president of the Business Development Bank to lobby for money for a friend, colleague and fundraiser in his riding of Shawinigan, an owner of a golf course that he  used to own to get money for that project. Is that ethical? Is that legal? That is for Canadians to judge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cancellation of the EH-101 helicopter project, on which the hon. member for Saint John has spoken in the House many times, with the stroke of a pen  cost  $800 million and thousands of jobs in western Canada. Then  the government turned around and on the last day of budget allocation spent $101 million to buy luxury jets to fly the Prime Minister and the cabinet around. Is that ethical? Those facts  are on the record.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the cancellation of the Pearson airport deal at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. There was the bold-faced promise to cancel and repeal the GST. We all remember that one. Was that ethical? Was that honest?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue with respect to free trade was another dandy. That was a very forthright promise made by the Prime Minister, a promise of course which  was reduced to writing in that famous, fabled, fairy book,  the red book. It contained one of the very subjects of the private member's bill with respect to the promise to have an ethics counsellor reporting directly to parliament as opposed to the person who could be the subject of unethical behaviour, the Prime Minister himself. It is completely perverse and completely perverts the member's wish that we have ethical behaviour.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a legion of other issues. There is  the appointment of Mr. Gagliano out of cabinet and sending him off to Denmark to avoid accountability for his actions here in this country. Is that ethical? Was his behaviour in this country prior to his departure ethical? It all remains to be seen. </p>


	<A NAME="T1945"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1945"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1950"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1940"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1945)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all done in the hopes that if they deny, ignore and delay, it eventually will go away and they will get re-elected. That is the ultimate purpose.  We have heard the Machiavellian intent and the parliamentary secretary has echoed it here again, “Let us just get re-elected”.  That reaffirms.  That cancels everything out.  That says “Everything is fine because Canadians have embraced us yet again”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in opposition have to take some responsibility for that if we are not prepared to give Canadians an alternative, a group, a party, a movement that they can trust.  Surely these things should be examined and Canadians should be reminded of the behaviour.  That has been the mantra of the Liberal Party forever:  repeat it;  it does not matter whether it is true or not, just keep repeating it over and over and eventually it will take hold.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we have an independent ethics counsellor that could preside over parliament, could examine issues, numerous issues that have arisen under this administration?  By all means.  I wholly endorse the spirit and the intent of the member's effort in bringing forward Bill C-388 which provides  for a code of conduct for ministers.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would certainly help enhance public opinion and public impression of ministers of the crown, particularly when we now see ministers in the government vying for party leadership and having campaign cheques sent to the wrong office.  We would not have to worry about the potential conflicts of interest if we had an independent ethics counsellor that would bring the issue back here, having delved into it in some detail.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is frightening is the litany of things I have listed is only the tip of the iceberg.  Those are only the things  we know about.  It seems that it is only when somebody slips up and sends a cheque to the wrong office that it comes to light, or when some talented investigative journalist brings it out, or perhaps it is something that the auditor general points out, like the public works minister  and his warm welcome to his new administration.  It was not his fault.  He inherited that problem.   The government had paid twice for the same report.  It is absolutely shocking and an absolute treacherous waste of money.  There was $7 billion we heard about in the last auditor general's report that does not appear to be too clearly accounted for.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers have been accused of stepping outside the bounds of democracy by illegally voting in byelections.  We all remember the occasion where a minister of the crown voted twice.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these occasions that I have referenced did not result in ministers resigning.  They did not result in the Prime Minister taking any action to have the ministers removed from office.  No.  Delay is the deadliest form of denial.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Prime Minister does is he waits it out.  He hunkers down and waits for the blaring headlines to go away.  He hopes that those headlines will not occur at all.  He simply ushers them off the stage quietly or dispatches them to Denmark.  What did the Danes do to deserve that?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our party's position has been clear on this.  We would require that the ethics counsellor  report directly to parliament instead of to the Prime Minister as is currently the case.  We have advocated that for some time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have to be guidelines.  We know the guidelines are very much needed to ensure that conflicts of interest between a minister's job and a leadership race do not occur.  Guidelines are needed to ensure that friends of the government do not receive special access to public funds.  Guidelines are needed to ensure that ministers will be held accountable to the House before they are sent away to represent Canada abroad, or that ministers who give false information to the House might be held accountable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these promises are made pre-election, when these fiction writers and producers decide to put these promises in print, I hope Canadians will look to members such as the sponsor of the bill to look for ideas and ways that we can bring back some form of democracy and  accountability to this place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw another blatant example today.  We have seen the massive overuse of closure.  Today was another new low where the government basically pulled a private member's bill off the table.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no wonder that the level of frustration goes up and  the level of cynicism bordering on apathy continues to rise. The government has done very little to promote ethics or accountability during its almost 10 years in office.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, first I would like to thank the members who took part in this debate. I want to thank them for their very positive and very constructive comments. However, I cannot refrain from saying openly that I truly deplore the duplicity shown by the parliamentary secretary who spoke on behalf of the government in this debate tonight.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say duplicity because he tried to minimize the importance of the objective pursued in the bill by saying that the Prime Minister has already taken several measures to ensure greater transparency and greater integrity in the system; that this bill and what it proposed to do, including creating the position of ethics commissioner, would just   take away the Prime Minister's responsibilities, when it is exactly what he himself had proposed in the 1993 red book. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it mean that the Prime Minister made false promises to Canadians when he was just  the leader of the opposition? He is trying to justify himself today by saying that the people elected his party once and then twice more. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the House is easily satisfied. As I mentioned in my remarks, they have no reason to boast when they were elected by only 40% of the 60% of admissible voters who did vote. They have been elected by a minority of voters, and they seem to be satisfied with this. It does not take much to satisfy them. This level of support is alarming, but the government uses it to justify its action, and it takes it as a sign that the public is supporting its action. The majority of Canadians voted against this government, which was  elected by a minority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals have no reason to be proud and to suggest that their action is supported by the public. The government should do its homework and take responsibility for its action before the public and  members of parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did this party, which has already been in power for too long, never realize that citizens are just waiting for a signal to renew they confidence in our political institutions?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said previously, Bill C-388 seeks to establish a code of ethics for ministers and provides for the creation of the position of  ethics commissioner, this being an independent commissioner reporting directly to the House of Commons. One might argue that the Prime Minister   made good on his promises, as I indicated a moment ago, by creating this position of ethics commissioner. But he was  very careful to appoint one who reports directly to him and to him alone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ethics commissioner cleared the Prime Minister in the Auberge Grand-Mère affair, it became clear that he was in fact a political advisor to the Prime Minister and the government, and not a guardian of transparency and federal administration, as the Liberal majority  on the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology  candidly admitted in its fourth report dealing with the Lobbyists Registration Act tabled in the House of Commons in June of last year.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole   Auberge de Grand-Mère saga, eclipsed by the tragic events of September 11, served to point out the urgency to tighten up the legislative and regulatory framework guaranteeing the integrity which the public is entitled to expect from federal cabinet members.</p>

This effort by the Government of Quebec went a long way toward erasing the old Duplessis-style political reputation that Quebec had been dragging for so long. Unfortunately, our representatives in office in Ottawa did not seem to follow Quebec's lead. They did not establish clearly that ethics and transparency were among their priorities, to the point that the government's ethics counsellor has become  a joke.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If government members have nothing on their conscience with regard to ethics, they should confidently and openly accept that this bill be made votable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I ask the unanimous consent of the House to make this bill votable. </p>
