	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture 
and Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
recognition of national co-op week from October 13 to 19 and on 
behalf of the hon. Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, minister 
responsible for co-operatives, I wish to pay tribute to all Canadian 
who have left us the legacy of a strong co-operative sector and to 
all those men and women who continue to build on that foundation.
<P>
	The co-operative is a unique form of business where the best of 
people and capital meet to address community needs in a 
democratic fashion.
<P>
	As community based and democratically controlled 
organizations whose savings benefit and remain in their local 
neighbourhoods, co-operatives have contributed to the 
development of a strong Canadian economy for more than a 
century.
<P>
	Co-operatives and credit unions are well recognized for 
combining economic and social objectives supported by strong 
corporate citizen behaviour. They offer a proven development 
model that can assist in our efforts to revitalize rural Canada.
<P>
	While co-operatives have been historically strong in the 
agri-food sector, I believe they can play an equally important role 
in the broader rural economy.
<P>
	The government has made rural economic renewal a priority. We 
are committed to forging a renewed partnership with co-operatives 
to assist them in this effort.
<P>
<B>(1005)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The co-operative sector makes a tremendous contribution to 
Canada's fabric, from building a strong sense of solidarity within a 
community to becoming a leader for the processing and marketing 
of many commodities; from breaking ground in financial 
technology to maintaining a strong base of enthusiastic volunteers.
<P>
	All together, co-operatives, caisses populaires and credit unions 
have a membership of approximately 12 million Canadians, 
provide jobs for 133,000 people, and represent assets of $143 
billion. Over the course of the year, a number of co-operative 
success stories were collected to demonstrate what can be achieved 
when concerned and affected people control the identification of 
priorities, the design of the business plan and the implementation 
process of a project or program.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has committed to modernizing its 
co-operative legislation. The national co-operative associations 
spent a number of years defining their legislative requirements. A 
countrywide consultation process on their proposals is currently 
underway. The Minister of Industry and the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food will be looking to the House to support the adoption 
of a new Co-operatives Act before the end of this parliamentary 
session. Our co-operatives deserve the best legislative environment 
to address the new global economy and their need for expanded 
sources of capital.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the millions of 
Canadians who have made the co-operative sector a vital and 
growing part of the Canadian economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour for me to speak about the national co-op week.
<P>
	As you probably know, the co-op movement has existed in this 
country since the beginning of the 19th century. The first co-op was 
a mutual fire insurance company that had its roots in a rural area. 
However, at the dawn of the 20th century, co-ops no longer 
restricted their activities to this sector. Indeed, many co-ops were  
active in sectors such as egg grading, cream processing and grain 
marketing. The fact is that, in the agricultural supply and marketing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5332"> 5332 </A></B>
<P>
sectors, co-ops were the primary promoters of the Canadian co-op 
movement.
<P>
	In Quebec, the biggest promoter was undoubtedly Alphonse 
Desjardins who, in 1900, founded the first credit union, in Lévis. 
As we know, the Mouvement Desjardins is now one of the largest 
financial institutions in Quebec, with assets totalling several 
billions of dollars. I would be remiss in not mentioning the base, 
the foundation of the co-op movement, as well as the spirit that 
guides it. Mutual help, democracy, fairness, solidarity, equality and 
autonomy are all values that reflect the co-operative movement and 
the people that are part of it.
<P>
	In this national co-op week, I want to pay tribute to all those who 
believe in the co-op movement, who support it, and who play an 
active role in it. I simply want to thank them.
<P>
	At the end of 1993, the number of co-ops in the country was 
estimated at close to 10,000. Therefore, it makes sense to say that 
the co-op movement plays an increasingly important role in terms 
of shaping our society and our lifestyle. Whether it is marketing 
and supply co-ops, production and service co-ops, or financial 
co-ops, the economy benefits through co-operation.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	In 1993, the business transactions of marketing and supply 
co-ops totalled over $8.8 billion. These co-ops had assets worth 
about $3.1 billion, and close to $1.2 billion was financed 
personally by the members. At the same time, the social solidarity 
and co-operation generated close to 18,000 full-time jobs.
<P>
	As a former member of the board of the Caisse populaire of 
Garthby, and the Caisse populaire of Disraëli, and as former 
chairman of the board of the Société mutuelle contre les incendies 
du comté de Wolfe, I am aware of the importance and the strength 
of the co-op movement.
<P>
	I should also point out that it is in the riding of Frontenac, which 
I have the honour of representing, that we find the largest co-op of 
maple syrup producers in the world. I take this opportunity to pay 
tribute to its members, on behalf of my voters.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is truly a 
pleasure for me to rise today on behalf of the Reform Party to pay 
tribute and to recognize people involved in the co-operative 
movements.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate and 
compliment the pioneers of the co-op movement. I know that many 
of us in the Reform caucus, at least 15 involved in a farming 
operation right now in western Canada and others who are just one 
generation away from the farm, actually know some of the pioneers 
who started and developed the co-op movement. This movement 
has truly been an important part of western Canadian history as it 
has been for the history of Quebec, Ontario and right across the 
country.
<P>
	Co-operatives are a vital economic component of many 
communities and there are many examples of co-operatives that are 
leaders in their field. Co-operatives have achieved success in large 
part because their members and executives are active in the 
business that the co-operative is involved in. For this reason the 
boards of directors, so often usually made up of people involved in 
that particular business, know the business well and make good 
decisions because of that.
<P>
	Agriculture co-operatives are as old as the west. I believe 
because of the farmers directing the co-operative movement and 
their co-operatives, they will always make the best decisions for 
the industry. I wish the minister of agriculture would take note of 
that.
<P>
	In the presentation the parliamentary secretary did comment on 
the very positive role of co-operatives, and that role has been 
particularly positive in agriculture. I wish the minister of 
agriculture would take his words to heart and apply that belief in 
the value of a co-operative to the way he deals with the Canadian 
Wheat Board.
<P>
	If the Canadian Wheat Board were run much more like a 
co-operative it would truly represent what farmers want much 
better. In other words, it would be run by directors who are elected 
by farmers themselves and the organization would become 
accountable to farmers. That is really what farmers want with 
regard to the Canadian Wheat Board more than anything else. 
Make it more like a co-operative.
<P>
	Co-ops and credit unions must be congratulated for helping 
communities develop and improve. They must also be recognized 
as a player in our economy that has proved competition and has 
given people another choice, something that makes democracy 
work very well.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	It is with gratitude that on behalf of the Reform Party I 
acknowledge the accomplishments of co-ops and credit unions. I 
know all Canadians will encourage them to continue their 
innovative example of leadership in their own particular business.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADA-ISRAELFREETRADEAGREEMENTIMPLEMENTATIONACT">CANADA-ISRAEL FREE TRADE AGREEMENT 
IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 9 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-61, an act to implement the Canada-Israel free trade 
agreement, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
seems to be a busy week for bills dealing with trade issues, unlike 
the normal situation where about one bill in trade comes forward 
per year. We happen to have had two this very week.
<P>
	We are now debating Bill C-61 which implements Canada's free 
trade agreement with Israel. I have to admit to being a little 
surprised at seeing this bill because there certainly was not much 
fanfare heralding its arrival. The Minister for International Trade 
signed the free trade agreement with Israel in the dead of summer, 
on July 31, when most people are about as far removed from what 
is happening federally as they can get.
<P>
	Other than a brief announcement, I do not recall any signs that 
the free trade agreement was in the works. I do not recall any news 
releases, any articles in the press or any calls for consultations with 
industry groups that might have wanted some input in the process.
<P>
	Let me be clear that we are not opposed to this bill. We believe 
that each step made in the direction of trade liberalization is a good 
one. I am only surprised at the low key, behind closed doors way in 
which the deal was struck. There should have been more 
opportunity for input from industry groups.
<P>
	We are in favour of trade liberalization. I understand the Liberals 
are now in favour of free trade as well. I compare them to a born 
again crusade; all of a sudden they have discovered the virtues of 
free trade and have embraced it with vigour. I do welcome that.
<P>
	I recall in 1988 they were very much against free trade and 
campaigned against free trade in the 1993 election, but here we 
have the Liberals doing their famous flip-flop. They are becoming 
free traders with all the will and might they can muster. I do think 
we are going in the right direction and I am glad the Liberals finally 
saw the light.
<P>
	One out of three jobs in Canada is created as a result of our 
exports. Thirty-seven per cent of our GDP is derived from trade. 
Growth in the economy has virtually only occurred in the area of 
exports in the last three  years. The domestic side of our economy 
has been very flat and we do have to credit the growth in our 
exports as being one way we have been able to grow out of the 
recession we were in in the early 1990s. I think we are on the right 
track and I would like to see that continue.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, I would like to see the next round of the 
World Trade Organization talks concentrate on further trade 
liberalization because Canada is in a good position to take 
advantage of that. We can compete with the best in the world but 
we have to have the trade rules that back us up and give us the clout 
in case we have trade harassment.
<P>
	We have heard a lot about the proposal for the free trade 
agreement with Chile. There has been a lot of discussion about that 
agreement being closely patterned after the NAFTA agreement and 
the potential for that country to eventually enter NAFTA. I 
welcome that. There has also been talk about the eventual 
enlargement of NAFTA to join the Mercosur countries of the 
southern hemisphere to form a free trade area of the Americas. 
However, with Israel of course we did not hear a word until it 
happened.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	Officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade were kind enough to give us a briefing last Tuesday 
regarding the free trade deal. They explained that this trade 
agreement is fairly simple. There is really no point in building an 
elaborate structure for dealing with a relatively small amount of 
trade.
<P>
	Our trade with Israel is really a drop in the bucket when 
compared to our trade flows with other countries; nonetheless it is 
important. Exports to Israel totalled $216 million last year, while 
imports from Israel amounted to $240 million.
<P>
	Although we are enjoying a big trade surplus now, essentially it 
is only with one country, the United States, which is of course our 
largest trading partner. It disturbs me that we continue to run trade 
deficits with almost all of our other trading partners. The amount 
we are talking about is almost the same amount as our trade with 
Cuba.
<P>
	It is my understanding that the benefits in this agreement will 
also be extended to the Palestinians. Under normal circumstances 
trade flows freely between the West Bank, Gaza and Israel. Even 
with the present closure between Israel and the occupied territories, 
one would hope this trade agreement would be extended to the 
people living in the occupied territories as soon as possible.
<P>
	I find this agreement interesting because it eliminates all tariffs 
on almost all industrial goods immediately upon implementation 
on January 1, 1997. Our free trade agreement with the United 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5335"> 5335 </A></B>
<P>
States called for a fairly lengthy phase out period, 10 years on some 
goods. Fortunately we were going to be there by 1998. But with  
this agreement we are going to zero tariffs overnight, which is 
absolutely great.
<P>
	There are only a couple of exceptions and I am not exactly sure 
why. Ladies swimsuits at the request of a Canadian swimsuit 
manufacturer and certain cotton fabrics at the request of Israeli 
manufacturers will have tariffs for another two and a half years. 
This will allow the affected companies to adjust to the competition 
over that period of time.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that non-tariff barriers for the most part 
will not be allowed. This is following the lead that has been 
established at the World Trade Organization.
<P>
	The agriculture sector, because of sensitivities from both sides, 
has been somewhat excluded from tariff elimination, although 
Canada has gained an increase in market access for certain 
commodities. These include grains, grain products, oilseeds, pulse 
crops, beef and various processed fish products. I have not had a 
chance to analyse what this might mean for farmers like myself 
who grow canola, but I think that any opportunity for access into 
these countries is a good one for us.
<P>
	It disturbs me a little that Canada continues to protect our supply 
management industries with tariffs that are as high as 350 per cent. 
These tariffs are known around the world as Canada's dirty tariffs. 
We simply must get into the 21st century and realize that it is not in 
our best interest to continue to support these. A reasonable phase 
out time to allow for that to happen is acceptable. We have to start 
that process. I would like to see it done at the next round of the 
World Trade Organization talks.
<P>
	Further trade liberalization is good for Canada. We have been 
one of the main proponents of trade liberalization. Yet right here at 
home we continue to restrict access to part of our economy. On the 
other side of the coin, the United States is using similar tactics to 
restrict access to Canadian supply management producers that 
compete head-on with the United States.
<P>
	I understand that the impetus for concluding a trade agreement 
with Israel at this time is that our largest competitors in that 
country, the United States and Europe, have had free trade 
agreements in place for some time. This will put us on a level 
playing field.
<P>
	The dispute settlement process in the agreement is fairly 
straightforward and it is binding. One of my colleagues who will 
speak later is quite interested in the whole dispute settlement 
process and will be examining that in some detail. He is concerned 
that dispute settlement procedures for international agreements are 
much better than the procedure we have for disputes between the 
provinces and Canada. It is very interesting that the Liberal 
government, once it realized the benefits of free trade, aggressively 
worked toward signing international agreements on trade.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	Where the government has fallen down is that it has not been 
able to put the same processes in place for trade between our 
provinces. That continues to cost Canadians somewhere in the area 
of $8 billion a year. The fact that we are not able to trade freely 
within our own country is a real contradiction. We have better trade 
agreements with our international partners than we have at home. 
My colleague from Vegreville will be speaking on this subject later 
today.
<P>
	Another colleague who is a well respected economist in his own 
right will talk about bilateral agreements versus multilateral 
agreements. I know there is a bit of controversy among trade 
economists whether countries should enter into bilateral 
agreements. The argument has to do with efficiency and 
production. The concern is that the most efficient producer, given a 
situation in which all tariffs are equal, loses business when his 
competitor in another country moves to a zero tariff with a buyer. 
Trade is then diverted from the most efficient producer who, 
unfortunately, still has to add a tariff to his price. When he sells the 
product to a foreign country he becomes a less efficient producer.
<P>
	The industrialized world is moving toward free trade with the 
World Trade Organization. The next round of trade talks will be 
held in 1998-99. The process is fairly slow, but we are getting 
there.
<P>
	The last Uruguay round of the GATT declared there would be an 
average 36 per cent drop in tariffs over a six-year period. We are 
now halfway through that period. That is nothing compared to the 
100 per cent drop in tariffs which has been achieved through the 
signing of the Canada-Israel free trade agreement.
<P>
	Even though these bilateral deals may divert trade from efficient 
companies to less efficient ones, they also create new trade which 
did not exist previously.
<P>
	I believe that bilateral deals are useful in trying out different 
rules and in testing different approaches. I suggest that the next 
bilateral agreement which Canada signs should try to up the ante 
beyond what we have been able to achieve at the World Trade 
Organization. We should try to get a proper definition for subsidies, 
countervail and some other things which were not achieved at the 
last round of World Trade Organization talks.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party welcome the bill. We believe that trade 
liberalization is good for Canada. We are a trading country. We 
have a relatively small population. Only about 10 per cent of the 
GDP in the United States is derived from exports. In Canada, 37 
per cent of our GDP is derived from exports. We need trade very 
badly. We need further trade liberalization in order for us to 
compete.
<P>
	Canada should be a bit more proactive in the bilateral 
agreements and at the next round of the World Trade  Organization 
talks. We could have used the opportunity with Israel to get an 
agreement on subsidies. That is what we should be looking at in our 
next move. Overall I support the bill. I am pleased that in just two

months manufactured goods will travel between our countries on a 
daily basis duty free.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will now move to the 
next stage of debate where member's interventions will be limited 
to 20 minutes and subject to 10 minutes of questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted that my colleague 
opposite is in complete agreement with the initiative put forward 
by the Minister for International Trade. It shows great foresight.
<P>
	I do not mean any disrespect by this, but the hon. member, who 
sits on the international trade committee, has for the last three years 
applauded all moves which liberalized trade and that increased 
Canadian business opportunities abroad. Generally speaking, he 
has been very supportive of the kinds of initiatives that the bill 
presents. He is unlike many of his Reform colleagues in that 
regard. We have actually seen eye to eye.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to stress some aspects of the bilateral relationships 
between Canada and Israel and remind members here in the House 
of the speech the minister made last night.
<P>
	For some time now, Canada and Israel have had an excellent 
relationship based on shared values and strong bilateral and social 
ties. Given the current critical situation, we are supporting the 
efforts made by Israel and its neighbours to achieve a legitimate, 
global and durable peace in the Middle East.
<P>
	While Canada was negotiating NAFTA with the United States 
and Mexico, Israel was increasing its commercial ties by signing 
free trade agreements with the United States and, more recently, 
with the European Union, Turkey, the Czech Republic and 
Slovakia.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	While that may have been a great idea for the Israelis, for the 
Europeans, for the Americans, it put us and our businesses at a 
slight disadvantage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Trade between Canada and Israel was, however, stagnating. In 
November 1994, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and the late Prime 
Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin, decided to do something about it. 
The leaders announced the beginning of negotiations that would 
hopefully lead to a free trade agreement between their two 
countries.
<P>
	Last January, Canada and Israel reached a tentative agreement 
that both governments kept trying to improve upon.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	While it would be my intention to applaud not only the foresight 
of the Prime Minister in this case and the diligent work of the 
Minister for International Trade, I would be greatly remiss if I did 
not acknowledge the focus of the individuals involved in the 
genesis of this idea, the generation of energy that led to its fruition, 
if I did not also underline the democratic process that led to this 
deal.
<P>
	As my colleagues on both sides of the opposition have indicated, 
this trade deal is one to be lauded, not so much for of its grandeur 
because it may have some limitations in relation to the kinds of 
business we do with the United States and other countries, but it is 
an important and crucial first step. Quite often many of us feel 
dwarfed by the magnitude of government and by what appears to be 
the inaccessibility of the decision making process.
<P>
	If members will allow me a personal reflection, this trade deal 
was really born out of a desire of entrepreneurs in Canada who saw 
opportunities emerging in the Middle East, and Israel in particular. 
They noticed that, notwithstanding all the difficulties that the area 
was having, because of the enormous influx of immigrants into 
Israel and because of the initiatives of the Israeli government to 
reach out and make peace and at the same time establish economic 
ties with its partners, there was a mini-economic boom.
<P>
	The Europeans were the first to notice this. Their companies, 
with the support of their governments, were able to develop a niche 
market that had started initially with the growth of tourism. It may 
come as a surprise to most members, but the tourism industry and 
related industries are at their most potent right in the Middle East, 
most particularly in and around Israel.
<P>
	That boom in the tourism industry allowed for enormous 
demand, much more than the area could supply for such things as 
furniture, for example, or textiles and clothing but also in the 
petrochemical and chemical industries.
<P>
	Our entrepreneurs in the Toronto-Montreal area found that, 
notwithstanding the competitiveness of their product and the 
quality of their materials they could not compete with the 
Europeans or the Americans because of the free trade agreements 
they had struck with Israel. They asked the then leader of our party, 
now the current Prime Minister of Canada, if he could address this 
at a public meeting. The soon to be Prime Minister was asked if he 
would address this vacuum in Canadian international trade policy. 
Notwithstanding the dangers that address might put the party in, he 
promised he would do it. This he did immediately on assuming the  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5337"> 5337 </A></B>
<P>
mantle of Prime Minister. We have seen the results. After two years 
of negotiations we finally have a deal.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	As well, many of my constituents who were involved in the 
initial genesis, the push toward getting government foreign policy 
and international trade policy to respond to the interests of 
entrepreneurs in Canada, took every opportunity to remind me as 
their local member and other members from Toronto and Montreal 
that this treaty needed to be signed. Not only would it benefit 
Canadians economically, it would give us indirect access to the 
European Union. I know my colleague from the Reform Party 
would appreciate that.
<P>
	It took a while for people to respond because obviously the 
details of such a deal had to be worked out. It is a credit to the 
people who were involved in this. I met them last July when the 
Minister for International Trade signed with his counterpart, Natan 
Sharansky in Toronto. Obviously there was some assiduous work to 
ensure that the deal would take place so that the new bilateral 
relations between Canada and Israel would work to the advantage 
of both parties.
<P>
	Statistics were related by the Minister for International Trade 
yesterday and repeated by my colleagues from the Bloc and the 
Reform Party this morning. Trade has already picked up in some 
areas by as much as 37 per cent and in others by 49 per cent over 
last year. Such is the impact of the discussions of such a deal. We 
can anticipate that much more will happen as soon as the 
agreement has been inked. I am hoping that the House will approve 
this today following the debate.
<P>
	In a crucial area like the Middle East, the presence of Canada 
whose reputation for altruism as seen through its peacekeeping 
efforts everywhere throughout the world would be a welcome 
addition. It has no interest except as one that would introduce 
expertise in the areas of the region that need it most. I pointed to 
petrochemical industries. The minister pointed to the electronic 
and agri-products industries.
<P>
	When we speak of Israel we are speaking of relations with a 
country which is not much larger than Prince Edward Island and 
half of it is desert. Most people can develop policy by shouting 
from one city to another, in the same way that we shout at each 
other in the House. The place is intimate, the proximity of one 
market to another is such that most of us would not appreciate the 
impact for economic secrets.
<P>
	However, the presence of Canada, not only as a peacekeeper but 
as a nation of entrepreneurs, that is willing and ready to provide not 
only its products but also its expertise will provide Canada, the 
Middle East and particularly Israel an opportunity to see how 
things can and should work.
<P>
	Both opposition parties have indicated that they recognize the 
import of Canada's initiative of strongly promoting that such a deal 
also be made available to the Palestinians in the area. I think it is 
marvellous that the Israelis saw an opportunity for a lasting peace 
with a Canadian presence on an economic and political basis.
<P>
	The bill is one that reflects not only what entrepreneurs wanted 
because it was generated in part by entrepreneurs who saw an 
opportunity and seized the chance to apprise their government of it 
and then follow it through together with the bureaucracies of both 
countries to ensure that legislation would come forward which 
would cement the ties both were willing to establish.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	We have already seen some of the product of that. We have seen 
some of the flower of that activity. I look forward to a greater, more 
blossoming economic activity and political participation on both 
sides.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you and colleagues for their attention. I 
thank them in particular for their support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no 
question that we support free trade and we support bilateral trade 
agreements that are negotiated by our representatives.
<P>
	I find it interesting to listen to the hon. member from the 
government side using such flowing and glowing eloquent 
language when describing this trade deal, but I wonder about the 
hypocrisy from the other side.
<P>
	When the Liberals were in opposition and when they had a leader 
by the name of John Turner, they ran a whole election campaign 
which caused me a lot of grief. I had to hold my nose while I voted 
for the Conservatives because I favoured free trade.
<P>
	I did not want to vote them in for another session. I did not want 
them to be here for another four years because they were 
incompetent. They were running the government very poorly. They 
were overspending. They promised tax cuts and did they give us tax 
cuts? They gave us tax increases. They promised integrity in 
government and what did they give us? They gave us nine cabinet 
ministers who quit in the first four years.
<P>
	In opposition they debated how free trade is not good and in the 
best interests of Canada, and how North American free trade is no 
good for Canada. We just have to go back into <I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
	John Turner ran a campaign against Brian Mulroney on free 
trade. That was the issue and the people over there, many who were 
in that campaign, were against it. Now we have every one of them, 
including the Prime Minister, saying free trade is great, quote the 
trade statistics.
<P>
	Thank goodness we have free trade because that is what is saving 
their butt in terms of jobs and job creation. The only reason our 
economy is growing is our trade agreements. That is what is 
making it grow. Domestic  growth is nil. It is next to nothing. There 
are no jobs in Canada. There are 1.4 million people out of work. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5338"> 5338 </A></B>
<P>
Thank God the jobs that are being created, those 600,000 jobs they 
brag about, over half of them are probably due to the trade.
<P>
	What I do not understand is the hypocrisy of politicians who say 
one thing in opposition and then when they get on the government 
side they flip-flop. I am not sure if this member has flip-flopped. I 
am not accusing this member of flip-flopping. I am sure based on 
his speech, I am positive based on his speech, that he believed in 
free trade when he was in opposition. He believed in free trade 
when John Turner was running against it. He believed in free trade 
all the way. I am sure he did because you cannot use language like 
that today, having argued against it yesterday.
<P>
	The hon. member is anxious to get up and I will let him get up, 
but I want to make a serious comment. I want to repeat it so that 
everybody understands my point.
<P>
	My point is why say that you are against something in 
opposition, then go over to the government and be in favour of it 
and in such a way that they always believed in it? It does not make 
sense to me. Thank goodness for the wonderful rebirth of the 
Liberal Party in terms of understanding the economy of the country 
and I compliment it for flip-flopping.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not accustomed to his phrase 
flip-flop. It is not part of the thesaurus that I read.
<P>
	I thank my colleague for pointing out why Canadians decided 
very decisively in the last election that they could no longer brook 
the kinds of people that were administering, in fact 
misadministering, the country.
<P>
	I am pleased that he realized that this government, this 
administration, my party, has taken all the appropriate steps to 
ensure that bad decisions were redimensioned, that adjustment 
programs were provided, that the direction required for trade deals 
be appropriately moved so that the benefits to Canada could accrue 
in an accumulative fashion.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	I am glad that he has noted that it has worked. He has pointed 
already to the impact of increased trade on the domestic economy. 
For that I thank him. He has pointed to the impact of this 
administration's approach to world trade, liberalized trade and its 
impact on the nation's finances. He has pointed to the importance 
of this kind of growth to the fiscal policies and to the impact on the 
interest rates which have accrued to Canadians, which is a very 
immediate and very profound financial impact. For all of these 
things I thank the member opposite.
<P>
	I want to thank him as well for recognizing that the country is 
run by an administration that realizes the importance of a changing 
world, the dimensions of that kind of change, the impacts of 
implementations of measures to deal with those changes and to 
bring them to a point where Canadians are very much an integral 
part of a globalized economy, of a globalized political economy, 
one in which they can look forward to a future with prosperity and 
growth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
enjoyed the comments of the parliamentary secretary for health and 
his recognition that indeed the Liberal Party has finally decided 
that free trade is an attribute and one that has been very successful 
in transforming the Canadian economy into one of growth.
<P>
	As my colleague from Calgary centre has just stated, the 
domestic economy has not recovered. There still is not the 
confidence there with consumers but on the trade side, on the 
export side we have been very aggressive. We have done a good job 
and there has been tremendous growth.
<P>
	I know the Liberal Party has done a major conversion here and 
now they think that free trade is good. Canada generally has been a 
leader in trying to put together the trade deals that are necessary. As 
I said earlier, we can compete with anybody on a level playing field 
but we cannot compete with subsidies from other countries and 
high tariffs.
<P>
	At the last round of the GATT talks which the Liberals took over 
at the very end, they favoured supply management, article XI, 
which would preserve border closures and stop any product from 
coming into the country in terms of supply managed farm products. 
Canada became isolated at those trade talks. We were the only 
country that finally took that view and continued to take that view 
although it was not one that was conducive to free trade and it still 
is not.
<P>
	We have moved to tariffs now, 350 per cent tariff on butter. 
Surely for a country that espouses free trade, trade liberalization, 
and has since after the second world war, are we not in a real 
contradiction here that we want free trade in other countries, we 
want access to their markets, but we will not provide it for the 
supply managed farm industry here at home?
<P>
	I would like the parliamentary secretary to comment on that 
question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I compliment the hon. member from 
Peace River. He and I sat on the international trade committee and 
on the foreign affairs committee for about two years. He has been 
insistent and persistent in his approach in defending the interest he 
feels he was elected to defend. I say that with no disrespect. It is 
important that members keep their minds on the issues.
<P>
	In the course of those debates in that committee he pointed to 
this issue on more than one occasion. In fact, he was part of a series 
of studies that the committees undertook and participated in to 
bring just such issues forward.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5339"> 5339 </A></B>
<P>
	The question of adjustments is not one that is going to be 
answered immediately in one debate in the House, nor dare I say, 
as we both found, in one committee. He pointed to the fact that 
Canada found itself isolated but that is part of the negotiating 
process. We entered into GATT, we entered into the World Trade 
Organization precisely because we wanted to ensure that the world 
recognizes certain standards, certain rules for dealing, for trading. 
We had to defend our own interests until we can find an alternative 
way to defend those interests.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	In the context of those two organizations, we had to negotiate 
and we continue to negotiate for the interests of Canadians. I do not 
think we need to apologize for that, notwithstanding the 
philosophical positions other people have.
<P>
	If farmers in Canada feel unhappy about the fact that we have 
defended their interests I would like them to say so. If what the 
member is saying, that defending our interests runs counter to the 
philosophical positions espoused by other countries and promoted 
by other countries to their own interest, that is a discussion that we 
can have a little later on. However, that is not what I am going to 
apologize for.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find 
the debate that has been going on between our colleagues for the 
last minutes interesting. It illustrates quite well what my colleague 
for Terrebonne referred to yesterday, that is, for almost the last 
three years now, we have been amazed to hear the Liberal 
government speak in favour of free trade in this House and on at 
forums around the world, since it was so opposed to the Free Trade 
Agreement with the United States and, later on, to the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. Thus, like our colleagues of the 
Reform Party, we are very happy to see this quite spectacular 
conversion on the part of our Liberal colleagues.
<P>
	This being said, I am happy to rise today in this House to speak 
on Bill C-61, an Act to implement the Canada-Israel Free Trade 
Agreement.
<P>
	I must say at the outset that, even though we are critical of the 
way in which the Liberal government singularly excluded the 
official opposition from the negotiations along with all the other 
players interested in expressing their points of view on this matter, 
the government can be assured of the support of the Bloc 
Quebecois because we are in favour of free trade and globalization 
of markets, which anyway reflect an irreversible trend in world 
trade.
<P>
	After the United States and Mexico, here is a third state, which is 
a lot farther from our frontiers, that will in all likelihood, in 
January, 1997, enter the group of countries with which Canada will 
remove all trade barriers.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois favours the establishment of closer ties 
between Israel and Canada. We think that Quebecers and 
Canadians can only win from such an agreement, since the free 
flow of goods and the increased competition promoted by free 
trade will give our respective peoples access to a larger range of 
products at better costs. For these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois is in 
favour of this free trade agreement, which, as I said, will allow 
Canadian businesses to increase their presence in Israel and 
eventually in other countries in the Near or the Middle East.
<P>
	This free trade agreement with Israel is designed to eliminate 
practically all duties on products traded between the two countries. 
Israel, with a population of 6 million-which, by the way, is just a 
little smaller than the population of Quebec-will have closer ties 
to Canada since tariff barriers that have restricted the free 
movement of goods until now will soon be eliminated.
<P>
	This bill, which is divided into three parts and includes 62 
clauses, will provide, among other things, for the elimination of 
duties on all industrial products as of January 1, 1997, except for 
two products for which the elimination of duties will be done more 
gradually, namely women's bathing suits and certain cotton fabrics.
<P>
	In addition to those two products, the agreement also provides 
for a reduction of duties on most agri-food products, except for 
dairy products as well as egg and poultry products, as agreed by 
both parties.
<P>
	This agreement comes just at the right moment to promote trade 
between Canada and Israel. In 1995, bilateral trade between the two 
countries reached $450 million or so, a 37 per cent increase from 
the previous year. As for Canadian exports to Israel, they stood at 
$236 million in 1995, up practically 50 per cent from 1994.
<P>
	Trade between Canada and Israel has been increasing constantly 
over the last few years.
<P>
	This is why the time has come to eliminate the trade barriers 
between the two countries. As Quebec's Deputy Prime Minister 
was saying, in October 1995, in a letter to the federal Minister of 
International Trade, Quebec, and I quote: ``[-] has always been a 
strong defender of freer trade between countries-he was referring 
to the Free Trade Agreement, the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the 
World Trade Organization-and still supports freer trade as an 
instrument of growth''. The Bloc Quebecois is in complete 
agreement with this view.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	What is special about the State of Israel is that it is located in a 
geopolitical context completely different from ours. The history of 
the Jewish state has not been all peace and tranquillity, for most of 
the neighbouring Arab countries have been in an official state of 
war against it since its creation in 1948.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5340"> 5340 </A></B>
<P>
	Certain events in the recent history of Israel are more significant 
than others. For example, the Six Day War that took place in 1967, 
culminating in Israel's victory over its neighbours, resulted in the 
occupation of territories that unfortunately has continued right up 
until the present.
<P>
	The names of these territories continue to be well known to us 
today, because they are still at the centre of world news. Naturally, 
this presence only adds to tensions between Jews and Arabs, 
because even though Israel withdrew from the Sinai in 1982 and 
from the Gaza Strip in 1994, it still occupies East Jerusalem, the 
Golan Heights and the greater part of the West Bank.
<P>
	However, in spite of the peace process set in motion in Madrid in 
1991, followed by the signature of the 1994 accords between Israel 
and the Palestine Liberation Organization, better known as the 
PLO, the peace process still has a long way to go.
<P>
	The tragic assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on 
November 5, 1995, dealt a disastrous blow to the peace process. 
This man, whose goal for many years had been to see the people of 
Israel finally able to live free of conflict, said in his last speech, just 
moments before being shot down by a young fanatic: ``I was a man 
of war, but today we have a chance at peace. I believe we must take 
this chance, so deep is our yearning for an end to the conflict''.
<P>
	His assassination led to a deterioration in the situation. Last 
spring, the repeated suicide bombings by the Hezbollah prompted 
the Israeli army to carry out air raids and bombing attacks on 
southern Lebanon. These attacks left over 150 Lebanese dead, most 
of them civilians.
<P>
	A few weeks ago, the decision by the new government of 
Benjamin Netanyahu to reopen the underground gallery leading to 
the site of the Al-Aqsar Mosque, the third most sacred Islamic 
religious site, led to riots in which some fifty Palestinians and some 
fifteen Israelis were killed. We sincerely hope that Prime Minister 
Netanyahu will re-examine his current hard line with respect to 
Palestinian autonomy.
<P>
	It may be worthwhile to point out that the present Canadian 
government constantly maintains that human rights are promoted 
through trade links. Yet, the state of Israel has already signed a free 
trade agreement with the United States, in 1985, followed by a 
similar one with the European Union in 1988, and now with 
Canada. But have we seen any improvement in the situation? No.
<P>
	We believe that the Israeli government ought now to be seeking 
solutions for reconciliation with the Palestinian authorities. After 
all, is politics not the art of compromise? Speaking of compromise, 
it would certainly be worth while to explore the possibility of 
expanding this free trade agreement to the Palestinians living in the 
occupied territories.
<P>
	The first step would, of course, be to obtain the go-ahead from 
the Palestinian authorities, in order to have the assurance that their 
inclusion in an Israel-Canada treaty was indeed what they wanted. 
It is possible that, expansion of the agreement to include the 
Palestinians would result in increased employment in the occupied 
territories, which might eventually contribute to stabilizing the 
social climate.
<P>
	The negotiations leading to the signature of this agreement were 
held throughout this entire troubled period. They began in 
November 1994, and ran until January 1996, and led to an 
agreement signed by the Minister of International Trade for Canada 
and the Israeli Minister of Trade and Industry, on July 31, 1996.
<P>
	As the party forming the official opposition, we have difficulty 
accepting that virtually the entire process leading to this agreement 
was held in secret, with no public debate whatsoever. It is 
understandable that the negotiating process itself needs to be 
carried out behind closed doors, that is natural. We know that the 
negotiators are faced with a tough job and have to negotiate many 
pitfalls and obstacles, but we would appreciate progress reports on 
the negotiations.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	Now we are not asking for parliamentarians to be present at the 
negotiating table, but we do believe that in a democracy, it is 
important to avoid any systematic exclusion of those who represent 
the people.
<P>
	Remember that the most important issue in the 1988 election 
was the free trade agreement between Canada and the United 
States, to which the Liberals were opposed. Many groups that knew 
they would be affected by the agreement could therefore take part 
in the debate.
<P>
	It was by defending their points of view and by making 
representations to the political authorities, that stakeholders, 
company directors and spokespersons for community and 
environmental groups were able to influence the tenor of the 
clauses included in the agreement before it was signed.
<P>
	During the negotiations leading up to the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, the unions took a position on labour-related 
issues and expressed their fears about NAFTA. Environmental 
groups also expressed their concerns about environmental issues. 
Although the results were not satisfactory to all stakeholders, the 
fact remains that before the agreement was signed in December 
1992, there had been had a major debate in the public arena.
<P>
	The treaty dealt with in the bill before the House today has now 
been signed. Negotiations have been finalized and nothing can be 
changed. Without repeated interventions by the official opposition, 
which managed to draw the government's attention to the problems 
that such an agreement would represent for the lingerie and bathing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5341"> 5341 </A></B>
<P>
suit industry in Quebec, decisions that would  have had a disastrous 
impact on this sector might have been made.
<P>
	In fact, this industry would have been in serious jeopardy, since 
the State of Israel imports its fabrics from the European Union duty 
free, which it gives it a competitive edge on Quebec and Canadian 
markets. If we had not raised this issue in the House in November 
1995, it is not certain that the negotiators would have been aware of 
the problem. And perhaps hundreds of jobs would have been lost in 
the process, especially in Quebec.
<P>
	Canada is now busy negotiating free trade treaties right and left. 
We approve of the opening up of this country to various markets, 
but it is absolutely necessary to review the process leading up to the 
signing of these agreements.
<P>
	The bathing suit issue is only one example of the potentially 
negative consequences of an agreement negotiated without public 
consultation. Although the agreement with Israel has already been 
signed, there is still time to improve the process for future free 
trade agreements being considered by this government. We are 
thinking for instance of current negotiations taking place between 
Canada and Chile, which are to lead to the signing of an agreement 
on or about November 15 this year.
<P>
	Officials at Foreign Affairs and International Trade have given 
us the assurance that information on these negotiations will be 
made available to us. We can only hope that the ministers 
responsible for Foreign Affairs and International Trade are 
prepared to give their approval for the release of such information.
<P>
	It is imperative to prevent a recurrence of this kind of situation, 
so that the opposition can do its job properly. Such a cavalier 
attitude on the part of the government is troubling, especially 
because the government knew quite well it could count on the 
support of opposition parties. Why persist in infuriating opposition 
parties when we could have presented the picture of a solid 
consensus to our trading partners?
<P>
	If the government really wants open and transparent debates, it 
should practice openness and transparency itself. Otherwise, we 
will have to conclude, as it is the case now, that it prefers secrecy 
and obscurity. I plan to demonstrate the extent of this government's 
pettiness and inordinate mysteriousness with the official opposition 
on this whole issue.
<P>
	Last April 25, during a special session of the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade on Israeli 
bombardments in South Lebanon, I conveyed to department 
representatives my reservations concerning the negotiations on free 
trade with Israel when it was bombarding civilian populations and 
openly crossing the internationally recognized borders of another 
independent country.
<P>
	One official of the department replied that negotiations were 
interrupted pending the election of a new government in Israel. 
That statement seemed confirmed later on by replies we received 
from the Office of the Minister of International Trade. In fact, in 
May and June, we called the office of the minister a few times to 
find out when the negotiations would end and when the agreement 
would be signed and we were always told that the agreement was to 
be signed only in January 1997.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	And yet, a few weeks ago-on September 19, to be exact-the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
informed the committee members that the agreement had been 
ready to be signed since March, and that the official signing, which 
was to have taken place during a visit of the Prime Minister of 
Israel in Canada, had been postponed because of the elections in 
Israel. This is what we are criticizing.
<P>
	It would appear that the agreement with Chile will be much more 
exhaustive than the one before us today. The agreement with Chile 
is supposed to be modelled on NAFTA. Since it will be more 
encompassing, there are many issues which would have been 
interesting to raise with Chile prior to promoting the agreement. 
Cases in point are standards regarding the environment, labour in 
general and child labour, in particular. The agreement with Israel is 
limited to goods and, as such, does not include services or 
investments.
<P>
	Last week, we met with Oxfam Canada representatives who told 
us how concerned they were with the lack of protection on social 
issues negotiations seem to be leading to.
<P>
	According to this organization, the agreement, the content of 
which will be made public when it is signed, around November 15, 
will undoubtedly not contain stringent enough rules on the 
environment and labour.
<P>
	Even though Chile is undergoing tremendous economic growth, 
too many of its citizens still live in poverty as a result of the 
polarization of wealth. Therefore, it would have been desirable, 
both for Chile's sake and Canada's, that these issues be looked at 
more carefully. This is why it would be important to know how the 
negotiations are going prior to the House being presented with a 
bill implementing the agreement.
<P>
	At least Bill C-61 before us today has the merit of stimulating 
exports and levelling the playing field for our companies 
competing with American and European firms, which have 
benefited from preferential access to the Israeli market for some 
time now.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, therefore, will support this bill to 
implement a free trade agreement with Israel, while condemning 
the fact that the elected representatives in this House were kept in 
the dark with regard to the negotiations and the issues raised during 
the discussions. It is not by hiding each of the negotiating steps 
leading to the conclusion of such important treaties that we will be 
able to reasonably debate the themes and issues that will affect the 
daily lives of our fellow contrymen.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5342"> 5342 </A></B>
<P>
	That is why, as I said earlier, the Departments of Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade should keep the members of this House 
informed of the status of negotiations, if we are to have an 
informed and responsible debate. Our position regarding Bill C-61, 
which goes in the same direction as the government's, shows once 
again how serious our party is when it comes to the interests of our 
constituents and their willingness to promote entrepreneurship.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me quote a short excerpt from the dissenting 
opinion the Bloc Quebecois gave in November 1994, during the 
review of Canada's foreign policy: ``Quebecers are not 
protectionists. They have shown it by strongly supporting the free 
trade agreement, the North American free trade agreement and the 
Uruguay round of GATT talks. Must we remind the House that 
Quebec's determination was the spearhead of the free trade 
movement in the 1980s? Far from seeing Quebec's sovereignist 
movement as a withdrawal into itself in response to economic 
globalization, we perceive it as an openness to the world''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for some excellent 
remarks.
<P>
	I would like to draw his attention to something that was said by 
the minister in his speech yesterday. I quote from <I>Hansard</I>. The 
minister said in reference to the free trade agreement: ``Why 
Israel? Israel and Canada have long enjoyed close relations. Our 
relationship is rooted in common values and shared democratic 
beliefs, the belief in freedom and the dignity of the individual''.
<P>
	Yet we have a new regime in Israel under Mr. Netanyahu which 
has taken a very hard line with respect to the peace process, a very 
hard line with respect to the Palestinians. We have seen an outburst 
of violence on the West Bank.
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague whether he thinks, in 
supporting Bill C-61 which in essence ratifies the free trade 
agreement, we also endorse the policies of Mr. Netanyahu with 
respect to the Palestinians on the West Bank.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think my hon. colleague has just 
asked me a very important question. I touched on this matter in my 
speech.
<P>
	Last spring, we in the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade had a special meeting on the Israeli 
bombing in southern Lebanon. We were  concerned at the time 
about the Canadian government beginning or pursuing free trade 
negotiations with the state of Israel, which was then bombing 
civilian populations in southern Lebanon and openly violating the 
internationally recognized borders of another sovereign state, 
Lebanon. We asked officials in these departments if they intended 
to suspend negotiations. All they said was that negotiations were 
suspended anyway, since they were waiting for the results of the 
Israeli election.
<P>
	We then found out that negotiations had not been suspended, that 
the agreement was in fact ready for signing as early as March. This 
shows the government's contempt, if I may use this word, for the 
members of this House and the committee, as we should never have 
been told negotiations had been suspended when the agreement 
was in fact ready to be signed.
<P>
	We did express reservations about the signing of this free trade 
agreement with Israel, given the Israeli government's somewhat 
intransigent attitude toward the Arab populations both within and 
beyond its borders.
<P>
	This is why we ask that this agreement be extended to the 
Palestinian populations of the occupied territories, in the hope that 
this will eventually improve their economic situation. We also want 
to improve the social climate in the Israeli occupied territories.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the Bloc member.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have been dying to ask this member a question because I have a 
concern. This is a trade agreement and he knows full well that, as 
my colleague mentioned earlier, there is a protective tariff system 
in effect in this country, especially with subsidizing the dairy 
industry in Quebec.
<P>
	We pay over and above the next lowest price we could get our 
dairy products for, 350 per cent supply management tariff. We 
subsidize that product in Quebec. It is a huge component of 
Quebec's economy.
<P>
	The member was sent to this House by the people of his 
constituency to break this country up. The people in his riding say 
they want to go on their own and they want him to fight for that. 
They also say they will be better off once they leave and that they 
will not have to pay for this expensive overhead that Ottawa 
generates. They will be able to do it better themselves and 
economically they will be better off. The people his riding think 
they will be better off if they separate. A large component of their 
industry is the dairy industry which is subsidized by consumers 
across Canada, including Quebecers.
<P>
	Does he believe that if Quebec separates we are going to 
continue to buy our product at a 350 per cent subsidized price from 
the province of Quebec, from the new country of Quebec or 
whatever it will be called?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5343"> 5343 </A></B>
<P>
	I feel that the issue of trade, of economics and of separation 
can be reduced to a simple argument which may be a reality that 
might sink in to the people of his riding as to the cost of 
separation, to whether the burden of proof should be on the 
separatists to prove to the people of Quebec that they will be better 
off in trade after separation.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	The Liberal member earlier asked why Israel. I ask, after 
separation why Quebec? We can get our product from ourselves. 
We can be the dairy industry to the rest of Canada. We can get it 
from the United States. They will become a competitor. 
Competition creates the best marketplace. The competition will 
reduce the revenue to the people in Quebec and Quebecers will 
have to compete. They will no longer be subsidized. The reality is 
they will be worse off. Would the hon. member like to comment on 
that subsidy?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was wondering if the hon. 
member would finally give me the opportunity to answer the 
question which he has been dying to ask me for such a long time. 
Since he had several minutes to keep repeating his question, I hope 
you will give me a few minutes to keep repeating my answer.
<P>
	First, I must point out that it is not proper to use the current 
debate on the free trade agreement between Canada and Israel to 
settle accounts relating to the constitutional issue. We will have 
ample opportunity, during other debates in this House and in other 
forums, to settle our accounts regarding the constitutional issue.
<P>
	That being said, I am pleased to answer the hon. member's 
question. His question is not only inappropriate, it is also insidious 
and, in my opinion, it shows the member's lack of knowledge of 
the supply management system, in Canada and in Quebec, for 
agricultural products.
<P>
	To be sure, Quebec's dairy industry is largely subsidized by the 
federal government, but the member should also know that the egg 
and poultry industries are also largely subsidized. And, while 
Quebec is a major producer of dairy products, it is not one of the 
major producers of eggs and poultry in Canada.
<P>
	Therefore, should the supply management system be eliminated, 
Quebec would lose, but so would Ontario and other Canadian 
provinces.
<P>
	Again, the member's question indicates a lack of knowledge of 
Canada's supply management system, but I will say no more.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that I do not fail 
to grasp this issue. I do understand this issue. It is the consumers I 
am talking about, the people who  buy the product. They are the 
losers right now and they would be the winners. I understand the 
system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not share this view, otherwise I 
would not have spent the last three years praising the virtues of 
sovereignty in this House. I feel that, in the middle and long term, 
Quebec would benefit from being a sovereign state, and that 
Canada and Quebec could mutually benefit from it.
<P>
	Why continue to spend so much energy arguing on issues that 
divide us, instead of trying to work together, in a new partnership, 
on the issues that unite us? I put the question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on Bill C-61, the 
Canada-Israeli free trade agreement.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party approve of bilateral trade agreements on 
the basis that they will strengthen the existing World Trade 
Organization.
<P>
	I know my colleague for Peace River has some very good ideas 
on this and he would certainly be happy to advise the government 
on various new initiatives it should undertake.
<P>
	A larger issue with respect to the Middle East is the security 
issue that threatens trade agreements and threatens the security not 
only between Israel and Palestine but the regional security which 
exists there which will have a huge impact on world economy.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	Currently the peace process is in disarray. There is a possibility it 
will fall apart. The Israelis and the Palestinians are polarized. We 
have a very important window of opportunity to help build bridges 
between the two groups.
<P>
	After Mr. Netanyahu was elected it seemed that the Likud Party 
was pulled away from the work which was done by Mr. 
Netanyahu's predecessor, Mr. Shimon Peres.
<P>
	On the other side, it did not take much for Mr. Arafat and the 
Palestinian authority to pull away from the peace agreement.
<P>
	Both groups have to realize that their fates are intimately 
entwined. History, geography and the future will not separate them.
<P>
	The conditions in the Palestinian autonomous areas are 
absolutely appalling. It is no wonder that terrorism has stemmed 
from these areas. It reflects the sheer frustration, anxiety and fear 
of these people. For example, in the Gaza Strip unemployment is 
over 70 per cent. That breeds desperate people and desperate 
people often resort to violence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5344"> 5344 </A></B>
<P>
	I would humbly suggest that economics is partly responsible 
for this situation. We have an opportunity through the free trade 
agreement with Israel to place conditions on how the Israelis will 
engage with the Palestinians in Palestinian autonomous areas. It 
should not be done in a heavy handed way, but in a coercive way 
for the betterment of both groups. The outcome of that will be 
improved chances for peace for all people.
<P>
	If we can do that we will cut the legs out from the radical 
elements of Hamas that are responsible for the bombings that took 
place in Tel Aviv. It will cut the legs out from grassroots support for 
Hezbollah. It will cut the grassroots support for the Islamic Jihad. 
The only way to do that is to offer the Palestinian people in the 
autonomous regions some element of economic emancipation. 
Hamas has received support by providing schools, medical care 
and economic opportunities for these desperate people who are 
crying for improvement in their appalling situation.
<P>
	I would encourage the government to find ways to work with the 
Israeli and Palestinian authorities to improve their bilateral 
economic agreements.
<P>
	I would also suggest that the closure of the West Bank and the 
Gaza Strip must end. It must end in conjunction with agreements 
from Mr. Arafat and the Palestinian authority that they will make 
swift, decisive and effective moves against terrorism in their areas. 
They cannot have it both ways. If the Palestinian authority is going 
to preach peace, it must act in a peaceful way. It will be painful, but 
it will have to act with its own people. Only by doing that will the 
Palestinians be able to achieve the respect and trust of the Likud 
Party and Mr. Netanyahu.
<P>
	On the other hand, Mr. Netanyahu has to stop closing down the 
West Bank and the Gaza Strip so freely and, at times, unfairly. That 
polarizes the Palestinian people and grassroot support wanes.
<P>
	We must also pursue avenues to improve the education system in 
the Palestinian autonomous areas, the economics and also the 
infrastructure development which will be required. In order to do 
this there has to be a radical shift. We cannot continue to have this 
polarization between both groups.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	A few of the key players are going to have to be brought to the 
table. A key in the Middle East peace process is Hafez al-Assad of 
Syria. One of the great failings is that Mr. Assad has not been 
brought to the table with Mr. Netanyahu or his predecessor and 
with the King of Jordan and hopefully Mr. Mubarak of Egypt.
<P>
	If these people can be brought to the table face to face then we 
are going to see some action. Mr. Assad controls Syria. He also has 
a huge sway in what happens on the northern border of Israel with 
Hezbollah. Israel is only going to feel secure on her northern 
boundary if the  activities of Hezbollah are removed and the key to 
that is Mr. Assad.
<P>
	Mr. Assad's intermediaries are not going to call the shots. We are 
not going to get any significant advancement in the peace process 
without Mr. Assad himself sitting down face to face with Mr. 
Netanyahu, King Hussein of Jordan, Mr. Mubarak and of course 
Mr. Arafat.
<P>
	Another aspect is Jerusalem, an extremely sore spot. It eludes 
me as to why this area, the seat of so many religions of the world, 
this exquisitely beautiful area which all of us in this House and 
billions of people around the world have such a connection to, is 
the seed of such rancour and animosity and the root provocation of 
so much killing. It is completely opposed-I do not care whether 
they are Muslims, Christians or Jews, that is not what Jerusalem 
has ever been about or should be about. It is not what Jerusalem 
stands for.
<P>
	A possible solution, because the groups are actually polarizing 
quite dramatically with Jerusalem, is to put it under UN protection. 
If the groups are not willing to share in Jerusalem, as right now 
they are not prepared to do, then the United Nations has to try to get 
tacit support from them to make Jerusalem a protected zone for the 
world, for all religions and for all people who follow those 
religions and have a spiritual connection with that beautiful city.
<P>
	My other point is on the whole aspect of the Palestinian 
autonomous areas and settlements. It is an absolute provocation for 
the Israeli government to continue to support settlements in the 
Palestinian autonomous areas. It is a slap in the face to the 
Palestinian authority and a slap in the face to the Palestinian 
people. It polarizes them dramatically and is only an act of 
provocation.
<P>
	The first thing the Israelis ought to do, and Canada can take a 
coercive role in this, is to: one, stop immediately all new building 
of Israeli settlements in Palestinian autonomous regions; two, 
remove some of those settlements out of the Palestinian 
autonomous regions and there will be some kind of trust again from 
the Palestinian people. The Palestinian authority must also provide 
assurances to the Government of Israel that terrorist activities are 
going to cease and desist. They will not but they must at least take 
an active role with the Israeli defence forces to come down on these 
extreme groups that are causing havoc in the whole peace process.
<P>
	Another factor which not many people are talking about and 
which in the long run overshadows much of what can take place in 
the Middle East is water. There is very little potable water left in 
the Middle East. Those water levels are going down dramatically. It 
may not sound like very much but if human beings cannot drink 
water, they will not live there. If there is no water, they cannot grow 
crops. If crops cannot be grown in these areas, there are not going 
to be settlements. This is a  problem that affects not only Israel and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5345"> 5345 </A></B>
<P>
the Palestinian people but it also affects Jordan and to a lesser 
extent Syria.
<P>
	Here is an opportunity for Canada to get groups of hydrologists 
together with other hydrology specialists in the world to help the 
Middle East try to maximize the water available and to improve the 
conservation and the development of the water tables that exist 
there. No matter what we do, if there is no water in the future, there 
simply is not going to be any people who wish to live there.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	I will close by saying that historically we have had two sides in 
the polarization. They have come together in a narrow window of 
opportunity and with great hope for the world in the peace process 
that took place in conjunction with the Americans.
<P>
	Sadly, what has happened since the last election is that the two 
groups are polarizing. They must realize that their fates again are 
intimately entwined. Perhaps they cannot live together in the same 
country. I think that is probably what is going to happen, but at 
least let them live side by side in peace and then develop economic 
co-operation between both groups. If those economic bridges 
develop, then peace will develop and the decades of mistrust and 
hatred are going to peel away, albeit slowly.
<P>
	There is a saying in the Middle East that peace is when a son 
buries his father and war is when a father buries his son. I hope for 
all the people of the Middle East that there will be far fewer fathers 
burying their sons. I also hope that Canada can take her role with 
the other members of the international community to develop in 
co-operation to bring peace to this much troubled area.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thought the member wandered a little bit off the mark in 
the sense that the free trade agreement with Israel has already been 
signed. All that is left is for this Parliament to endorse that deal. It 
cannot be changed as it stands at the moment.
<P>
	I am very proud of this country and especially this Parliament for 
the way in which we exchange very differing ideas in a spirit of 
tolerance of one another's views and a great respect for the dignity 
and rights of others, regardless that perhaps some of the members 
may even seek to break up the country. Yet, we respect the dignity 
of one another.
<P>
	My problem is that there is a new regime in Israel that has set a 
new mark for Israel in terms of respect for human rights and human 
dignity by embarking on a hard line approach to the Palestinians. 
As the member has stated, it is a provocation and has led to deaths 
in the Middle East, mainly of Palestinians.
<P>
	I would like to repeat a question for the member which I had put 
to the member for Verchères, who I did not feel answered it very 
directly. Does the member feel that if this Parliament endorses this 
free trade agreement, are we at the same time endorsing the hard 
line attitude of Mr. Netanyahu toward the Palestinians? Are we 
endorsing his view of human rights and respect for human dignity?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my hon. friend from the Liberal Party for his very astute question.
<P>
	Although we support this bill, I believe there is an inherent 
danger in the bill's being perceived as an endorsement for Mr. 
Netanyahu and the Likud party's hard line approach with the 
Palestinian people. That is why it is imperative for us to make 
clarifications.
<P>
	We should through this bill strongly support and coerce the 
Israeli government to engage in serious economic activities to 
improve the health and welfare of the people who exist in the 
Palestinian autonomous areas and in particular the terrible and 
profoundly disgusting conditions that exist in the Palestinian 
camps. If anyone were to visit them, they would be absolutely 
shocked. Therein lies the danger and the opportunity.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	That is why I would strongly encourage our government to make 
it very clear to the Government of Israel that we as a country do not 
support this hard line attitude; we do not support the prevention of 
Palestinians from moving into Israel from the West Bank and the 
Gaza Strip; and we do not support the continued atrocious and 
appalling conditions that exist in the Palestinian camps and in the 
Palestinian autonomous areas.
<P>
	We strongly demand that, together with Mr. Arafat and the other 
Middle East leaders, Prime Minister Netanyahu engage in 
co-operative efforts to improve the economic situation that exists 
in these areas. Therein lies the hope for peace.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-61, the bill which implements the 
Canada-Israel free trade agreement.
<P>
	This agreement should benefit many Canadian businesses and 
many Canadians. It means job creation which must be a top priority 
for anybody in this House. This agreement applies especially to the 
areas of agriculture and grain products, high tech communications, 
natural resources and the manufacturing sector. It is important for 
Canada to promote more open and fair trade with all countries 
around the world. We would not find much argument in this House 
with regard to that statement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5346"> 5346 </A></B>
<P>
	My concern lies in the fact that it seems like too much of this 
government's energy on balance goes to seeking out trade with 
other countries and too little energy goes to seeking free trade 
within Canada.
<P>
	Canada's international trade amounts to about $160 billion a 
year. It is a large part of the Canadian economy, so it is important. I 
want to make it clear that it is important to encourage free trade 
with other countries. Since the Canada-U.S. trade deals have been 
put in place, our trade surplus with the United States has increased 
dramatically. It has been good for Canadians. Deals like the 
Canada-Israeli agreement, though much smaller, are still 
important.
<P>
	My concern is the lack of balance in the government's policy. 
While foreign trade amounts to about $160 billion a year, trade 
between provinces amounts to $146 billion a year. How often have 
we heard this government or the official opposition talk about the 
importance of removing the barriers to interprovincial trade? The 
balance is not there.
<P>
	Our Prime Minister goes on world tours to places like China, 
Chile and so on. He makes a big show of signing contracts in other 
countries. When he does this it probably plays well to the folks 
back home. I acknowledge it is important for the Prime Minister to 
perform this function but again, where is the balance?
<P>
	The Liberals in this government, in throne speeches, in budget 
speeches, in reports from committees-I could mention many 
different key documents which this government has presented in 
the House and outside of the House-have stated that it is a top 
priority to deal with the problem of internal trade barriers, barriers 
in trade between provinces.
<P>
	Last year the finance committee released a prebudget report on 
interprovincial trade which stated: ``Trade in Canada must be 
placed on an equal footing with Canada-U.S. trade in terms of the 
free flow of goods and services''. I am sure the committee would 
have expanded this statement to include deals between Israel and 
Canada. Government members acknowledge that interprovincial 
trade should at least be placed on an equal footing with 
international trade. Unfortunately, their words do not coincide with 
their actions.
<P>
	There was only one action the government did take. In 1994 it 
signed the agreement on internal trade. It was a start but many 
different sections of that agreement were to be completed later by 
set dates in the future. Not one of these targets has been met.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	While this government deals with agreements such as this to 
some extent, it has completely failed to do anything substantial to 
remove the barriers to interprovincial trade. Yet interprovincial 
trade amounts to almost as much as international trade. Where is 
the balance? It is important that that balance is restored.
<P>
	The government, rather than follow the recommendations of its 
own throne speeches, its own budget speeches, has not treated with 
interprovincial trade with the kind of importance that it should 
have. As a result, some very unsettling situations are building in 
this country. We have, for example, the problem between Quebec 
and Newfoundland with the Churchill Falls hydro deal.
<P>
	If the section on energy in the agreement on internal trade had 
been completed as was promised by the government, while it 
would not deal with the current Churchill Falls hydro contract, it 
certainly would allow the new lower Churchill Falls project, which 
is critical to the future development of Labrador and 
Newfoundland, to go through. I am not talking about renegotiating 
a current contract, I am talking about allowing the development of 
the lower Churchill Falls project, a brand new hydro contract, 
which would really help in the development of Newfoundland. It 
would provide much needed jobs not just from the development 
project itself but from the development of Voisey's Bay, for 
example, and other developments in Newfoundland down the road.
<P>
	The neglect of this agreement has led to that kind of disaster. 
Quebecers are fair people. They are people of integrity. When they 
think of holding back Labrador and Newfoundland's development, 
the people of Quebec would not feel kindly about that. They want 
the best for Labrador and Newfoundland. That is just one of the 
areas that has been neglected. The balance is not there between 
internal trade and foreign trade.
<P>
	Second is the dispute that has arisen between New Brunswick 
and British Columbia with the United Parcel Service workers 
moving to New Brunswick. If the agreement on internal trade had 
been completed on schedule and if the proper degree of importance 
had been placed on that deal, then this dispute would never have 
arisen.
<P>
	If this dispute or another one had come up and a proper dispute 
settlement mechanism had been put in place then this dispute 
settlement mechanism could have dealt with this very serious 
problem, which actually threatens to take British Columbia out of 
the internal trade agreement altogether. That would be a very sad 
day for this country and for British Columbia.
<P>
	The third major problem that has resulted from the lack of action 
on the part of the government in removing internal trade barriers is 
the dispute between Quebec and Ontario on moving labour and 
contracting back and forth between the two provinces. This dispute 
has been brewing and getting bigger and more threatening over the 
last few months. We saw sand, manure, other things dumped on 
bridges between Ontario and Quebec. Today, as I speak, a rally is 
being planned by the construction workers in Ottawa at the Delta 
Hotel-I am not sure about the location-and construction workers 
are not going to let this issue die. Ontario construction workers  are 
concerned because while Quebec workers and contractors are 
allowed to freely come to Ontario, Ontario workers and contractors 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5347"> 5347 </A></B>
<P>
are not allowed the same access to Quebec. I think it is very 
important for Quebecers to think about this situation.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	The government of Ontario is threatening very serious trade 
action which would restrict the movement of Quebec workers and 
contractors into the Ontario market. The Ontario legislature is 
seriously moving in the direction of putting up a wall so that trade 
will not go freely either way. That means Quebecers, many of 
whom are now working in Ontario, will be denied access to Ontario 
jobs.
<P>
	Why has this very serious situation arisen? It is because of the 
lack of action on the part of the government to finish the agreement 
on internal trade and remove the barriers to interprovincial trade. 
There is no leadership from the government in this area.
<P>
	What does this lack of leadership cost Canadians? According to 
the Fraser Institute and other think tanks, it costs Canadians 
between $6 billion and $10 billion a year in lost income. This is 
very serious. According to the Fraser Institute it costs the average 
Canadian family about $3,500 a year in lost income, all because the 
government has not put the priority on interprovincial trade that it 
has put on foreign trade.
<P>
	Bills such as this one today are important. I acknowledge that. 
But why on earth not have a bill tomorrow which will deal with the 
barriers between provinces in a serious and substantial way? This is 
very important. It is so important that the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce came out with a substantial report on this issue. It 
estimated that a 10 per cent increase in interprovincial trade would 
add 200,000 new jobs in Canada.
<P>
	Instead of moving in that direction, within a couple of blocks of 
the House of Commons a rally is being planned by construction 
workers who are frustrated because the government has not taken 
the action it should have to remove barriers to free labour 
movement and to be able to conduct business openly and freely 
between provinces. This is a serious situation.
<P>
	It really surprises me that the industry minister who is in charge 
of the agreement on internal trade has been completely silent while 
right in his own constituency in Ottawa, Ontario workers are being 
denied access to jobs across the river in Hull and Gatineau because 
of the barriers thrown up by Quebec. It is a sad situation.
<P>
	There are Liberal members in the government who represent 
people in Hull and Gatineau. Why are they not speaking out on this 
issue? If they do not act very quickly and very soon, the Ontario 
government will close the border, build a wall and there will be no 
free movement of labour or business between Ontario and  Quebec 
at all. It has come to the point where that decision could be made 
very soon. Where is the government in dealing with the problem 
right in its own backyard?
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	The government should be ashamed. It has to focus on this. It has 
to look at the balance and the importance between interprovincial 
trade and international trade. It has to realize its importance to the 
Canadian economy are very similar, speak out on this issue, solve 
the problem that is being demonstrated very clearly right here in 
this city and finish the agreement on internal trade. It has to put in 
place a dispute settlement mechanism and at least give Canadians 
the same kind of freedom in doing business with another province 
as it has between Canada and other countries.
<P>
	The sad reality for many business people in certain parts of the 
country is that they actually have easier and more open access to 
the United States than they do to other provinces. That is sad and 
action must be taken on this. It is very urgent right now because of 
the serious situations building across the country.
<P>
	Pitting one province against another certainly does nothing to 
help national unity. Pitting Ontario against Quebec does nothing to 
help national unity. Pitting British Columbia against New 
Brunswick does nothing to help national unity. Pitting Quebec 
against Newfoundland and Labrador does nothing to help national 
unity.
<P>
	Why has this issue of removing interprovincial trade barrier not 
been given the importance that it should be given? It is important to 
people in every single province in this country. It could mean a 10 
per cent increase in interprovincial trade. According to the 
Canadian Chamber of Commerce it could mean 200,000 jobs or 
more, $3,500 added to each family household income, a $6 billion 
to $10 billion increase in income to Canadians. All of this could be 
achieved if the same importance were given to interprovincial trade 
as has been given to international trade and if these barriers are 
removed as quickly as possible.
<P>
	I would like to more than encourage the government, I would 
like to push it, in particular the industry minister, to deal with the 
issue and allow the free movement of people, goods and services 
between provinces, and allow those 200,000 jobs to be added in 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
concur with the member that it is very important to deal with 
interprovincial trade matters. There are certainly some 
opportunities there but that is not the subject matter of the bill and 
it is not a bilateral agreement that we have with the provinces. We 
are talking here of a bilateral agreement and the speech was really 
not much 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5348"> 5348 </A></B>
<P>
about the bill. If I may I would like to  make a couple of comments 
about what bill this is and ask the member a question.
<P>
	We are speaking on Bill C-61 put forward by the Minister for 
International Trade, an act to implement the Canada-Israel free 
trade agreement. In brief the main elements are: first, tariffs will be 
removed from industrial products of Canadian or Israeli origin 
beginning January 1, 1997; second, duty free access or low duties 
will be applied to a variety of agricultural and fisheries products 
exported to both countries; finally, to resolve any disputes under 
the agreement both countries have agreed to be governed by a 
binding dispute settlement process.
<P>
	This bilateral trade agreement is extremely important to Canada. 
For many years Canada and Israel have had excellent relations 
based on shared values and strong political and social bonds. To 
give an idea of dimensions, in 1995 the two way trade exceeded 
$450 million, an increase of 37 per cent over 1994. Canadian 
exports totalled $216 million in 1995, up 49 per cent from 1994. In 
terms of the trade the other way, Canadian imports from Israel were 
worth $240.8 million in 1995, a 32 per cent increase on 1994. 
These are very significant.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	Earlier this day the member from Peace River gave a speech in 
which he developed a theme which has been coming along about 
how the government has been slow and why is this such a secretive 
process and how come this government has not made this an issue 
and why is it not in the forefront of what is going on.
<P>
	The facts are that in November 1994 the leaders of Canada and 
Israel announced the opening of negotiations for this bilateral free 
trade agreement. On January 12, 1996 Canadian and Israeli 
officials reached a tentative agreement leading to the formal 
signing of a free trade agreement in Toronto, during the visit of the 
minister of industry and trade, of both the state of Israel and 
Canada.
<P>
	The facts are that the government has proactively pursued 
bilateral trade agreements for the benefits of Canada. This 
government has done its job in this regard.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not believe that if interprovincial trade 
within Canada is such an important issue that it would be more 
important for us now rather than to deal with partisan issues and to 
ignore the bill to move this bill forward quickly so this House 
would have more time to talk about further important initiatives? It 
is time to get the priorities straight. I ask the member, could he stop 
wasting the House's time and start dealing with the legislation 
before the House?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member talked about the partisan 
use of time. If that was not just as partisan a statement as we could 
find, I would like to see the other one that comes close to matching 
it.
<P>
	The day he calls the removal of interprovincial trade barriers a 
partisan issue it is a sad day in this House. It is  an issue that affects
<P>
all Canadians. As I explained before, 200,000 jobs are lost because 
action has not been taken, six billion to ten billion dollars lost, 
$3,500 per family. In family week I would expect this member to 
acknowledge that and to accept that and to say yes, this is an 
important issue.
<P>
	This agreement is an important agreement as well. We are 
supporting it. We are doing everything we can to push it along, so 
what he said is nonsense.
<P>
	On the relative importance of this agreement, which involves $.5 
billion in trade, to the agreement to internal trade, which involves 
$146 billion in trade, the comparison is pretty lopsided. The 
importance of removing the barriers through internal trade cannot 
be overstated. It is not a partisan issue. This member should not 
have presented it as that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to challenge the member on his 
assertions. I did not comment or take away from the importance of 
interprovincial trade and trade barriers. It is not a bilateral 
situation, though. We have 10 provinces and 2 territories.
<P>
	The member has twisted the facts. I reiterate my point to him. 
This bill before the House is a bilateral deal which is good for 
Canada. It provides a further model of how important bilateral 
agreements are and it will provide the basis for further trade 
opportunities for all Canadians.
<P>
	I would again suggest to the member that the important thing to 
happen now is let us deal with this bill quickly so that we can have 
more time in this House to deal with very important matters like 
interprovincial trade agreements.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the hon. member did 
acknowledge the importance of removing these barriers to 
interprovincial trade. I just hope he can put some pressure on his 
industry minister and others in his government to deal with this 
issue.
<P>
	The member said rightly that this is not a bilateral issue. In fact, 
interprovincial trade is a federal responsibility under sections 91, 
92 and 121 of our Constitution. It is clearly the responsibility of the 
federal government to never allow interprovincial trade barriers to 
build in the first place and to remove them if they should.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	This obligation has been put aside by Liberal and Tory 
governments for over 125 years. We have all kinds of barriers to 
trade between provinces which are causing the problem that is 
developing in Ottawa and which are causing the problem between 
British Columbia and New Brunswick. These kinds of problems are 
threatening to tear our country apart.
<P>
	If we are going to keep this country together we need economic 
harmony between the provinces. That can only come if the federal 
government stops neglecting its responsibility under the Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5349"> 5349 </A></B>
<P>
Constitution. It must show leadership in this issue and remove 
barriers to interprovincial trade.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for my colleague from Vegreville.
<P>
	During his presentation there were comments from the Liberal 
side asking what his speech on internal trade barriers had to do with 
the Canada-Israeli free trade agreement. I suggest that it has 
everything to do with free trade agreements, bilateral and 
multilateral.
<P>
	Our Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade has done a study on why small and medium size businesses 
are not exporting. As a point of reference, about 100 companies in 
Canada are responsible for 80 per cent of our exports. It is a sad 
commentary that we are not allowing opportunities for small and 
medium size businesses to explore this very important growth area. 
One of the biggest reasons which those businesses give for not 
getting involved is they say they cannot build economies of scale in 
Canada because of the restrictive trade barriers within Canada. 
That is hurting their ability to get big enough to launch into the 
international trade area.
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague from Vegreville if he sees this 
as an important restriction on the ability of Canadian companies to 
get into the export market.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, a very well known Canadian was 
asked a few weeks ago what was the single largest problem in 
dealing with international trade. This very prominent Canadian, the 
hon. member for Peace River who just asked the question, said that 
the single largest factor which is preventing Canadian business 
from doing business around the world is the lack of interprovincial 
free trade. The hon. member has already alluded to why that is.
<P>
	Canadian companies, in some cases, need the ability to build. 
They have to get the economics of scale so they can compete on the 
world market. In many cases they cannot build when they are 
operating within one province. There are so many barriers to doing 
business in other provinces which prevent the growth that is needed 
in order for Canadian business people to succeed in international 
trade.
<P>
	This is almost unbelievable. It has become so bad that I have had 
business people tell me it is easier for them to do business with 
some states in the United States than it is with other provinces. 
Some of them say: ``We are moving out. We do not want to move 
out. We love this country. But we are moving out of this country 
because if we do business in the United States then we have free 
access to all Canadian provinces and we do not have to jump 
through all the hoops which we would be required to if we were 
doing business with the provinces from  within a Canadian 
province''. That is a sad commentary, but it is the truth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to support my colleagues and the government in 
passing this bill. I believe it will increase trade between the two 
countries and generally will serve the interests of both the people of 
Israel and the people of Canada.
<P>
	However, I wish to deal with two objections which are normally 
raised whenever there are bilateral agreements between states or 
when there are agreements for regional free trade.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	The first of these objections is that it diverts resources away 
from the pursuit of overall free trade. This is true enough. No 
government has infinite availability of experts to engage in trade 
negotiations. It would in my judgment be the best of all possible 
worlds if all trade barriers between all countries were removed.
<P>
	However, generally I believe that the two targets of pursuing 
both bilateral trade barrier reductions and universal reductions in 
trade are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, while I would in a 
perfect world rather have completely free trade, I am satisfied that 
the negotiations of the Israel-Canada free trade agreement have not 
slowed down progress on obtaining completely free trade 
throughout the world through negotiations at the World Trade 
Organization.
<P>
	However, there is a very interesting and important other 
objection that is often raised to bilateral agreements. It arose in the 
post-war years when the club of Rome led to the integration of the 
European economies. It involved a very subtle but interesting 
counter intuitive argument.
<P>
	If free trade is good then is it possible that free trade between just 
two countries or within a region might in fact be bad and reduce 
world output and welfare? This is a strange puzzle, one when it was 
first developed by Jacob Viner in the 1930s. It almost threatened to 
paralyze all economic research. Here we have a world full of 
regulations, tariffs, domestic regulations and taxes, all of which are 
distorting the free allocation and the efficient allocation of 
resources as they would be in a completely free economy. Yet 
people thought for a long time that if we could go slowly in the 
reduction of such barriers, one at a time, by ultimately moving 
toward a completely free economy we would therefore be on a 
progressive movement toward increasing the efficiency of 
allocation of resources and therefore living standards of people in 
the world.
<P>
	However, as Viner pointed out, that is not necessarily so. This 
was his argument. He framed it in the context of trade between two 
European countries but I will do it for the case of Israel. Let us 
assume for a moment that right now the tariffs facing imports into 
Israel both from  Morocco and from Canada are the same and as a 
result, because Morocco is the cheapest producer of this product, 
trade is now taking place from Morocco importing into Israel and 
Canada is left out. Let us now consider that when the tariff barrier 
on that product comes down only on trade between Canada and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5350"> 5350 </A></B>
<P>
Israel, it is possible that the imports from Morocco are replaced by 
imports from Canada into Israel.
<P>
	By definition, if previously when they both faced the same tariff 
barriers, the production of that product in Morocco was the least 
cost production location, the one which served the world best 
because Israel got its product at the lowest price, therefore shifting 
the production to Canada would mean a loss in productive 
efficiency for the world. This is called trade diversion. It is a 
negative aspect of moving in this world the way Canada did with 
Israel by reducing trade barriers through bilateral agreement.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Of course, there is another side to it. It can also be that the 
reduction in the tariff barrier means that now the production will be 
taking place between Israel and Canada, whereas before only Israel 
was producing the product. There were no imports at all.
<P>
	To repeat, the alternative is the lowering of the tariff barrier and 
will result in the creation of trade between Canada and Israel, trade 
which previously did not exist. By definition again, the product that 
used to be produced at high cost behind the tariff barriers in Israel 
will now be produced at a much lower cost in Canada and shipped 
to Israel. That is what the free market says is done.
<P>
	We face an empirical question: Are the benefits from trade 
creation greater or smaller than the benefits from trade diversion? 
It is not clear on purely logical grounds which of these effects will 
dominate.
<P>
	We can see why in the presence of such a puzzle in the post war 
years economists were very upset. Logically, they could not say 
anything any more about the benefits of any form of deregulation, 
like the removal of tariff barriers, unless they had the empirical 
evidence on how much more trouble was created rather than the 
benefits that were created.
<P>
	It turns out in an examination of the experience of the European 
Economic Community, trade creation by far outweighed trade 
diversion.
<P>
	One of my students at Simon Fraser University wrote his 
doctoral dissertation on asking whether the Government of 
Pakistan had a net benefit from the greater growth that took place 
in Europe as a result of unification of the common market, the 
removal of tariff barriers between Germany and France and Italy, 
than it had because some of its exports to Germany were replaced 
by exports that previously were taken from France.
<P>
	A careful study of trade patterns has shown that typically, trade 
creation outweighs trade diversion. I am personally convinced that
<P>
this will be the case with Israel as it has been in Europe and almost 
any other country that has been studied.
<P>
	This effect is especially strong if at the same time the removal of 
the barriers takes place, trade is created and wealth increases. As 
countries get richer because of the more efficient allocation of 
resources, they will trade more. This dynamic effect, as it is called, 
of trade creation provides benefits that empirically have far 
outweighed the effects of trade diversion.
<P>
	Nevertheless, in my own mind there remain some problems. I 
raised them with the people from the Department of Foreign 
Affairs when they briefed us on this bill. There have to be very 
tedious provisions for certification of the origin of goods that are 
being traded.
<P>
	For example, since there is free trade between Israel and Canada 
but not between Pakistan and Canada, it is possible that Israel could 
lend itself simply to taking products produced in Pakistan that are 
transshipped through Israel and then, as a result of that, are moved 
into Canada without having to face trade restrictions that we as a 
country have imposed on Pakistan. Personally I think we are so rich 
that we should remove them all.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	We have to face the fact that in the wisdom of this House many 
years ago, some barriers were put up to trade with Pakistan. We 
must somehow ensure they are maintained and are not 
circumvented in a surreptitious way through the use of Israel as a 
base to ship. As a result, there needs to be a bureaucratic 
mechanism to assure Canada that all the products exported from 
Israel to Canada are Israeli products.
<P>
	That sounds fairly easy but the question is: What if a shirt comes 
from Pakistan but it has no buttons and no buttonholes and an 
Israeli factory makes the buttonholes, attaches the buttons and 
packages the shirt? Is it now a Pakistani product, or is it an Israeli 
product? This is one of the issues. Strict rules have to be put in 
place, which are thought through, codified and enforced, as to what 
level of value added in a country makes it okay to call the shirt an 
Israeli product rather than a Pakistani product.
<P>
	We can see how complex all of this is. Some products may be 
coming from Europe. Complicated products may contain not just 
Pakistani input but German input, and we have free trade with 
Germany. There are all of those issues. One of the fears of people 
who oppose bilateral free trade is that the amount of bureaucracy 
with enforcement mechanisms and dispute resolution mechanisms 
is very costly indeed.
<P>
	What we really need is to remove these discriminatory tariffs as 
they now exist where we give concessions to Israel but not to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5351"> 5351 </A></B>
<P>
Pakistan. If we had given our benefit of free trade on these products 
to Pakistan as well, this problem never would have arisen.
<P>
	After looking at the evidence on all of those matters, I have 
concerns over the growth of bureaucratic enforcement mechanisms 
throughout the world, as Canada has bilateral agreements not just 
with Israel but also with the European Community and Latin 
American countries such as Chile and with NAFTA. It is becoming 
a bureaucratic nightmare.
<P>
	There are certain influential professions which have very good 
lobbyists that benefit from all of this. They are the lawyers. They 
are the organizations that certify this is the right kind of origin, that 
this is okay. They will completely oppose free trade and say to go 
ahead with bilateral free trade.
<P>
	I will discount arguments of this sort and suggest that we should 
continue to push along with as many bilateral free trade agreements 
as we can obtain. When we are through and have a bilateral 
agreement with every country, maybe then the time will come to 
say: Why maintain anything at all? Let us move to total free trade. 
That is my hope and this agreement is a step in that direction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask my colleague from Capilano-Howe Sound since he is 
an economist, what would some of the economic benefits be of 
applying the global model on free trade to interprovincial trade? In 
his speech, the hon. member for Vegreville mentioned 
protectionism from province to province, job creation and the value 
of eliminating barriers to interprovincial trade. Could the member 
enlighten me on this issue?
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is an excellent question. It is 
absolutely ludicrous that it is advantageous for a Canadian 
producer to set up shop abroad in order to have more ready, cheaper 
access to the complete Canadian market than it is if the same 
producer were located in Ontario or British Columbia. It is a 
scandal. I do not see where it is in the interests of anyone in Canada 
to encourage companies to do that.
<P>
	We must get together and realize that everyone is losing. If a 
company in Ontario which specializes in the production of a good 
and can produce it really cheaply and sell it at a low price to a 
government in Quebec, we are all better off when this takes place 
rather than when a producer in Quebec which produces at a much 
higher cost gets to supply the government with that product. Why? 
Because we know there are also producers of specialized products 
in Quebec that can produce more cheaply than anybody in Ontario. 
So when the Ontario government wishes to buy that product, it too 
will then be required to buy the cheapest, not just from the local 
producer in Ontario.
<P>
	Both Ontario and Quebec residents would be better off because 
the products consumed by the government of those regions in most 
cases would get the product at a lower cost. The employment 
effects in one province would be matched by the employment 
effects in the other province.
<P>
	Why this simple idea has not penetrated the minds of politicians 
in Canada is beyond me, even though I have sat here now for three 
years and talked to politicians.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member has magical powers that 
only an economist has.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, does the member for Capilano-Howe Sound think that 
another country's current track record on human rights violations 
should have any bearing on the timing of Canada's signing of a free 
trade agreement?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, my training is in economics. I must 
say that many other arguments are always advanced on why the 
principle of free trade should be violated. It is not just human 
rights. There are all kinds of other considerations. We hear in this 
Chamber all the time that we must protect our culture. The list is 
very long. I have always been very, very skeptical of the merit of 
such arguments.
<P>
	We heard this same government say that we should trade with 
Cuba because the only way to stop its dictator, its gross violator of 
human rights from carrying out his crimes is to open up the society 
through trade, increased exchanges.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	The Americans of course are criticized heavily for saying it has 
not worked and it will not work. The only thing that Castro will 
understand is if he gets hurt in the pocketbook. Who is right? I do 
not know. I have sat listening to American senators and 
congressmen for hours on either side making very telling 
arguments. And because of my difficulty of being able to make 
these judgments and quantify them, I would say let us go for free 
trade and let the chips fall on the other issues.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is always 
with great pleasure and interest that I listen to economic statements 
by my hon. colleague for Capilano-Howe Sound. A moment ago, 
I appreciated the way he explained that trade should be based on 
the most attractive price for the consumer. He said: ``If the price is 
lower in Quebec, the Ontario government should buy from Quebec, 
and vice versa''.
<P>
	The question I want to ask him is: With the advent of a sovereign 
Quebec, would he maintain the same position?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5352"> 5352 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I may not be right all the time but I 
am consistent. On issues like that I like to be consistent, of course.
<P>
	In my own judgment the best thing that Quebec can do is move 
from its rather socialist current program to where the role of 
government in Quebec is much smaller. If I were asked I would say 
if Quebec tomorrow turned itself into the Hong Kong of North 
America, welfare would shoot up enormously.
<P>
	Imagine having a much lower tax rate because your services are 
much smaller. Imagine having the lowest corporate tax rate in 
North America. You would have so much capital flowing in 
wanting to pay these low tax rates you would have higher revenue 
than you have at the current rate. On top of that you would have 
huge employment effects from all of them.
<P>
	My problem is that I am not worried about Canada erecting trade 
barriers to Quebec if it chose to be stupid enough to choose 
sovereignty; what worries me is from the evidence that I have seen 
coming from the French tradition of dirigisme from the French 
tradition of big government, everything can be engineered to the 
perfect world.

	However, there are a lot of provinces in our confederation that 
appear to favour supply management and supply management 
tariffs. Would the member please outline for me what the argument 
is by these provinces that believe in supply management tariffs and 
supply management in protecting and preserving these rather than 
eliminating these. What is the argument in keeping it and is it 
hurting or helping Canadians?

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 1</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-5, in Clause 104, be amended by replacing lines 32 to 39 on page 62 
with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``104. Section 177 of the Act is repealed.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak today on this 
piece of legislation to amend the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, 
and specifically on the clause relating to student loans. In fact, this 
is why I decided to wear the crest of the university closest to my 
riding, the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi, which is located in 
the riding of my colleague from Chicoutimi.
<P>
	When an individual declares bankruptcy, the court usually 
makes an order of discharge, which releases the individual from all 
claims or, in other words, from his or her debts. However, section 
178, appendix I, provides for six claims that are not released from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5353"> 5353 </A></B>
<P>
by an order of  discharge. The bankrupt is thus required to pay off 
his or her debts in spite of his or her bankruptcy.
<P>
	Clause 105 of the bill adds a paragraph to section 178 of the Act 
that stipulates that any debt or obligation in respect of a loan made 
under a federal or provincial student loans act cannot be discharged 
if the bankruptcy occurred before the date on which the bankrupt 
ceased to be a student or within two years after the date on which 
the bankrupt ceased to be a student.
<P>
	Everybody knows that it costs a lot of money to go to college or 
university. The costs are constantly going up, year after year. 
Students have to work and get a summer job. That is fine, except 
that some students have trouble making both ends meet, and, at 
times, this is almost impossible. They cannot repay their student 
loans, which may reach around $30,000, or even higher for the 
students who are from remote areas and have to move to Montreal, 
for instance, to study and have to pay for an apartment, over and 
above their tuition fees. All of this costs a lot of money.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	When there is no other way out, a student has the right, like any 
individual or small business in this country, to go bankrupt. 
However, this new bill says that they will no longer be able to do 
so.
<P>
	Some people may say: ``Of course, students go to university, 
spend years studying and then, when the time comes to pay back 
their student loans, they can look at all their debts and decide to go 
bankrupt. And then, the government has to foot the bill''.
<P>
	Of course, some may think that, but I have personally met with 
members of student associations from Quebec, who told me this is 
not so. Going bankrupt is not an option for them. You cannot think 
that you can snap your fingers and all your student loans will have 
disappeared. This is a very sensitive issue. Yes, there may have 
some abuse in some areas, like anywhere else, but I think this is a 
sensitive issue, because what we are talking about here is education 
and that, to me, is not an expense for our country, or should I say 
for both our countries, but rather an investment. But I do agree that 
it is expensive.
<P>
	This bill raises some concerns. Could it lead some students to be 
afraid of attending post-secondary institutions? One has to wonder 
about that, especially since ten years ago students had the right to 
go bankrupt, that is obvious. But then, the situation back then was 
different. After graduating from university, it was much easier for 
students to find a job and therefore to repay their loans.
<P>
	According to the government, there are much too many 
bankruptcies today. These are not voluntary; people have no 
choice. Most of the time, young people go bankrupt because they 
cannot make both ends meet. Thus, it is rather a pity to look at the 
situation this way.
<P>
	Furthermore, we know there was some disagreement in the task 
force, in particular concerning the special immunity for student 
debts and its possible effect on access to higher education, as I 
mentioned earlier.
<P>
	So, why am I against the government's proposal? Clearly, the 
government went along with the task force's proposal without 
asking itself what really was behind this change. For the 
government, mere fiscal considerations took precedence over the 
logic of the proposal.
<P>
	Is education an expense or an investment? Sure, when we 
promise to cut the deficit, we have to make all kinds of cuts, I 
agree, but cutting funding for education may not necessarily have a 
negative impact now and allow us to boast, a couple of years from 
now, that we have reduced the deficit. However, I worry-and this 
is quite legitimate at my age-about possible negative effects in 
the long run, since education is a long term investment.
<P>
	Moreover, I think this proposal is discriminatory. The 
government gives special treatment to student debts, which it does 
not do for other similar categories of debts owed to the 
government. Section 178 of the act lists other categories of debts 
that cannot be released by an order of discharge.
<P>
	However, these other categories apply to people such as 
defrauders, convicted offenders who have to pay a fine, people who 
default on their alimony payments, people who obtained property 
under false pretences, and now the government is adding students 
to that list. Wow! This is putting students who, I think, are the 
future of our nation in the same boat with convicted offenders and 
people who default on their alimony payments.
<P>
	The government is including students in the same category as 
these people who break the law and who do not respect court 
orders. Treating students like this is totally unacceptable and 
discriminatory.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Moreover, this proposal was made without a careful study of the 
situation. All the government did was look at the figures and say: 
``The student bankruptcy rate is increasing and it must be because 
of abuse. Therefore, we will take away their right to declare 
bankruptcy''. It did not take a close look at what is really going on 
and did not take the economic climate into account.
<P>
	Some blamed students, saying that they party a lot, they travel, 
etc. Not all students do that. Yes, some students are well off, they 
use their parents' car to go to school and have no problem at all 
going to university. But what concerns me is those who are not in 
that situation and who will be affected by this bill. It is thought that 
there are abuses, so it is decided to cut assistance to students, but 
there has been no study or survey to look at what prompts students 
or graduates to declare bankruptcy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5354"> 5354 </A></B>
<P>
	Given the rate of unemployment and the economic difficulties 
facing young people, it is somewhat cynical to claim that students 
are deliberately declaring bankruptcy. Therefore, in the absence 
of a serious study of the reasons why students or those who have 
just completed their studies declare bankruptcy, it is completely 
irresponsible to introduce a discriminatory, unfair and inequitable 
measure on the mere strength of an increase in the number of 
bankruptcies among those with student loans.
<P>
	Furthermore, this increase is probably due to the poor economic 
situation in which young people find themselves, to the high rate of 
unemployment they are experiencing and to increases in tuition 
fees that are not unrelated to federal government cuts. Members 
will recall the Axworthy reform. I took part in a march to protest 
these measures. All this is having the repercussions we see.
<P>
	I could also speak about the last question I put to the Minister of 
Human Resources Development about the Young Canada Works 
Program. There were $60 million remaining and the government 
did not seem to know where, to spend them is not how I should put 
it, but to invest them. This is what makes me wonder today.
<P>
	It is in light of these facts that we have moved the amendment to 
eliminate this paragraph. I hope that the government will not turn a 
deaf ear and that it will keep one foot in reality. We have been told 
that a university education is an investment in our future that will 
lead to a job. I would agree that that is still the case and I 
recommend it. But the good old days are gone, and now that the 
economic situation is worse, we are making it harder for students.
<P>
	We will therefore vote against this bill, unless our amendment is 
carried.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raised some interesting points 
on this motion. In particular, he spoke about the bankruptcy of 
students and the problems that arise in the student population. The 
government is well aware of the financing which students get 
during the time it takes them to get a university degree. Many times 
students spend large sums of money to get university degrees.
<P>
	However, once a student gets the degree, that is not the time for 
the student to automatically declare bankruptcy to wipe out the 
loan. There is a grace period for the first six months after the 
student leaves university. No payment has to be made. After that 
first six months, if the student is not in a financial position to make 
payments and meets the criteria of the legislation, the student can 
get an extension of that grace period for another 18 months, making 
it a full two years that a student does not have to make payments on 
the student loan.
<P>
	Statistics show that 70 per cent of students who go bankrupt do 
so during that first two-year period. They are going bankrupt 
during a period when there is no financial pressure on students to 
pay back. They have a six-month period of grace and they can get a 
further 18-month extension.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	The argument of the hon. member is quite fallacious. He is 
saying that students are having difficulties in the first two years 
after completing studies or leaving university. It is not a wilful 
abuse by the students. However one has to question declaring 
bankruptcy during a period of time when there is not a requirement 
for making payments. It is for that reason we have a two-year 
period that is required before a student can go through bankruptcy. 
That is why it has been structured as such in the legislation.
<P>
	The hon. member stated that the government must remain 
connected to reality. That is exactly what we have done. The reality 
is that students should not be going through bankruptcy and 
declaring their student loans in a bankruptcy if there is no financial 
pressure on students to do this. There is no requirement for them to 
make the payments during the first two-year period. Their going 
through bankruptcy is really not reality. We are bringing this matter 
back into reality.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the opposition to this portion of the 
bill has not been raised by the students, it has been raised by the 
hon. member opposite. The students have not been opposed to the 
two-year period and have not raised opposition at the committee 
level to this requirement.
<P>
	I believe many students realize that there is reality. Students 
realize they have obligations. Many of them who graduate from 
university have one of the finest assets that can be had. The asset is 
a degree. It is a ticket to other employment. Allowing them to 
automatically be able to wipe out such a debt when there is not 
pressure on them would be grossly unfair.
<P>
	As well, the amendment would repeal section 177 of the act. It 
deals with fraudulent marriage contract settlements as being 
grounds where the court can refuse to discharge a bankrupt 
individual. Let me read a portion of section 177: ``If the debtor 
becomes bankrupt and it appears to the court that the settlement, et 
cetera, was made in order to defeat or delay his creditors, the court 
may refuse or suspend an order of discharge or grant an order 
subject to conditions in like manner as in cases where the bankrupt 
has been guilty of fraud''.
<P>
	Surely the hon. member does not want this portion of the 
legislation to be wiped out. Surely the courts should be allowed, 
when there are such fraudulent actions, to be  able to defeat such 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5355"> 5355 </A></B>
<P>
individuals from trying to take this action and prevent them from 
defeating or delaying creditors who have legitimate claims.
<P>
	The hon. member's motion would repeal this condition. It would 
be grossly unfair if a debtor could become bankrupt but has made a 
fraudulent arrangement in a marriage settlement just to defeat 
creditors. This is not what we want to see in bankruptcy legislation. 
This is not what we want to see in our laws.
<P>
	This legislation will prevent that from happening. It will prevent 
fraudulent actions such as this. As well, the bankruptcy legislation 
will prevent students who are not under financial pressure from 
going into bankruptcy during the first two years.
<P>
	I should not put it that broadly because students can go into 
bankruptcy within the first two years. They would just not be able 
to declare the student loan as part of the bankruptcy. They may 
have other debts, and that is fine. They can deal with those but not 
with the student loan itself.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	For the reasons I have indicated in dealing with the fraudulent 
marriage contract settlements and the provision in section 177 that 
would allow courts to not allow such settlements and for the 
reasons dealing with the student loans which I have indicated to the 
House, the government is opposed to this motion. It is the 
government position that this motion is fallacious and should not 
be passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I believe I am in need of a reality check here this morning.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois brings in an amendment to deal with 
fraudulent use of marriage and then the first speech is on student 
loans and student bankruptcies. The amendment tabled dealing 
with the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, the Creditors 
Arrangement Act and the Income Tax Act, as the hon. 
parliamentary secretary mentioned, deals with the fraudulent 
representation of marriage. The amendment proposes that Bill C-5 
repeal section 177 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
<P>
	Reform opposes this Bloc amendment. Before I discuss why we 
oppose it, I believe it is important for the House to understand the 
purpose of section 177 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. 
Section 177 sets out two situations that could result in a court 
refusing, suspending or granting a conditional discharge from 
bankruptcy.
<P>
	These situations are: first, where the bankrupt made a settlement 
before or in consideration of marriage and at the time of making the 
settlement he or she was unable to pay all of his or her debts 
without the use of the property involved in the settlement; second, 
where the bankrupt made a covenant or a contract in consideration  
of marriage for the future settlement of property that would and 
should be available as security for creditors.
<P>
	Where it appears to the court that this type of settlement, 
covenant or contract was made to defeat or delay creditors or was 
unjustifiable at the time it was made because of the poor financial 
state of the debtor, the court can refuse, suspend or order a 
conditional discharge.
<P>
	This seems entirely appropriate to me. If section 177 is repealed, 
the door is left open for people to commit fraud, to play fast and 
loose with their creditors. In fact, are we not saying if section 177 is 
repealed that fraudulent behaviour is okay, that our society accepts 
this kind of behaviour.
<P>
	I do not think anyone would agree that tolerating this kind of 
behaviour is a good idea. Fraud is a crime. I believe that the 
legislation should more and more point to the open and 
straightforward method of doing business that all people 
understand, appreciate and can live with.
<P>
	Prevention of fraud can be insured through deterrence. 
Deterrence keeps this kind of activity from occurring when 
potential offenders, considering the consequences, decide that to 
honour their obligations is the best course of action to follow.
<P>
	Section 177 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act provides a 
deterrence against those who would unfairly short change their 
creditors under the circumstances outlined in this section of the act. 
People should not be using marriage as a means to avoid creditors. 
Section 177 is consistent with other sections of the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act dealing with transactions that take place prior to 
bankruptcy.
<P>
	For example, section 91(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
Act provides that any settlement of property that takes place within 
a year before a bankruptcy is still open to the trustee. Section 91(2) 
provides that any settlement that takes place within five years 
before a bankruptcy is void if the trustee can prove that the settler 
required the property included in the settlement to pay his or her 
debts at the time of making that settlement.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	These measures along with section 177 are designed to deal with 
situations where debtors transfer property to defeat or delay or 
defraud their creditors.
<P>
	If we eliminate section 177 of the BIA, what does it say about 
these other sections of the act as well? It really creates a double 
standard. It seems to me that what we are saying here is use 
marriage as a means to unfairly shelter assets from bankruptcy. But 
it cannot be done under the circumstances outlined in sections 
91(1) or 91(2).
<P>
	Section 177 is needed to safeguard against people using 
marriage inappropriately to commit fraud. It is also needed to 
protect 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5356"> 5356 </A></B>
<P>
the standard that says no fraud under any circumstances will be 
tolerated. Section 177, however, does leave the court discretion. 
The courts may decide.
<P>
	As members of the House and particularly of the Industry 
committee will know, I am one of the people who believe that our 
legislation should not always leave discretion to the minister, to the 
superintendent of bankruptcies. I would like to see these sections 
tightened up. But the committee of the House has decided against 
that. However, I am in favour of this discretionary aspect of section 
177.
<P>
	There are circumstances where the court may decide that what 
the debtor has done is entirely fair, but this discretion should be left 
with the courts and section 177 should remain.

	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-60, an act to establish the Canadian food inspection agency and to 
repeal certain and amend other acts as a consequence, be referred forthwith to the 
Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased 
to speak on Bill C-60, the Canadian food inspection agency act.
<P>
	The creation of this agency is a good example of the 
government's commitment to better service for Canadians, food 
safety and that quality remains a top priority for Canadians.
<P>
	An integrated approach at the federal level, as provided by this 
new bill, will improve our overall efficiency and effectiveness. 
Canada enjoys the enviable international reputation for excellence 
in producing and supplying some of the safest and highest quality 
food products in the world. A major pillar of that reputation is our 
stringent world class inspection and quarantine service.
<P>
	However, mounting pressures including increased imports, 
changing export markets, new technologies, higher rates of 
production and continuing fiscal restraints are demanding new 
ways of delivering food inspection and animal and plant health 
programs that are more efficient, more scientific and more 
internationally compatible.
<P>
	Today one-quarter of Canada's food production goes for export 
while one-fifth of the food we eat is imported. As part of our 
responsibility for ensuring a safe food supply for Canadians, we are 
involved in more than 1,000 inspection and quarantine agreements 
worldwide.
<P>
	Here in Canada an integral network of responsibilities has 
developed over the years covering food production, manufacturing, 
distribution, retail, import and export and involving industry at all 
levels and government.
<P>
	At the federal level, three different departments have roles to 
play, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Health Canada and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5357"> 5357 </A></B>
<P>
Fisheries and Oceans Canada. The introduction of this bill 
represents an innovative step forward by the Canadian government 
in its desire to get things right.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance announced in the 1996 budget, Bill 
C-60 proposes the creation of a Canadian food inspection agency to 
be responsible for delivering and enforcing all federally mandated 
inspection and quarantine services and animal and plant health 
programs.
<P>
	The agency, which could be up and running by early 1997, will 
be a stand alone organization reporting to the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food. At the same time, responsibility for 
setting food safety standards and auditing the enforcement of food 
safety regulations will be consolidated and enhanced within Health 
Canada. This re-organization will have many benefits for all 
stakeholders in the food sector, consumers, industry and 
governments.
<P>
	It will reduce overlap and duplication between the federal 
departments and set the stage for a more integrated Canadian food 
inspection and quarantine service. It will provide a single focal 
point for food inspection and quarantine services and help make the 
government more responsive to the needs of its clients. It will 
ensure the continued safety of Canada's food supply and help 
maintain our international reputation for safety and quality. It will 
facilitate the use of more efficient and up to date food inspection 
and quarantine technologies, and it will help lay the foundation for 
enhanced Canadian access to critical import international 
marketplace.
<P>
	Federal food inspection services and animal and plant health 
programs currently involve over 5,000 people and cost more than 
$400 million a year. Consolidating these services in a single agency 
will allow us to achieve savings of $44 million annually and will 
make it easier for the industry, the provinces and the consumers to 
deal with the Government of Canada on food inspect and 
quarantine matters.
<P>
	Let me underline that food safety will continue to be our top 
priority. In fact, the fundamental principle of this re-organization is 
that food safety cannot and will not be compromised. This means 
that Canadians will be assured of continuing high safety standards 
and stringent enforcement of our food safety regulations.
<P>
	At the same time, the new agency will bring a more unified 
approach to enforcement of federal food inspection and quarantine 
regulations across this country. The agency will also help Canadian 
food firms implement a hazard analysis and a critical control point 
for the HACCP system.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Canada is a world leader in the implementation of HACCP 
which is internationally recognized as the best system available to 
ensure the safety of food products. Our department has $11 million 
in adaptation funding to help small and medium size businesses 
adapt to the system.
<P>
	By continuing under the new agency to move to more scientific 
and updated systems such as HACCP we will achieve greater 
assurance of food safety for Canadians and improve international 
market access for Canadian businesses. That market access is 
another very important benefit of the new agency.
<P>
	With more liberal trading agreements such as NAFTA and the 
World Trade Organization as well as rapid population and income 
growth in developing regions like Asia Pacific, international trade 
in all food products is booming. The Canadian food inspection 
agency will ensure that exporters of different types of food 
products will be able to deal with one contact for inspection and 
quarantine services.
<P>
	By moving forward with harmonization of international 
standards the agency will help improve the compatibility of food 
inspection and quarantine requirements and reduce the possibility 
of artificial trade barriers based on sanitary and phyto-sanitary 
measures, an increasing problem for Canadian exporters.
<P>
	These changes in the federal food inspection and quarantine 
services are the result of two years of extensive consultations with 
industry and the provinces. Over 60,000 newsletters and fact sheets 
have been distributed to stakeholders around the country. The 
proposed agency has received widespread support from the private 
sector and provinces.
<P>
	At our annual meeting in July, federal, provincial and territorial 
agriculture ministers not only offered unanimous support for the 
Canadian food inspection agency, they also endorsed further 
development of a more comprehensive Canadian food inspection 
system that would involve all levels of government and which 
would respect appropriate governmental jurisdictions.
<P>
	A Canadian food inspection system implementation group of 
federal, provincial, territorial and municipal representatives is now 
working with the industry in a variety of other areas which include 
the national dairy code, a food retail established code, a meat, 
poultry and fish code, and a transportation practices protocol.
<P>
	The drive toward a Canadian food inspection system, one of 
eight initiatives to improve and strengthen the efficiency of our 
Canadian federation, was highlighted by the first ministers last 
June as the leading example of how we are renewing the Canadian 
federation and improving the way that provinces and the Canadian 
government work together in the best interests of all citizens.
<P>
	As we continue to move forward on the long overdue 
reorganization of Canada's food inspection and quarantine 
services, our challenge and our commitment  is to ensure that 
Canada maintains 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5358"> 5358 </A></B>
<P>
its high standards of food safety and quality while improving the 
efficiency and reducing the cost to the taxpayer.
<P>
	I believe the creation of the Canadian food inspection agency 
will be a major step in that direction.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
are certain positive elements in Bill C-60, an act to establish the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency and to repeal and amend other 
Acts as a consequence, which we are looking at this afternoon.
<P>
	The idea of creating a national agency is a good one in itself. 
Reducing the duplication in services of the three departments, 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Health Canada and Fisheries 
and Oceans Canada will bring about savings.
<P>
	We in the Bloc have long been calling for elimination of the 
duplication between the various departments. However, the 
Liberals' strategy of referring this bill to a committee before 
second reading prevents us from making any constructive 
amendments to Bill C-60 at this point.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	For instance, there seems to be some latent patronage with 
respect to the appointment of agency executives. Under clause 5, 
the president and the executive vice-president shall be appointed by 
the governor in council.
<P>
	We all know what it means when someone is appointed by the 
governor in council. These are friends of the government, like 
former minister André Ouellet, for instance, and we can refer to 
him by name since he has left the House, who was appointed to an 
executive position with a fantastic salary. The process is not 
exactly transparent.
<P>
	Appointments should be made in accordance with the rules of 
the House and should be examined before the Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food. Staff should be hired on the basis of 
competence, not on a partisan basis. Just because someone is a 
card-carrying member of the Liberal Party does not mean he is 
competent. Of course, just because someone is a card-carrying 
member does not mean he is incompetent, but being a member of 
the party should not be a <I>conditio sine qua non</I>.
<P>
	So the Bloc Quebecois cannot give its approval to what is, in 
fact, an opportunity for patronage, because it would also mean 
approving of government interference in areas under provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Still on the subject of political appointments, we can read the 
following in clause 10 of Bill C-60:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>10.(1) The Minister shall appoint an advisory board of not more than twelve 
members to hold office during pleasure for a term not exceeding three years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Again, this is unacceptable, for two reasons. First, here again it 
is the minister who appoints those who will sit on the advisory 
board. Second, this means that Quebec has no guarantees as to its 
representation on this board.
<P>
	A little further we read in clauses 12 and 13:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>12. The Agency is a separate employer under the Public Service Staff Relations 
Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
However, in clause 13, it says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>13.(1) The President has the authority to appoint the employees of the Agency.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Now, the president is appointed on a partisan basis, and he is 
supposed to appoint the employees of the agency. We will have to 
see how these appointments are made and whether the process is 
politically proper.
<P>
	In clause 16, we read that the agency may procure goods and 
services from outside the public service, including legal services.
<P>
	Of course these bills are drafted by lawyers, and a good lawyer 
looks after his own. So the agency will be able to procure legal 
services as it sees fit.
<P>
	In clauses 20 and 21 there are two more issues we could raise. 
First, if federal agreements are entered into, we must ensure that 
Quebec does not end up in a position where it indirectly subsidizes 
the food inspection services obtained from the federal government 
by a province or provinces.
<P>
	If a service is provided to another province by the federal 
government, it will be necessary to ensure that the work done in 
this province is not done with federal money. Otherwise, Quebec 
taxpayers will be paying for services in other provinces.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Two examples come to mind, including the RCMP. Everyone 
knows that, in Canada, two provinces-Quebec and Ontario-have 
their own police force: the OPP in Ontario and the SQ in Quebec, 
while the federal government, through the RCMP, provides police 
services to municipalities and also to other provinces. Well, do you 
know, dear colleagues, that Quebec foots part of the bill for the 
services rendered by the RCMP in the maritimes and in the western 
provinces? Ontario does also.
<P>
	The federal government recovers only about 75 per cent of the 
real costs of the services provided, through the RCMP, to provinces 
and municipalities. The other 25 per cent are paid by all the 
provinces, including, of course, Quebec and Ontario. Since Quebec 
pays 24 per cent of federal taxes, it can be assumed that, we are 
subsidizing 24 per cent of that 25 per cent for RCMP services in 
provinces and territories other than Quebec and Ontario. This is an 
example of unfair treatment.
<P>
	Similarly, Quebec, which harmonized its sales tax with the 
federal GST four years ago, must again pay 24 per  cent of the $960 
million which the federal government gave to the maritimes so 
they could harmonize their provincial sales tax with the GST, while 
we got nothing. We did not get a cent to harmonize our sales tax 
with the GST.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5359"> 5359 </A></B>
<P>
	Those are two examples of unfair treatment. This agency should 
not be a further source of unfairness.
<P>
	Secondly, care must be taken to ensure that clause 71 does not 
open the door to any other form of federal interference in areas 
under provincial jurisdiction. The Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture said, and I quote: ``Bill C-60 states that the 
compensation to be paid to cattle owners following the destruction 
of their animals or things under the Health of Animals Act must be 
taken from the Consolidated Revenue Fund''.
<P>
	For example, if your herd is hit by brucellosis and a decision is 
made to destroy the whole herd, the Consolidated Revenue Fund 
must compensate the loss. The CFA goes even farther, considering 
that the cost incurred for cure, quarantine, cleaning and 
replacement of damaged or destroyed goods, restocking, etc., 
should be included and mentioned in the bill, and included in 
clause 71. Such a clause will guarantee that farmers will not be 
disadvantaged because they reported their cattle to be ill.
<P>
	As agriculture critic, I worked with a farmer living near 
Rivière-du-Loup whose flock developed scrapie. The quarantine 
imposed was not 40 days, as most Canadians probably think, but 
five years. During this time, the farmer could not sell, kill, eat or 
make money in any way with his sheep. Most farmers must 
withdraw from business when confronted to that situation.
<P>
	That is why the Bloc Quebecois will propose a series of 
amendments to Bill C-60 to try to improve it. We will also invite 
the government party to co-operate so this bill will benefit the 
general public.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to make a few comments on this bill.
<P>
	This is a bill which if passed will implement a food inspection 
agency that should be streamlined somewhat. What really scares 
me is that the agriculture minister is going to be in control of this 
agency. When I see that it has taken three years for the agriculture 
minister to decide that we are going to have a referendum on barley 
marketing and within those three years he still has not been able to 
come up with a proper question on what to ask farmers, I am just 
wondering how he is going to regulate this big agency and how cost 
effective it will be.
<P>
	When the new agency comes into effect in 1997 it will become 
one of Ottawa's largest bureaucracies with 4,500 employees and a 
budget of $300 million. That is a lot of  peanuts, $300 million for a 
regulatory body. When we look at deficit reduction and we look at 
the total debt in this country of $600 billion I guess it is the 
Liberals' idea that another $300 million is not that significant.
<P>
	Federal officials contend that ending the interdepartmental 
overlap and duplication in such areas as enforcement, risk 
management, laboratory services, informatic systems and 
communications will save taxpayers $44 million annually starting 
in 1998-99. It always astounds me that whenever we see 
projections and they are somewhat down the road we can usually 
expect that somehow the manipulation of the system will be there 
so that they can come within that figure even when it means 
transferring costs to other agencies. However the detailed 
breakdown of this estimate has not yet been provided by the 
government. That is interesting.
<P>
	Also, no decisions have been made on the staff reductions or 
details given on the new agency's surplus laboratories. There is a 
lot of money involved in those laboratories. What is going to 
happen to them is a big question. I hope the government finally 
realizes that if there is going to be disposable assets that it gets a 
fair market value for them.
<P>
	Although the Reform Party supports consolidating and 
downsizing the operations of the federal government, we fear that 
this bill will accomplish little except to shuffle names and titles. 
Instead the government should be considering the advantages of 
privatizing a significant portion of Canada's food, plant and animal 
inspection services.
<P>
	This is one of the big issues we have been debating for the last 
three years, harmonizing and privatizing. We know that each 
province has its own inspection services and there is always 
conflict between the two agencies. It is time we realized that 
harmonization has to happen or the conflict will increase and we 
will spend more dollars instead of less.
<P>
	Only $40 million or 13.3 per cent of the agency's $300 million 
budget is currently cost recovered. The agency already plans to 
dramatically increase this amount to more than $70 million. We 
know who is going to bear these costs. It is going to be the 
taxpayer, the processor or the primary producer. It is tremendously 
important that we start downsizing and becoming more efficient 
and productive in these agencies as well as in our food processing 
and primary production.
<P>
	Where the Reform Party supports user pay and cost recovery, the 
cost of the service must reflect the true costs of providing the 
service and not the added expense of maintaining the government 
bureaucracy. The bill should ensure that a greater priority is placed 
on cost avoidance and cost reduction. This is important as the 
agency created by this bill will be responsible for enforcing and 
administrating several federal statutes which regulate food, animal 
and plant health and related products. These include the Feed Act, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5360"> 5360 </A></B>
<P>
the Fertilizer Act, the Health of Animals Act, the Meat Inspection 
Act, the Plant Breeders Rights Act and the Seeds Act.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	This bill will also continue to centralize authority for food 
inspection in the hands of the federal government. The Reform 
Party believes the government should acknowledge that since the 
provinces already provide many of these same inspection services, 
the emphasis should be on decentralization and encouraging 
common inspection standards.
<P>
	For these reasons the Reform Party opposes the bill.
<P>
	Turning to the bill itself, we have specific concerns. Provisions 
in the bill seem to create an environment for empire building.
<P>
	Clause 5 of the bill states that the governor in council shall 
appoint a president and an executive vice-president to the new 
agency. These individuals will be responsible for the day to day 
operations of the agency and will provide advice to the minister on 
matters relating to the mandate of the agency. There is no mention 
of the qualifications which will be required by these people. This 
type of situation opens itself up to pork barrel politics.
<P>
	Clause 8 of the bill states that the president and the executive 
vice-president shall be paid such remuneration as is fixed by the 
governor in council. We do not even know the salary amounts for 
these two positions.
<P>
	Clause 10 states that each member of the advisory board shall be 
paid such fees for his or her services as are fixed by the minister. 
Again, we cannot tell Canadian taxpayers how much they will be 
paying for these salaries.
<P>
	This is a very good example of what we are experiencing with 
the Canadian Wheat Board. We have appointed commissioners 
who have received severance packages. We do not know what those 
severance packages are. There are positions which have pension 
plans and nobody really knows what the cost is. When I look at this 
regulatory agency which is being set up very much like the 
Canadian Wheat Board, I find it to be scary.
<P>
	I know also that the Manitoba food inspection agency is always 
in conflict with the federal agency. It is costing us jobs. It is costing 
us exports. For example, there is a small sausage manufacturing 
plant in my constituency. The manufacturer is allowed to sell his 
product all across Manitoba; however, he cannot sell it to federal 
agencies, such as CN or the military. I do not know why it would 
pose a health risk to the federal agencies; Manitobans eat the 
sausage and it is delicious. I am told that we could save almost a 
dollar a kilogram if people in the federal agencies ate the Manitoba 
sausage instead of importing sausages from federal agencies in a 
different province.
<P>
	If we want to become efficient and if we want to harmonize, we 
do not have to harmonize just with foreign countries, we have to 
harmonize within our own boundaries. We have to make sure it is 
cost effective and that the taxpayer as well as the primary producer 
gets the benefit. We should also give a break to the processors. 
They are the people who are creating the jobs. It is the small 
businessmen and the entrepreneurs who really make this industrial 
machine work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture 
and Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to rise today, on behalf of the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans, to speak to the motion requesting that Bill C-60, an act to 
establish the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, be referred to the 
Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food before second 
reading.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	This bill is the starting point of a very important journey. The 
plans for the trip began in March 1996, when we were preparing the 
budget speech; at that moment, our government stated for the first 
time its commitment to establish an agenda aimed at finding 
alternative solutions for the delivery of programmes, at finding the 
most efficient and least expensive way to carry out programs and 
provide services.
<P>
	This journey is an important part of that agenda and it will lead 
us to the creation of a unique food inspection agency, gathering 
under one roof all the activities previously performed by three 
different federal departments. Our government knows some of the 
important port of calls where it will have to stop along the way.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian fishery is an important contributor to national 
import and export activities. In addition to considerable domestic 
consumption of Canadian fish and fish products, substantial 
markets exist for Canadian products abroad. Fully 84 per cent of 
fish and seafood caught by Canadians is destined for foreign 
markets.
<P>
	Similarly, markets exist within Canada for fish species that are 
not indigenous to Canadian waters. Some 50 per cent of the fish 
and seafood consumed in Canada is imported. To support these 
high import and export figures and to promote confidence both at 
home and overseas in fish destined for human consumption, this 
government is committed to ensuring that fish inspection policies 
within this new agency retain the prominence and the high 
standards that they now have as part of fisheries and oceans.
<P>
	In order for any food inspection service to meet the needs of its 
many client groups not the least of which are consumers, ensuring 
food safety for all Canadians must be the first priority. A new 
agency must uphold the excellent reputation of existing inspection 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5361"> 5361 </A></B>
<P>
services to ensure the safety of products consumed by the Canadian 
public whether these products originate in Canada or elsewhere.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As we know, since at least 84 per cent of all fish caught in 
Canada is destined for foreign consumers, a new inspection agency 
will also have to improve and guarantee access to foreign markets 
for our products.
<P>
	We must assure our foreign trading partners that Canadian sea 
products are of good quality and meet the requirements of strict 
regulations. That means we will have to keep up the excellent work 
that Fisheries and Oceans is doing now in the area of fish 
inspection.
<P>
	Finally, to reach these goals in a period of budgetary cuts, we 
will, of course, have to maintain a certain form of cost recovery so 
that those benefitting from the inspection services will pay part of 
the costs.
<P>
	The new single food inspection agency, which will become a 
reality if the bill is passed, stops in each one of these ports of call, 
that is to say that it takes into account all these needs while drawing 
on new approaches for the delivery of inspection services, many of 
them initiated by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and 
creating new opportunities for the future.
<P>
	We all know that the Canadian fish inspection program is world 
renowned. We must keep this reputation, and we will, since the new 
agency will be operating from such a solid foundation.
<P>
	The bill enshrines the quality management program and the new 
importer quality management program, which are based on the 
premise that food safety is the main concern.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	The new agency will rely on highly specialized fish inspectors, 
who are currently controlling the industry's quality management 
systems, ensuring their efficiency.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The new single food inspection agency will also be forward 
looking. It will create a food inspection regime that consolidates 
inspection activities at the federal level. It will enhance ease of 
access for products to foreign markets. It will facilitate greater 
collaboration between the various levels of government in Canada, 
providing the basis for equivalency of standards and programs. It 
will simultaneously reduce overlap and duplication while 
promoting a more efficient and effective service delivery system. 
This government is fully cognizant of the necessity of maintaining 
open and frequent dialogue with the new agency's many clients. 
This we will do.
<P>
	As Canadians grow and their needs change, the government also 
evolves to continue to meet their needs. We are committed to doing 
things differently and the Canadian food inspection agency 
represents a significant step in this direction.
<P>
	We all recognize that this is an opportunity whose time has 
come. As Secretary of State for Fisheries and Oceans as well as for 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, I remain certain that the fish inspection 
system will be enhanced within this new agency.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our journey is starting now with the passing of this important 
bill establishing a canadian food inspection agency. I believe it will 
result in the setting up of a agency, which will see to the efficient 
and effective implementation of a world class food inspection 
program.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise and talk about Bill C-60, an Act to establish the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency and to repeal and amend other 
Acts as a consequence.
<P>
	The need for a federal food inspection agency comes from 
pressure exerted by municipal and provincial governments, the 
agricultural sector, fisheries and even consumers. The setting up of 
a single unit in the area of food inspection was therefore awaited 
anxiously.
<P>
	Very often those who must deal with the federal system of food 
inspection do not know to which agency they should refer. Indeed, 
the present system of federal inspection is such that they must deal 
with several departments or agencies including Agriculture 
Canada, Fisheries and Oceans as well as Health Canada. These 
three departments account for more than $340 million annually in 
expenditures by the Consolidated Revenue Fund for food 
inspection.
<P>
	The creation of a public agency responsible for all federal 
inspection services was announced in the 1996-97 Budget. This 
announcement has raised great expectations, and Bill C-60 should 
now answer them. Unfortunately, the Canadian Food Inspection 
Agency the federal government is proposing is rather disappointing 
if you consider its structure, its make up and its mandate.
<P>
	According to senior officials responsible for setting up the 
project, the proposed agency is a model of originality. There is no 
similar agency in the world. However, originality is not necessarily 
what provinces, municipalities and the agricultural and fishery 
sectors hoped to get in answer to their requests. These people 
wanted an end to duplication and in particular they did not want to 
assume the cost of an agency whose efficiency has yet to be proven.
<P>
	Bill C-60 says that the Canadian Food Inspection Agency is 
established ``in order to consolidate and enhance the efficiency and 
effectiveness of federal inspection services related to food and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5362"> 5362 </A></B>
<P>
animal and plant health and to increase collaboration with 
provincial  governments in this area''. All this is hot air, good 
intentions and window dressing.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	In reality, the future agency will be a patronage haven created to 
reward the friends of the government of the day. The evidence is in 
clause 5 of the bill which provides that: ``The Governor in Council 
shall appoint a President and an Executive Vice-president of the 
Agency to hold office during pleasure for a term not exceeding five 
years, which term may be renewed for one or more further terms''. 
We see clearly this appointment procedure is designed to ensure the 
executive power's political loyalty to the government. This 
procedure is arbitrary, unfair and highly partisan. It calls into 
question the objectivity of decisions and actions that will be taken 
by the future federal food inspection agency. That is what must be 
expected from the agency.
<P>
	That is not all. The agency will also have an advisory board of 
not more than twelve members who this time will be appointed by 
the minister responsible for the agency. This absolute discretionary 
power will probably be given to the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, since it is he who gave us Bill C-60.
<P>
	What we must understand in all this is that the choice of policies 
relating to the agency's mandate will thus be determined by the 
minister's friends. Once again, this appointment procedure is 
totally unacceptable. It does not respond in any way to the 
expectations of provincial and municipal governments and of the 
people in the farming sector and fisheries.
<P>
	Furthermore, the membership of this famous advisory board 
does not provide any guarantee as to the representation of the 
farming and fisheries sectors on the committee, and even less about 
the involvement of the provinces and municipalities.
<P>
	How will the agency be able, as is mentioned in Bill C-60, to 
pursue a greater degree of collaboration between federal and 
provincial departments in the area of federal food inspection if the 
provinces are not permanently represented on the agency? The 
provinces have their say in this future agency.
<P>
	At this time, there is no guarantee that they will have a forum 
where they may heard, and most of all, there is no guarantee that 
they will be able to actively participate in decisions that will be 
taken. These decisions affect them directly and we should not 
ignore the total lack of judgment the government is showing in this 
issue.
<P>
	When we look at the mission of the agency, it is not more 
reassuring. It says that the Minister of Health is responsible, among 
other things, for establishing policies and standards relating to the 
safety and the nutritional quality of food sold in Canada. This 
prerogative given to the Minister of Health allows him to interfere 
directly in fields of provincial jurisdiction by setting standards and 
regulations, which will be applied all across Canada. These powers 
belong rightfully to the provinces and not to the federal 
government. This situation must be strongly condemned.
<P>
	Much was expected from the creation of the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency. Once again, the federal government is 
disappointing us. What we are offered today is obviously, another 
example of patronage. Once again, the provinces are being pushed 
aside and, moreover, the government is making sure that it controls 
everything by exercising provincial powers.
<P>
	Nobody in the agriculture and fishing sectors, including the 
provinces and the municipalities, was expecting such a 
disappointment. They expected at least to be true partners in the 
decision-making process. This is not the case. Bill C-60 introduced 
by the Minister of Agriculture has every possible flaw and we must 
scrap it.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
few comments on Bill C-60, the act that would put in place the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
<P>
	The stated purpose of this bill is to establish the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency in order to consolidate and enhance the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the federal inspection services 
related to food, animal and plant health and to increase 
collaboration with provincial governments in this area.
<P>
	Specifically, the bill sets out the new agency's framework in 
terms of responsibilities, accountability, organization, human and 
financial resources, powers and reporting. The bill also amends 
some of the enforcement provisions and penalties in federal 
statutes that the agency will enforce or administer in relation to 
food, plants and animal health.
<P>
	When the new Canadian Food Inspection Agency begins 
operation in 1997 it will become one of Ottawa's largest 
bureaucratic entities with 4,500 civil servants and a budget of $300 
million. Federal officials contend that ending interdepartmental 
overlap and duplication in such areas as enforcement, risk 
management,

save taxpayers $44 million annually beginning in 1998-99.
<P>
	However, a detailed breakdown of this estimate has not been 
provided by the government. No decision has been made on staff 
reductions or the new agency's surplus laboratories. We have a 
broad statement of cost, a broad statement of savings and no 
specifics whatsoever.
<P>
	When we are working with legislation that creates a new 
bureaucracy of 4,500 employees with an estimated budget of $300 
million we should have a lot more detail. I am not talking about 
minute detail, but about a statement that really explains how the 
money will be spent and how money will be saved. That has clearly 
not been offered in this legislation.
<P>
	The government departmental estimates on cost are $300 million 
but we should know from history that departmental estimates are 
rarely accurate. It would be a rare occasion indeed. I have seen 
many new agencies created and I do not know if I have seen one 
that has come in on budget. I would feel much more comfortable 
that this agency would come in on budget if some information were 
given to show how the money would be spent.
<P>
	I want to make it clear that the Reform Party supports the 
consolidation and downsizing of federal government operations but 
this bill will accomplish little except for the shuffling of names and 
titles. Instead, the government should be considering the 
advantages of privatizing a significant portion of Canada's food, 
plant and animal inspection services. The Reform Party has been 
calling for this since the day we came here.
<P>
	We should consider how much of this service can be privatized 
so the service can be provided at a lower cost to the people who 
need the services. At the same time I acknowledge it is very 
important to ensure the services that are privatized can be done 
more efficiently, in a less expensive way and safely.
<P>
	With a saving of $40 million or 13 per cent of the agency's $300 
million budget, that 13 per cent is currently cost recovered. The 
concept of cost recovery that the Reform Party proposes, and that I 
personally heard being recommended by many processors, 
particularly processors of agricultural products, is quite different 
from what this government proposes.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	Reform proposes that cost recovery should reflect the lowest 
cost at which the service can be provided, whether it is in the hands 
of the private sector or the government. I believe that in some 
cases, the private sector can provide very high quality service for 
less money than government can. In other cases, it may be found 
that the department can provide the service at a lower cost. It is not 
clear which services could be provided better by the  private sector 
or by the department. I do not know of any study or any work 
having been done on this.
<P>
	The government's idea of cost recovery is totally different than 
the Reform idea. The Reform idea is cost recovery at the lowest 
price. If it can be done for less money with high quality then give it 
to that group or person to do.
<P>
	The second major issue I would like to touch on in this 
legislation concerns the authority of the provincial governments 
versus the federal government. The federal government has 
decided that the way to end overlap between the federal and 
provincial governments is to centralize the complete service in the 
hands of the federal government. This is certainly in line with what 
Liberal governments have done over the years.
<P>
	Liberal MPs have generally accepted that Canadians like big 
government. Along with big government comes high taxes. I 
contend that Canadians want a much smaller government, lower 
taxes, more take home pay and therefore a much better job 
situation in the country. There are two visions of Canada. There is 
the vision held by the Liberals and Conservatives which has been 
demonstrated over the years. They believe in big government, high 
taxes, low take home pay. Then there is the Reform vision which I 
believe is shared by many Canadians: a much smaller federal 
government with much lower taxes and higher take home pay, 
therefore, a better take home pay.
<P>
	Unfortunately, with this legislation the government has chosen 
the large government, high tax route. The legislation will place a 
great burden on the taxpayer and on processors who are paying cost 
recovery.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, I see that you are right in the 
middle of your speech. Rather than cut you off in about a minute 
and a half, I thought I would let you take up right after question 
period. You will have a full three minutes then.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., we will now proceed to Statements by Members.

	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the agriculture minister has yet again demonstrated that 
he has absolutely no direction for western Canadian grain farmers.
<P>
	On the one hand he demonstrates solid support for the single 
desk monopoly of the Canadian Wheat Board by closing loopholes 
in the Customs Act while on the other allowing it to self-destruct 
by its lack of accountability and transparency.
<P>
	This minister has shown he is prepared to prosecute farmers in 
order to prevent them from accessing niche markets that the board 
will not service. At the same time he allows the board to 
circumvent its own act by directing selected farmers to end users 
who pay huge bonuses outside the pooling system.
<P>
	In my opinion, if a violation of the Canadian Wheat Board Act is 
punishable by jail for farmers, then so should the same punishment 
apply to wheat board officials.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday while appearing before the finance committee 
the finance minister announced that the deficit for 1995-96 is $4.1 
billion below the government's target of $32.7 billion.
<P>
	The reason given for this is that government spending and 
interest charges were lower than expected, but the figures the 
minister released for employment insurance show another reason 
the deficit is lower than expected.
<P>
	While the government has cut benefits for unemployed workers 
by $1.3 billion in 1995-96, the government is collecting $9 billion 
more than it is paying out in benefits. Most of this surplus will go 
to reducing the deficit.
<P>
	This is not the government's money. It rightfully belongs to the 
13 million workers who contributed to it. At a time when the 
unemployed are having a difficult time trying to make ends meet 
with reduced benefits it is cruel and unfair to make the deficit 
numbers look better by gouging unemployed workers.

<P>
	He failed to remind Canadians that the roll-over of the still

tend to use the same benchmarks as investors do in any 
sophisticated market to judge the risk and return on Canadian 
instruments relative to other markets. If these investors perceive 
that Canada's fiscal consolidation is missing the mark, they may 
well opt for foreign instruments, leading to higher borrowing costs 
in Canada.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEDEFICIT">THE DEFICIT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, although 
the Minister of Finance has forecast a $7.3 billion drop in the 
deficit for 1996-97, if we take a good look at his figures, we see 
that the cuts in transfer payments to the provinces are responsible 
for at least 25 per cent of this reduction, and that the minister is 
using the surplus in the employment insurance fund, which, in 
itself, is responsible for 70 per cent of this deficit reduction.
<P>
	My question to the Minister of Finance is this: Will he admit that 
95 per cent of his deficit reduction is financed by the employment 
insurance fund and cuts in transfer payments to the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, transfers to the provinces represent between 20 and 25 
per cent of our spending. Therefore it stands to reason that when we 
make cuts, we cannot cut 25 per cent just like that. We have to cut 
fairly across the board.
<P>
	Now, we gave the provinces two years notice to give them time 
to adjust, while we made cuts immediately. I also want to say that 
the cuts we made in our operations were far more numerous than 
the cuts in provincial spending.
<P>
	As far as the employment insurance fund is concerned, first of 
all, we must create a reserve to protect ourselves against a possible 
decline in the economy, and second, as the auditor general said in 
1986, it is part of our consolidated revenue fund, so it is treated as 
such.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the Minister of Finance. This is the first time we have had a 
clear statement from the government that the surplus in the 
employment insurance fund-the premiums paid by workers and 
employers-has been taken by the government to finance its 
expenditures. At last we have the confirmation we tried so many 
times to obtain in the past, but to no avail.
<P>
	Since the Minister of Finance seems so willing to give me the 
right answers, I would like to ask him whether he is prepared to 
admit that if he had not cut transfer payments to the provinces, 
today a province like Quebec would have no deficit at all, so that 
Quebec's deficit is what Ottawa has downloaded on Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it 
may well be that when the Bloc finance critics ask questions, the 
Leader of the Opposition is not always listening. I have often 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5368"> 5368 </A></B>
<P>
quoted in the House the auditor  general's report for 1986 in which 
he insisted that the government return what was known then as the 
unemployment insurance fund-now we say employment 
insurance-to the consolidated revenue fund. So this is not news.
<P>
	Second, as far as Quebec is concerned, thanks to the drop in 
interest rates, Quebec got $625 million more over the past two 
years than it expected, and this year, I gave Bernard Landry $600 
million more than Jean Campeau had counted on, so that adds up to 
$1.2 billion.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, members 
on the government side should not get so excited. The figures are 
there in the budgets. Everybody knows that transfer payments to 
the provinces have been cut. Ask the Minister of Finance, let the 
backbenchers ask the Minister of Finance and he will confirm this 
is true. It is all there in the budgets: Transfers, including those to 
Quebec, were cut substantially with the implementation of the 
Canada social transfer. So think about it, before you celebrate. 
Look at your budgets.
<P>
	And now for our question. Since 95 per cent of the deficit 
reduction announced by the Minister of Finance came out of the 
employment insurance fund and transfers to the provinces, as he 
confirmed in his answer to the first question-the minister made no 
attempt to hide the fact-and since 95 per cent of this attempt to 
reduce the deficit is paid for by the provinces, by the unemployed, 
by workers and employers, what was the government's 
contribution, other than a meagre 5 per cent of this reduction, in 
other words, between 350 and 400 million dollars?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Unfortunately, 
Mr. Speaker, when the Leader of the Opposition starts talking about 
figures, he makes a few mistakes. It is quite clear that the federal 
government has borne the largest share of these cuts.
<P>
	Let me give you an example. For 1994-97, although transfers to 
the provinces dropped by a total of $4.1 billion, we cut twice as 
much in our own operations, in other words, $8.3 billion.
<P>
	Second, I think that as far as Quebec is concerned, it is quite 
clear that in 1996-97, transfer payments to Quebec will total $10.9 
billion, more than for any other province. Quebec, which accounts 
for 25 per cent of the Canadian population, will receive 31 per cent 
of the transfer payments. Equalization payments alone will give 
Quebec $3.9 billion, which is 45 per cent of the total amount of 
equalization payments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the opposition makes small mistakes, the government 
and its finance minister in particular make big ones.
<P>
	The finance minister's deficit reduction efforts are more than 
timid. And his job creation efforts are non-existent. After the 
recession in 1982, it took only three years to restore employment 
and labour force participation to their prerecession levels. Today, 
six years after the last recession, the Canadian labour market is still 
879,000 jobs short. This is a disaster. Yesterday, while recognizing 
this is a disaster, the minister still replied that his government will 
not do anything about it.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Finance admit that the job market is in a 
disastrous situation and refuse at the same time to put in place real 
measures to improve the employment situation in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this was discussed yesterday. The government has put in place 
several measures that have had a very positive effect in terms of job 
creation, be it the funds allocated by the former Minister of Human 
Resources Development to create jobs, summer jobs for young 
people or funding for research and development or for foreign 
trade.
<P>
	Also, it should be pointed out that the vast majority of 
economists in Canada agree that lower interest rates have had a 
huge positive impact on the private sector's capacity to create three 
quarters of a million new jobs in Canada since we came to office.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Conference Board itself recently declared that the job 
situation in Canada was a disaster, that the real unemployment rate 
in Canada was not 9.4 per cent but rather 12.5, when one includes 
those who have given up looking for work. The Chamber of 
Commerce of Canada shares the view that this is a disaster. 
Something can be done to help, which leads me to ask the 
following.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance undertake before this House to 
substantially lower the contributions of employers and employees 
to the unemployment insurance fund and call an emergency 
meeting with the provinces to discuss the implementation of real 
job creation measures? In case he has forgotten, I remind the 
minister that employment is a national emergency.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
since coming to office, we have reduced the burden of 
unemployment insurance, now called employment insurance, by 
$1.8 billion. This is a huge amount and possibly also one of the 
reasons why job creation has taken off.
<P>
	That said, there is no doubt that the employment situation across 
Canada is of concern to us, as it is to the Government of Quebec. 
We have great hopes that the summit scheduled for the end of the 
month will be a success.
<P>

	We have a problem, and I do not mean only the federal and

	The hon. member referred to the recession. Clearly, Canada has 
suffered greatly from the 1989-92 recession being so intense and so 
long. In fact, its impact is still being felt. It will have to be looked 
into. I welcome the hon. member's questions because I think we 
should work together. The issue was raised at the finance ministers' 
meeting. This is one of the reasons why the infrastructure program 
is being extended.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday a number of us sat patiently through the 
presentation by the Minister of Finance but his economic statement 
failed completely to address the principal concerns of Canadians. 
The finance minister failed to address the needs of the 1.4 million 
unemployed, the two to three million underemployed, and the one 
out of four Canadians who are worried about their jobs. He failed to 
address tax relief, the principal route to job creation.
<P>
	Why has the finance minister failed to deliver what Canadians 
really want: lower taxes and more and better jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of all of us in the House, I would first like to welcome the 
leader of the Reform Party to the debate.
<P>
	The fact is that had the leader of the Reform Party been paying 
attention, he would have noticed that right from the beginning 
when we took office we had a two track approach on the whole 
question of cleaning up the balance sheet. The first was certainly to 
get Canadians back to work. As a result of that, the Prime Minister 
embarked on several trips abroad with Team Canada which brought 
a great number of new jobs to this country. He would have also 
noticed that we extended concessional financing. We have invested 
in R and D. Through the Department of Human Resources 
Development we put money into summer jobs for students and 
re-entry jobs for students.
<P>
	The fact is, in addition to the substantial interest rate decreases 
which have occurred as a result of this government's action, 
750,000 new private sector jobs have been created since we took 
office. That indeed is something for Canadians to be proud of.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the finance minister wants to debate, he has to face 
unpleasant facts.
<P>
	The unpleasant facts are the Liberals have cut transfer payments 
by 40 per cent. They have cut health care payments by $3 billion. 
They have cut benefits to seniors. They are dismantling social 
programs to pay the interest on the ballooning $600 billion federal 
debt. The finance minister has gone through all of this without 
being able to translate it into benefits of lower taxes and more jobs 
for Canadians.
<P>
	My question again is: Why has the finance minister failed to give 
Canadians lower taxes and more and better jobs?
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would simply ask the leader of the Reform Party to hark back to 
Reform's first budget. When he does so, he will see that what 
Reform recommended in terms of health care, what it 
recommended in terms of transfers to the provinces, and what it 
recommended in terms of old age pensions was to simply kill the 
patient.
<P>
	It really is the height of something that would be 
unparliamentary in terms of language for the Reform Party leader 
to stand up now and talk about what we would do. I would simply 
ask him to carry his thought one step further. The leader of the 
Reform Party has said that we should cut taxes. Fine. Let him now 
stand up and tell us where he would cut in our programs. What 
social programs would he cut in order to justify a cut in taxes?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in this House we ask the questions and the finance 
minister can bluster all he wants. He can avoid the question all that 
he wants, but he cannot escape the fact that he has failed to deliver 
on the government's promise for jobs. The reason he has failed is 
that he cannot deliver on tax relief.
<P>
	I will ask him one more time. Why has the finance minister 
failed to deliver tax relief to Canadians and the more and better 
jobs that tax relief would bring?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
every one of our budgets we have brought forth tax relief for 
specific areas. In terms of unemployment insurance, we cut the 
costs over the last two years by $1.8 billion. We have provided tax 
credits for poor families with children. We have provided tax 
credits for people in school.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party says that they ask the questions 
in this House. In terms of the basic question of what social 
programs would you gut to pay for your tax programs, the 
Canadian people will insist that you answer that question.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	If the federal government can prove it has the deficit under 
control, it is because it is reducing it mostly on the backs of UI 
contributors by accumulating a surplus of at least $5 billion a year 
through payroll taxes, which, as we know, are paid mainly by 
workers and discourage job creation.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that, by asking lower and middle income 
workers, the unemployed and businesses-especially small 
businesses-to build up this surplus and pay for the deficit, he is 
dangerously and unfairly taxing employment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
when we came to office, there was a $6 billion plus deficit in the 
unemployment insurance fund. We had to make it up and we did. 
This year, we have a $5 billion surplus.
<P>
	According to Human Resources Development Canada's chief 
actuary, we need a surplus of $10 billion to $15 billion so the fund 
can sustain another economic downturn or recession. Second, it is 
clear that if we lower premiums, every five-cent reduction would 
cost us $350 million, and we would have to find this money 
somewhere else.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	There is a question I sincerely want to ask the hon. member. 
There are several kinds of payroll taxes, not only employment 
insurance, but also taxes for health care, training, the CSST. If this 
is true, I hope the hon. member will also ask the provinces to lower 
their own payroll taxes.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the 
commission's chief actuary said, the accumulated surplus will 
amount to at least $5 billion a year, whereas during the worst of the 
recession, when benefits were higher and more unemployed people 
had access to unemployment insurance, it was close to $6 billion. 
This increase makes no sense at all.
<P>
	Since what really matters is employment, will the minister admit 
that, beyond his fine-sounding words, Canada's citizens are in fact 
poorer according to Statistics Canada, as the real disposable 
income per person has dropped by more than $1,000 since 1989? 
Will he admit that Canadians have become poorer?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, if the hon. member looks at her figures, she will see that, 
according to Statistics Canada, Canadians did get poorer-she is 
right about that-but it happened before we came to office. Since 
we came to office, the situation has stabilized, which means we 
made significant progress. We would like to increase Canadians' 
income, but before we could do so, we had to stabilize it.
<P>
	Second, yes, there will be a $5 billion surplus at the end of the 
year. This does not mean that the surplus will keep growing 
forever. But we do need a surplus to protect ourselves against a 
recession.
<P>
	As I said earlier, according to the auditor general, this money is 
included in our figures. When we lower premiums as we did last 
year and as we intend to do this year and hope to do in the years to 
come, it certainly costs us money.
<P>
	Having said that, I want to ask the hon. member, because I 
myself cannot ask my provincial counterpart, Mr. Landry: Will she 
ask Mr. Landry, will she thank Mr. Landry, who said yesterday-

the never never land of Ottawa is there celebration over a deficit of 
$29 billion. Only in the never never land of Ottawa is there 
celebration over deficit reduction by downloading on the 
provinces.
<P>
	Why has the Minister of Finance burdened provincial health, 
education and welfare programs with cuts of $6 billion while he 
lets his own government get away with cuts of less than $2 billion a 
year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
was made very clear in the presentation yesterday that while we 
were very proud of having bettered our targets for the second year, 
and while I think all Canadians can take great pride in the control 
which we now have over the nation's finances, we made it very 
clear that victory was not yet won. The fight ahead of us is going to 
be very tough, and we are going to stick with it. I think the hon. 
member should understand, and I would hope that he would join 
with this side of the House and with all Canadians as we stick to 
what is going to be a very difficult fight.
<P>
	I would also hope that perhaps he would get his numbers just a 
little more correct. The fact is that in the period 1994-95 to 1997-98 
in terms of our own spending as opposed to transfers to provinces, 
we have cut by $8.3 billion, and total entitlements to the provinces 
have only been cut by $4.1 billion.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I guess we will have to look at the record of what his 
deputy minister said yesterday. As of yesterday it was $6.3 billion.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	I wonder how this works out. Coming from British Columbia, 
creative accounting in federal fiscal updates scares me. Creatively, 
last year's fictitious deficit was improved by a fictitiously large 
windfall. By a very mysterious coincidence, projected declines in 
revenues, exactly dollar for dollar, match projected declines in 
interest costs.
<P>
	How many more such fictitious numbers and creative accounting 
are behind the minister's assurance that he is hitting his unchanged 
and unchanging targets?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member knows there is no fictitious accounting. Our 
books are certified by the auditor general. The auditor general goes 
through them and it is according to generally accepted accounting 
principles. I do not think that it behoves the hon. member to cast 
aspersions on the federal government's numbers because he knows 
the implications of what he is saying.
<P>
	I would like to go to the member's question of transfers. We all 
have to understand something. When we cut, whether it is 
transfers, which we do not want to do, or in our own backyard, it 
impacts on the provinces. It really is slightly bogus to talk about 
cutting this way and cutting in our own backyard as if it does not 
cut the provinces.
<P>
	If military spending is cut and a base is cut in a province it is a 
cut in that province. Is the hon. member saying that we should cut 
old age pensions? We will not do it. However, if we ever did, it 
would impact on welfare in the provinces. Is he saying we should 
cut R and D? If we did, it would affect the universities.
<P>
	There is nothing the federal government does that does not 
impact on the country. That is why we will not cut old age 
pensions, why we will not cut research and development and why 
we will not savage this country.

the sanctions taken to ensure such unbecoming conduct never 
recurs?

between the Prime Minister and his ministers on a cabinet 
confidential basis which set out certain rules of conduct.
<P>
	The reports that were printed in the papers today are simply 
briefing notes that the ethics commissioner uses to brief various

very different things. I think the hon. member should recognize a 
difference when he sees one.

these from the British High Commission earlier today.

members of the cabinet he only has to look at the various 
honourable decisions taken by ministers. When they have breached 
the code they have made the honourable decision and resigned, as 
did the former Minister of National Defence last week.
<P>
	The best test is the test of practical outcome. I believe the 
Canadian people respect that.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
members of this government, particularly cabinet members, have 
problems with ethics.
<P>
	Last week, it was the former defence minister, regarding the 
incidents that we know; yesterday, it was the intergovernmental 
affairs minister, who used the Privy Council-the Prime Minister's 
department-letterhead for partisan announcements; now, it is the 
turn of the indian affairs minister.
<P>
	How can the minister explain that, in a document released in 
August 1996 by his department and entitled <I>Pride in Partnership</I>, 
he directly refers to the commitments the Liberal Party of Canada 
made to aboriginal people in the red book? Since when does the 
minister of indian affairs promote the red book by using taxpayers' 
money?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I promote the Liberal red book 
every time I get a chance to speak or write.

<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I find it 
unacceptable that the minister would try to downplay the incident. 
The indian affairs minister promotes the red book and says there is 
no problem, adding that he will seize every opportunity to promote 
it.
<P>
	The minister should realize that it is inappropriate for the 
government to use public money for political purposes, namely to 
boast about his government's performance. He should pledge to 
repay the federal treasury for such abuse, with money taken from 
the Liberal Party fund. Will the minister repay the federal treasury 
for this abuse?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if that is the only question I am 
going to get from the Bloc in two months, I am in pretty good 
shape.
<P>
	The red book happened to be our policy. It was a promise to the 
electorate, which eventually became cabinet policy. We were 
telling the public: ``This is our policy. This is what we promised 
you. This is what we delivered''. Short and simple.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the minister of agriculture. The minister announced 
last Friday that he will hold a plebiscite on the future of barley 
marketing in western Canada.
<P>
	I need some clarification from the minister. Western farmers 
really want to know, as they go into marketing this year's barley 
crops, will farmers be given the option to choose dual marketing in 
the plebiscite?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have had the opportunity to 
answer this question in the House before.
<P>
	It is very clear in the policy statement that was delivered, both on 
Friday of last week and Monday of this week, that we will be 
asking a very clear cut question about whether farmers wish to put 
all barley, that is, both feed and malting barley, on the completely 
open market for all sales or would they prefer to retain the current 
system through which the Canadian Wheat Board, as modernized 
by the various changes that we are making, remains the single desk 
seller for all barley exports and domestic barley sales for human 
consumption. That is very clear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister has answered the question. He has said that dual 
marketing will not be an option.
<P>
	This option is accepted by many western Canadian farmers. Will 
the minister promise today that he will change his mind on this 
issue and put dual marketing as an option on the ballot?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party does not like it 
when I do change my mind and they do not like it when I do not 
change my mind. I find it very difficult to understand their 
position.
<P>
	What it is important for the Reform Party to explain to their 
supporters so that this issue can be fully understood is that the 
concept of dual marketing would dilute the price pooling system. It 
would make it untenable for there to be guarantees of initial 
payments.
<P>
	It would make it impossible for the quantity of supply, the 
security of supply, to be guaranteed in world markets by Canadian 
marketing and there would be no ability, under a dual marketing 
system, to safeguard Canadian quality.
<P>
	Those are some of the flaws that the Reform Party should draw 
to the attention of those who make this argument.

	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	For over 100 years, Banff national park has served as the 
flagship of Canada's national parks system. It is a symbol of 
Canadian heritage. Its protection is a value shared by all Canadians 
coast to coast.

Bow Valley study? How will she balance the environmental 
protection with the long-term sustainability of Alberta's tourism 
industry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for an 
extremely well thought out and well articulated question.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, on October 7 the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage announced that she would take immediate steps 
to implement some of those recommendations. She has put a stop 
to any new commercial use of lands in Banff National Park. She 
has actually removed the air strip, she has removed the buffalo 
paddock and the cadet camp. She has also set up a corridor north of 
the city that will be for wildlife. She has set up clear wilderness 
areas within the park.
<P>
	As for the remainder of the recommendations, the assistant 
deputy minister of parks will be setting up an advisory committee 
that will work out an implementation strategy that the minister will 
announce in April.

proposed changes to the Canada pension plan. The minister has 
said that some provinces have proposed to cut benefits to seniors 
by taking away full inflation protection.
<P>
	My question to the minister is straightforward. What is the 
federal position on this issue? Will the minister clearly state 
whether he supports this change or whether he is prepared to stand 
with the NDP governments of Saskatchewan and British Columbia 
in rejecting this regressive proposal which would betray the trust of 
Canadian seniors?

first it is by no means clear that the description of any 
government's position is as described by the member. However, I 
would tell him that all of the provinces have come together and 
quite clearly there is going to have to be a package. When the 
package is put together it will imply trade-offs and we will have to

approach to justice.
<P>
	The justice minister is well aware that the anxiety Canadian 
parents feel about the safety of their children has just received 
another horrific jolt after yesterday's brutal abduction and violation

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANFOODINSPECTIONAGENCYACT">CANADIAN FOOD INSPECTION AGENCY ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, as a lifelong farmer 
and a member of parliament who represents the people of 
Dauphin-Swan River, it is a pleasure to have this chance to speak 
on Bill C-60, the Canadian food inspection agency act.
<P>
	Food inspection and quarantine services have always been a 
priority in Canada. Canada has one of the most effective food 
inspection and quarantine systems in the world. The confidence of 
Canadians in the quality and safety of their food is among the 
highest anywhere. However, our food inspection and quarantine 
system is facing many new pressures. How effectively Canada 
meets those challenges will have a major impact on the food 
industry and on all Canadians.
<P>
	Agriculture and agri-food accounts for 8 per cent of our gross 
domestic product and directly and indirectly employs some 1.9 
million people. In addition, Canada has one of the largest 
commercial fisheries in the world with fisheries and aquaculture 
valued at about $4 billion a year and employing some 120,000 
workers.
<P>
	In our cities and in rural areas like the constituency of 
Dauphin-Swan River, the food industry is an integral part of our 
day to day lives and forms the backbone of many communities. 
These contributions cannot be taken for granted. The future growth 
and success of the food industry from fishing and farming to food 
service and retail depends on the continued high quality of our 
products and strong consumer confidence in the safety of our food 
supply. In the face of today's many pressures, that requires 
changes, less duplication and overlap, and greater responsiveness 
to changing ways of doing business.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	In 1994 federal, provincial and territorial agricultural ministers 
committed themselves to addressing those challenges by endorsing 
a blueprint document for the Canadian food inspection system, 
CFIS. CFIS involves all levels of government in looking at 
harmonizing food standards, inspection and quarantine services 
into a single integrated system for all of Canada. The CFIS 
objectives are: to protect the health and safety of Canadian 
consumers; to sustain our international reputation for safe high 
quality food; and to maintain an efficient and effective food 
inspection and quarantine system.
<P>
	In May the office of food inspection systems, OFIS, was 
established to assess the feasibility of setting up a single food 
inspection and quarantine system at the federal level, a first step 
toward a Canadian food inspection system.
<P>
	In July 1995, OFIS issued a discussion paper entitled: ``Federal 
Food Inspection System-Organizational Options'', and it 
presented four possibilities. The discussion paper was widely 
distributed to industry stakeholders who further dialogued on the 
proposed changes. These discussions were fundamental to the 
decision making process that led to the announcement of the 
Canadian food inspection agency in the 1996 budget.
<P>
	The legislation we are introducing today is widely supported by 
the provinces and the industry. The agency will reduce costs and 
ensure greater consistency in inspection and quarantine methods 
and standards. Under the legislation, the Canadian food inspection 
agency's responsibilities are clearly defined. They will be centred 
in six key areas: animal and plant health programs; trade and 
commerce and economic fraud; inspection and quarantine policy; 
assessment, evaluation and verification of inspection and related 
activities; registration, certification and approval; and enforcement 
and compliance actions.
<P>
	The new agency will also be responsible for enforcing food 
safety standards and regulations. It will play a lead role in the risk 
management options dealing with food related health issues.
<P>
	As stated in the 1996 budget, Health Canada will retain 
responsibility for food safety policy and setting standards. It will 
also be responsible for auditing the agency's inspection and 
quarantine activities.
<P>
	With the creation of the Canadian food inspection agency, roles 
and accountability will be more clearly defined, strengthening the 
decision making process. The agency will maintain close links
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5377"> 5377 </A></B>
<P>
with the OFIS to ensure that work toward a Canadian food 
inspection system is continued and expanded.
<P>
	The agency will improve government responsiveness with a 
more private sector type financial framework. This framework 
incorporates multiyear flexibility and a simplified vote structure; 
reconciles the information requirements of Parliament and other 
client groups; and minimizes administration and financial systems 
costs. In order to encourage efficiency, the agency will have the 
option of selecting service providers in areas such as payroll and 
accommodation services.
<P>
	Removing food inspection and quarantine services from the 
departmental system will also have many other benefits. A stand 
alone agency will encourage a new corporate culture which will 
help transcend old approaches and build new partnerships with the 
private sector. Staff will work in a more flexible, client focused 
environment and will deliver more uniform procedures whether for 
bread, chocolate, canned salmon or beef stew.
<P>
	In addition, the new agency will have the flexibility to build on 
existing federal-provincial agreements by streamlining and 
negotiating new ways of delivering services such as delivering 
provincial inspection and quarantine functions by federal 
inspectors and vice versa, and establishing federal-provincial 
corporations for joint delivery of federal and provincial inspection 
and quarantine programs.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	Federal and provincial ministers would, however, remain 
accountable for their respective statutory responsibilities. Clearly, 
this more streamlined, efficient and responsive approach to food 
inspection and quarantine is an important avenue to ensure 
continued confidence in the safety and in the quality of our food 
supply.
<P>
	This new agency will not only benefit rural constituencies like 
Dauphin-Swan River. It will help all Canadians. I would like to 
call on all members to lend their support for this important 
legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, Bill C-60 
proposes the creation of a public agency called the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency. As its name indicates, this agency will be 
responsible for providing federal food inspection services, and 
related services, such as recalls and food poisoning investigations, 
as well as managing food safety-related emergencies.
<P>
	In the government documentation, we are told that this new 
agency will ``make it possible to eliminate duplication and overlap 
and to consolidate resources, while increasing efficiency and 
decreasing by  approximately 10 per cent the overall federal costs 
relating to food inspection''.
<P>
	What is, in fact, involved is consolidation and rationalization. 
The overall objective of this measure is to create a more efficient 
and more effective inspection system.
<P>
	The fusion of federal activities will facilitate implementation of 
an inspection system that conforms to the HACCP-hazard 
analysis at critical control points-approach to food inspection. 
The motto of the new agency would be ``protecting the Canadian 
consumer''.
<P>
	Already, a sizeable number of Canadian food processing firms 
have adopted some elements of the HACCP approach. While, at 
present, this represents a preventive approach, it has some obvious 
advantages: first, a guarantee of exceptional safety for the 
consumer; second, an internationally accepted standard for export 
sales; third, an economical means of reducing recalls and waste.
<P>
	The HACCP approach involves a hazard analysis at critical 
control points. In other words, we must identify risks, list 
preventive measures and express criticism as the situation unfolds.
<P>
	To get back to the idea of creating the Canadian Food Inspection 
Agency, we agree there should be a single federal food inspection 
authority in the future. On the other hand, we cannot support this 
bill in its current form, and I will tell you why.
<P>
	Note that there are 94 clauses in this bill. As presented by the 
government, this bill might become a real patronage haven. Since 
clause 5 allows the governor in council to appoint a president and 
an executive vice-president of the agency to hold office during 
pleasure for a term not exceeding five years, the minister might be 
tempted to appoint a friend.
<P>
	And if that were not enough, clause 10 enables the governor to 
appoint an advisory board of 12 members.
<P>
	Worse yet, clause 22 allows the minister to approve the agency's 
corporate or five-year business plan. As we know, as soon as 
possible after it is established and at least once every five years 
after that, the agency must submit a corporate business plan.
<P>
	In fact, if we let the minister choose the president and 
vice-president of the agency as well as the 12 members of the 
advisory board, he can also control the agency by directing its key 
policies. All this does not put the government's transparency in a 
very good light.
<P>
	That is not all. Under clause 17 in the bill, the government gives 
the agency and its executives the power to license, sell or otherwise 
make available any patent, copyright, industrial design, and so on. 
In this regard, I did not see any sales or allocation criteria. Would 
the cost be lower to a contributor to the Liberal campaign fund?  As 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5378"> 5378 </A></B>
<P>
I said earlier, the government is trying to control the agency and 
turn it into quite the patronage haven.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	With Bill C-60, the government is looking to consolidate 
inspection activities relating to food as well as animal and plant 
health, and related activities including food recalls, the 
investigation of instances of food poisoning and the management 
of emergency situations related to food safety. To fulfil its 
mandate, the agency will have a staff of approximately 4,500 and 
an initial budget of $300 million. It should be operational early 
next year, in 1997.
<P>
	Its 4,500 employees will come from three departments: some 
3,900 from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada; 400 from Fisheries 
and Oceans Canada; and 200 from Health Canada. The jobs of 
these 4,500 employees will be secured for two years. One wonders 
now what will happen to them after. And where it says that the new 
agency will look into the need to introduce voluntary leave 
incentives, I hope the agency will reduce its staff through attrition 
only, that is to say, as people retire.
<P>
	At present, the federal government spends approximately $340 
million per year to fulfil its duties and responsibilities regarding 
food inspection across the country. This figure is taken from 
schedule B to the working paper on the federal food inspection 
system-organizational choices of July 1995. This expenditure is 
shared three ways between Health Canada, Agriculture Canada and 
Fisheries and Oceans Canada.
<P>
	Under Bill C-60, total costs will be reduced by approximately 10 
per cent or $44 million annually as of 1998-1999. With such a 
reduction of the food inspection budget, the status quo is not in the 
least guaranteed as regards cost recovery.
<P>
	The Canadian Federation of Agriculture supports the 
establishment of one food inspection agency, as proposed by the 
Minister of Agriculture in this bill. It did express some 
reservations, however.
<P>
	It gives its support on the condition that this reorganization not 
lead to new cost recovery measures. Moreover, it expresses the 
strong desire to see producers represented on the advisory council. 
In this regard, I think the proposal is excellent.
<P>
	The Canadian Federation of Agriculture also strongly hopes that, 
as far as compensation to be paid for costs incurred with respect to 
treatment is concerned, clause 71 will include ``and for other 
measures''. Thus, additional costs will be included, such as with 
respect to quarantine, cleaning, replacement of damaged or ruined 
property, restocking, etc.
<P>
	The impact of such an addition to the legislation would ensure 
farmers do not lose out because they have reported a disease. As we 
all know, the riding of Lotbinière, which I am honoured to 
represent, is Quebec's largest agricultural riding.
<P>
	Quebec supports the establishment of the agency because it 
amalgamates the inspection services. From now on, there will be 
only one interlocutor. But it would be contrary to Quebec's position 
if the federal government, through this agency, unilaterally 
established national standards. It would be a very good thing to 
have a new sharing of administrative responsibilities in the food 
inspection sector, while making sure no one has to give up its own 
fields of jurisdiction, and no change is made to the division of 
powers provided in the Constitution.
<P>
	The Union des producteurs agricoles, the UPA, agrees with the 
Quebec government. It does not want the provinces, particularly 
Quebec, to have a say regarding the activities of the future agency.
<P>
	The Bloc asks that the provinces, including Quebec of course, be 
consulted and listened to regarding the agency's activities in the 
coming years. It makes sense and it is only normal for the federal 
government to act with the agreement of the provinces in the food 
inspection sector, since consumers' health and interests are at 
stake. However, the federal government must respect the existing 
fields of jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Costly overlap must be reduced. Grouping together the 
inspection services of the Department of Agriculture and 
Agri-food, Health Canada, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada is a 
step in the right direction. We must promote harmonization and 
streamline standards so as to reduce the burden of regulatory 
requirements and promote the competitiveness of our businesses.
<P>
	In closing, we must, I repeat, promote joint action, but according 
to the partners' respective fields of jurisdiction. In this regard, I 
refer government members to sections 91 to 95 of the Constitution 
Act of 1867.

Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak in support of 
this legislation along with my other colleagues.
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, as members know, 
has tabled a bill which is a fine example of the government's 
commitment to protect the health of Canadians. That bill 
introduces a new food inspection system. It is one that is built on 
the same overriding priority that we have always held high, good 
health for Canadians through the safest possible food sources.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pickard:</B> That is right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> My colleague who comes from the agricultural area 
of Essex-Kent will bear me out.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5379"> 5379 </A></B>
<P>
	This new system keeps that goal front and centre while 
achieving efficiencies, savings and increased effectiveness for 
everyone with a stake in the process and most especially, 
consumers and taxpayers. The minister has introduced legislation 
that creates the foundation for a Canadian system, one with greater 
harmonization of both standards and inspection.
<P>
	As the speech from the throne noted, the government is prepared 
to work with interested provinces so that the new food inspection 
system co-ordinates these activities at the federal and provincial 
levels.
<P>
	In my comments today I want to speak about the role of Health 
Canada in the new food inspection system. Hon. colleagues should 
know that Health Canada has a strong and firm role in protecting 
the health of Canadians and this bill fits that role. It draws on the 
unique strengths of the department.
<P>
	The legislation will first of all eliminate the overlap that has 
existed among Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Fisheries and 
Oceans Canada and Health Canada regarding food inspection. This 
is not a trivial matter. The agency will be solely responsible for the 
delivery of food inspection and related services.
<P>
	Health Canada will focus its attention on the food safety policy, 
standard setting and research necessary to support the system. It 
will assess the effectiveness of the agency's food safety activities. 
In short, Health Canada will focus on the science that is the 
foundation of a credible and effective inspection system.
<P>
	You will forgive me if I applaud the initiative because this new 
approach makes sense. It fits with the government's emphasis on 
addressing the key determinants of health and few things are more 
important than good, healthy and nutritious food. It also fits with 
the other health protection functions of Health Canada has and the 
scientific resources it uses to carry out those functions.
<P>
	These policy development and standard setting functions will 
draw on the strengths and resources that the department has built 
up over the years. We are going to apply both experience and 
expertise.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	It will continue to use an approach that is based on good science. 
It will continue to use risk assessment as a framework for our 
activities so that our food inspection priorities are right.
<P>
	These functions will continue to draw on the substantial 
laboratory infrastructure of Health Canada. Our national network 
of facilities and experts will allow the food system to identify 
hazards and assess them effectively through toxicology, disease 
surveillance and human health impact investigations. These 
facilities will form the practical basis of the department's abilities 
to set standards and create appropriate policies. This kind of work 
is the foundation of any modern, credible food inspection system.
<P>
	Health Canada's staff deals with a wide range of food health 
hazards. Its scientists and analysts track chemical risks as a threat 
of allergens. They go after biological threats such as salmonella 
and they deal with physical issues such as the occasional presence 
of metal fragments in food products. That is not a very pleasant 
thought.
<P>
	These experts are connected to Canada's broader public health 
intelligence system. They are linked to a network of people and 
places such as the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control. They are 
linked to physicians and public health specialists across Canada. 
That means that our national disease surveillance system includes 
the capacity to quickly assess and check if an emerging health 
problem is food related.
<P>
	As Health Canada's scientists and researchers work in their labs, 
they are not working in isolation. In this new model they will be in 
constant touch with the agency. They will work in a way that 
recognizes industries' interests in sound standards that earn the 
trust of Canadian and international consumers alike.
<P>
	Health Canada brings together another advantage to the new 
food inspection system, its international contributions and 
contacts. In a world where trade is increasingly open and where our 
food products find buyers around the world we need consistent and 
fair standards, as identified in our debate earlier this morning on 
the bilateral agreement with Israel. My colleague, who comes from 
a very vibrant farming community in southwestern Ontario, 
Essex-Kent, will affirm that.
<P>
	The department will see that Canada plays a full role in this 
process. Health Canada has a long and respected tradition of results 
in helping Canadians to enjoy one of the safest, healthiest food 
supplies in the world. Under this legislation that tradition will 
continue. Canadians will have a strong, credible team of medical, 
scientific and research professionals at work in labs and in the field 
to ensure solid standards and sound policies backed by the very 
best of research.
<P>
	With this bill Canadians will get food of the highest possible 
quality and an inspection system which will be efficient and well 
organized. I believe that is has the support of the provinces and the 
stakeholders. I believe it deserves the support of all members of the 
House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, Bill 
C-60 is entitled an act to establish the Canadian Food Inspection 
Agency and to repeal and amend other Acts as a consequence. It 
sets up the Canadian Food Inspection Agency in order to 
consolidate and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of federal 
inspection services related to food and animal and plant health as 
well as to increase co-operation between the federal and provincial 
governments in this area.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5380"> 5380 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	This agency will take over from the old Interdepartmental 
Committee on Food Regulation established in 1986. Thus there 
will be only one body in this area at the federal level.
<P>
	The bill also sets out the responsibilities, accountability regime, 
organization, human and financial resources regime, powers and 
reporting framework of the agency. It also amends some of the 
enforcement provisions and penalties in federal statutes that the 
agency will enforce or administer, with regard to food and animal 
and plant health.
<P>
	Simplifying the food inspection system in order to eliminate 
duplication, to enhance trade and improve enforcement of 
regulations relating to food safety is a very commendable 
objective. It has been set forth in the last federal budget and 
relatively well accepted by Quebec as well as other provincial 
governments.
<P>
	I should mention that the auditor general, in his 1994 report, 
strongly recommended that the food safety assurance system be 
reviewed in order to deal with its numerous flaws. More 
specifically, he singled out the Interdepartmental Committee on 
Food Regulation for its lack of consistency. This committee, made 
up of representatives from Health Canada, Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans and Revenue Canada, has not 
always fulfilled its mandate of bringing specific changes to the 
food safety assurance system and of enhancing innovation and 
efficiency in relation to inspection methods.
<P>
	Moreover, the committee has failed to report the results of its 
investigation as required in its mandate. The auditor general has 
also emphasized the inability of Health Canada to guarantee 
complete and effective enforcement. In a nutshell, the auditor 
general and most stakeholders think our food inspection system 
should be reviewed.
<P>
	The goal of having in the federal government a single window 
for food inspection is commendable, but the way the federal 
government wants to go about it is totally unacceptable and is just 
one more example of federal intrusion into areas of provincial 
jurisdiction. In a way, Bill C-60 flies directly in the face of the 
repeatedly expressed will of Quebec to take on all its 
responsibilities under the Constitution.
<P>
	Even if this bill did recognize the existing areas of jurisdiction, 
the present wording of several clauses still makes Bill C-60 a bad 
bill that would not meet the goals expressed therein, and it would 
still incur the official opposition's condemnation.
<P>
	For example, the government maintains it is looking for a more 
efficient federal service for food, animal and plant inspection. In a 
system such as ours, with elected representatives, efficiency and 
openness often go hand in hand. When things are done behind 
closed doors, the  interests of people behind the door are often well 
looked after at the expense of the public left outside.
<P>
	In Bill C-60, the government had many opportunities to show it 
cares for openness. For example, clause 5 stipulates:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Governor in Council shall appoint a President and an Executive 
Vice-President of the Agency to hold office during pleasure for a term not exceeding 
five years, which term may be renewed for one or more further terms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is no consultation, no consideration in committee, nothing 
of the kind. Only unilateral appointments made at the whim of the 
government.
<P>
	Of course, the official opposition cannot support that section the 
way it is drafted. It would open the door to discrimination and 
patronage. If the federal government really wanted to be 
transparent, it would have ensured that these appointments could 
be examined by Parliament. These appointments should be 
submitted to the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food at least for consideration, if not for final approval.
<P>
	The same thing goes for clause 10, which deals with the advisory 
board and reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) The Minister shall appoint an advisory board of not more than twelve 
members to hold office during pleasure for a term not exceeding three years, which 
term may be renewed for one or more further terms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Again, it is unacceptable for a minister to act alone in appointing 
the members of the advisory board. Since this board is responsible 
for helping the minister choose the policies he has to implement, it 
is important that all the appointments referred to in this clause be 
reviewed by the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food. Therefore, the minister will not be able to yield to 
temptation and appoint his buddies or people who share his 
philosophy.
<P>
	Another bit of lip service on the part of the government is 
co-operation with the government of Quebec and of all the other 
provinces. However, there is absolutely no mention of this in Bill 
C-60. Yet, this was a great opportunity. When appointing a board to 
advise the minister, the government could have guaranteed 
representation for Quebec, which accounts for 25 per cent of the 
Canadian population, and ensured that at least one member of the 
advisory board out of four is from Quebec so that the Quebec's 
point of view would be well represented on the board. Moreover, 
these appointments could have been approved by the provinces.
<P>
	But, once more, the lip service expressed loud and long does not 
translate into government action. Subclause 4 of this clause 
provides that the minister shall appoint one of the members as 
chairperson of the advisory board. Again, the minister wants to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5381"> 5381 </A></B>
<P>
control the agency by appointing himself the chairperson of the 
advisory board.
<P>
	Instead of letting competent people in the field who have to work 
with the food inspection staff choose a chairperson themselves, the 
minister will probably appoint one of his friends or one of his 
devotees who will defend his point of view at all times. This lack of 
transparency is apparent in the phrasing of several of Bill C-60's 
clauses: clause 22-corporate business plan, clause 23-annual 
report, clause 26-consultation, clause 32-annual audit, or any 
other clause concerning appointments or reports.
<P>
	These actions must be examined and approved by the standing 
committee. Then, these appointments and changes could be 
submitted to the House, to all hon. members. This is not 
unreasonable. In a democratic system, there is never enough 
transparency, and prevention is better than cure.
<P>
	Finally, clause 11 deals with the responsibilities of the new 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency. This agency would be 
responsible for the administration and enforcement of various 
existing federal statutes. So far, so good.
<P>
	However, subclause 4 of this section reads as follows: ``The 
Minister of Health is responsible for establishing policies and 
standards relating to the safety and nutritional quality of food sold 
in Canada.'' In this regard, the position of the Quebec government 
and of the official opposition is crystal clear.
<P>
	I do not know how many times in the last three years I have 
quoted this section, which is part of the Constitution: ``Under 
section 92, subsections 7 and 5 of the Constitution Act of 1867, and 
pursuant to the interpretation of many courts, health and social 
services are the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces''.
<P>
	In closing, the Bloc Quebecois has always demanded that the 
federal government respect the jurisdiction of the provinces 
regarding health care and we intend to call upon the Liberals to 
withdraw from this field and to transfer to the province of Quebec 
all federal moneys regarding Quebec's health care. I think that the 
Bloc Quebecois will not support Bill C-60 in its present form.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, first, allow 
me to note the lack of interest shown by the government party and 
the third party on this bill since the Bloc Quebevois-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> Why do you say that? Where are the members of the 
Bloc? We are here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Only the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Health seems to be interested.
<P>
	I note also that the Liberal government is proceeding in a rather 
unusual way. It did the same thing in the case of employment 
insurance, that is it resorted to the pre-examination process in order 
to skip second reading, which is essential in a democracy, under 
our parliamentary procedure, as we could have suggested 
amendments at this stage.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	But no, once again, the government is trying to ram things 
through Parliament and flouts democracy. Like my colleagues, I 
am in favour of the establishment, by the federal government, of a 
single food inspection agency.
<P>
	Members may find it strange that a sovereignist is supporting the 
establishment of a Canadian agency in the health sector. Let me 
explain. Between 1980 and 1985, I worked for the former Minister 
of Agriculture of Québec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> The best.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Yes, at the time, everything was working fine in the 
agriculture sector. You will recall that, since 1978 at least, Quebec 
has been combining, various services in the agri-food sector. 
Quebec's agriculture department is called Department of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, and is also responsible for fishing and 
marketing.
<P>
	Being bigger, the federal government was slower to react. 
Finally, in 1996, almost 18 years later, it realized that it had to 
combine three food inspection services from three different 
departments. Not so long ago, Industry Canada also had its own 
inspection service.
<P>
	We have been told that this ought to be done because it 
represents savings of $40 million. If the figures are right, and if we 
add them all together over a period of, let us say, 10 years, it means 
that because of its lack of efficiency and of duplication in three of 
its own departments, the government lost $400 million. It now 
recognizes that it has been inefficient for 18 years. That is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	Yes, we want the federal government to put its house in order 
but, as usual, a number of clauses in this bill will make it possible, 
through the Department of Agriculture and other departments, for 
the government to infringe on provincial jurisdiction. The bill 
reads in part that the federal government may enter into agreements 
with the provinces, but I doubt that it will because most of the time 
it does not.
<P>
	The Quebec government gave its approval to the spirit of the bill, 
but last summer, at a meeting of agriculture ministers, the Quebec 
minister, speaking for his government, said: ``The premiers urge 
the ministers concerned to ask that the Canadian food inspection 
system's implementation group recommend before the end of the 
year ways to set up a Canadian food inspection system. That is true.
<P>
	At the annual agriculture ministers' conference held in Victoria 
on July 3 and 4, the ministers adopted the wording proposed by the 
Quebec minister, which reminded the federal government that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5382"> 5382 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec  government intended to co-operate in eliminating overlap 
and duplication, but asked that Quebec's jurisdiction be respected.
<P>
	Since I am familiar with agriculture, I know that Quebec has 
about 495 officials working in food inspection and that in the three 
federal departments mentioned in the bill there are at least 600 
officials involved in food inspection in Quebec. I talk about 
Quebec because it is the province I know best.
<P>
	So, there is a total of 1,100 federal and provincial employees to 
inspect food in Quebec. I can understand that the federal 
government wanted to streamline its services. But it should go a 
step further and respect provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	If the federal government is sincere in its willingness to work 
with the provinces, it should negotiate with the Quebec agriculture 
department a way for the provinces to apply the required standards 
because food products do not only travel from province to 
province, but also to other countries. So the federal government 
would set common standards that would be accepted by the 
provincial agriculture ministers and by the federal minister, and 
Quebec, which has already integrated its services and which acted a 
long time ago to eliminate overlap, would apply these standards.
<P>
	One food inspection service, with responsibilities for 
municipalities with regard to the third market is the one for 
distribution in Montreal, Quebec City, Sherbrooke and 
Trois-Rivières. We have already made arrangements with these 
municipalities so they can enforce the regulations in restaurants 
because it is more easily done at the municipal level.
<P>
	The federal government should do the same thing as Quebec did 
with its large cities and work out an integrated action plan with 
Quebec so we no longer have two kinds of food inspectors: type A, 
B and C laboratories. This system often causes confusion, and 
some agricultural producers, depending on the region, are affected 
by this conflict between two jurisdictions.
<P>
	Yes, this bill is an improvement, or it would be more accurate to 
describe it as policy of the not so bad, because the federal 
government has been inefficient in the area of food inspection for 
at least 20 years. We hope it will be more efficient in the future, and 
the ideal situation would be a co-operative arrangement between 
the federal government and the Quebec government to eliminate 
overlap and create a fully integrated and coherent network.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to the bill establishing the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency for a number of reasons. The 
first is that it is a fine example of the good faith shown by Quebec's 
sovereignists in their  belief in the importance of having a free and 
open economic association in Canada for the future.
<P>
	With the federal government, we have a situation where three 
departments, Health Canada, Agriculture Canada and Fisheries and 
Oceans, have, for many years now, in the course of their activities, 
been stepping on each other's feet. We also have horror stories to 
tell, which, I hope, will no longer be the case with the new 
legislation. In any event, let us hope that these changes will help to 
improve matters. I will give you an example.
<P>
	It concerns a farmer in my riding, a producer of pure-bred sheep, 
who, last year, was the victim of a completely inexplicable change 
in behaviour from the Canadian bureaucracy.
<P>
	In the past, when there were signs of illness in his flock, or in the 
flock of any other producer, the exposed animals were put down, 
and the producer was compensated accordingly.
<P>
	Last year, the regulation was changed, and we spent a long time 
looking for an explanation. Now, the affected animals are placed in 
quarantine. That is all very fine and well when you have large 
flocks, like they do out west, where there are some very large 
operations. But, when you are looking at small operations, such as 
in Quebec right now, this jeopardizes the producer's reputation and 
it does so for several years. There could have been an error at a 
given time, but small operations must not be shut down and, 
because of one error, producers prevented from continuing to 
operate. This was an example of too many cooks spoiling the broth. 
Certain policies do not necessarily apply in the same way, say as 
between Quebec and western Canada, but it could be the 
Maritimes. It could be different between large and small centres. 
We must continue to have latitude.
<P>
	Therefore, we are in favour, if the food inspection issue can be 
simplified, and if there can be harmonization so that our operations 
can be as competitive as possible
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	The other horror story I would like to tell you is about a small 
abattoir in my riding, which slaughters a number of different types 
of animal. It has been systematically hit hard by the department, 
almost picked on, with a demand that it comply overnight, or 
nearly, with exactly the same standards as a multinational meat 
packing plant would have to meet. This causes problems, for it can 
mean the death of small businesses. Solutions to problems of this 
kind must be found.
<P>
	So, if creation of a federal food inspection agency enables us to 
do away with these picky standards, and to have more appropriate 
behaviour by inspectors, as well as fewer rules to make problems 
for organizations, all the better.
<P>
	There is no question of doing away with food safety standards. 
Everyone agrees that we need topnotch safety standards, which are 
exactly what is required for consumer satisfaction, but at the same 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5383"> 5383 </A></B>
<P>
time, we must not place businesses in situations that cannot be 
remedied in the short term. They must be given time to make 
adjustments, and the type of market they are in also needs to be 
take into account, so as to not necessarily apply the same standards 
to a multinational as to a small business.
<P>
	This is where Bill C-60 falls down. It is a bill which will return 
management of food inspection once again into the hands of people 
who are not necessarily experts in the field-which seems to be a 
trend with this government. There is a good deal of latitude 
concerning partisan appointments to the board which will 
administer the act, and corrections are therefore required in this 
aspect of it.
<P>
	Indeed, we intend to work on this. I would like to quote the 
position taken by the Quebec government at a conference of the 
ministers concerned by the creation of the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency. Quebec, in a show of good faith, said the 
following: ``The Premier urges the ministers concerned to ask that 
the Canadian food inspection system's implementation group 
recommend ways to set up a Canadian food inspection system that 
respects the jurisdictions of all governments''. So this was an 
honest gesture.
<P>
	In other words, we were saying: At last you are streamlining 
your operations by having only one agency instead of three. So if 
you do that properly and respect the jurisdictions of all 
governments as reflected in a future agreement, we are showing our 
good faith and are prepared to sit down at the table with 
representatives of the federal, provincial and territorial 
governments.
<P>
	Interestingly, this attitude is inspired by the European Union 
model, a kind of common legislative basis. If it works, it will be an 
example of how partnership, for instance, could work between a 
sovereign Quebec and Canada. It could be a very interesting 
exercise, and we have already had an example of this-although 
Diane Francis and the <I>Financial Post</I> may not agree-in the dairy 
production sector, where Canada's major dairy provinces, with the 
exception of British Columbia, have created an open market. 
Irrespective of the status of the Quebec government, there would be 
this open market, which would continue to develop now and in the 
future, so that the system would work effectively.
<P>
	The same option is on the table now. When we say that the 
sovereignists want to help build a satisfactory economic market in 
Canada, this is a concrete example.
<P>
	So we agree with creating only one agency, provided it respects 
the jurisdictions of each sector. I think that if the federal 
government does its streamlining but on the other hand continues 
to infringe on Quebec's jurisdictions, we will not have solved a 
thing. It will then be up to the federal government to deal with this. 
However, if creating the agency helps to clarify the  situation, if it 
helps make our businesses more competitive and allows for the fact 
that the local slaughterhouse in Saint-Pascal-de-Kamouraska 
cannot be expected to meet the same stringent standards one would 
apply to a multinational, it could be an interesting development.
<P>
	But in that case, it will be necessary to respect the various 
jurisdictions. If the federal government says it is wall to wall from 
Vancouver to Halifax and the same standards apply everywhere, we 
will be stuck with the same problems. However, if the government 
streamlines its operations by creating an agency that will respect 
the jurisdictions of all concerned and apply standards that are 
satisfactory to this province within the provincial context, we may 
get some interesting results.
<P>
	In concluding, to achieve this the federal government will have 
to eliminate the partisan aspect of the way it appoints the people 
who will manage the system.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	The commission which will be responsible for management will 
probably be strongly influenced by the position of the government. 
People appointed by a province and, within the agency, people 
coming from a province but appointed by the federal government 
and provincial authorities could still work at cross purposes. 
Jurisdictions will have to be clearly respected.
<P>
	We have an opportunity before us. Sovereignists from Quebec 
are open to trade with the rest of Canada, they trust Canada and 
showing their good faith. If the federal government changed some 
aspects of its act and reviewed its operation, we would have before 
us an interesting model which could be exported and which would 
bring Canadians to understand that sovereignty and partnership are 
the way of future not only of Quebec but of Canada as a whole.

<P>
	This bill, which is entitled an Act respecting the oceans of 
Canada, is prefaced by some rather surprising ``whereases''. This is 
indeed surprising in a bill that is supposed to outline the way things 
will be done; these ``whereases'' are statements of intent, the kind 
one would expect in the preamble of a policy paper rather than a

	This bill might have been coloured by the minister who initiated 
it, but the, not a policy statement, states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas Parliament wishes to reaffirm Canada's role as a world leader in oceans 
and marine resources management;</BLOCKQUOTE>
In our opinion, this is not only pompous, but in view of the 
resources not provided for the implementation of such a policy, 
rather misleading.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	I will read another one:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas Parliament wishes to affirm in Canadian domestic law Canada's 
sovereign rights, jurisdiction and responsibilities in the exclusive economic zone of 
Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What is interesting, in this instance, is that Parliament wishes to 
affirm its sovereignty or Canada's sovereign rights over its 
exclusive economic zone when, in the first whereas, it was said that 
Parliament wishes to reaffirm Canada's role.
<P>
	In committee, the Bloc Quebecois proposed an amendment to 
clarify that ``Whereas'' so that this paragraph would not mean we 
are changing the respective roles of the provinces and the federal 
government in the control of the territory.
<P>
	Yes, as Quebecers, we are concerned by this provision and no, 
the government did not follow-up on our propositions.
<P>
	Let me quote the bill again:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, in collaboration with other 
ministers, boards and agencies of the Government of Canada, with provincial and 
territorial governments and with affected aboriginal organizations, coastal 
communities and other persons and bodies,-is encouraging the development and 
implementation of a national strategy for the management of estuarine, coastal and 
marine ecosystems.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That statement, which appears in various other places in the bill, 
is quite clear on the role of the provinces in the distribution of 
powers and responsibilities as the government sees it. Even if it 
comes from one department, that bill is presumably endorsed by 
government as a whole.
<P>
	It is odd that, at this time in the history of Canada, the federal 
government would present a new bill where it treats provinces as 
private individuals or corporate bodies with whom it could 
eventually co-operate if it sees fit to do so, considering that, during 
the recent Jasper conference, in the absence of Quebec, provincial 
premiers examined their respective powers, agreed to follow-up on 
that point and talked about their eventual shared management of 
canadian federalism in areas like social programs and such, and at a 
time when there is, all over Canada, and not counting Quebec once 
again, a great determination to review the dynamics of Canadian 
powers and responsibilities.
<P>
	I am talking about this issue because, in Canada, Quebec has 
been too often identified as the spoilsport, the one making it 
impossible to come to an agreement, while what we find out is that, 
on many issues, aside from Quebec which has its partnership 
project, Canadian provinces or at least a number of them say they 
want to take part in the management of this country. It is true in the 
social sector and in many others.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	This bill is totally unacceptable to us because it divides the 
Department of the Environment who is already conflicting with the 
provinces in some areas of jurisdiction. It seems to divide the 
department into sectoral components. Thus there would be a sector 
for fisheries, oceans and ecosystems, which is very surprising and 
worrisome because it is obvious that, when dealing with 
ecosystems, even though it says in chapter 2 that this part does not 
deal with rivers, the department can also meddle throughout the 
territory.
<P>
	Since the Department of the Environment is announcing 30 per 
cent cuts over three years, how can we increase its activities if it 
does not get any means to do so?
<P>
	Finally, it has been said time and again that the department's 
power to impose user fees for the coast guard and the minister's 
authority to impose registration even on pleasure craft constitute an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5385"> 5385 </A></B>
<P>
outrageous abuse that leads us to foresee further centralization that 
makes no sense at this time, not only in Quebec, but throughout 
Canada.
<P>
	We asked that this bill be postponed; it is definitely in no shape 
to be passed by this House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Order. It is my 
duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce-nuclear test 
ban treaty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am happy to speak to the bill on Canada's 
oceans, because this is an important strategic tool of which Quebec 
will be deprived. We have a very good case in point. This bill will 
regulate the setting of fees for services including ice breaking and 
navigational aids like buoys on the St. Lawrence. There is already a 
unanimous consensus in Quebec against the measures proposed in 
this bill. Since this is a federal jurisdiction, we must express 
Quebec's views and let the House know that this bill will reduce the 
competitiveness of all the industries along the St. Lawrence.
<P>
	The government made an important, deliberate choice in 
deciding to reduce by 50 per cent its involvement in the area of 
transportation. Transport Canada is in the process of divesting 
itself of its port facilities. It is proposing that local authorities take 
responsibility for the future of port facilities. This could be an 
interesting proposal, because it has done such a terrible job for so 
long that, if it gives these facilities back to the local authorities, 
they will at least have control over the decisions affecting them.
<P>
	I think it was malicious on the part of the government to, at the 
same time, make the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
responsible for setting the fees to be charged for services on the 
river. On one hand, they are asking local authorities to take over the 
facilities and telling them: ``Make them viable so we can do 
something interesting with them in the future. On the other hand, 
we will continue to set fees for services on the river and impose 
significant increases''. As a result, boats, stevedores and transport 
management workers will face new choices in the future and 
wonder whether they would be better off going through New 
England, through U.S. ports on the Atlantic side rather than 
through the St. Lawrence.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	One might say: ``The opposition party condemns this, that is all 
does''. That is the position of the Société de développement 
économique du Saint-Laurent, which raised the matter in a letter to 
the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	This corporation represents, according to this list here, at least 
30 different organizations, including members of Quebec's 
aluminum industry association and some big names like Alcan 
Aluminum, the Alouette aluminum smelter, and so on. It also 
includes the Association des  armateurs du Saint-Laurent, the 
Association des industries forestières du Québec, the 
Administration de pilotage des Laurentides, the Bateau-Mouche du 
Québec, stakeholders from various areas.
<P>
	The Act respecting the oceans of Canada will give the federal 
government, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada in particular, the 
authority to raise fees, putting into question the competitiveness of 
port facilities along the St. Lawrence River. That is why this bill 
absolutely must be opposed, because it takes away from Quebec a 
major development tool which is also used everywhere along the 
St. Lawrence seaway.
<P>
	It could have a major negative impact on all shipping to Ontario. 
Behind all this are choices to be made and, in a way, the federal 
government has chosen to fail Quebec in that respect. While a 
completely different decision could have been made, a choice was 
made to protect the bureaucracy. There is an major clean-up to do 
with regard to icebreakers and in the federal St. Lawrence River 
management system.
<P>
	Take for example the fact that all icebreakers in the Atlantic 
region operate out of Halifax. This may be very interesting for 
people in the maritimes, but icebreakers work mostly in the St. 
Lawrence and every time they have to fill up, they must go back to 
Halifax. This is strange, because it is from Halifax that the Irving 
corporation controls oil operations.
<P>
	Why is such a situation not corrected? Why did the department 
not clean up its act? Instead of asking for a fee increase, it might 
have been better to do a cleanup inside and to say: ``We have to 
review the coast guard issue. We have to see if we can provide the 
same services at a lesser cost, or in a different way''.
<P>
	This is not what the act will do. It will make sure that the 
bureaucracy is being taken care of, at the expense of the businesses 
that have to live with these economic realities. We are talking about 
cost for icebreaking and fees for navigation aids, buoys. What is 
tragic is that this measure jeopardizes the reform of port activities 
in Canada.
<P>
	The parliamentary transport committee is currently travelling 
across Canada regarding Bill C-44. Everywhere it will stop, people 
will tell its members, as was the case in Vancouver, where the issue 
was not icebreaking but dredging costs: ``You are generating costs 
to us that will kill any desire on our part to take over the facilities 
you are offering us''.
<P>
	Same thing in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Let me give you a 
concrete example. In Cacouna, the port development corporation 
has already issued a letter of intent to the government and it is 
prepared to take action, to negotiate with the federal government. 
In fact, negotiations are about to be undertaken, and consultations 
are already taking place on a regular basis.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5386"> 5386 </A></B>
<P>
	But the biggest fear in that community is not so much over what 
is going on at Transport Canada-in fact dealing with transport 
officials can be interesting-but rather how the port will be 
affected by the new fees imposed under the Oceans Act and the 
increase in fees.
<P>
	There are so many negative consequences involved that people 
often say: ``Let us take a little more time before making a 
decision''. We should look into this, because these are questions 
that SODES, the St. Lawrence Economic Development Council, 
asked the Minister of Transport. because it would appear that he 
listens better.
<P>
	They have a vision, and I think the government should have kept 
all these services under the authority of a single organization. This 
way, decisions could have be made in a more rational and 
co-ordinated fashion. Right now, there is something machiavellian 
about the system. We would think that the separation between the 
two departments was to ensure that the local community remains 
responsible for the facilities and picks up the tab for related 
services. These are very bad choices the federal government has 
made and it does not look good.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	These questions that have remained unanswered so far come 
from the St. Lawrence Economic Development Council. The 
official opposition is not the only one asking questions. How will 
these changes affect the selection of operators? Will businesses and 
industrial sectors be forced to close? Will the higher fees result in 
services being provided elsewhere than on the St. Lawrence River?
<P>
	Are there financial losses involved for these businesses, not only 
losses resulting from closures but also other types of losses? Will 
the investment potential be affected? This is a fundamental 
question. The decisions that will be made under the marine act will 
affect economic choices in 5, 10, 15 or 20 years. Major 
corporations such as Alcan, which is a member of SODES, do see 
this.
<P>
	This is the type of issues people wonder about. With its Oceans 
Act, the federal government deliberately chose to take this strategic 
tool away from Quebec and this is why we must oppose the bill. 
The government must absolutely redo its homework and give the 
federal transport department responsibility for user fees again, so 
that there will be only one decision maker, who will take into 
account all the economic criteria, before making a choice.
<P>
	It is not true that we only have to subsidize coast guard 
icebreakers. The decisions made must take into account the 
economic reality as a whole, and we must make sure that, in the 
end, no additional damage is done through a fee increase, which 
would mean more costs to the economy as a whole and also to the 
governments involved.
<P>
	In conclusion, the bill should be rejected. It is not a measure that 
will serve the interests of Quebec, and this is why the official 
opposition will vote against it.

	The House resumed from October 8, 1996, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-29, an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and 
the importation for commercial purposes of certain 
manganese-based substances, be read the third time and passed, 
and the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to speak on this bill, which is being read for the 
third time. We are debating Bill C-29, an Act to regulate 
interprovincial trade in and the importation for commercial 
purposes of certain manganese-based substances.
<P>
	The main product affected by this bill is a fuel additive called 
MMT, which has been in use since 1976 to increase the octane 
rating in almost all unleaded gasoline. The Canadian General 
Standards Board has set the maximum quantity at 18 milligrams of 
manganese per litre.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	I am not a chemist, but I think it is appropriate and legitimate for 
each and every one of us to wonder about the ongoing battle 
between two large industries, the oil industry and the auto industry, 
and about the nature and the effects of the products these industries 
are manufacturing and marketing. Often, catastrophes happen 
because of a lack of vigilance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5387"> 5387 </A></B>
<P>
	In my riding alone, we are still dealing with the problems of 
the lagoons in Mercier which were contaminated by stored toxic 
waste and with the Chateauguay River which was contaminated 
by chemical fertilizers.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois was in favour of this bill at the second 
reading stage. This was to allow the government to proceed with a 
more thorough study of its bill. However, it did not take advantage 
of this opportunity. It is trying to ban a substance without 
demonstrating that this is a necessary and reasonable solution to a 
real problem. We are not convinced at all that it is right. Thus, the 
Bloc Quebecois is forced to oppose this bill.
<P>
	We consider that the fundamental reasons of this bill remain 
obscure. The government and the industry suspect the 
manganese-based substances damage automobile anti-pollution 
systems. But nothing proves this beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Independent tests could not prove that MMT has a negative effect.
<P>
	Here is what was concluded from a test program carried out by 
the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, in the United 
States:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As for the arguments put forward by the American Automobile Manufacturers' 
Association opposing the conclusions of the EPA to the effect that MMT does not 
alter ``all or part'' of the operation of the vehicle exhaust system, the court decided 
they were of absolutely no value. First, the court indicated that the EAP had 
established ``that the additive used by Ethyl had easily passed the tests required for 
the study of the most severe requests ever made statistically speaking''. Moreover, 
the court noted that the EAP had examined according to more severe criteria the 
Ethyl data on the use of the additive in the vehicles produced by the highest 
technology and had indicated that the APE could not detect any real increase of the 
emissions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When we are talking about car problems, I think that all of us 
who have cars are the best experts. I have a car that reached 50,000 
kilometres last week. Yet, after 50,000 kilometres, I get exactly the 
same distance per litre as when I first bought the car. My previous 
car, which I changed just 20 months ago, had 150,00 kilometres on 
it. It never needed major repairs or maintenance, just an oil change 
every now and then.
<P>
	I understand perfectly well when automakers tell us that their 
research is secret, that they cannot say anything to us about it, that 
it is difficult to demonstrate that MMT is harmful to vehicles. I 
have proof. We all drive cars and we are all in a position to know if 
MMT is really harmful to vehicles.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Some say also that this product could be harmful to our health 
and to the environment. Nothing could be less certain. Until now, 
neither Environment Canada nor Health Canada has banned MMT. 
Ethyl Corporation goes even further, saying that MMT helps 
reduce nitrogen monoxide emissions, one of the causes of urban  
smog. If MMT was banned, this could result in an increase in the 
amount of smog in our cities.
<P>
	Here is what was said about a series of tests conducted by Ethyl 
Corporation. It was said that, to satisfy the U.S. Clean Air Act 
requirements for the reintroduction of MMT in unleaded gasolines 
in the United States, Ethyl Corporation conducted the most 
extensive series of tests ever undertaken on a gasoline additive. 
The testing program was designed with the assistance of the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. automakers to evaluate 
and document the effect of MMT performance additive on 
automobile tailpipe emissions and to determine the implications 
for air quality if MMT additives were used in the U.S. gasoline.
<P>
	Four different pairs of cars were driven 75,000 miles with and 
without MMT to evaluate the effectiveness of MMT in oxygenated 
fuels (MTBE and ethanol). The tests showed that adding MMT to 
these fuels reduces nitrogen monoxide levels as well as the toxic 
and chemical reactivity of unburned hydrocarbons.
<P>
	The testing carried out by Ethyl Corporation went far beyond the 
tests conducted by automobile manufacturers in Canada and in the 
United States, as confirmed by the United States Court of Appeal in 
its ruling handed down April 14, 1995, ordering the EPA to grant 
Ethyl an exemption.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to ban manganese-based substances 
because they are apparently dangerous. Yet, this same bill allows 
the use of MMT in gasoline containing lead. If it is okay in gasoline 
containing lead, why is not okay in lead free gasoline?
<P>
	The situation is not clear. In the United States, the ban on MMT 
has been the focus of a legal war with the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, which sought to have it banned completely. The 
Court of Appeal decided otherwise, which leaves me thinking that 
it has not yet been shown that MMT is a product dangerous to the 
health or the environment.
<P>
	The following is a summary of the ruling handed down by the 
Court of Appeal ordering the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency to issue an notice lifting the ban on MMT.
<P>
	On April 14, 1995, the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of 
Columbia handed down its decision in the case of Ethyl 
Corporation vs the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in 
which Ethyl challenged the July 13, 1994 rejection by the EPA of 
the application by Ethyl to have the ban on MMT in lead free 
gasoline lifted.
<P>
	The Court established that the director had breached the 
conditions clearly set out in section 211 by turning down Ethyl's 
application to have the ban on MMT for public health reasons 
lifted. According to the Court, because Congress had given the EPA 
the mandate to evaluate solely in terms of emissions the implica-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5388"> 5388 </A></B>
<P>
tions of applications to have bans lifted, and because Ethyl had  met 
the prescribed requirements, it felt that the director of the EPA had 
overstepped his authority by turning down Ethyl's request to have 
the ban on MMT lifted. In light of these facts, the Court issued a 
direct order to the EPA to grant Ethyl's request and lift the ban on 
the corporation's fuel additive.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Here are the very two points they would have us believe, and 
which are the reasons behind the tabling of this bill, that is, the 
damage that can be done to automobiles, and the health problems 
that can arise. In both cases, neither the automobile manufacturers 
nor certain courts in the United States have come up with 
conclusive evidence.
<P>
	We are, however, entitled to wonder why the government is so 
bent on replacing MMT. The determination of the federal Liberals 
to ban MMT will cost Quebecers and Canadians several tens of 
millions of dollars, and possibly over $100 million. Gas consumers 
are going to pay the bill, largely through increases of probably 1 
cent per litre in the price of gas at the pump.
<P>
	The costs generated by this bill could escalate further. On 
September 10 this year, the Ethyl Corporation, an American 
company, filed a notice of intent to submit a complaint, with a view 
to obtaining compensation totalling $201 million in American 
currency or $275 million in Canadian currency, pursuant to section 
1116 of the North American Free Trade Agreement signed by the 
Canadian government. The company claims that Bill C-29 violates 
certain provisions of NAFTA and that as a result, it subsidiary, 
Ethyl Canada, will suffer losses when the bill comes into force.
<P>
	In the circumstances, it is surprising to see the government 
continue this exercise. The issue is divisive, and the debate still 
goes on, even within the government caucus. It would seem that 
with this bill, the Canadian government knowingly exposes itself to 
legal action, which today seems imminent.
<P>
	Last February, the Minister for International Trade warned the 
Minister of the Environment in a letter of the possibility of legal 
action. With Bill C-29, Canada seeks to prohibit imports of MMT, 
without in any way restricting the domestic production, sale or use 
of this product. This is further evidence of the bill's lack of 
purpose.
<P>
	The government continues this exercise regardless because some 
major interests are at stake. What is at stake is ethanol. We know 
that Ontario and western Canada, with a research budget of $70 
million from the federal government, want to take over the 
production of ethanol and in the process replace MMT. The 
problems this may cause for employment are of minor importance 
to the federal government. We in Quebec have had a taste of this 
kind of medicine in the past.
<P>
	Previously, the federal government caused a real disaster in the 
petrochemical industry in East Montreal, that benefited western 
Canada. The Borden line, established in 1963, led to Montreal's 
losing four of its six refineries in the seventies and eighties. Nearly 
8,000 jobs were lost as a result. In fact, I would like to take this 
opportunity to renew an invitation from Quebec's Minister of 
Finance, Bernard Landry, to his federal counterpart and the Prime 
Minister of Canada, asking them to pay regular visits to Montreal 
east so they will remember the damage done by the federal 
government and the consequences that are still being felt today.
<P>
	The same happened in the case of the Auto Pact in 1965. It led to 
a concentration of the automotive industry in southern Ontario, 
thus encouraging closer ties with the American automotive 
industry. I know the federal government will not admit that this 
industrial raiding is the cause of Quebec's current economic 
problems, but I can tell you it is the main reason why Quebecers 
want to see a sovereign Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Another example of disinformation: 76,000 lost jobs in Quebec 
in July and August, supposedly because of the political uncertainty. 
The Prime Minister of Canada made the effort to travel to Beauce 
this summer to voice his claim that Quebec's economic woes were 
the result of political uncertainty. Yet, in August, when Quebec 
created 41,000 jobs, or 50 per cent of the figure for all of Canada, 
no one in the federal government could be found to visit Quebec 
and talk to us about political uncertainty.
<P>
	As for the sad fate of the other provinces, it did not occur to any 
Liberal MP to link that to political uncertainty. As well as operating 
from a double standard, the government is moving ahead with no 
concern for its partners in the federation. Six provinces already, in 
other words a majority, have made known their opposition to Bill 
C-29. The provinces have a say on the issue of gasoline additives.
<P>
	In passing legislation on interprovincial trade, the government is 
again interfering in areas of provincial jurisdiction. What has 
become of the decentralizing federalism promised during the 
referendum campaign? We are still stuck with the never-ending 
centralization of powers and decisions on the federal level.
<P>
	Since the Liberals regained power in Ottawa, the last thing in the 
government's mind is respect for the fundamental law of this 
country. For example, it systematically refused to comply with 
Alberta's request to include the subject of MMT on the agenda of 
the conference of natural resources ministers, which took place in 
Yellowknife recently.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5389"> 5389 </A></B>
<P>
	In short, we are faced with a battle between two major 
industries; the automotive industry and the petroleum industry do 
not agree on the use of their products. Who will back off? Who 
is right? Who will win?
<P>
	Who will pay? The user, I am sure. But I am equally sure that we 
would be able to predict the outcome if we were only able to see 
who has contributed the most to the slush fund.
<P>
	In conclusion, we on this side of the House are going to vote 
against Bill C-29. It is more the result of efforts by lobbyists and 
corporate self-interest than a reflection of real public interest. As 
far as the content is concerned, nothing leads us to believe that 
MMT will be banned along with manganese-based products. As far 
as form is concerned, this is a hastily thrown together effort which 
is simply adding fuel to the fire.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
today I had the opportunity to meet with representatives of the 
Canadian Automobile Dealers Association. I had a good 
conversation with Mr. Douglas R. Leggat, chairman of the 
Federation of Automobile Dealer Associations of Canada and 
MMT certainly was an issue with them.
<P>
	He reminded me of the fact that General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, 
Toyota, Honda, BMW, Jaguar, Hyundai, Mazda, Nissan, Rolls 
Royce, Subaru, Volvo and I could go on, all these automobile 
manufacturers have registered their support in favour of the ban on 
MMT. On top of that there is a national survey of Canadians which 
says that the majority of Canadians also support the ban on MMT.
<P>
	How can the member say that the government is not serious 
about this bill and that it does not represent the well-being of 
Canadians as reflected by those impacted by it? It is an important 
issue and the government is certainly very serious about 
proceeding with this bill. That is why it has come before the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. There is no doubt in my mind and in the mind of Bloc 
members that the issue is a very serious one indeed.
<P>
	I went through all the documents made available to us, either by 
the health department or others; I mentioned earlier a couple of 
specific examples, and I will not go over them again.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	I will be pleased to provide the member with a copy of this 
information, if he does not have it already.
<P>
	Neither the health community nor the car manufacturers can 
provide us at the present time with any conclusive example, test or 
study showing that MMT is a hazard. We are told, for instance, that 
it causes damages to vehicles. Again, as I said earlier, I believe that 
those who are in the best position to notice that MMT causes 
damages to cars are the users.
<P>
	All of us are users. I am one. I have been driving for years, and 
when I put 150,000 kilometres on my car without any repairs, I 
have my doubts when car manufacturers tell me that MMT is a 
problem.
<P>
	With regard to the health issue, it is more difficult of course to 
show, to clearly demonstrate which product is harmful and which 
one is not. I mentioned a slew of cases before the American courts; 
there again, it proved impossible to show that MMT was a health 
hazard.
<P>
	Third, I cannot understand, if it were that much of a health 
hazard, why Canada, not another country, would allow it to be 
manufactured, exported, and added to unleaded gasoline. It would 
not make any sense if it were that harmful. It does not make any 
sense to tell us it is extremely harmful and then, turn around and 
allow it to be added to gasoline.
<P>
	With regard to the poll, I must sincerely tell you that if someone 
called me at home asking me whether I agreed or not, given how 
little I know about the production of MMT, I would have to listen to 
the preamble. And when you tell people in the preamble that it is 
harmful, they say: ``If it is harmful, ban it''.
<P>
	For my part, I agree with the member that this issue is very 
serious, but the government has not been serious enough for me to 
vote in favour of the bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Madam Speaker, there is an important aspect here 
that the member has raised. That is that we cannot prove beyond a 
reasonable doubt whether there are problems. There is a suspicion 
and a risk element here that is apparent from the work that has been 
done. It makes me recall the circumstances surrounding the 
substance ureaformaldehyde. It was a substance that was used very 
prevalently in our insulation systems and things were discovered 
later.
<P>
	The point is that if we are going to make legislation and we are 
going to err, the prudent thing to do is to err on the side of caution. 
Concerns have been raised. I think the member would agree that if 
over time there is an error made, that the error on the side of 
caution which errs in favour of protecting the health of Canadians 
in dealing with a potentially serious environmental issue and a 
potentially damaging situation simply to the operation of motor 
vehicles, it is the prudent course to take.
<P>
	Would the member agree with that assessment?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin: </B>Madam Speaker, as I said earlier, this is undoubtly a 
serious matter.

<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	I think that where there is a little confusion is that it is not a new 
product being introduced, but rather an old product being 
withdrawn. This is totally different from a new product; such a 
product must be approved and greater caution must be exercised.
<P>
	I believe this is not the issue. The issue is that Ontario, especially 
Ontario, with a subsidy of, I think, $70 million, wants to produce 
ethanol, wants to monopolize the market. I believe this is the real 
issue. They come from Ontario, I understand that, and they want to 
immediately take over ethanol production, and the purpose of 
eliminating MMT is to replace it by ethanol.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, B.Q.):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank 
you for allowing me to speak immediately because, shortly after 
six, I must take a plane to Winnipeg where I will replace a Bloc 
Quebecois colleague on the justice committee which is holding 
consultations on young offenders. I also want to thank my 
colleague from the Reform Party who agreed to let me speak before 
him.
<P>
	I am happy to participate in this third reading debate on Bill 
C-29, an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and the importation 
for commercial purposes of certain manganese-based substances. 
That bill would prohibit the utilisation of manganese-based 
products, including MMT. That additive has been added to 
unleaded gasoline since 1977 in Canada. However, it is important 
to mention that Bill C-29 does not ban the production, sale or 
utilisation of MMT in Canada.
<P>
	Just like all my other colleagues from the Bloc who participated 
in this debate, I also think that this bill raises several questions. The 
economic and environmental consequences of this bill, as well as 
its impact on trade between Canadian provinces and between 
Canada and our southern neighbour, the United States, command a 
more thorough consideration before we pass the bill as readily as 
the Liberal would want us to.
<P>
	I wonder about the relevance and the appropriateness of such a 
bill considering that this government should, in theory, first and 
foremost see to the common well-being of the country. I say in 
theory because, judging by the spirit of Bill C-29, in fact, the 
government seems to be acting in favour of one small group at the 
expense of Canadians and Quebecers in general.
<P>
	Therefore, I cannot support Bill C-29 because there seems to be 
a disproportion between the costs and benefits for the population. I 
also will not support Bill C-29 because I feel it is unfair since it 
favours the wealthiest people in our society, that is the majors of 
the automobile industry who gather more and more in the very 
Liberal province of Ontario.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to salute the 26,000 General Motors 
workers who are now on strike at the plants in Boisbriand, Quebec, 
and in Oshawa, St. Catharines, Windsor, London and Woodstock in 
Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	These people are out on strike to save their jobs and to prevent 
this multinational company from selling two automotive parts 
plants in Ontario, plants which employ some 3,800 unionized 
workers. These workers are also striking in protest against General 
Motors' undue reliance on outside suppliers for parts. In most 
cases, the subcontractors employ non-unionized workers who are 
paid less.
<P>
	I wish to express my solidarity with the CAW strikers, the 
Canadian automobile workers, and I wish them success. I hope they 
will sign shortly a good collective agreement with their employer.
<P>
	Having worked a considerable time in the labour movement I 
know a strike is never easy; it is difficult and I hope they will 
manage to reach an agreement in the very near future.
<P>
	One of the reasons put forward by the government in support of 
this bill is that MMT is harmful for the environment. Therefore, it 
is also harmful for public health. However, it is mainly the 
automobile manufacturers who are making these allegations. They 
contend that MMT in gas fouls up the car pollution control systems 
which could lead to an increase in the price of cars, therefore they 
threaten to reduce warranties and to disconnect the onboard 
diagnostic systems. The minister who introduced the bill was very 
receptive to these pressures which have more to do with 
blackmailing than with true warning against the harmful effects of 
a product.
<P>
	Blackmail, indeed, since at the same time other people were 
voicing a reverse opinion on this bill. Based on Health Canada 
studies, one of which was done on December 6, 1994, officials 
from the oil industry and the product distributors, particularly 
Ethyl Canada, claim that MMT is not harmful to public health. 
Results from several scientific tests also show the addition of a 
quantity of MMT to gasoline leads to a reduction of emissions 
contributing to the formation of ground-level ozone and urban 
smog. Contrary to statements made by the automotive insdustry 
lobby, with the ban on MMT, urban smog becomes more 
significant.
<P>
	If we withdraw MMT from gasoline, we will have to find a 
substitute for it. At the present time, it seems the Liberal 
government is in favour of ethanol, but ethanol production is 
financially and environmentally costly. Its production from corn 
pollutes the environment much more than MMT production.
<P>
	MMT requires less intensive treatment than ethanol, which 
means less carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide and 
sulphur dioxide from the stacks of plants producing gasoline. As 
for ethanol, fertilizers and pesticides used in corn production cause 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5391"> 5391 </A></B>
<P>
damage to soil. If the environmental and social arguments in favour 
of this bill do not hold, the same goes from the economic 
arguments.
<P>
	It has been demonstrated that costs related to the changes 
proposed by Bill C-29 are excessive. Canada simply cannot afford 
such rather irrational expenses.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	The substitute proposed for MMT, that is, ethanol, would require 
several millions of dollars in investments. Besides, as my 
colleague was saying earlier, the government has already launched 
an investment program of about $70 million for ethanol 
development. Coincidentally, an ethanol plant in Chatham, 
Ontario, a Liberal stronghold, has received federal government 
assistance.
<P>
	Undoubtedly, this bill is partisan, and it is not a coincidence that 
the government wants to have it passed at all costs. By giving in to 
the pressures of the automotive industry, which is concentrated in 
Hamilton West, the riding of the minister at the time, and in 
southwestern Ontario, and by favouring the ethanol industry, it is 
scoring political points.
<P>
	As taxpayers, the people of Canada and Quebec will lose a great 
deal in this project. According to some estimates, it will cost over 
$100 million in capital, including $7 million in Quebec alone, in 
addition to the operating costs of the refineries, which will have to 
leave the additive MMT out of their gasoline. If this bill is passed, 
the oil companies may threaten to lay off employees or to increase 
the price of gasoline.
<P>
	In addition to the production and transportation costs, there are 
the costs associated with the multiple lawsuits that might be 
launched by the American and Canadian companies hurt by this 
policy. It is imperative to point out that Bill C-29 violates certain 
provisions of international trade agreements, including NAFTA, as 
well as interprovincial trade treaties. Once again, through this bill, 
the Liberal government flouts certain sections of the Canadian 
Constitution prohibiting federal interference in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	On September 10, Ethyl Corporation, from the U.S., which is the 
only company manufacturing MMT and exporting it to Canada, 
filed a C$275 million lawsuit against the federal government. Ethyl 
argues that, under an article in NAFTA, its trade rights are being 
undermined by this legislation the government is about to pass. 
This multinational corporation alleges that its reputation has been 
damaged by the environment minister's comments on MMT.
<P>
	Last February, the Minister for International Trade sent a letter 
to his colleague, the Minister of the Environment, to warn her that 
prohibiting the importation of MMT would violate Canada's 
obligations under the terms of the World Trade Organization and 
NAFTA, and could only be justified for health or environmental 
reasons in light of the scientific evidence available.
<P>
	The Premier of Saskatchewan also informed the Prime Minister 
of his reservations about the impact of Bill C-29. In a letter dated 
September 16, he wrote that ``the bill is totally unjustified at this 
time''. It is the Government of Saskatchewan saying this. That 
provincial government's views should be taken into consideration.
<P>
	Saskatchewan is not the only province to object to Bill C-29. By 
attempting to regulate interprovincial trade, the federal 
government is once again interfering in an area of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Last May, the Quebec National Assembly unanimously passed a 
motion calling on the federal government to defer passage of Bill 
C-29. Of course, as in several other areas, the federal government 
continues to turn a deaf ear to the provinces opposing its legislative 
agenda. Once again, co-operation between the federal government 
and the provinces has become an important issue.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I cannot support this bill. The scientific 
evidence invoked to justify the ban on MMT is extremely weak, 
while environmental and economic considerations have not been 
taken into account. I, for one, feel that these aspects have an impact 
on the quality of life of Canadians and Quebecers. That is why we 
must look at them more seriously and carefully than this 
government is doing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member raises similar issues to those that have been raised by other 
speakers from the Bloc having to do with an indictment of the 
automobile lobby.
<P>
	As I indicated earlier, today I had an opportunity to meet with the 
Canadian Automobile Dealers Association and the chairman, 
Douglas R. Leggat from Burlington, Ontario. The issue of MMT is 
extremely important to them.
<P>
	The adverse effect of MMT stems from the fact that 
approximately 80 per cent of the combustion products of the 
additive remain in the engine combustion chamber and catalytic 
converter. This adversely affects the vehicle pollution control 
equipment and as a result will increase air pollution and consequent 
health implications.
<P>
	My question to the member comes down to, are we concerned 
about a potential problem of the lobbyist type or are we dealing 
with a risk to the environment and to the health of Canadians? I 
would like the member to tell me what the automobile industry has 
to gain from this other than to have products which reduce the 
pollution of Canada's environment.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is obvious to us that there is a very 
strong lobbying effort by the automotive industry on this issue. 
Like my hon. colleague, most of the government members who 
oppose our view are from Ontario, where there is a high 
concentration of car manufacturers.
<P>
	If you were really sure of your facts, you could discuss the 
matter with your colleague, the Minister of International Trade, 
who is also from Ontario, who wrote the Minister of the 
Environment, saying how concerned he was about the potential 
implications of this bill.
<P>
	If you are so right, why did the Government of Saskatchewan 
express very serious reservations about this bill? The Government 
of Quebec did the same thing; the Quebec National Assembly 
unanimously passed a resolution opposing this bill.
<P>
	I think it would be in the interests of the people of Canada and 
Quebec not to proceed with this bill, especially at a time when there 
is a difference of opinion in government, within Cabinet. I think the 
bill should be considered further before being brought back, given 
that it is very controversial.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight for the 
member that the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment 
task force on cleaner vehicles and fuels estimated that health 
benefits of up to $31 billion over 23 years would result from 
introducing cleaner fuels and more stringent vehicle emissions 
standards into the Canadian marketplace.
<P>
	Acknowledging that there is some uncertainty, some risk, some 
disagreement of opinion, would it not be prudent to proceed with 
this bill if we are to err on the side of caution in protection of the 
health of Canadians and the Canadian environment?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> With all due respect, Mr. Speaker, I do not think that 
the health of Canadians and Quebecers is at great risk. That is why I 
do not believe this bill is warranted in the circumstances. There are 
scientific studies to back me up on this.
<P>
	I think that the government is facing a huge challenge, because if 
there is no consensus within Cabinet itself, among its own 
members, it would be wiser not to go ahead with a bill as strongly 
criticized and as controversial as this one.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want to 
suggest that the scientificstudies the hon. member from the Bloc 
was referring to are studies that have been developed by the 
corporation in question which is producing MMT. One might try to 
understand whether these would be unbiased studies.
<P>
	Studies were conducted by the University of Waterloo, which is 
a very fine Canadian university with international and national 
reputation. The university has suggested that the studies that were 
conducted by Ethyl Corporation were not valid and were not 
conducted in a rigorous scientific way. I would suggest that the 
studies that the hon. member has brought forward are not entirely 
correct.
<P>
	The member talks about a lot of things in his speech. The debate 
right now is on the amendment, which is to postpone a vote on this 
bill for another six months. I find this amendment to be totally 
intolerable and unacceptable. I think Canadians who are watching 
us today also find this intolerable.
<P>
	Canadians find it intolerable that the Bloc and the Reform are 
colluding on this and are falling prey to a lobbying effort by an 
American multinational firm. If we are going to stand up for 
Canada, if we are going to stand up for the health of Canadians, if 
we are going to stand up for a clean environment for Canadians, we 
are not going to pander to the desires and needs of an American 
multinational. I say shame to them.
<P>
	I would point out in reference to the concerns the member 
opposite has raised, that the Canadian Council of Ministers of the 
Environment task force, which represents ministers from all the 
provinces in Canada, in its report on cleaner vehicles and fuels 
recognizes that fuels and emissions control technology should be 
treated as an integrated system to reduce motor vehicle emissions. 
The ministers have further agreed to require that cleaner fuels be 
mandated for use in all motor vehicles. The MMT initiative is fully 
consistent with this approach.
<P>
	I was in committee and there were witnesses from Ethyl 
Corporation. I asked the witness from Ethyl: Whose responsibility 
is it to ensure that we reduce unacceptable emissions? Is it the 
public? Is it the government? Is it the automotive industry? Is it the 
refinery? His answer to me was that all those other people had a 
responsibility but that the refineries and the producers of MMT had 
no responsibility. I think Canadians would find that absolutely 
unacceptable. The arguments that are put forward by both the Bloc 
and Reform support unacceptable arguments.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member from my side of the House who has a little bit 
of sense around this issue, I would suggest a lot of sense around 
this issue-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</b> He is a Liberal.

	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan: </B>He is a Liberal. Absolutely<B>.</B>
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5393"> 5393 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member asked a question of the member opposite, why 
would all of these automotive manufacturers put forward a 
situation where MMT is bad for their onboard diagnostic systems? 
We are talking about over 20 automotive manufacturers that are 
in competition with each other. They have spent millions of dollars 
conducting scientific tests. Why would they spend this money in 
a fiercely competitive market if they were not going after the 
truth?
<P>
	I want to add a few more truths about Bill C-29 to refute some of 
the untruths coming from the other side. The truth is that MMT 
impairs emission control equipment. If you want information on 
the formulation of fuel you should consult a refinery expert. If you 
want to understand the impact of that fuel on a vehicle you need to 
talk to the engineers and scientists who design and test vehicles.
<P>
	Everyone agrees that more than 80 per cent of the manganese 
that is added to gasoline stays in the automobile's engine and 
emissions control system. Guess what happens when it stays there? 
It gums up the works. It makes those systems inoperable. When 
those systems do not operate it makes it impossible to monitor all 
of the other emissions from that automobile.
<P>
	The member opposite in his speech spoke of the cost to 
consumers. Taking MMT out of gasoline will result in a $5 cost to 
the consumer for a year versus thousands and thousands of dollars 
of cost to their automobile. That is why the Canadian Automobile 
Association, which is the largest consumer group for the 
automobile drivers in Canada, is right behind this bill.
<P>
	Another truth is that if MMT was really as great as the 
corporation that produces it claims for vehicle performance and 
emission control, it would have been embraced by the automotive 
manufacturers in jurisdictions like California as part of their 
emission control standard. MMT is banned in California. If anyone 
in the House has been to California you know the kinds of problems 
it has with smog.
<P>
	The organizations that have been held accountable for achieving 
measures for emissions reductions have worked with leading 
academics, scientists and engineers around the world to find a way 
to reduce the pollution from vehicles. No jurisdiction or 
corporation has found MMT to be part of the solution.
<P>
	The truth is that Canada is the only jurisdiction in the developed 
world in which MMT is used on a national basis. In spite of the 
recent narrow technical decision of a U.S. court that forced the 
Environmental Protection Agency to grant Ethyl a waiver, MMT is 
still prohibited for use in over one-third of the U.S. states. A 
number of refineries do not allow MMT as part of their 
reformulation program.
<P>
	There is another truth which I would like to use to debunk 
opinions expressed by members of the House.  The Government of 
Canada has the authority under NAFTA to pass legislation like Bill 
C-29. I guess the members opposite are running like scared little 
chickens, afraid of this giant American multinational company. 
They are afraid to promote their sovereignty. I find it very 
interesting when we hear a lot of debate about sovereignty in this 
House.
<P>
	NAFTA has a safeguard that allows us to protect human, animal 
or plant life and health. This safeguard was enshrined in NAFTA to 
allow the federal government the ability to protect the environment 
and the health of Canadians without fear of having these efforts 
blocked by frivolous trade actions like the one recently announced.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I have another truth. It is that the U.S. wants to ban MMT as 
badly as Canada. The proposed challenge being brought by the 
corporation is a private challenge against Bill C-29. This is a clear 
signal that its position is not supported by the American 
government. The American government has not hestitated to 
launch complaints under NAFTA in the past but in this case the 
U.S. EPA has taken a leadership role, which is what the 
Government of Canada is doing in opposing the use of this fuel 
additive.
<P>
	Carol Browner who is the head of the EPA in the United States 
said earlier this year, and I would like to say this loudly, clearly and 
perhaps slowly so that it might sink into the member's opposite, 
that the EPA, believes that the American public should not be used 
as a laboratory to test the safety of MMT.
<P>
	I applaud the efforts of the government which makes a similar 
stand. Canadians will not be a testing ground for MMT. Would you 
like me to repeat that? Canadians will not be-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I ask the hon. member to please sit down. 
I appreciate the hon. member is not the only one who does this but 
the hon. member will please not have a you and I discussion across 
the floor. I ask that she please address all of her remarks to the 
Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. It is 
just that I have such an incredible passion about this particular 
issue and I have such a lack of understanding why the opposite side 
is not getting it.
<P>
	Health Canada confirmed in July 1996 that it fully supports the 
proposed ban on MMT. A ban on MMT is also supported by the 
public health departments of the cities of Toronto and North York. 
These and other communities are all too familiar with the health 
problems associated with poor air quality and are anxious to see 
MMT banned. Very little is known about the long term health 
effects of chronic low level exposure to manganese compounds that 
are formed when MMT is used as an additive in gasoline.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5394"> 5394 </A></B>
<P>
	As I said at the beginning of my speech, the suggestion that 
we are caving in to one lobby group is totally absurd. When we 
look at the equation, who is standing on the side of the public 
interest? On one side are the Bloc and the Reform that have caved 
in to the lobbying efforts of a single American multinational which 
I might add fought against the removal of lead in gasoline.
<P>
	On the other side, the side that is speaking for the public interest, 
for the health of Canadians, for the environmental protection of 
Canadians are organizations like the Allergy Asthma Information 
Association, the Canadian Automobile Association, which is the 
largest consumer group for Canadians automobile drivers, the 
Canadian Institute of Child Health, the Council of Canadians, the 
Environmental Defence Fund, the Learning Disabilities 
Association of Canada, the Ontario Public Health Association, 
Pollution Probe and the Sierra Club of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	I believe I have made my case very clearly and I look forward to 
a quick resolution of the amendment and the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as I listen to the comments on MMT it occurs to me that just about 
the time the Liberals are getting around to banning it, the United 
States lifted the ban about a year ago. I wonder why the Liberals are 
trying to play catch-up on this now.
<P>
	A consequence of eliminating MMT as an additive is a 20 per 
cent increase in nitrous oxide emissions, which is the smog we are 
trying to avoid in our cities. What the member said does not make a 
lot of sense. I wonder what her comment would be in the light of 
these two facts.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps the hon. member had 
the misfortune not to hear my speech. I will endeavour to speak a 
little more slowly.
<P>
	With respect to the member's first question, in my speech I 
clearly stated that the case which went before the U.S. Supreme 
Court was lost on technical grounds. The EPA is going ahead. I also 
said that Carol Browner, who is head of the Environmental 
Protection Agency in the United States, said that the American 
public should not be used as a laboratory to test the safety of MMT. 
I further said that California, along with 16 other U.S. states, has 
banned MMT. Most of the refineries in the United States are not 
using MMT. They refuse to use MMT.
<P>
	With respect to the final question of the hon. member opposite, 
the information that he has relayed to the House comes from a 
study undertaken by the corporation responsible for the production 
of MMT and, might I add, the only corporation in the entire world 
which produces MMT. This information came from the study. This 
was a study which the University of Waterloo, an internationally 
renowned institution, debunked.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder (Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want ask a question of the parliamentary 
secretary. The member from the third party spoke about nitrous 
oxide, manganese oxide, et cetera. There is another additive that 
we could put into gasoline. It is called alcohol. When alcohol is put 
together with gasoline it is called ethanol. We are not putting a 
refinery out of business. It could mix that too.
<P>
	In Ontario we will create a new domestic market for corn 
producers, consisting of 15 million bushels, with the ethanol plant 
which will come on line next year. Carbon monoxide and carbon 
dioxide emissions can be lowered. The problem of the onboard 
diagnostic sensors which the automotive dealers are worried about 
can be solved. More than that, there is a byproduct of this. It is 
called brewer's grain. Brewer's grain has had enzymes which have 
acted upon it. It is highly digestible. It can be fed to cattle, dairy 
cows and pigs. There is a byproduct from it called fertilizer. Some 
of the amendments the third party is talking about reflect the 
byproduct that comes from bulls. That can go into the ground. 
Crops can be raised from that. There is absolutely no pollution 
from it at all. It is totally green biomass. I would like the 
parliamentary secretary to comment on that.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> Mr. Speaker, as always, my hon. colleague 
has an interesting way of addressing some very complex problems.
<P>
	One of the things that has been raised in this House, especially 
by members opposite, is that this will only help the Ontario corn 
industry. I would suggest that not only ethanol can be used as a 
replacement for MMT. There are many other substances.
<P>
	The members from the Bloc forget that there is an ethanol 
producing organization in Quebec which manufacturers ethanol 
from wood products.
<P>
	There are many different opportunities. There are refinery 
operations in the province of Alberta, the province that many 
Reform members come from.
<P>
	When we are talking about banning MMT and replacing it, we 
are talking about a variety of substances being used in ways that all 
parts of this country can benefit instead of giving all of the money 
to an American firm.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is good for health.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> It is good for health.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Resuming debate, with apologies to the 
member for Mississauga South, unless there is unanimous consent 
to extend the time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have been 
scheduled to speak on this issue for some time now. I was kind 
enough to give my space in the order to a Bloc member who had to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5395"> 5395 </A></B>
<P>
catch a plane. I would  appreciate some time to speak on this issue 
before the time expires.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Accordingly, there is not unanimous 
consent to extend the time of the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I want 
some clarification from the Chair as to the extension of time. 
Private Members' Business is set for 5.30 p.m. and certainly we 
have no difficulty at all in extending it briefly but obviously we do 
want to get on with the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member. The time has 
been extended because of a ministerial statement to 5.42 p.m.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
important for me to speak on this issue again because of the way 
the Liberal members are using the facts of this issue so loosely. We 
have talked about a number of them. Over and over they have 
talked about the ethanol issue.
<P>
	I have been involved in this issue from the very beginning. I 
listened to the evidence before the committees. We were told time 
and time again by the refinery people that ethanol is not a substitute 
for MMT in gasoline. So that is a straw man they are putting up. It 
is an entirely irrelevant issue; it has no relevance here.
<P>
	We are talking about who is in the pockets of whom. The 
member Essex-Windsor talked about the importance of the 
Canadian automobile industry and that it produces 465,000 jobs 
and 7 per cent of Canada's GDP and all the rest of it. I do not see 
how that is relevant in this debate unless that member is lobbying 
on behalf of the automotive industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. With due 
respect, when a member names another member and indicates that 
they are in the pockets of somebody else, indicates that somehow 
they are getting some benefit, that is to impute motive and bring 
disrespect to a fellow colleague in the House.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	I resent that and I ask the member to withdraw the comment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If members had to sit up here they would 
appreciate that sometimes comments that are made are very 
disturbing. I wonder, in the interest of collegiality if the member 
would be prepared to reconsider and word that matter differently.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be glad to withdraw the 
accusation if those on that side withdraw exactly the same 
accusation that was made against this party.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I did not rule it to be unparliamentary. In 
light of what the member has said, I will rule that what has been 
said is not unparliamentary and I will allow the member to 
continue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Certainly I have no 
problem with the member for Essex-Windsor defending the 
interests of the automotive industry because they are, after all, her 
constituents. Coming from a constituency that has considerable oil 
and gas development, I would also speak on behalf of those people.
<P>
	However, one condition I would put, speaking on their behalf, is 
that they would produce credible evidence for me to back up their 
case. I sat in committee and listened to the evidence and only a 
moron would have believed the evidence to be credible. They told 
us that this substance in fact fouled the spark-plugs of cars. They 
did not even have the decency to produce the evidence on two 
spark-plugs that were the same make and model. The Liberals sat 
there and swallowed that rubbish like it was the truth.
<P>
	I listened, met and talked to both sides on this issue, the car 
manufacturers, the refiners and Ethyl Corporation, which is more 
than the Liberals were willing to do, I might add. After all this 
debate and in committee Ethyl Corporation told the members that it 
wanted to be reasonable and fair on this issue and that if the 
Liberals would just allow a non-partisan study where all the 
interest groups had a chance to partake in the protocol on this study 
and that the evidence was impartial and undeniable, it would 
voluntarily withdraw the product from the market. How can anyone 
be more reasonable than that? I suggest they cannot.
<P>
	I think the hypocrisy that floats around this issue is unbelievable. 
The member for York-Simcoe, who spoke yesterday, stood in the 
House during statements and said: ``Nations around the world 
agree that human interventions create conditions that cause global 
warming and climate change. We all share in the negative 
economic and social consequences''.
<P>
	That same day in the afternoon the member for Elgin-Norfolk 
said: ``I would like to congratulate the city of Chatham and the 
company, Commercial Alcohols, for the recent announcement of 
the construction of a new $153 million ethanol production 
facility''. We kind of get an idea of what is going on here. We 
cannot have it both ways.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That smell is getting pretty bad.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> You are darn right, and it is not the fermenting 
corn that smells either.
<P>
	The facts surrounding the ethanol business relating to MMT 
simply are not a rational argument because ethanol does not and 
will not replace MMT. I think anyone who looks at the argument 
would agree.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5396"> 5396 </A></B>
<P>
	I am running short of time so I am jumping around here a little 
bit. I would also like to quote from the Halifax Sunday <I>Daily News</I> 
when Premier Savage of Nova Scotia said that he could not 
support this bill because the supporting of this bill would 
necessitate the closing of the Imperial Oil refinery in his province.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is garbage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> That is right here.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	The fact is the automotive industry is trying to get rid of MMT to 
cover a deficiency in the technology it is required to bring forward. 
In spite of the fact that MMT has been banned for 20 years in the 
United States, the OBD-II technology has the same failure rate in 
the U.S. as it does in Canada where MMT is in the gasoline. The 
problem is that the automotive industry had to get exemptions from 
those standards in order to licence the OBD-II technology in its 
cars because they are not reliable. The technology is not developed 
to the degree it needs to be and it cannot meet the standards. It 
needed a bogeyman to blame that on so it chose MMT. And that is 
the plain and simple reason why this issue is before us now.
<P>
	The evidence is there. This issue has been studied more than any 
other gasoline additive issue in history. It went before the courts in 
the United States twice and Ethyl Corporation won the cases both 
times. There is no scientifically verifiable evidence to show that 
MMT does foul the OBD-II equipment. It simply is not there.
<P>
	We have heard time and time again the horror stories about 
manganese destroying human brain cells and all the rest of it. The 
Liberals' own health minister studied this product very thoroughly 
and in spite of all we have heard, Health Canada says there is no 
detrimental effect to the health of Canadians by the addition of 
MMT to gasoline in Canada.
<P>
	Again, these strawmen keep popping up everywhere to cover this 
weakness of the evidence involved. I got across everything I 
needed to.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It now being 5.42 p.m., the House will 
now proceed to the consideration of Private Members' Business as 
listed on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That in the opinion of this House, the Minister of Transport should proceed rapidly 
to establish a Canadian test site for Operation Respond, a computerized database of 
hazardous  materials that would improve safety for firefighters and help save lives and 
property.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, since 1991 firefighters and other 
emergency responders have been seeking the establishment of a 
Canadian demonstration site for Operation Respond, a 
computerized North American emergency response information 
system which enables firefighters to obtain accurate instant 
information at the scene of a hazardous materials incident. I would 
note as well that Operation Respond can also be applied to 
passenger rail traffic.
<P>
	Over the years firefighters and other emergency responders have 
received significant support from members on all sides of the 
House in their demand for speedy action on Operation Respond.
<P>
	I would like to take the opportunity today to acknowledge the 
support of members on all sides of the House from the Liberal 
caucus, les deputés du Bloc québécois, members of the Reform 
Party and members of the Conservative Party.
<P>
	Yesterday I spoke with half the members of the Conservative 
caucus, the member for Saint John, and she indicated her strong 
and ongoing support for this motion.
<P>
	I also want to thank all the members who have written or 
telephoned to indicate their support of the motion even though 
some are not able to be present in the House for this first day of 
debate.
<P>
	Members will also understand that I want to pay a special tribute 
and say a special word of thanks to my own colleagues who have 
been so vigorously supporting these changes over the years, my 
colleague for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake who seconded the 
motion today and all of my other colleagues who joined in 
seconding the motion now before the House. I would particularly 
note the member for Winnipeg-Transcona who has been a solid 
supporter of this. In fact, in June 1995 he brought a motion before 
the House also under Private Members' Business urging the 
government to move forward on this very important initiative.
<P>
	As long ago as 1992 colleagues such as Ian Angus from Thunder 
Bay and Joy Langan from Mission-Coquitlan spoke out in 
support of these changes. The people who have really been on the 
frontlines in this long campaign are the firefighters themselves, the 
International Association of Firefighters and firefighters across 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	From my community the Canadian vice-president Terry Ritchie; 
Mark Fletcher, the president of local 323; the Burnaby local of the 
IAFF and Robert Hall of Vancouver local 18, have been 
particularly helpful in this. I might add that they have noted some 
of the particular concerns in the lower mainland. As a port city, 
Vancouver has had more than its share of hazardous materials 
incidents and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5397"> 5397 </A></B>
<P>
the amount of traffic that passes through our ports and our streets 
continues to escalate very significantly.
<P>
	All transportation corridors to the lower mainland run through 
Burnaby whether it is roadways, railways, airways or marine ways. 
In fact all hazardous materials that are shipped into Vancouver via 
trucks are transported along highways which travel through 
Burnaby. The major rail carriers all travel through Burnaby. Four of 
the six petrochemical wharves in the GVRD, the Greater 
Vancouver Regional District, are also located in Burnaby.
<P>
	The Burnaby firefighters have noted that the current system, the 
CANUTEC system which has been in place since 1979, works well 
when firefighters know specifically with what they are dealing. The 
problem is not knowing what chemicals, what other hazardous 
materials are being dealt with. As noted by Mark Fletcher in his 
letter to me: ``Often valuable time is lost and great risks are taken 
in trying to make that determination. A computerized tracking 
system would alert us to the fact when rail cars or tanker trucks 
were carrying mixed loads because of course chemicals which are 
relatively harmless on their own can in fact become extremely 
dangerous if they are mixed in with other chemicals''.
<P>
	Operation Respond has the potential to save many lives in the 
city of Burnaby, the lives of the members of our fire department but 
also the lives of citizens in that community. The system would 
enable firefighters to stay in a safe zone away from a hazardous 
materials incident and not have to take proactive measures until 
they know what they are dealing with and until they can proceed in 
a safe manner.
<P>
	I want to acknowledge the leadership on this issue of the 
Canadian director of the International Association of Firefighters, 
Doug Coupar, who has done such an outstanding job of making 
members and others aware of the importance of this issue and the 
importance of moving quickly on this issue.
<P>
	I want to add a special word of thanks to my assistant Catherine 
Meaden who has done such a fine job as well in helping to prepare 
this important debate.
<P>
	The objective of this motion is straightforward.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is to establish a test site for Operation Respond, a 
computerized database of hazardous materials that would improve 
safety for firefighters and help save lives and property.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	By way of background I would note that the most dangerous 
aspect of firefighting is responding to incidents that involve 
hazardous materials or HAZMAT as they are known. Firefighters 
in Canada are especially hampered by the lack of information 
available in such incidents, especially within the critical first few 
minutes after arriving on the scene. What is absolutely essential is 
accurate, accessible information. This is crucial to saving lives and 
property at the scene of these accidents. The appropriate response 
for one hazardous material could prove quite catastrophic or very 
dangerous if another substance is present.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There is a whole gamut of advanced technological systems that 
would allow firefighters to know exactly the nature of hazardous 
materials to which they are exposed, and to get the advice they 
need to react. These systems may be designed for the processing of 
hazardous materials at a given site, and for those transported by 
train, aircraft, truck or boat.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The information provided by these systems not only aids in 
identifying what hazardous materials are present but it can also 
offer detailed information on the appropriate emergency response 
techniques. In some cases it can provide guidance on evacuating 
specific communities.
<P>
	Implementation of a hazardous materials identification system 
would ensure that firefighters have the information they need to 
effectively respond to any incident enabling them to protect lives 
and property. Surely firefighters have the right to know precisely 
what hazardous materials may be present. They have the right to 
know that immediately. They should not have to wait minutes or in 
some cases hours to get that vital information.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	In the case of passenger rail emergencies, Operation Respond 
will make it easier for firefighters to save lives by knowing entry 
points, electrical and mechanical systems and bypass advice.
<P>
	Members of the House will perhaps have noted an ad that was 
placed in this week's issue of the <I>Hill Times</I> newspaper. In this ad it 
is pointed out that courier packages are readily traceable across 
Canada, indeed around the world. That technology exists, but 
Canada's firefighters do not have access to the same modern and 
latest technology to identify potentially hazardous materials. It is 
essential that we make this change and it is essential that we make 
it now.
<P>
	There are many examples of the urgency of this system. 
Members will recall the Mississauga train derailment in 1979. The 
train was carrying chlorine gas and 24 cars of the train derailed. 
Two propane filled cars exploded into a huge fireball of chlorine 
gas. Many residents were forced to evacuate their homes.
<P>
	I know that the member for Mississauga West, who strongly 
supports this motion by the way, remembers vividly that particular 
incident. I know that the  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Transport, the member for Hamilton West, who has also indicated 
previously his support for this motion, recalls well the Mississauga 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5398"> 5398 </A></B>
<P>
incident. In fact as a young television reporter from Hamilton he 
was assigned to cover that tragedy.
<P>
	In circumstances such as that it is absolutely essential that 
firefighters have access at the earliest possible time with the latest 
technology to know precisely with what materials they are dealing.
<P>
	There are many other examples. In the small town of Linwood in 
Ontario was a burning vehicle, a urethane spray truck. Firefighters 
attended the scene. They were not able to identify a placard, which 
of course we are told should be available. One of the firefighters 
was able to obtain the driver's manifest and the load sheet and 
determined from that what dangerous chemicals were on board. 
They consulted with CANUTEC and were told to stop their 
suppression efforts. In fact those suppression efforts could have 
been dangerous to the firefighters in question.
<P>
	There was a rural Manitoba accident where firefighters had to 
wait 13 hours to determine the contents of a derailed train. Finally 
they used binoculars to obtain an identification number.
<P>
	Another incident was on the northern bank of the Eramosa River 
in Guelph outside the Huntsman chemical plant earlier this year. 
The Guelph fire department was called. It was a chaotic scene, a 
spill of some 56,000 litres of the liquid chemical phenyl which was 
being unloaded into a storage tank. It is very toxic and very 
flammable and burns on contact. The firefighters were hampered 
because they were not able to get the information they needed when 
they needed it. They waited two hours before they were finally able 
to obtain that information.
<P>
	It is not good enough to rely on the CANUTEC system which is 
currently in place. Operation Respond uses a unique number which 
is clearly identified, clearly displayed, not just in one place but on 
all load containers and in a variety of different locations.
<P>
	It is essential that we move ahead. It is essential that the 
transport minister make the Operation Respond Canadian test site a 
top priority for his department and that he commit the necessary 
staff and resources to do that.
<P>
	The House might ask why is it that Canada has not already 
moved to test Operation Respond? Transport Canada tells us that 
the current CANUTEC system needs no improvement. There are 
too many examples of CANUTEC not working effectively. Delay, 
manual use of a telephone, are simply not acceptable, especially 
when computer technology exists. They say there have been no 
direct casualties from incidents. So far we have been fortunate.
<P>
	What about a major catastrophe in downtown Toronto, for 
example? Would CANUTEC act quickly enough to prevent 
casualties? There is a very serious question about that.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	The CANUTEC system and those who defend it alone also fail to 
account for those who have been exposed to contamination, the 
inconvenience of unnecessary evacuation or the loss of property 
which might have been preventable.
<P>
	Transport Canada tries to say, as well, that it will cost too much. 
We hear astronomical estimates which are in the millions of 
dollars. That is absolute nonsense. We are not talking about 
scrapping CANUTEC and starting out with an entirely new system. 
We are talking about building on CANUTEC, strengthening and 
improving the CANUTEC system to ensure that it uses the latest in 
computer technology.
<P>
	I would note that, in fact, the majority of professional fire 
departments already have the necessary equipment to operate the 
system.
<P>
	Operation Respond is a non-profit entity. It is already in place in 
the United States in many locations and its people are quite 
prepared to co-operate to get this under way in Canada. In fact, 
today we received tentative cost estimates from Operation 
Respond. They say it would be in the order of $40,000 to $50,000. 
If we wanted to add passenger rail to that it might bump the cost up 
to $65,000 or $70,000. That is all we are talking about. Surely there 
is not a member in the House who would not agree that this is a 
small price to pay to enhance the safety and the security of 
Canadian firefighters and Canadian communities.
<P>
	The key point is very straightforward. Firefighters want direct, 
on screen access via laptop computer when they are in the critical 
first stages of identification. The CANUTEC system does not 
provide this. Right now firefighters have to go through a 
CANUTEC middleman by telephone, even though most 
professional fire departments already have computers and 
modems.
<P>
	Let us augment and improve the CANUTEC system. Let us work 
together with major carriers who have indicated they are prepared 
to co-operate. Let us make sure that Transport Canada is not just 
sitting on the sidelines observing. Let us make sure that it is the 
major player in this very important process.
<P>
	This motion has support, not just from firefighters and many 
communities across Canada, but from other emergency responders. 
The Canadian Police Association, for example, has written me a 
letter in which it says that the Canadian Police Association, 
representing approximately 40,000 frontline police officers, 
supports any additional tool, such as the motion proposes, which 
will facilitate the safe storage, handling and shipping of hazardous 
material within Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5399"> 5399 </A></B>
<P>
	The United Transportation Union, which represents more than 
8,000 rail and bus transportation industry employees, is in total 
support of Operation Respond in its efforts to provide first 
responders with on site, up to the minute, safe and reliable hazard 
information. UTU members are all too familiar with the dangers 
of incidents involving hazardous materials. As railway employees 
they have experienced hazardous material incidents. They say that 
the CANUTEC system leaves unquantifiable reasons for which 
Operation Respond should be implemented immediately.
<P>
	Imagine being put on hold for upwards of three hours while 
trying to access needed information. That is just not acceptable.
<P>
	I urge all members of the House to support this motion. I ask the 
Standing Committee on Transport to hold hearings. That 
committee is chaired by the hon. member for Winnipeg South. That 
member was not able to be here today for this debate. However, I 
spoke to him and he indicated his strong support for this motion. I 
am very pleased that he also indicated that he is prepared to 
encourage and to support hearings of the Standing Committee on 
Transport on this motion.
<P>
	Firefighters and other emergency responders from across 
Canada are going to be watching this debate very carefully and will 
be watching the outcome of the debate. I am concerned about any 
attempt by any member of the House, particularly on the 
government side, to water down or amend this motion to suggest 
that we should study it, examine it or observe it. The time is long 
overdue to implement a test site. We do not need any more 
observation. We do not need any more study.
<P>
	It is fitting that this week Canadians are observing Fire 
Prevention Week. Two days from now, Saturday, October 12, is 
Fire Service Recognition Day.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	When the Minister of Labour spoke earlier this week about this 
day, he noted that our full time and volunteer firefighters often put 
their own lives in danger in order to save other lives. He said: ``We 
want to use this day to express our appreciation and gratitude to all 
firefighters across Canada''.
<P>
	In closing, let me say that there could be no more fitting tribute 
to the dedication and commitment of firefighters and other 
emergency responders in Canada than passing this motion and 
establishing a Canadian test site for Operation Respond to improve 
the safety of firefighters and to help save lives and property.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the government members here and 
elsewhere, obviously we would echo the kinds of praises the 
member for Burnaby-Kingsway offers to those in emergency 
response teams.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate on the 
motion brought forward by the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway concerning the establishment of a test site for 
``Operation Respond''.
<P>
	The motion stipulates that the federal government should 
establish without delay a test site for the ``Operation Respond'' 
program. This emergency response system, which was first set up 
in the Houston area, in the United States, is now in use in selected 
localities in that country.
<P>
	``Operation Respond'' provides basic information to people and 
organizations in selected areas, who have access to the appropriate 
software. The promoter is ``Operation Respond Incorporated'', a 
non-profit organization, which is marketing an emergency response 
computer system, that includes procedures, software and content.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The primary goal of the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act 
is to promote public safety during the transportation of dangerous 
goods. This dangerous goods program has two dimensions. The 
first is to prevent an accidental release. The second is to ensure 
adequate responses should there be an accidental release or should 
one appear imminent.
<P>
	Accident prevention includes proper identification of dangerous 
goods, appropriate means of containment and proper markings on 
these containers. In addition, a shipping document describing the 
dangerous goods accompanies those shipments.
<P>
	Adequate response to any accidental release of dangerous goods 
requires knowing what is involved, its properties and what should 
be done. Canada already has in place a comprehensive, national 
emergency response service called CANUTEC.
<P>
	CANUTEC is equipped to handle these types of situations. 
Operation Respond is limited in its activities. Indeed I should point 
out that the response information provided by the Operation 
Respond program is essentially that which is contained in the 
``North American Emergency Responds'' guidebook which was 
co-authored by CANUTEC and the U.S. Department of Transport.
<P>
	My colleague opposite knows that this guidebook was developed 
to provide responders with immediate guidance at an accident and 
is only an introductory element in CANUTEC's program. As an 
aside, I would like to point out that Transport Canada has this 
summer provided sufficient copies of the recently released 1996 
version of this guide for distribution at no charge to all fire 
department vehicles and to all police highway vehicles in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5400"> 5400 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition, this year the department also distributed in the form 
of a video to all fire departments in Canada the results of research 
work on explosions associated with liquefied gases. The video 
makes reference to the tragic accident in Quebec where several 
firefighters lost their lives as a result of a boiling liquid expansion 
vapour explosion involving liquefied gas.
<P>
	I make reference to these items and to the support CANUTEC 
provides firefighters to highlight the fact that the department has a 
great respect for firefighters. It recognizes that providing effective 
support to firefighters is one of the more important emergency 
response activities that the department can undertake.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	I am certain the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway is 
familiar with CANUTEC. The centre operates 24 hours a day, 
seven days a week. Its primary goal is to provide information, 
guidance and advice.
<P>
	CANUTEC provides a bilingual chemical and regulatory 
information and communications service to emergency responders 
and industry at an accident. These responders may include 
volunteer firefighters, full time firefighters, police or industry 
response teams, such as teams from the major petroleum and 
chemical producers.
<P>
	CANUTEC is staffed by professional chemists, trained in 
accident situations, who are capable of providing information and 
advice to any level of detail required by responders.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It gets around 30,000 phone calls a year, 600 of which are for 
serious accidents. Pursuant to the Transportation of Dangerous 
Goods Act, any accidental release of a dangerous substance must 
be immediately reported to local police authorities. However, if the 
accident involves a train, Canutec must be the first organization to 
be informed.
<P>

<P>
	In Transport Canada's continuing effort to provide for a safe and 
efficient transportation system, two officials from Transport 
Canada are currently observing the Operation Respond program in 
the United States. Their role as observers is to attend Operation 
Respond meetings and to identify any new activities which would 
be considered effective tools for responders in Canada.
<P>
	Finally, let me assure all members that Transport Canada will 
continue to closely monitor the Operation Respond program and 
will consider any activities which are shown to be effective in 
assisting emergency responders.
<P>
	My colleague opposite has already given an indication that there 
is support for these kinds of initiatives and for the Department of 
Transport's initiatives by members of the transport committee. I 
leave it to my colleagues on that committee to speak for themselves 
and to address this issue when it appears again during private 
members' hour. I do not presume to speak on their behalf, but I 
know they share with me the considerations that I have just 
outlined not only for themselves but for the department as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to speak today to the motion by the 
member for Burnaby-Kingsway, which strikes me as an 
interesting one. We could even say that it is a good opportunity to 
point out where the work of parliamentarians can have an influence 
on departments when they are a bit slow to implement something.
<P>
	We have a member who has just told a minister, a department 
with several thousands of employees, that they perhaps should have 
done something a little sooner, the question having first come up in 
1991. Some things could have been done and the motion introduced 
is certainly interesting from many points of view.
<P>
	It should be noted that what we are talking about is 
implementing a test site to ensure that computerized data about 
hazardous materials can be made available very rapidly to fire 
fighters called to accidents.
<P>
	It is a rather complex situation, because it also involves the 
provinces. There is WHMIS in Quebec, which concerns the 
handling of all hazardous materials, and these various programs 
must be linked up so that the computerized system works and so 
that everything is done legally and in accordance with provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	It is understandable that the member for Burnaby-Kingsway 
has included the word ``rapidly'' in his motion, because Transport 
Canada has been slow to act. This is clear from the letters of 
support he has received from the International Association of Fire 
Fighters and the Canadian Police Association. It is something that 
people have been waiting for.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	These are the groups who have been dealing with the problems 
for a long time now, those with the expertise, because, in the case 
of hazardous materials, it is important that the information be 
available in the first five minutes after they have been informed of 
an incident.
<P>
	It is also important to have very precise information, on 
electrical and mechanical systems, for instance, anything that can 
help avoid a misstep that would create a problem worse than the 
original one.
<P>
	For some time, Transport Canada depended on the CANUTEC 
telephone system, but now it is obvious this is not enough. What is 
needed is a faster, more suitable, more accurate system which 
provides us with access to the computerized tools developed in 
recent years. There is no excuse for being behind the times, like 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5401"> 5401 </A></B>
<P>
dinosaurs,  particularly in areas where vital actions have to be taken 
quickly.
<P>
	I feel that this is all the more vital because there are volunteer 
fire fighters, as well as professionals. This summer, I attended the 
KRTB (Kamouraska, Rivière-du-Loup, Témiscouata, Basques) fire 
fighter competitions. About ten different fire brigades were 
involved. It was easy to see just how vital physical dexterity, 
courage, tenacity and endurance are to a fire fighter.
<P>
	I was thinking, as I examined the motion of the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway, that it was important for this type of service 
to be made available to people who perform these duties on a 
volunteer basis, and quickly.
<P>
	One might think that rural fire fighters will not run into major 
fires and major problems, but then the railway comes to mind. All 
that is needed is one train wreck, since the rail lines cut through the 
whole region, one incident with a hazardous waste spill. Without 
the necessary information , we would find ourselves in a very 
touchy situation in which volunteer fire fighters, children's fathers 
and mothers, could find their lives in jeopardy if the wrong steps 
were taken.
<P>
	A society can be judged by the protective services it offers. 
Those who are supposed to intervene in hazardous situations 
should have access to a quick and effective source of information 
so they can provide a satisfactory service.
<P>
	This is an interesting motion that will compel the government to 
take action as soon as it has been adopted. Awareness of the 
problem has already increased thanks to today's debate and to the 
vote that will follow so that this motion can be put into effect.
<P>
	To the Bloc Quebecois, it is also important to ensure that this test 
plan is implemented in accordance with provincial jurisdictions, 
taking into account the practical aspects of operations and of quick 
intervention, but to ensure that data bases are made available to 
those who manage the system so that the information is available 
and this sort of service is provided in the proper way, it will be 
necessary to guarantee free access to information and to ensure this 
is done in accordance with existing legislation.
<P>
	For instance, after testing the site in British Columbia, we cannot 
afford to wait six months, a year or two years until it can be used in 
Quebec, just because the provincial jurisdictions were not taken 
into account. This aspect must also be considered when 
establishing the test site, so that here in Canada we will be able to 
establish something similar to what is already being used in the 
United States. The system will provide the kind of service that will 
help us avoid major accidents involving humans, sometimes loss of 
life or financial loss. The service will help people who already 
serve the public and  are prepared to face hazards in the course of 
their daily lives.
<P>
	In this context, Parliament would do well to support a motion of 
this kind, especially since the Canadian government seems to be 
dragging its feet. It is not a bad idea to do some moving and 
shaking to ensure that this project gets off the ground.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	One wonders if we had a system where jurisdictions were clear 
cut and the responsibilities of all concerned were clearly identified, 
whether this type of action would not have taken place more 
quickly, because there would have been one authority responsible. 
There would be no passing the buck. I hope that some day we will 
have that kind of system, for the benefit of Quebecers and 
Canadians.
<P>
	But meanwhile, the motion presented by the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway is a very interesting one. I think it deserves 
support. In concluding my speech, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by adding after the word ``should'', the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``, in agreement with the provinces,''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So this experiment should be carried out to reflect the 
responsibilities of all levels of government so that, in the end, we 
will have a better way to protect both fire fighters and all those who 
may be involved in disasters as a result of accidents across this 
country.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion is admissible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this very 
important debate.
<P>
	I begin this evening by congratulating the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway for bringing this matter forward for 
discussion and hopefully for approval.
<P>
	Private Members' Business in this Parliament has been the 
source of many fruitful and interesting debates. As hard as it 
sometimes may be for us to believe it, occasionally bills and 
motions actually pass. Without Private Members' Business we 
probably would not be having this debate tonight.
<P>
	The motion put forward by my colleague seeks something 
relatively simple and inexpensive. By passing this motion we will 
be sending the Minister of Transport a message, to move quickly to 
establish a Canadian test site for Operation Respond. We are asking 
him to have the effectiveness of the software developed by 
Operation Respond tested to determine if it does identify hazardous 
materials, thus improving the safety for firefighters and others who 
may be involved in a chemical fire.
<P>
	Everyone in the Chamber and all Canadians are indebted to 
firefighters for the courageous work they do. I am sure we all 
remember trips to the local fire station to see the big red trucks and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5402"> 5402 </A></B>
<P>
the brave men, now women and men, who hourly put their lives in 
danger to protect our lives and our property. I never cease to be 
amazed by the ability of our firefighters to respond quickly and 
effectively to all forms of crisis.
<P>
	In this motion we are addressing a particularly dangerous 
situation where hazardous goods or chemicals are involved in a 
fire. We have moved to a time in history where with complex 
materials and chemicals a firefighter must have a level of 
sophisticated knowledge beyond anything previously required in 
our history.
<P>
	The firefighter has to know the particular combustibility of 
compounds, how various chemicals react together and, of course, 
the means that must be used to put the fire out.
<P>
	Approximately 25 years ago the system which is presently used, 
CANUTEC, was developed by the Department of Transport. It is an 
excellent system that has served us well in the past years. I 
understand that it works when placards are put on vehicles or rail 
cars transporting hazardous goods, explaining the content of the 
rail car or transport truck or other ferrying device. Once these 
placards are spotted by the firefighter they call the staff at 
CANUTEC with the information. Within eight to ten minutes a call 
comes back telling the firefighters at the scene what the contents 
are and how they might fight the blaze.
<P>
	As I said, it is a good system but perhaps not as quick as it could 
be. That is where this motion comes in. That is where Operation 
Respond comes in.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	Under this system, which is has been ably explained by the 
member for Burnaby-Kingsway, each truck, vessel, rail car or any 
other mode of carrying freight which is part of the Operation 
Respond program carries a unique number.
<P>
	Firefighters simply need to find the unique number which I 
gather is displayed in many places on the container and enter it into 
a lap top computer carried in a firebrick.
<P>
	Within a minute the contents of the container will be displayed 
on the lap top computer screen. The sources of the information for 
Operation Respond are data bases kept by the carriers. This system 
is not only quick but gets around the problem encountered with 
CANUTEC where sometimes the placard showing the relevant 
information regarding the container is destroyed in the crash or 
burned in the fire.
<P>
	The Operation Respond system can be used for passenger rail 
where it would show entry points and electrical systems et cetera 
on the passenger cars. The software for this program was 
developed in the United States and is the property of the United 
States  government. I am informed it is willing to share it with us 
for free. It has already made this offer to Mexico and Mexico has 
said yes and is testing and implementing Operation Respond.
<P>
	The hardware needed to use the software is a lap top computer. 
Most fire stations already have them, at least according to the 
International Association of Firefighters. A place is needed to test 
and surely this government can find some vacant land. How about 
some of the Canadian Armed Forces bases land that has already 
been closed. Why not try it? What do we have to lose?
<P>
	Why is Canada not testing Operation Respond already? There 
are some reasons. Transport Canada believes the current system, 
CANUTEC, needs no improvement. Countless examples prove that 
this is not the case. CANUTEC system does work but not as 
quickly or as a reliably as Operation Respond would.
<P>
	Officials point to the fact that in using the present system there 
have been no direct casualties from incidents involving hazardous 
materials. Is this not just luck? In the event of a major spill in 
downtown Toronto would the CANUTEC system work fast enough 
to prevent casualties? They also fail to account for those who have 
been exposed to contamination, the inconvenience of unnecessary 
evacuation or loss of property which might have been preventable.
<P>
	Apparently what stands in the way are the egos of Transport 
Canada, the egos that developed the original detection system and 
do not want to give it up. They do not want to give in to progress. 
Let us say in this case that Operation Respond is to be used along 
with CANUTEC to placate the egos of Transport Canada. Let us 
test it to see if it works and let us see how it works. The costs of 
proceeding are minimal. Through adoption of this motion let us 
send a clear signal to Transport Canada to draft the test criteria 
which can be used to determine if the test is a success.
<P>
	What is the position of international firefighters? International 
firefighters of course support this demonstration site for Operation 
Respond. They say that firefighters deserve the right to know 
exactly what hazardous materials may be present at any incident. 
They need access to reliable information within the first three to 
four minutes on arrival. That will save lives by ensuring that 
firefighters use the most effective response techniques at any 
incident involving hazardous materials.
<P>
	In passenger rail emergencies Operation Respond will make it 
easier for firefighters to save lives by knowing entry points, 
electrical, mechanical systems and bypass advice.
<P>
	The International Association of Firefighters urges the transport 
minister to make Operation Respond's Canadian test site a top 
priority in his department by committing staff and resources to this 
project immediately.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5403"> 5403 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us send a clear message to our brave firefighters that we 
in this Chamber stand behind them in what they are trying to do. 
I know the firefighters in my riding and across Canada need the 
Operation Respond system and I know they are watching tonight. 
Let us send a clear message to the Canadian people that we have 
their safety at the top of our agenda. Let us adopt this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I join the 
debate on the motion before us which asks the House to advise the 
Minister of Transport to proceed rapidly to establish a Canadian 
test site for Operation Respond, a computerized data base of 
hazardous materials that would improve the safety for firefighters 
and help save lives and property.
<P>
	That we are debating this motion during fire prevention week is a 
happy happenstance. I take this opportunity to salute the 
courageous staff and volunteers of 4,061 fire departments across 
Canada for their dedication and service that helps secure the safety 
of Canadians and their properties. They have done a most laudable 
job.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	Yearly there are approximately 27 million shipments of 
dangerous goods, for a total weight of 2 billion tonnes. Yet less 
than 0.002 per cent of these shipments are involved in an 
emergency where people, property and/or the environment is 
threatened while waiting for an effective response.
<P>
	Canadians can take pride in our existing legislation. The 
Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, together with Canada's 
dangerous goods program, is the basis for this strikingly small 
percentage of accidents involving the release of hazardous 
materials.
<P>
	We continue to want to do better. We would like to reduce this 
already small percentage of accidents to an irreducible minimum 
and so we must continue to search for a better tool, a better system 
where one exists.
<P>
	Earlier the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health 
spoke about the twin goals of Canada's dangerous goods program, 
to prevent an accidental release of hazardous materials during 
transport and to ensure an adequate response is at hand should there 
be such an accident.
<P>
	It is in continuing vigilance for the latter goal that Canada has 
had in place since 1979 a comprehensive national emergency 
response service called CANUTEC, short for Canada urgence en 
transport emergency centre.
<P>
	This emergency centre is nationwide in scope and it is operated 
by Transport Canada 24 hours a day every day of the year, giving 
valuable information and communication service to emergency 
responders, including our fire fighters, ambulance personnel and 
police forces. It is staffed by professionals, trained in accident 
situations who can provide immediate advice on chemical, physical 
and toxicological properties of dangerous goods, on health hazards 
and first aid, fire, explosion, spill or leak hazards, remedial actions 
for the protection of life, property and the environment, evacuation 
distances, and personal protection clothing.
<P>
	Federal regulations require that CANUTEC must be contacted in 
the event of an accident or incident involving radioactive materials 
or infectious substances.
<P>
	To ensure its high quality service keeps with the times, 
CANUTEC scientists research and investigate developments in 
emergency technologies and new information regarding dangerous 
goods. Joint international research projects are developed and 
undertaken.
<P>
	I am pleased to inform the House that in keeping with its 
commitment to high quality service, officials from Transport 
Canada have been observing the implementation of Operation 
Respond at the Buffalo test site in Texas, including the ones held as 
recently as last month.
<P>
	Let me share some of these observations. It requires a lot of 
co-ordination between various emergency services, police, fire and 
ambulance services. It could not substitute for the lack of 
familiarity of emergency responders with dangerous goods 
response procedures. One county was cited as an example. The 
communication equipment did not make it easy for one service 
from one county to talk to a different county with a different 
service.
<P>
	Most road carriers do not have computerized data banks showing 
in real time the content of their vehicles. Operation Respond had to 
negotiate with trucking firms so that they could gain access to 
companies' data banks through a modem necessitating the need for 
compatibility of the systems.
<P>
	Operation Respond works better on the rail side of 
transportation. Operation Respond was not able to provide 
information on the type of protective clothing required for a test 
situation. Operation Respond could not give the on-scene 
commander answer to the question of how he could determine 
whether to evacuate an industrial plant to which smoke from the 
accident was drifting toward. This latter observation, I might note, 
would have been addressed by Canada's CANUTEC service had 
the accident happened in Canada.
<P>
	But my purpose in sharing these observations is not to criticize. 
Far from it. No system is ever perfect. Operation Respond trials 
only made some of its weaknesses visible. They will have to be 
solved for any safety program to work, Operation Respond or any 
other program.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5404"> 5404 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	I would like to go one step further and respectfully submit that a 
careful comparative study of the capabilities of the two systems, 
Operation Respond versus CANUTEC, in Canadian or American 
sites or both, may well be the approach to take, were we to find the 
better system which I alluded to earlier in my debate. I support the 
continued search for a better system. This search should be done 
with speed.
<P>
	Our firefighters and our emergency responders deserve our 
respect, our help and our support. They are the Canadian public's 
first line of defence in the event of an accident. We in the House 
have a duty to provide them with all the information they need to 
protect the public and themselves. We shall provide them with the 
tools necessary to achieve this goal.
<P>
	We must have the foresight and the imagination to envisage new 
uses for new technologies in a way which will help our firefighters 
and all other emergency responders.
<P>
	Operation Respond certainly opens new horizons. Hence we 
must continue to monitor it and to test it. We should examine the 
feasibility of allowing the American company, Operation Respond 
Institute Incorporated, should it wish, to conduct a Canadian test 
site. Conceivably, this may be a joint international effort.
<P>
	While we must also display the reserve that keeps us from 
jumping on the bandwagon that in the end may lead us away from 
our real goals, we must not hesitate to accept a tool when after 
thorough research it is demonstrated to be better and which will 
make our country safer for all.
<P>
	Having had some background in the clinical trials of drugs, in 
clinical research, I know that one treatment 15 years ago was 
deemed to be the best in North America but 15 years later it was 
shown to be not so. We must listen carefully and examine all data 
carefully. We must not jump on the bandwagon, but at the same 
time we must not hesitate to move and move with speed if it can be 
demonstrated that possibilities for a better system exist out there.
<P>
	Our ultimate goal is a safer country for all citizens, including 
emergency responders at the scene of an accident, particularly 
when the accident involves hazardous materials.
<P>
	I would like to reiterate the concept that when we are presented 
with the opportunity of a new and better system, we must not 
detract from examining that system. Of course, when we examine a 
system, costs will be involved but we must equate the costs to the 
real benefits that will ensue. We have to measure that against the 
lives that will be saved, against the properties that will be lost and 
against the environment that will be threatened for eternity.
<P>
	I congratulate the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway for 
taking this particular initiative. We must examine it with great care, 
for a better system demands great care in handling it. We cannot 
conclude that it is best when at the same time we say that we must 
test it. The very essence of testing a particular system tells us that 
we have not yet made the final conclusion on the quality of the 
particular system. And so I submit that we must look at this with a 
very positive mind because what is at stake are the lives and 
property of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member for Burnaby-Kingsway on 
a point of order. The member will realize he is using the time of the 
hon. member for Lévis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief. I wonder if the 
hon. member might be willing to accept a very brief question at this 
point with the unanimous consent of the House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to extend the 
debate by two or three minutes to allow a question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> Mr. Speaker, we need to take care when we are 
examining the impact of any policy on human-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is getting too complicated. I am sorry 
to all colleagues. The hon. member for Lévis.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government's 
attitude is indicative of its unwillingness to be questioned, even 
though on this side we are in agreement.
<P>
	I have been here all afternoon and I notice some inconsistencies 
in the government's attitude. For instance, with regard to the single 
food inspection agency, it took the federal government 18 years 
more than the Quebec government to solve the problem of overlap 
among its departments with regard to the setting up of a process to 
replace manganese with ethanol. It is urgent since the impact in 
Ontario is very significant. This is a matter of great urgency.
<P>
	The proposal by the member for Burnaby-Kingsway is very 
interesting and would cost very little. I asked him because he had 
an assessment made of this. The cost for the implementation of this 
new measure would be $50,000 for the federal government and 
$60,000 more if we also applied it to the railway. For a mere 
$110,000 the federal government is requesting time, more time for 
a study. This is something they use in the United States, it has been 
scientifically proven and it will improve the situation.
<P>
	Once again the government is showing it cannot react at the drop 
of a hat. It is taking an inordinate amount of time just to study a 
small measure which would greatly improve peoples' safety. Just 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5405"> 5405 </A></B>
<P>
imagine, within five minutes of a call, fire fighters would know if 
there were hazardous substances in a place.
<P>
	Let me relate a incident that happened in a company in my 
riding. Because of the products that were found there, water could 
not be used to extinguish the fire because it would actually cause 
the fire to spread. It would have been important to have this type of 
information. The government side, as always, is procrastinating, 
asking for time to get involved.
<P>
	I know the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway agrees with 
the amendment moved by the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup. He would agree with it. What he 
is proposing is an amendment that says ``in agreement with the 
provinces''. Why does he propose that? It is simply because fire 
fighters are under the authority of municipalities in general and 
municipalities are under the authority of the provinces.
<P>
	All we are asking the federal government to do is introduce a 
system that would be used from coast to coast in order to improve 
the information for firefighters and facilitate their work.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	As you know, in large centres, the knowledge and the 
information available to fire departments can be rather advanced. 
However, fire departments in small municipalities of Quebec, and 
elsewhere, are often made up of volunteer fire fighters. These 
people need a system that is easy to access and to operate, and one 
that will provide them with the available information. These are not 
permanent employees. They need a tool of reference to help them 
do their job and do it better.
<P>
	It is unbelievable that the government would hesitate, study, 
ponder and wonder about a measure that would cost $110,000. The 
costs related to the proceedings of this House during the hour that 
was just spent on this issue are higher than that. But the 
government wants to continue to review and analyze the issue. This 
is unacceptable.
<P>
	I wanted to make these comments in support of the motion 
proposed by the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway, and the 
amendment of the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hour provided for the consideration 
of Private Members' Business is now expired and the order is 
dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the Order 
Paper.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NUCLEARTESTBANTREATY">NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on September 26 I rose in Parliament to note the historic 
signing that week of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty at 
the United Nations by 80 countries, including Canada. I should 
point out that as of today, 111 countries have signed the 
comprehensive test ban treaty. This treaty will reduce the 
development of new nuclear weapons because if nuclear weapons 
cannot be tested, new nuclear weapons cannot be developed.
<P>
	On September 26, I also noted that several key countries, 
sometimes known as nuclear threshold states, had refused to sign 
the treaty. These are countries that have a nuclear weapons program 
and are trying to develop a nuclear weapons capability. Prominent 
among these countries which did not sign are India and Pakistan. I 
should point out that Pakistan was willing to sign if India signed, 
but India refused to sign.
<P>
	I would like to point out as well that to bring this treaty into 
force, it is required that 44 nations which have a nuclear capability 
must ratify the treaty and deposit the ratifications at the UN.
<P>
	The signing of this historic treaty, especially by the five nuclear 
powers, is indeed a great accomplishment for the security of our 
planet and a great accomplishment for the security of mankind. I 
might say as well it is a great accomplishment for those of us who 
have been working for many years to ban all nuclear weapons.
<P>
	This treaty properly complements the nuclear non-proliferation 
treaty which was extended indefinitely several months ago.
<P>
	However the signing of this treaty is not enough. The job is 
incomplete. Not only is it essential to get the 44 ratifications to 
bring the treaty into force, but it is also essential to bring on side 
those nations such as India that have not yet signed. There will be 
no advance in global security if the old nuclear powers stop testing 
and reduce their weapons, while other nations continue to test and 
become new nuclear powers.
<P>
	India's argument that the present nuclear powers should first 
commit to a timetable to reduce and eliminate all their nuclear 
weapons is a good argument, but it does not justify its 
non-signature nor any future testing or any attempt to develop new 
nuclear capabilities.
<P>
	Such countries as Germany, Japan and Brazil, which are also 
large powerful countries and do not have nuclear weapons, are not 
blocking the treaty and insisting that these other countries do what 
India is insisting.
<P>
	Once again I ask the government, what can Canada do to bring 
India and other non-signatories on side and to assure the 
implementation of this important treaty?
<P>

	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very glad to respond to the hon. 
member's question.
<P>
	Thanks to Canada, a conference is scheduled to be held some 
time late in 1999 to discuss the status of the CTBT. This conference 
is called for in the treaty and is a Canadian initiative. At that 
conference, signatory countries will review the situation of the 
treaty and, if it is not yet in force, will seek ways by which they 
might ensure its early implementation.
<P>
	Clearly it would be premature to specify what actions might be 
taken, as what would happen depends on the exact status of the 
treaty at that time. Also the policies and positions held by countries 
may change by that time.
<P>
	It is our hope that those countries which have said they will not 
sign the CTBT will reflect on their position and eventually sign this 
treaty and other non-proliferation treaties which they may not have 
signed yet. Canada will use every diplomatic opportunity to press 
for universal adherence to the treaty.
<P>
	Along with Canada, more than 90 countries had signed the treaty 
by the end of last week, including the five nuclear weapon states: 
the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, France and China. 
The number of signatory countries increases daily and they already 
include one of the so-called threshold states, Israel.
<P>
	The treaty requires that 44 countries listed in the text sign and 
ratify the treaty in order that the CTBT enter into force. In the 
meantime, under customary international law, countries which 
have signed a treaty are obliged to do nothing that would go against 
the purpose of the treaty.
<P>
	What about the countries which do not wish to sign the treaty? 
Canada respects the decision of sovereign nations to take whatever 
action they see fit, including not signing a treaty which has the 
overwhelming support of the international community. Canada 
believes that this treaty, with the strong support that it enjoys, will 
establish a legally binding international norm against testing and 
will be a powerful political and moral lever even on 
non-signatories.
<P>

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted. The House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.48 p.m.)
