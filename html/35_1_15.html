<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFNATIONALREVENUEACT">DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL REVENUE ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue)</B> 
moved that Bill C-2, an act to amend the Department of 
National Revenue Act and amend certain other acts in 
consequence thereof, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased today to speak to Bill 
C-2. Revenue Canada plays a fundamental role in supporting 
Canada's social and economic well-being. The Department 
performs this role by enforcing Canadian law and sovereignty at 
our borders, administering international trade agreements, 
collecting revenue and redistributing funds to low and modest 
income Canadians.
<P>
	Due to the wide diversity of these activities, Revenue Canada 
touches the lives of Canadians every day-whether they be 
taxpayers, travellers, small businesses owners and employers or 
members of large corporations.
<P>
	For example, among the department's client groups are 
150,000 large importers and exporters, 131 million travellers, 
and 22 million individual tax filers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This interaction and scope has Revenue Canada in a unique 
position to understand what Canadians want; to know as well 
that Canadians want Revenue Canada to find new and better 
ways of doing business. I am sure everyone in this House wants 
less red tape and bureaucracy and businesses in particular want a 
lower overall compliance burden so that the Canadian business 
sector can be more successful in the marketplace.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	As a government, we have made a commitment to all 
Canadians that we will provide them with an administration that 
is efficient, innovative, co-operative and fair. Canadians agree 
with us that overlap, duplication, a lack of co-ordinated policies 
in this country have placed a growing financial burden on the 
shoulders  of the taxpayers. To this end, reduced administrative 
costs, less red tape and improved service delivery are vital 
objectives of Revenue Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Because the current Department of National Revenue Act 
provides for one minister but two separate departments and two 
separate infrastructures, this represents an impediment to the 
optimal delivery of programs and services for Canadians. For 
this reason, I am today speaking in support of Bill C-2, an act to 
amend the Department of National Revenue Act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The proposed amendments are administrative in nature and 
are designed to consolidate, in law, the previously separate 
components of customs and excise on the one hand and taxation 
on the other. Consequently they will permit Revenue Canada to 
operate and efficiently function from one single infrastructure.
<P>
	The amendments are consistent with the government's 
objective to provide efficient administration through the 
streamlining of process and the elimination of duplication.
<P>
	I wish to point out that the mandate of the Minister of National 
Revenue will remain the same and that the integrity of 
departmental programs will not be compromised with this 
administrative consolidation.
<P>
	On the contrary, administrative consolidation will permit 
Revenue Canada to use resources more effectively and to build 
on the strength of its components. Thus it will enhance the 
department's ability to carry out its responsibilities for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	It will also allow the department to better co-ordinate revenue 
administration activities with the provinces. This is a very 
important objective of this government. Administrative 
efficiency and the elimination of duplication are points 
contained in our party's election platform. This commitment 
was confirmed in last December's meeting of finance and first 
ministers and was repeated in the recent speech from the throne.
<P>
	As an example, shared information and co-ordinated 
investigation efforts will strengthen enforcement programs 
directed at smuggling, illegal trade, revenue generation and the 
underground economy. It will mean better protection in regions 
such 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="926"> 926 </A></B>
<P>
as British Columbia against drug smuggling and better 
protection, we hope, in the regions of Ontario and Quebec from 
cigarette smuggling.
<P>
	Revenue Canada will be more accessible to its many clients 
and will provide a broader range of information, services and a 
one stop shopping process through the network of customs, 
excise and taxation offices.
<P>
	In Alberta, for example, this will result in our clients being 
able to do business at all 12 locations of Revenue Canada rather 
than at separate taxation, separate customs and separate GST 
offices.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Overhead costs can be reduced by combining common 
support services sharing administrative resources and systems 
and eliminating duplication, where it makes sense to do so.
<P>
	The goal is to do business more effectively. Revenue Canada 
wants to capitalize on the benefits and opportunities to be gained 
through administrative consolidation.
<P>
	Through administrative consolidation, we are able to invest in 
the primary automated lookout system in, for example, the 
Windsor area in Ontario, and are therefore better able to protect 
our borders.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	The passage of these amendments will enable Revenue 
Canada to improve its ability to enhance revenue 
administration, protect Canadian society, including in Quebec, 
from illegal entry of people and products, deliver 
socio-economic programs, and administer international trade 
agreements.
<P>
	In short, administrative consolidation will benefit both the 
government and the millions of clients who deal with Revenue 
Canada. Departmental savings in time, money and paperwork 
will be redeployed to enhance program delivery and to provide 
better service to clients.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a government we are committed to restoring Canadians' 
faith in our ability to provide responsive, effective and efficient 
public administration. I am sure all members of the House agree 
that no one can afford inefficient government.
<P>
	Canadians voted for change. We have an obligation and an 
opportunity to support that change today. As a government, we 
have promised accountable, responsible and efficient 
government where Canadians will get value for their tax dollars. 
These legislative amendments enabling the administration and 
consolidation of Revenue Canada will help us deliver on that 
promise and begin the process of regaining the confidence of 
Canadians in their institutions of government.
<P>
	In conclusion, I am confident that Revenue Canada is capable 
of meeting the goals that have been set for it to become the most 
progressive, innovative and effective revenue administration in 
the world. In order to start the process to accomplish this, I seek 
the support of the House and all members in the speedy passage 
of Bill C-2.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
finally at the stage where we start examining bills. After one 
hundred days in office-I read this week that it was a hundred 
days since the election-this is the first bill before Parliament, 
Bill C-2, an act to amend the Department of National Revenue 
Act and to amend certain other acts in consequence thereof. The 
purpose of this bill is simply to change certain terms in order to 
reflect a situation that has already existed for over a year.
<P>
	As far as the principle is concerned, and the minister referred 
to it in his speech, we certainly agree with the objective of 
streamlining operations, and not just because it is in their red 
book but because everyone wants us to do this. Everyone 
expects this to happen, and it is a social principle our voters 
want to see implemented.
<P>
	However, we will have to conduct a more specific and 
thorough analysis, and we will have an opportunity to do so in 
committee. There seems to be no problem about the principle. 
However, there are fears which may be justified in some 
respects, and I would like to point these out to the minister. I 
know that some have already been communicated to the 
minister, and I would like to refresh his memory.
<P>
	Before proceeding with this general analysis, there is one 
point I would like to make. As I said at the beginning of my 
speech, this government has been in office for over 100 days. 
People often expect a new Parliament to start off with tough 
measures, to make the kind of improvements we need in a 
society that in some respects, and I am thinking of the economy 
in particular, is headed for disaster unless something is done.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	I think it is symbolic that, as our first bill, we should have 
something which in many respects seems rather minor and 
somewhat disappointing. Of course we will have to wait for the 
budget. After the election they told us to wait for the opening of 
the session, and at the opening of the session they told us to wait 
for the budget, and now I am afraid that when the budget is 
brought down, they will tell us to wait for the next budget 
because they ran out of time. We expected some tax measures 
that would be an incentive for people to become honest citizens 
and show a little more understanding for the system, and that 
would give them a little more confidence in a fairer system.
<P>
	In fact, there are few references in the red book to the tax 
system. Last night I was reading this book again to try to find 
something interesting. I was disappointed. I scanned the book 
carefully for a reference to tax revenues, and I could not find a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="927"> 927 </A></B>
<P>
single one. I saw the nice  tables we see in all government 
publications, but not much in the way of analysis and 
recommendations.
<P>
	So I wondered, since there is not much in the red book about 
tax equity, if we would get anywhere at all in this respect during 
this Parliament, since the government keeps referring to the 
principles in the red book. Maybe they should consider 
publishing a new and revised version. This is just a suggestion. I 
remember at school we had first and second editions, so I 
suggest they do a second edition of the red book that would 
mention tax equity.
<P>
	The Minister of National Revenue was expected to bring in 
some tough measures. I remember raising the question with the 
Minister of Finance, who said that the Minister of National 
Revenue would, at the appropriate time, make an announcement 
on cigarette smuggling, through the excise Tax Act and the 
customs Act. He is very involved in this particular area as well, 
but we are still waiting. Meanwhile, what is happening in 
Quebec, Ontario and the maritimes? And some day British 
Columbia as well. There is already a little of this going on, but 
not to the same extent.
<P>
	Meanwhile, we are not getting much in the way of 
announcements. When I go back to my riding on the weekend, I 
will tell my constituents that we worked on Bill C-2, which 
provides for abolishing a deputy minister's position which, for 
all practical purposes, has already been abolished. I think people 
will be pleased to see some jobs being cut here, but they will also 
be very disappointed.
<P>
	On the revenue side, there is a lot of dissatisfaction among the 
public which feels there is no fairness in our tax system. A lot of 
this disenchantment with politicians and with all members in 
this Parliament, arises from a sense of injustice.
<P>
	I expected the government to work a little harder on this. 
There is still time. Parliament will continue to sit, and I hope 
that eventually, the government will have some proposals for us.
<P>
	Consider the principle of this bill. Let us not get involved in 
detailed analyses but look at the principle. The principle is, that 
now there will be only one deputy minister for Taxation and 
customs and excise, where previously there were two. This 
principle was put into a piece of legislation. This seems proper 
and reasonable, and I agree with the minister that streamlining is 
necessary and that informatics and data processing systems can 
be consolidated. However, perhaps there are a few questions we 
should ask. There is some apprehension in this respect, and there 
have been a number of changes back and forth. In recent years, 
there were repeated proposals to switch Customs to another 
department. It seems as though that the government cannot 
decide where it should belong.
<P>
	The main role of customs posts is to control our borders. 
These people have a security role. They must watch everything 
that crosses our borders, whether persons or merchandise. I 
heard the minister refer earlier to drugs. There is a lot of talk 
about cigarette smuggling lately, but people tend to overlook the 
smuggling of illegal drugs which is big business and generates 
tremendous problems because of the enormous amounts 
crossing our borders.
<P>
	That is the approach at customs. For historical reasons and 
reasons based on economic principles, over the years countries 
have imposed various customs tariffs to protect their 
economies, because they thought that was the answer and was 
also a way to make businesses more prosperous.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Now, the trend is toward free trade and lower customs tariffs. 
The customs sector is being asked to fulfil a dual role, namely 
providing security and collecting tariffs.
<P>
	This role is likely to diminish considerably in the coming 
years, as free trade takes on greater importance. Soon, we will 
be considering phasing in amendments to customs tariffs in 
conjunction with NAFTA and the GATT negotiations. We have 
many reasons to believe that in the long term, the role of 
customs will become marginal.
<P>
	Customs employees are concerned about being attached to a 
sector where the prime focus is revenue, whereas their primary 
role is security and control. As long as we have customs 
tariffs-and I realize that the Department of Revenue must be 
responsible for this area-I believe that the minister has to 
address these concerns during the upcoming transition. I know 
that he met and had some productive discussions with 
representatives of the customs and excise union. They voiced 
some concerns which cannot be ignored. They also have some 
practical concerns about their personal future and I will get back 
to this in my detailed analysis later on.
<P>
	We must look at the role of the customs sector in the public 
service somewhat philosophically. This may not be the best 
solution, but of course we will learn to live with it. However, 
some caution must be exercised prior to the consolidation so as 
not to confuse the role of the two sectors and neglect security by 
decreasing border controls.
<P>
	Recently initiatives aimed at increasing border controls were 
announced in Windsor. While this is very commendable, these 
initiatives will have to do more than simply appease those who 
fear for their jobs. They will have to be taken with a eye to 
controlling what goes on at our borders. Tighter controls and 
improved procedures are needed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="928"> 928 </A></B>
<P>
	These are the fears people have, and they appear to be 
justified.
<P>
	CEUDA, the union representing sector workers, reports that 
internal Revenue Canada studies on consolidation 
recommended as one option that customs remain a separate and 
distinct sector. However, since no one in this House and very 
few other people have seen these studies, it is impossible to 
know whether this option is viable. Perhaps the minister is 
aware of these studies.
<P>
	If internal studies were in fact conducted, what conclusions 
were drawn? Were these genuine conclusions? If not, the 
minister should make these studies public. Given the difference 
between the customs function and the tax function, this study 
should have concluded that it would be best to keep the two 
separate.
<P>
	Therefore, many concerns have been voiced and the people 
involved have received a lot of support. They have received 
support from the municipalities and the communities 
concerned, from people who are afraid that the revenue side will 
take precedence over security matters. Special attention will 
have to be paid to this aspect of the issue and considerable 
vigilance will be required in the years to come to ensure that 
security remains an important consideration.
<P>
	Let us now look at the bill. There is nothing extraordinary 
about it as such and it can easily be read in five minutes. It is 
only two or three pages long, but several sections warrant closer 
attention. This bill will, of course, be referred to the finance 
committee and we will certainly have a number of questions to 
ask then. However, I would just like to draw the minister's 
attention at this time to a few simple matters. For instance, it is 
mentioned in the bill that the deputy minister holds office during 
pleasure. One can ask why this should be the case? Was this not 
the case in the past? This is only a minor detail, but every word is 
important, apparently, in a legal text.
<P>
	Further on, there is a provision which concerns me a little and 
I hope that eventually the minister will clarify his intentions. 
Under References, the bill calls for section 6 of the Act to be 
repealed. The section in question which is to be repealed reads 
as follows and I quote: ``The Minister shall cause to be laid 
before each House of Parliament, not later than the fifth sitting 
day of the House after January 31 next following the end of each 
fiscal year, a report showing the operations of the Department 
for that fiscal year''.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	This section would disappear. Would the report to Parliament 
disappear? If so, why? I recall hearing our friend from the 
Department of Finance during the election campaign and many 
times since the beginning of the session say that openness was 
important, that people must understand what is being done with 
their taxes and that we need simple indicators. These principles 
are often mentioned here. Perhaps I am mistaken. Perhaps the  
report will be made at some other time in some other way, but I 
would like it to be required by law.
<P>
	I am not at all pleased with that clause, but maybe he has a 
good reason; the minister can explain it to us in due course or in 
committee when we consider the bill clause by clause, but it 
worries me. It is far from the principles of the red book, if I 
understood it correctly, anyway.
<P>
	But the key clause, which is at the heart of this bill and which 
is hard to understand-the minister referred to it just now in his 
speech, says this: ``Nothing in this Act shall be construed to 
affect the status of an employee who, immediately before the 
coming into force of this Act, occupied a position under the 
authority of the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for 
Taxation or the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for 
customs and excise except that each of those persons shall, on 
the coming into force of this Act, occupy their position under the 
authority of the Deputy Minister of National Revenue''.
<P>
	Basically, what they seem to be saying is that this bill in no 
way changes the status of public servants.
<P>
	At the same time, the minister says in a letter that ``we can 
already see specific advantages'', since this practice is already 
in effect and operational; there is now only one deputy minister 
who does double duty; with this bill, there will be only one 
deputy minister doing the job. So the minister says, ``We can 
already see specific advantages, in particular since the 
administrative consolidation-''. People often like to talk about 
consolidation when the time comes to downsize; they use softer, 
less offensive words. ``In particular, since the administrative 
consolidation has already saved $30 million''.
<P>
	There is something that I do not understand. We are told that 
the status of the public servants did not change and then we are 
told that $30 million was saved. I cannot believe that a single 
deputy minister cost $30 million. At least, I hope so, and I doubt 
that is the case.
<P>
	I understand his principles when he says that they will share 
computer systems and administrative services. That is true, but 
it changes the status of public servants. How come the bill said 
in the transitional provisions that it changed nothing? You must 
understand that it is a transitional provision in the bill. How long 
does the transitional period last? We will see when we analyze 
the bill clause by clause. We will ask the minister or his 
representatives to explain what it means.
<P>
	The rest is clauses replacing references to two ministers in 
other laws with a single minister now. There is no longer a 
taxation division and a customs and excise division.
<P>
	It is very well done. The lawyers are competent; they do good 
research and can find all the references in all the laws. They did 
a thorough job of research.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="929"> 929 </A></B>
<P>
	We cannot oppose the principle of streamlining-it is good 
and desirable, but we can always wonder if it is really the right 
place. The people at customs have concerns and feel that the 
department is moving ahead quickly with this reform. On the 
other hand, perhaps the public will defend the minister and say 
that he is not going fast enough. But I would like us to be a little 
more open about something, namely this. Was there really this 
internal study and what did it conclude? Are they being joined 
with the right department in the right way?
<P>
	You know, it is tempting for a department to reach out in as 
many directions as possible and to control many things. I must 
say that this minister has quite a budget. The Department of 
Revenue has an operating budget of $2.5 billion. That is a lot. He 
has been given this responsibility; surely he can explain it. I do 
not doubt his abilities, but we must be careful not to expand a 
department which is already very big or to give it a role that may 
be broader. I share those concerns with the customs officials. We 
still support the principle but we will have questions to ask 
before the finance committee, of which I am a member, and I 
will be there when this bill will be studied.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	I would like to go back to a point I mentioned earlier, namely 
the first bill tabled in the 35th Parliament. Bill C-2, other than 
being the first bill tabled, will not make history by a long shot. 
But if we look at past Parliaments, I do not imagine that we 
would find many first bills similar to this one; they would have 
been mere administrative measures, as a rule.
<P>
	There is more to this bill. What will happen in the medium 
term? What kind of structure will there be? How far do we want 
to go with integration? That is another concern that people have. 
Will we have regional offices poorly adapted to the reality of 
customs and taxation? The minister seems to be denying it, and I 
hope so. We have to watch out for this. Again, we must be 
careful not to cause inefficiencies as we have done in the past. 
Regional offices have not always been closer to reality, and I am 
in a good position to confirm it, Mr. Speaker. It may not be of 
great concern to us here in this House, but in my riding, the 
office of the Quebec agriculture ministry is located in an urban 
center and not in either of the two agricultural areas. This is very 
frustrating for farmers and I sympathize with them.
<P>
	We must do the same thing so that customs officers do not 
have problems with regional offices-they are not very close to 
the border-as long as they have very direct and close relations.
<P>
	The Auditor General and others talked about closer relations 
between customs personnel, the Solicitor General and other 
authorities, in order to improve control mechanisms. I am 
confident that the minister is taking this into account and that, 
during this Parliament, he will try to work more closely with 
others to improve operations.
<P>
	We on this side of the House often talk about administrative 
overlap but we know that interdepartmental co-operation is 
often very difficult, not necessarily because of individuals but 
because it is not a simple thing. This is something we must look 
into.
<P>
	The Auditor General often says in his reports that we must 
improve interdepartmental efficiency and I hope that the 
minister will work on this during this mandate because his 
department has an important role to play in this respect. It is his 
department that collects money from the taxpayers. It does not 
do much for one's popularity to collect money from taxpayers' 
pockets, not these days, Mr. Speaker. Especially as I feel they 
are not getting good value for their money.
<P>
	That is what they tell us every day. I will be travelling back to 
my riding in a little while and I am sure that I will hear the same 
thing again this weekend as usual. I will be embarrassed to say 
that we, in this House, are now working on a bill that will cut a 
deputy minister's position to save $30 million. The bill says 
there will be no public service cuts but the minister's comments 
clearly suggest that there will be cuts, retirements or early 
retirements. Something has got to give. This $30 million must 
come from somewhere. We cannot pull numbers out of thin air 
like this. We must explain how this $30 million has been saved.
<P>
	It is funny; every time we must make cuts or whatever, we 
deny being opposed to cuts but we cut $30 million and say we 
have become more efficient. Too bad it is taking us so long to 
realize such things.	
<P>
	I am not convinced that this government will be better than its 
predecessors in this regard. We often react poorly, but if one 
looks behind the measures taken, one always finds the same old 
speeches. Governments come and go but the arguments stay the 
same. We have cut back, therefore we have become more 
efficient, and we acted in the best interests of individuals. Well, 
I hope so.
<P>
	One day the minister is going to tell us how he saved this $30 
million and state more clearly where we are going in the future 
with a closer integration of customs and taxation duties. I know 
he is still concerned with improving service to clients. He said 
so this week and I congratulate him. Individual tax returns may 
come a week earlier this year and there will be simplified forms 
for seniors, which is a good thing. We are glad, people will like 
it.
<P>
	People are more worried about the amount they pay and the 
unfairness they see in the system than when they receive their 
tax refunds, if they get one. There is still a long way to go. I hope 
that the House will soon have an opportunity to consider such 
measures.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="930"> 930 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	I would prefer that the Finance committee first examine the 
issue, since the minister directed us to work on the GST reform 
or, if you prefer, on changing that tax. In any case, some changes 
will have to be made, at least regarding the system as a value 
added tax program. However, I would like us also to examine tax 
expenditures, including the impact of tax incentives on job 
creation, as well as the objectives of such measures and their 
cost.
<P>
	This week, the government announced a reform of social 
programs. However, in this particular case, we are not being told 
about a tax reform, or even the possibility of such an initiative, 
which Canadians would be much more happier about. Indeed, 
taxpayers would like to know that we are at least looking at 
improving the taxation system. But the government is silent on 
this issue; it does not even work on it because this is not yet part 
of its agenda. I guess we will have to add an annex to the red 
book. As I said earlier, new initiatives will have to be included; 
some improvements will have to be made. Surely, there are 
people who have worked on the draft of this legislation; the 
message was heard, the staff was increased and the government 
will undoubtedly be able to come up with a much improved 
version.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> A new and improved version.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> A new and improved version, as the hon. member 
says. I will conclude by saying that we will approve the principle 
that each clause of this bill will be examined in detail by the 
finance committee, that we have concerns regarding what 
customs officers themselves have said, as well as some groups 
supporting them. The minister met with customs officers, and he 
may have reassured them. We must not overlook the role of 
customs in this integration. There are important issues, and we 
need not elaborate on the smuggling problem. Effectiveness can 
be improved, but interdepartmental co-operation will also have 
to improve. More importantly, the government will have to 
introduce other measures if it wants the public to be pleased with 
its performance after the first 100 days. Indeed, Canadians are 
still waiting for concrete solutions to problems which directly 
affect them, particularly the unfairness and the injustice of the 
tax system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today on the issue of Bill C-2, an act to amend the 
Department of National Revenue Act and to amend certain other 
acts in consequence thereof.
<P>
	In the interests of reducing duplication and overlap of 
debaters, today I will speak on behalf of the Reform Party which 
in principle supports Bill C-2 in the spirit that has been put 
forward by the Department of National Revenue and the 
minister himself.
<P>
	According to this department the approval of Bill C-2 will 
enable it to be more responsive to changing needs, to streamline 
operations, to reduce the administrative burden on taxpayers, to 
reduce costs and duplication, and to improve the quality of its 
services and programs.
<P>
	My party supports the initial steps taken by the Liberal 
government in an attempt to streamline departmental activities. 
Combining immigration and citizenship, customs, excise and 
taxation, and eliminating altogether the department of public 
security will help reduce duplication and overlap. However the 
Reform Party stresses the need for increased financial reviews 
and reforms for all government departments to ensure that 
taxpayers' money is being spent efficiently and effectively.
<P>
	The Minister of National Revenue has stressed that his 
department is responding to the needs of Canadians and 
encouraging confidence and faith in revenue administration. We 
hope that Bill C-2 will not represent the only step his 
department is taking to reduce costs.
<P>
	The reduction of costs associated with departmental 
consolidation and the removal of a few individuals at the 
executive level are just the tip of the iceberg when one considers 
the amount of government waste that has existed over the years.
<P>
	Superficial or cosmetic attempts to correct the injustices in 
fiscal and political accountability will no longer be tolerated by 
taxpayers.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	Our party would encourage the minister and his government 
to initiate line by line, item by item reviews of the departments 
to find out where the money is going. Perhaps asking questions 
like: Do certain departments have too many employees or not 
enough? Are they best serving the interests of the public with the 
resources allocated to them or not? Should they be living in the 
town or city that they are working in, or should they be 60 miles 
away with the government and taxpayers paying for mileage?
<P>
	These results should be made public in their entirety in the 
form of an annual report which could then be distributed to all 
parties for a review. The Minister of Finance spoke yesterday 
about the vast amount of experience of the individuals 
assembled in this House. The government should take advantage 
of this to help find new ideas to better manage its money.
<P>
	My party wants the federal government and its departments to 
demonstrate fiscal responsibility and exercise restraint. Our 
philosophy is that the size of government can and must be 
reduced without affecting the level of service taxpayers expect.
<P>
	I congratulate the Minister of National Revenue in 
amalgamating or intending to amalgamate two huge 
infrastructures into one with the objective of streamlining 
operations with the purpose of better delivery of service, as he 
has said, less red tape, as he has said, and the co-ordination of 
collecting revenues 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="931"> 931 </A></B>
<P>
with the provinces. This certainly appears to be a page out of the 
Reform Party blue sheet and I appreciate that.
<P>
	As mentioned, my party supports the idea of increased 
government efficiency and cost cutting in the Department of 
National Revenue provided that the quality of services to 
Canadians is not affected in the field. Our constituents have 
concerns, as also mentioned by the member for the Official 
Opposition who spoke just prior to me, that Bill C-2 would 
reduce the level of service in the field. I would like to voice 
some of these concerns for the record so the standing committee 
on finance, which will review this bill in detail, will be aware of 
them.
<P>
	It is feared that the combination of Revenue Canada Taxation 
and customs Canada is designed to place more of an emphasis on 
revenue collection, controlling the underground economy and 
smuggling. customs officials must not be hindered in any way 
by legislation from performing the important duty of protecting 
Canadians from illegal drugs, weapons and criminal elements 
by reducing their ranks.
<P>
	By masking administrative cuts at the top, the minister is 
leading by example. However, he must not reduce the number of 
customs personnel in the field which would hinder their ability 
to function effectively.
<P>
	Individuals in the Manitoba riding of Lisgar-Marquette for 
example are concerned that the savings from eliminating one 
deputy minister may be lost tenfold by other problems arising 
from the passing of Bill C-2. In their ports of Snowflake and 
Crystal City, people are concerned that this bill represents the 
first of several steps that would ultimately see the cutting back 
or elimination of customs personnel at certain border points.
<P>
	This concern stems from a pilot program in the United States 
to establish automated permit ports at specified ports of entry on 
the northern border. The main thrust of the U.S. program is to 
expand the hours of low risk entry points so that they can be 
open when staff are not on duty. Canadian and U.S. citizens will 
be allowed to enter the United States unimpeded at specific 
crossings when the port is closed.
<P>
	This program was developed to promote efficiency and the 
results, according to the constituents of Lisgar-Marquette, 
may encourage the Department of National Revenue to follow 
suit. However, constituents fear that ports like Snowflake and 
Crystal City would become more attractive to criminal elements 
looking for a trouble-free point of entry.
<P>
	The illegal gun trade is a lucrative business. With easy access 
to handguns in the United States this area could become a real 
problem for customs border patrols and the RCMP. I am 
expressing a concern and I hope the minister acknowledges that. 
Increased efficiency must not come at the expense of 
effectiveness.
<P>
	One of the natural roles of government should be to protect its 
borders and sovereignty, and I do not mean the definition of 
sovereignty as used by the Official Opposition. Concerns have 
also been raised by the customs union, several municipalities 
and the media that with the consolidation of the two 
departments, the resources for customs officers to effectively 
defend the border will be strained.
<P>
	The customs union is under the impression that increased 
emphasis on these activities will lead to a reduction in resources 
for other activities, such as controlling illegal immigrants, 
firearms, pornography and stopping abducted children.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	The customs union is seriously concerned about the effects of 
this legislation upon the quality of services demanded. For 
example, it is concerned that drug seizures will be reduced.
<P>
	In 1991 there were 10,000 seizures at the border. In 1992, 
there were 25,000 and in 1993 when there was an increase in 
trafficking, there was a reduction in the number of seizures to 
15,000. According to the union smugglers are using more 
innovative and effective techniques to move illegal items into 
Canada. It must be able to respond with the latest techniques to 
catch them.
<P>
	This is why the union is concerned that a lack of emphasis is 
being placed on to these activities. By amalgamating two 
departments into one, possibly the idea of making cuts at the top 
would end up in the field. Once again, I know the minister does 
not intend to do that. I hope he does not. He is shaking his head. 
Therefore, these concerns should be laid to rest.
<P>
	The union is concerned that these activities will only get 
worse with the implementation of this legislation.
<P>
	The Canadian Police Association has also criticized the 
merger because the border is the first line of defence for guns 
and other weapons which ultimately end up on Canadian streets.
<P>
	Even with an elimination of a deputy minister, ensuring that 
the level of service is strictly monitored and adjusted 
accordingly should overcome these fears.
<P>
	The Minister of National Revenue stated that he believes a 
unified Department of National Revenue will build on the 
strength of our existing customs, excise and taxation 
administrations. It will better serve Canadians and strengthen 
their confidence in Canada's revenue administration.
<P>
	Consequently the Reform Party supports the principle on 
which Bill C-2 has been proposed. We ask that the 
parliamentary standing committee examining it take into 
consideration the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="932"> 932 </A></B>
<P>
possible negative effects expressed by our constituents through 
my comments.
<P>
	Improved efficiency and effectiveness can result from this 
bill provided that reorganization and government cost savings 
will be done with the security and best interests of Canadians in 
mind.
<P>
	Once again, we commend the Liberal government for 
removing a piece of duplication and overlap from a government 
agency and encourage much more of the same in areas where 
government waste is evident.
<P>
	As the minister of revenue stated in his speech today while he 
was supporting Bill C-2, giving taxpayers value for their tax 
dollars is definitely a most honourable objective and should be 
supported by all members of this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, my comment will be brief.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate the minister of revenue for 
moving so quickly on the whole issue of minimizing the 
duplication and overlap in any area related to taxation or service 
to the public in the area of taxation. This is welcomed by most 
Canadians. I am happy to see that the Reform Party recognizes 
the importance of our seizing this initiative and acting on it 
within the first hundred days.
<P>
	I also have to say to the members of the Bloc, specifically to 
the critic of the Bloc-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Please make your comments with 
respect to the speaker who just spoke.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
regarding this whole notion of when we return to our ridings this 
weekend, alongside the initiative that has taken place here today 
in this bill there is another initiative that is closely related to it 
which I am sure many members read about in the newspapers 
today.
<P>
	The whole process of examining alternatives to the goods and 
services tax began yesterday in the finance committee. We as 
members of Parliament should make sure when we go home to 
our constituents and talk that we do not just refer to the activities 
that take place in this House of Commons.
<P>
	There is all kinds of activity, as the Reform Party member 
alluded, and initiatives taking place that are good news for our 
constituents.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	Most Canadians would welcome the fact that the finance 
committee said that by the end of June it wants to hear of all the 
possible alternatives to the GST in our existing tax system. It is 
very important that we give that encouragement to our 
constituents when we go home.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
comment on the customs Act, Bill C-2, basically customs is 
there for two major reasons. The first one is to make sure there is 
a good flow of traffic across the border. It is also there for the 
safety and security of Canadians.
<P>
	One of the things that was alluded to by all members is that 
there always have to be savings in federal departments, or any 
department run by government. We have some 90 departments 
that crown corporations and we have always said that we want to 
look at them. There are reasons why we have them. If we cannot 
run them efficiently we look at turning them over to the private 
sector.
<P>
	In this case the minister is amalgamating two departments. 
Obviously there are going to be problems with staffing. There is 
always going to be some staff simply because if they have 
territorial problems they will go to members opposite and make 
presentations.
<P>
	One of the things that I want all members of this House to 
remember is that whenever we work with departments the 
people who work for government are servants of the general 
public. We hear it time and time again that most of the problems 
that are encountered, that frustrate the taxpayers of this country, 
relate to the fact that bureaucrats or people who work for 
government slow the process down. They get into some kind of a 
culture in which all of sudden they have extra powers and they 
impede the progress of citizens. We get a lot of examples of that.
<P>
	One of the things that all members should remember is that we 
should not inflame it by being in bed with any person who works 
for any department with regard to territorial matters. All of us 
who work for government must recognize that the taxpayer is 
the person who funds all these programs. If there are any 
efficiencies to begin with, they should be there and there should 
be common courtesy for all.
<P>
	I hope that when we examine any bill or any scenario in which 
governments are downsizing or right sizing, as the case may be, 
which is the term being used now, as the member who seconded 
my motion on the throne speech said, we should be lean but not 
mean.
<P>
	As a government we should remember that and also remember 
that when we are trying to do these things we are trying to do 
them for the general taxpayer and we are trying to give 
efficiency notwithstanding the fact that this jobless recovery is a 
very significant and important thing that everyone has to deal 
with, including government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments from the 
hon. member.
<P>
	I would like to add that as a businessman over the last 23 or 24 
years I have gone through downsizing, right sizing and cuts. I 
have always found that the best and most effective cuts are made 
at the top, but leave the people at the point of service, the point 
of sale. The people at the top make the most money. By 
eliminating one or two of those people we then in effect, perhaps 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="933"> 933 </A></B>
<P>
as we evaluate our service ability to give taxpayers value for 
their money, can hire three or four more customs officials.
<P>
	The way some of the bureaucrats get criticized by taxpayers 
that some of them are rude and some of them are using their 
powers abusively comes from the fact that they are probably 
overworked. There is strain and stress in their jobs and it is up to 
the Minister of National Revenue to make this determination 
and find out if there are more people required in the field or not.
<P>
	If we concentrate on what gets us the most compliments, it is 
always the person, just like at a bank, who interfaces with the 
customer. The tellers give the major banks a good reputation or a 
bad reputation, not the VP in the ivory tower. It is the tellers, the 
customs officials, the people the minister sends out to the field 
to do tax audits. Those people who interface with the taxpayers 
are the ones who give government a good reputation or a bad 
reputation. Human resources is an important element and it must 
be evaluated on the basis of the workload, what is expected, 
proper compensation and a good working environment at that 
level.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	In the last two administrations in this Parliament, because a 
lot of the members in the Liberal party are also new, the previous 
government spent most of its time improving the executive level 
of operations and expanding it rather than improving the real 
important areas of operations which were in the field.
<P>
	I hope the minister plans to concentrate in that area. I believe 
the reputation of all bureaucrats will rise accordingly.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will not have enough time 
to finish my comments before the start of Question Period. 
Should I begin anyway?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We cannot very well call it eleven 
o'clock, since Question Period is so important to everybody. 
Would you mind starting? You have seven minutes.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Whelan:</B> I have seven minutes but I will not be able to 
finish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. The hon. member 
may be recognized but does she not have her full time after 
Question Period?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Of course she will, yes.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Whelan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of 
Bill C-2, an act to amend the Department of National Revenue 
Act and to amend certain other acts in consequence thereof.
<P>
	This bill would enable the Minister of National Revenue to 
consolidate two distinct departments under his responsibility 
since 1926 into one and thus eliminate unnecessary duplication 
and overlap within government.
<P>
	It will also bring distinct benefits to taxpayers and it will 
enhance the Department of National Revenue's ability to 
provide more efficient and effective services and programs. It 
will not compromise the integrity of programs in the area of 
responsible enforcement, Canadian sovereignty and laws at the 
border, revenue generation or trade administration, the lines of 
business that make the department an essential national 
institution.
<P>
	My remarks will focus today on how the important 
enforcement and compliance roles of Revenue Canada will be 
recognized and reinforced, not undermined, through the 
administrative consolidation which Bill C-2 will permit.
<P>
	I will also speak specifically about customs activities, non- 
compliance measures which consolidation will strengthen.
<P>
	Revenue Canada customs is highly regarded and highly 
respected as one of the finest services of its kind in the world. 
This respect has been well earned and Canadians can rest 
assured that this will continue to be the case within a unified 
Revenue Canada. Not only due to its enforcement role but also 
because of programs such as International Project Return, a 
program to find missing children, Revenue Canada customs has 
become internationally recognized.
<P>
	To all of those who work for the safe return of missing 
children to their families, the minister has assured me that 
Revenue Canada customs remains committed to International 
Project Return. Revenue Canada is firmly committed to 
maintaining and strenghthening all its customs functions.
<P>
	As national revenue minister, the hon. minister has said the 
role of customs is essential to the social and economic well- 
being of the country. Canadians have a right to safe communities 
and safe environments and protection from unfair economic 
competition.
<P>
	For that reason the government is committed to a strong and 
visible customs program and presence at the border.
<P>
	Revenue Canada customs will continue also to have a clear 
mandate to enforce Canadian law and sovereignty at the border 
by preventing the entry of criminals, illegal immigrants, 
pornographic material, prohibited goods and weapons. As well, 
a mandate to protect Canadian business and industry by 
administering international trade agreements. Further, a 
mandate to protect local economies by collecting taxes at the 
border as well as to provide service to other government 
departments at border facilities. This mandate will be carried 
out by competent, experienced managers and employees.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="934"> 934 </A></B>
<P>
	As well the customs and excise unions, some organizations 
and border communities have expressed concerns about the 
integration of customs within the Department of National 
Revenue. Their concerns are unwarranted and unsupported. 
Enforcement activities at Canada's border crossings are 
important to this government and to Revenue Canada and will 
remain so.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	In fact administrative consolidation will enhance and 
strengthen customs programs by allowing first, greater 
accessibility to a broader range of information, second, 
increased use of technology, and third, a redeployment of 
additional resources to better attack the underground economy 
and to combat smuggling.
<P>
	So far, from savings realized through the administrative 
consolidation of headquarters, almost $13 million has been 
reinvested in key customs initiatives such as enhanced 
technology at airports and border points to speed up the 
processing of travellers and goods and to facilitate the detection 
of contraband-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I apologize for interrupting right in the middle 
of a sentence. It being 11 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 30(5)

to Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to express my 
concerns about the current restructuring the Department of 
Human Resources Development is proposing for Erie riding 
with respect to Canada employment centres.
<P>
	It is my understanding that staffing at these centres in my 
riding is to be reduced by approximately 50 per cent, with this 
personnel to be relocated to larger urban centres in neighbouring 
ridings. This void is to be filled by the use of computers to be 
used by a basically computer illiterate clientele. This is not a 
realistic or practical trade-off.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	I respect and compliment the department in its efforts to 
streamline and reduce costs overall. However with an 
unemployment rate in the Niagara region at approximately 15 
per cent, such cutbacks in our area are inappropriate and 
unacceptable at this time. The blind slash of the pen must be 
reviewed.
<P>
	The problem is further complicated by the lack of a regular 
public transportation system between the respective 
communities and the incidence of long distance phone calls at a 
time when the financial resources of the unemployed are greatly 
diminished. At a time when our riding needs more support the 
bureaucrats are dictating less. Bigger is not necessarily better.

what small business can accomplish.
<P>
	As a Canadian manufacturer and network integrator, Northern 
Micro began supplying its extraordinary combination of 
performance and service in 1985. In 1993 business demands 
required that Northern Micro triple its office space. Now it is 
positioning itself for even greater success in 1994, doubling its

	At a time when the economy was at a standstill Northern 
Micro used a creative mix of marketing moxy and aggressive 
client services to boost sales to over $20 million, selling 10,000

	The federal government must work with Canadian business to 
provide the proper supports and to create a positive climate for

<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>

to pay tax on the withdrawal.
<P>
	The program also recognizes the importance of the housing 
market to economic growth. Its extension will stimulate 
residential real estate and job creation. The program also 
recognizes that a paid off principal residence is for many the 
cornerstone of their retirement plan.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Conservative government threw Canada's financial dice for nine 
years, taking a terrible gamble with our tax money. It bet heavily 
on a rising economy hoping that the economy would outgrow the 
deficit and the problem would just somehow go away. As we 
know the economy did not grow fast enough and the result is 
today's fiscal disaster.

	In the budget to be brought down this month let us hope the 
government realizes that good intentions, wishful thinking, or 
hoping that somehow the right cards will turn up will never put 
anyone to work. Governments should learn from the mistakes of 
the past.
<P>
	Reformers have been warning for years that high deficits and 
high unemployment are directly related. We will seal the fate of 
our unemployed by allowing deficits to balloon out of control.
<P>
	Any budgetary plan that trusts in luck as a basis of its fiscal 
policy will keep the unemployed out of work and that, you can 
bet on.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	While it refuses to divulge its plan of action to put a stop to 
cigarette smuggling, the government expressed its intention to 
enforce the law everywhere in Canada, including on Indian 
reserves. In fact, the Deputy Prime Minister herself said that 
living on a reserve does not give the right to violate Canadian 
laws.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, my question is: Will the Deputy Prime Minister 
reiterate in this House her intention to enforce the law, and will 
she promise to take necessary action to ensure that the law is 
indeed enforced everywhere, including on Indian reserves, in 
spite of the reservations expressed to that effect by the Solicitor 
General?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, these days, the members 
opposite keep repeating that smuggling we do nothing about 
cigarette smuggling.
<P>
	The Leader of the Official Opposition was a Cabinet member 
in the previous government for 781 days, but he did not act. We 
have been in office for less than 100 days. We will have a plan of 
action next week, and this is what I call true action and real 
governing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, are we to understand that the government will 
intervene everywhere, including in Akwesasne, to ensure that 
the law is respected even though the Mohawk authorities in 
Akwesasne declared yesterday that the RCMP had no right to 
intervene on the reserve territory?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the problem of contraband 
smuggling is not limited to reserves. It is an unfortunate mistake 
on the part of the member if he leaves the Canadian people with 
the impression that this is strictly a problem on reserves.
<P>
	The problem of contraband smuggling is one that involves 
organized crime. It is a problem that is spreading with rapidity 
throughout major parts of the country. It is also a problem that 
his leader sat in a cabinet for 781 days and did nothing about.
<P>
	We have been in cabinet for less than 100 days. We have been 
working very hard on a concerted plan which will respect and 
indeed ameliorate the health conditions of Canadians and at the 
same time deal with the enforcement issues.
<P>
	I would say that is a government that is not about talk, it is 
about action.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is strange to hear this government talk about action, 
considering that to this day only one minor bill was tabled, but 
we did hear a lot of lip service.
<P>
	I am also surprised to hear the Deputy Prime Minister 
complain because we raise the issue of smuggling on reserves, 
since she herself made a statement yesterday on national 
television, regarding that problem.
<P>
	Since other statements were also made on the national 
networks yesterday, does the Deputy Prime Minister intend to 
follow up the request for an urgent meeting made by Mohawk 
officials? As you know, some of their spokespersons have 
threatened to stage a major confrontation if the RCMP tries to 
enforce the law on their reserves.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Will the government meet with Mohawk officials from 
Akwesasne, Kanesatake and Kahnawake to discuss cigarette 
smuggling? Yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, what I said yesterday and 
what the Prime Minister mentioned repeatedly, is that we are 
asking all Canadians to respect the law, whether it is in a 
convenience store or on an Indian reserve.
<P>
	I am somewhat surprised by the member's question, because 
on the one hand he claims that this problem strictly concerns 
Indian reserves, while on the other hand he wants us to negotiate 
with those who created the problem.
<P>
	In fact, we have already initiated a dialogue with all the 
stakeholders, including provincial governments. I know that the 
minister responsible for aboriginal issues is meeting with all our 
Cabinet colleagues to come up with a solution by next week. 
This is what I call action and I am surprised to see the Bloc 
Quebecois tell us about enforcing the law when it was precisely 
a member of that party who was bragging about prevention-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Bellechasse.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. The action plan on 
cigarette smuggling that the government is about to announce is 
said to include a six dollar cutback in taxes on a carton of 
cigarettes. Nevertheless, provinces in English Canada are 
joining forces against any cutbacks in taxes.
<P>
	Could the Deputy Prime Minister tell us whether the 
government is going to proceed with its plan to reduce federal 
taxes on tobacco, even though it may be supported only by the 
province of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>First, Mr. Speaker, there is no such thing 
as English Canada provinces. Canada is a country where all the 
languages of the world are spoken. Just take a stroll in my riding 
and see for yourself.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Copps:</B> Second, the Prime Minister stated very clearly 
that we were going to co-operate closely with the provinces and 
try to come to an agreement. However, if we can not reach an 
agreement, we are prepared to go ahead on our own. I should say 
to the hon. member that his leader asked us last week to make a 
move with or without Quebec. He should decide whether he 
wants the co-operation of the provinces or whether he wants the 
federal government to take the lead. As far as we are concerned, 
we want to make a deal with the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question to the Deputy Prime Minister. Would 
she not agree that the tax cutback action plan may prove 
unefficient in Akwesasne, since this reserve is bordered by 
Ontario, United States and Quebec, especially if the government 
of Ontario refuses to lower its taxes on tobacco?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, our plan has not been 
finalized yet and, therefore, it is very difficult at this point in 
time to discuss the details. We want the Canadian people to 
understand that it is not a problem unique to Indian reserves. 
Those who buy smuggled cigarettes, one pack out of three in 
Quebec and one pack out of five in Ontario, are all Canadians. It 
is wrong to say that the problem is unique to reserves. It is a 
smuggling problem, something which involves organized 
crime, and we will propose next week a plan which will deal 
with health and taxes, but especially with fair and equal law 
enforcement for all Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Agriculture.
<P>
	It is reported that negotiations to end the labour dispute on the 
west coast have broken down. As the minister knows this is not 
the first time labour disputes on the west coast have completely 
disrupted the movement of resources and products to market, to 
the detriment and well-being of thousands of farmers on the 
prairies and other producers.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Is it the view of the minister and his department that grain 
handling should be declared an essential service? Has he made 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="939"> 939 </A></B>
<P>
strong representation to the minister responsible for labour, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, on that position.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
question.
<P>
	The question he has raised is one of broad policy 
considerations. I must admit that in the last number of days I 
have been focusing more importantly on the immediate concern 
with respect to the work stoppage on the west coast. I am pleased 
to take the opportunity of this question to provide an update on 
the present situation.
<P>
	As members will know the federal mediator that was made 
available in this dispute was appointed last Tuesday, February 1. 
The talks with the parties commenced on Wednesday. They 
continued through the day on Wednesday and in fact until 5 a.m. 
on Thursday. There was an adjournment during the day on 
Thursday. The talks resumed at 3 p.m. on Thursday. As the hon. 
member advised in his question, those talks broke off at some 
point yesterday afternoon or last evening.
<P>
	The mediator, Mr. Lewis, will be providing a full report 
shortly-in fact it may be in hand at the moment-to my 
colleague, the Minister of Human Resources Development. The 
minister is making his senior mediator from the offices in 
Ottawa available to assist in bringing the parties back to the 
table and resuming the discussions in Vancouver.
<P>
	The government would strongly urge the parties to reflect 
very carefully upon their respective positions and their 
responsibilities in this matter. The parties should resume their 
negotiations immediately.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the minister updating the House on this particular 
dispute.
<P>
	Would the minister give us a clear answer on the broader 
question as to whether his department responsible for 
agriculture-whether your department and you as the minister 
favour legislating-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Please do not forget me. I feel lonesome up 
here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Does the minister's department favour 
declaring grain handling to be an essential service? Could the 
minister advise the House on that point?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I am sure the hon. member will 
know, as a western Canadian with a great deal of interest in the 
health and well-being of the western Canadian grains industry, I 
am very anxious to pursue every conceivable possibility that 
will enhance the position of western Canadian grain farmers 
properly within the context of national public policy.,
<P>
	The precise question he has asked in terms of labour relations 
and other issues affecting the west coast grain handling situation 
must be put within that broader national context of overall 
policy considerations with which the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, with his particular responsibility for 
labour, would be intensely involved.
<P>
	The idea the hon. member suggests is not a new one. It has 
been proposed by others in western Canada from time to time, 
but at the present moment it is not under active consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a further supplementary question. I am sure the minister 
does not want to see agricultural producers left twisting in the 
wind.
<P>
	Previous governments have legislated an end, as the minister 
knows, to particular grain handling disputes on the west coast. 
Would the minister recommend similar action in this case and 
within what timeframe?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think it is helpful, in the 
context of the circumstances existing at the present time, to 
speculate about the proposition the hon. member has raised.
<P>
	It is extremely important for us to urge the parties to assume 
their responsibilities, to get back to the bargaining table and to 
take full advantage of all mediation facilities that are being 
made available to them in the present circumstances by the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	They have a responsibility to resolve the dispute and to 
resolve it fast.

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance. During the election 
campaign, on October 1st, 1993, to be more precise, in an 
interview he gave to <I>Le Téléjournal</I>, the Prime Minister was 
asked if he would commit himself not to increase taxes for the 
next two years. The Prime Minister replied, and I quote: ``So, I 
want to be quite clear on this. There will be no tax increases''.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Finance reaffirm the commitment made 
by the Prime Minister not to increase taxes for the next two 
years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, is the hon. member 
telling us that his party does not want to eliminate tax 
loopholes? If that is the case, it would be totally contrary to what 
the finance critic of his party has told us.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="940"> 940 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I almost 
found myself having to answer a question, when it should be the 
opposite. So, I will ask my question again and suggest some 
alternatives.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Finance not agree that instead of 
increasing taxes, we should implement the tax measures 
Jean-Robert Sansfaçon is suggesting in today's <I>Le Devoir</I>, 
namely a decrease from 80 per cent to 50 per cent of the 
deduction rate for meal and entertainment expenses and the 
same tax treatment for gambling and lottery winnings as for 
capital gains?
<P>
	Would the Minister of Finance not agree that there are other 
measures besides tax increases that can be considered? Those 
measures are the kind the Bloc could support.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> First of all, Mr. Speaker, if I am 
helping him put his questions, it is just that I think our questions 
are better. We have more experience.
<P>
	I have read the article the hon. member just quoted and I found 
it very interesting. I also find interesting the fact that, unlike the 
Reform Party, the hon. member believes that eliminating tax 
loopholes would really make the tax system more fair and 
equitable, and is not just another way to increase taxes. I am glad 
he is making this distinction, which the Reform members do not 
seem to be able to do.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	One of the few mechanisms which the Canadian public has for 
making direct input into the House of Commons is through the 
use of petitions. Yet petitions seem to be simply tabled here and 
left to collect dust. There is no mechanism whereby they can be 
debated or acted upon directly.
<P>
	Would the government entertain the notion of further 
amending the standing orders so as to allow even for a one day 
debate on those petitions that enjoy a large degree of public 
support?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member has made an interesting suggestion. I think it 
can be best dealt with by having it studied by the House 
procedure committee on which her party is represented. This 
would enable the idea to be explored further.
<P>
	In the meantime opposition parties have opposition days 
during which they can debate subjects of their own choosing. 
Certainly it is open to the member's party to use one of its 
opposition days to discuss the subject matter of one or more 
petitions.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, surely 
some of these things are important to the government, not just 
the opposition ranks.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Would she allow debate on just one petition pertaining to the 
credibility of Parliament and public trust in this particular 
institution, namely the petition that is currently circulating in 
the riding of Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member has called for this to be a matter of a change in 
the standing orders. As a first step I think the broad implications 
of having debates on petitions should be considered in the 
committee set up by the House for the purpose of considering 
such changes, and that is the House committee on procedure.

is for the President of the Treasury Board. In December 1992, 
the previous Conservative government froze the payment of all 
grants in lieu of taxes on federal lands and buildings, which of 
course caused a significant shortfall in revenues for 
municipalities across Canada.
<P>

respect to grants in lieu of taxes which comes under the direct 
jurisdiction of the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services. I hope we can have a further response before long for

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	On Wednesday the Prime Minister said that he believed the 
restrictions on free speech contained in the contested gag law 
are compatible with democracy. He said that there are a lot of 
people who want to influence the outcome of an election but ``do 
not have the guts to run for Parliament''.
<P>
	Why does the government believe that participation in the 
political process outside the party structure should be so 
severely restricted?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada 
welcomes participation by every Canadian in the political 
process. The Government of Canada is concerned about the 
issue of paid advertising and paid activity which is a direct 
attempt to influence the electoral process.
<P>
	In 1976 when the Government of Canada amended the 
Elections Act to put all political parties on a level playing field, 
it did so because it recognized that money should not be the tool 
to influence democracy.
<P>
	The federal government believes that everybody should be on 
a level playing field. The level playing field should not simply 
restrict spending by political parties but there should be an open 
opportunity for everybody to participate, not to buy their way 
into influencing the election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a supplementary question for the Deputy Prime 
Minister. Political parties are not on an even footing and 
political parties have a financial advantage over private 
individuals in an election campaign.
<P>
	Does the minister believe that Canadians should have to fight 
all the way to the Supreme Court to defend their right to freedom 
of expression during an election?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, nobody is denying 
Canadians the right to free expression during an election.
<P>
	The fact is that the Canada Elections Act requires that paid 
advertising by political parties be restricted. Indeed official 
agents of political parties are subject to fines and even jail terms 
of up to five years if they do not respect the advertising 
limitations.
<P>
	All that the Liberal Party and the Government of Canada are 
asking is that when it comes to paid advertising the level playing 
field be preserved so that democracy can be preserved and no 
single big money private interest can buy its way into 
influencing the election process.

multicultural fabric of our nation, will contribute greatly to 
economic growth according to the Economic Council of Canada.
<P>
	To give success to this policy, will the minister take steps to 
ensure that visa offices and certified medical examination 
centres in countries such as Ukraine, India, the Philippines and 
others, will be sufficiently staffed and strategically located to 
ensure that the application process is as convenient and as

friend from Winnipeg North and also take the opportunity to 
commend him for the leadership role he has taken within the 
general policy areas of both immigration and multiculturalism.
<P>
	The member raises a good point. There needs to be a 
connection between the desired levels of immigration 
announced and debated and the delivery mechanism.
<P>
	I can tell the hon. member and the House that, for instance, we 
have increased the number of visa officers at our High 
Commission in India from 19 to a current 30. As well, we have 
also put in place accredited medical practitioners because of the 
demand in the state of the Punjab.
<P>
	Since the fall of the Berlin wall we have opened visa offices in 
Kiev, Bucharest and Prague. The hon. member is correct and we 
are moving with dispatch.

	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	The issue of whether to lower cigarette taxes is especially 
complex and divisive because there are many other issues 
involved, including health care and crime to name but two.
<P>
	Since the convictions of members on this issue do not follow 
party lines, will the Deputy Prime Minister allow members of 
her government to vote on cigarette taxes without considering it 
a confidence vote?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has 
made it quite clear that on issues that involve the spending of 
taxpayers' dollars, the government has to have the confidence of 
the House to be able to carry out those measures.
<P>
	When the question relates to the budget or major initiatives on 
excise taxes, the government needs the confidence of its 
members to be able to proceed with money measures.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
members of the government vote according to their conscience 
or according with their constituents' wishes on the issue of 
cigarette taxes, can the Deputy Prime Minister assure the House 
they will not be disciplined?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> First of all, Mr. Speaker, I should have 
congratulated the member on her first question.
<P>
	Second, I hope that every member of this House has a 
conscience and when it comes to making decisions around 
cabinet, caucus, party or government policy that we do not park 
our consciences at the door.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister has made it very clear that when it comes 
to matters involving taxation, the government must have the 
confidence of the House of Commons to proceed with 
initiatives.
<P>
	It is not simply a case of saying on every tough issue that it is a 
matter for an individual; on a tough issue which involves several 
departmental initiatives, such as health issues, criminal and 
enforcement issues, or tax issues, obviously we intend and need 
to have a united front as the Government of Canada.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, Hibernia, 
the oil drilling megaproject off Newfoundland, is becoming the 
biggest white elephant in Canada's history.
<P>
	The federal government is sinking billions of dollars into this 
financial black hole, at the same time as we are finding out that 
the Minister of Finance is seriously considering a sizable 
increase in taxes.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister, in the absence 
of the Minister of Natural Resources. Does the Deputy Prime 
Minister admit that this project is not financially viable and will 
she confirm that the cost overruns could exceed $1.5 billion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

the Government of Canada adopted policies on this megaproject 
for the future. I will also remind the hon. member of comments 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="943"> 943 </A></B>
<P>
made by Quebec's  Minister of Natural Resources, Mr. Christos 
Sirros, who spoke on this issue this week.
<P>
	That being said, the Government of Canada intends to respect 
contracts and written commitments, because the government 
has the right and the duty to honour commitments already made, 
including those concerning the Hibernia project.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> An answer like that is 
rather surprising, Mr. Speaker, since the Liberals cancelled the 
helicopter contract as soon as they took office.
<P>
	At any rate, can the Deputy Prime Minister tell us if she 
intends to stop this hemorrhage of public funds, or are we to 
gather from her answer that in fact her government will continue 
to squander taxpayers' money on a political pay-off to the 
Premier of Newfoundland, Clyde Wells.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that it would be 
inappropriate to compare Toronto Airport with the Hibernia 
project.
<P>
	The Toronto Airport deal was signed during the election 
campaign. It is also known that the Government of Canada had 
made a direct commitment to cancel the helicopter contract and 
that the former government, during the election campaign, was 
in a position to withdraw the contract but the previous prime 
minister did not exercise that option.
<P>
	As a government, we have said that the future projects which 
we will consider will not be megaprojects, because we cannot 
afford them and it is not profitable for small and medium-sized 
businesses, which are the basis of our red book.
<P>
	That said, we want to respect the contracts and commitments 
made in writing by the previous government. I presume that it 
must also be the policy of the Bloc Quebecois, if it ever came to 
power, to respect the contracts signed by previous governments.

for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	This morning's <I>Globe and Mail</I> contained an article regarding 
Canada's Sea King helicopters which implied that in spite of 
their recent use in the gulf war, off Yugoslavia, Haiti and 
Somalia, they were not airworthy or capable of carrying out 
their missions.
<P>
	I wonder if the minister could comment on the airworthiness 
of the Sea King helicopters and their capability for the jobs that 
they have to do.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his question. I know he is very 
interested in military matters.
<P>
	When we cancelled the EH-101 we did so with the full 
knowledge that the Sea Kings could last until the year 2000. 
Indeed the EH-101s would not come on stream until about 1999 
and 2000.
<P>
	I recognize some of the comments made but in the article-I 
read it this morning-the commanding officer at Shearwater 
said that as far as he is concerned, like any aging equipment the 
Sea Kings require more and more maintenance but are perfectly 
safe.
<P>
	I flew on one in the Adriatic before Christmas, 70 miles, pitch 
black in stormy seas. It landed on the ship and got me back here. 
I think it is a good enough indication of how airworthy they are 
if they could take me that distance and get back safely.

<P>
	During a conference in Toronto on the electronic highway, the 
secretary of state for science announced the creation of an 
advisory council. The name of the former president of TV 
Ontario, Mr. Bernard Ostry, was mentioned as the chairman of 
this committee.

chairing that committee?

that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the fact that the minister will not confirm that will not 
prevent me from asking a supplementary question.
<P>
	Given that the minister already has recommendations 
contained in the Ostry report on the electronic highway, could he 
explain why we would need a second committee to study the 
matter?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry): </B>Mr. Speaker, as 
we said in the speech from the throne, the implementation of a 
Canadian strategy for an information highway is a priority of 
our gouvernement.

we believe we should have a committee to provide us with 
precise information on an ongoing basis.

whose interest in the information highway will touch on a 
variety of fields; users, those who will be contributing to the

question is for the Minister of Justice. On January 4, 1994 I 
wrote to the minister with regard to the case of Patrick Kelly. He 
is the former RCMP officer convicted of murdering his wife in 
1981.
<P>
	Since his conviction the crown's key witness, whose 
testimony convicted Mr. Kelly, now admits her testimony was 
false. Given this new information that now introduces 
reasonable doubt, will the Minister of Justice take action to 
review the case?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I acknowledge at the 
outset my gratitude to the hon. member for Comox-Alberni for 
informing me last evening of his intention to raise this matter. I 
am grateful for his consideration.
<P>
	As a result I have had an opportunity to review the dossier. I 
can tell the hon. member that I have received correspondence 
from counsel acting on behalf of Mr. Kelly, invoking the 
provisions of section 690 of the Criminal Code. This section 
empowers the Minister of Justice to grant mercy in the name of 
the crown either by directing a new trial, or by referring the 
matter to an appeal court for a review where there has been some 
indication that there may have been a miscarriage of justice.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	I am now in the process of assembling the material that will 
enable me to deal with that application, including requesting a 
copy of the transcript at trial, the addresses to the jury, any 
reasons for judgment that may have been given, also particulars 
of any new evidence that counsel wishes me to consider.
<P>
	In accordance with the invariable practice that material will 
be organized and assessed. An investigative brief will be 
prepared. It will be presented in the fullness of time to counsel 
for the applicant for comment and then the matter will be put on 
my desk for decision.
<P>
	I assure the hon. member that I consider my functions under 
section 690 to be among the most important responsibilities in

As was pointed out last evening on the CBC news, in its red book 
the Liberal Party of Canada accused the previous government of 
deliberately undermining our institutions and argued that 
funding cuts to the CBC illustrated the Tories' failure to 
appreciate the importance of cultural development.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="945"> 945 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister undoubtedly recognizes this excerpt from the 
red book. Can he tell us whether he agrees with the position 
taken by his party?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I am more interested in the future than in the past. It is 
precisely because of our concern for the future that we 
announced yesterday a number of initiatives to help fund the 
CBC's operations so that this great national institution can 
continue to adapt, flourish and serve Canadians from coast to 
coast.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to hear the minister say that the red book 
is a thing of the past. Perhaps we will hear no more about it then. 
Does the minister still claim to be a friend of the CBC family, 
while preparing to implement the cuts decreed by the previous 
government, cuts which the Liberal Party strongly condemned 
when it was in opposition?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the letter that I sent to the new president of the CBC 
yesterday contained more than just an announcement that the 
cuts decreed by the previous government would not be 
rescinded. First, we indicated clearly that we would do 
everything we could to ensure that the CBC continued to 
flourish in spite of the cuts.
<P>
	Second, we agreed to a long-standing request from the 
corporation, namely that it be allowed to borrow money. In the 
past, this request had always been denied. Third, we indicated 
that we would look for other sources of funding which would 
help the CBC to flourish. Therefore, to view the announcements 
only in a negative light is unfair. The new president of the CBC 
acknowledged that there was also a positive side to our 
announcements.

the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Earlier this week the minister stated that virtually everybody 
at the pre-budget consultation conferences supported 
augmenting the revenue side.
<P>
	Mr. Jason Kenney, national director of Canadian Taxpayers 
Federation and a great many other people have advised me that 
as participants at the Calgary conference, every workshop called 
for no increase in taxation. How does the minister explain this 
discrepancy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development

workshops in Calgary and at the other three as well there are 
differences of opinion as is natural. My statement was that at 
virtually every conference there was tremendous support for 
building equity into the tax system.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	If we take a look at the member's question, I would say that 
not only virtually every member at those conferences but 
virtually every Canadian would like to see the government

<P>
	In the 1980s some 60 animals were imported into Canada

<P>
	Canada's first case of BSE was diagnosed in December of last 
year in Alberta. The cow was originally imported from the 
United Kingdom in 1987. Continued access for Canadian cattle 
and products to international markets depends very heavily 
upon my department's commitment to undertake very stringent 
control measures with respect to BSE.
<P>
	The department is following a procedure that will ensure there 
will be no animals remaining in Canada that could have had any 
contact with any source of BSE infection. That position is 
strongly supported by every major livestock organization in the

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

its obligations very specifically to get certain amendments to 
the NAFTA. Those were achieved by the work of the Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	If we are going to make statements in the House we should 
make sure we are on track. That being said, obviously the first 
priority of the government is job creation. We are disappointed 
that the figures are not better. We have a fiscal plan and a jobs 
plan on track.
<P>
	Because the hon. member has a great deal of experience in this 
area, I know she is going to want to work collaboratively with

why they have put their confidence in us and we intend to

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFNATIONALREVENUEACT">DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL REVENUE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-2, 
an act to amend the Department of National Revenue Act and to 
amend certain other acts in consequence thereof, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to recap my 
earlier comments in support of Bill C-2, an act to amend the 
Department of National Revenue Act and to amend certain other 
acts in consequence thereof.
<P>
	This bill would enable the Minister of National Revenue to 
consolidate two distinct departments under his responsibility 
since 1926 into one and thus eliminate unnecessary duplication 
and overlap within government.
<P>
	It is an act that will bring distinct benefits to taxpayers and 
will enhance the ability of the Department of National Revenue 
to provide more efficient and effective services and programs.
<P>
	I want to assure the House that this act will not compromise 
the integrity of programs in the area of responsible enforcement, 
of Canadian sovereignty and laws at the border, revenue 
generation, or trade administration, the lines of business that 
make the department an essential national institution.
<P>
	I would also like to inform the House that Revenue Canada 
customs is highly regarded and well respected as one of the 
finest services of its kind in the world. This respect has been 
well earned and Canadians can rest assured that this will 
continue to be the case within a unified Revenue Canada. Not 
only due to its enforcement role but also because of programs 
such as International Project Return, a program to find missing 
children, Revenue Canada customs has become internationally 
recognized.
<P>
	I would like to assure the member who raised this concern 
earlier and I would like to assure all of those who work for the 
safe return of missing children to families that the minister has 
assured me that Revenue Canada customs remains committed to 
International Project Return.
<P>
	As well, Revenue Canada is firmly committed to maintaining 
and strengthening all its customs functions.
<P>
	As national revenue minister, the hon. minister has said that 
the role of customs is essential to the social and economic well 
being of the country.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, Revenue Canada customs will 
continue to have a clear mandate to enforce Canadian law and 
sovereignty at the border by preventing the entry of criminals, 
illegal immigrants, pornographic material, prohibited goods 
and weapons. As well, a mandate to protect Canadian business 
and industry by administering international trade agreements. 
Further, a mandate to protect local economies by collecting 
taxes at the border and also a mandate to provide service to other 
government departments at border facilities.
<P>
	I would like to assure the House that this mandate will be 
carried out by competent experienced managers and employees.
<P>
	As well, the customs and excise union, some organizations 
and border communities have expressed concerns about the 
integration of customs within the Department of National 
Revenue. I again want to inform this House that their concerns 
are unwarranted and unsupported.
<P>
	Enforcement activities at Canada's border crossings are 
important to this government and to Revenue Canada  and will 
remain so. Administrative consolidation will enhance and 
strengthen customs programs by allowing greater accessibility 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="948"> 948 </A></B>
<P>
to a broader range of information, increased use of technology 
and redeployment of additional resources to better attack the 
underground economy and combat smuggling.
<P>
	So far, from savings realized through the administrative 
consolidation of headquarters, almost $13 million has been 
reinvested in key customs initiatives such as enhanced 
technology at airports and border points to speed up the 
processing of travellers and goods and to facilitate the detention 
of contraband and high risk travellers.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	In 1993 Revenue Canada customs seized a record amount of 
drugs worth more than $1.4 billion. I am sure that customs 
officers will continue their outstanding work with law 
enforcement agencies to keep drugs off our streets.
<P>
	Enforcement does not begin only at Canada's border. That is 
why Revenue Canada is negotiating agreements with carriers in 
other countries to work together in the international fight 
against drugs.
<P>
	The government is very concerned about the level of 
smuggling we are currently experiencing. Such illegal activity 
cannot continue to the overall detriment of society and this 
government is considering its strategies in this regard. We 
believe that a strengthened enforcement role, both at the border 
and in the boardroom, will help the government to tackle the 
issues of smuggling and non-compliance.
<P>
	I want to inform the House that by combining its resources, 
Revenue Canada will be able to get tough with the small 
minority who cheat the system. Administrative consolidation 
will give Revenue Canada the resources, expertise and 
information to conduct joint GST and income tax audits of 
individuals and businesses to identify non-registrants and those 
not reporting income, to conduct special investigations and to 
improve its ability to identify non-compliance with all of its 
acts and regulations.
<P>
	It is up to this government to ensure that the law-abiding 
majority does not suffer because of those who deliberately cheat 
the system either by smuggling or not paying their taxes. All 
Canadians should pay their fair share.
<P>
	As the Minister of National Revenue has said, such illegal 
activities constitute a significant threat to Canadian society and 
to our economy. This government is determined to maintain and 
enhance its ability to respond to these challenges. As well, this 
legislation will permit the minister to organize the delivery of 
programs and services. With improved accessibility, Canadians 
will no longer have to run from one Revenue Canada office to 
the next to get general information, make payments or pick up 
publications and forms. All of this can be done  at one time at 
Revenue Canada's expanded network of offices across Canada.
<P>
	As well, there will be a consolidated collections program. 
Clients will eventually be able to deal with one revenue official 
for all their accounts. The result will be efficient service that is 
more responsive to individual business circumstances and 
combined audits.
<P>
	Revenue Canada recognizes that businesses usually have to 
deal with customs, excise, GST and income tax auditors 
separately. This is cumbersome and inconvenient, particularly 
for small businesses. Therefore, Revenue Canada is developing 
a consolidated approach to audit. This will mean better service, 
reduced costs and less duplication. It will be less intrusive to 
businesses because whenever possible combined audits will be 
done at one time.
<P>
	Finally, we will have a single business registration number. 
Revenue Canada is taking the lead for the federal government by 
developing a single business registration number; one client, 
one account number. This is obviously a much simpler system 
for businesses that sometimes have to use several different 
account numbers when dealing with different parts of the 
department.
<P>
	The department plans to pilot this initiative in eight cities in 
May of this year. There will be a single remittance for customs, 
GST and income tax. The department is now examining a plan 
which will allow it to accept single payments. This initiative 
will simplify and streamline accounting for hundreds and 
thousands of Canadian businesses and an offset system.
<P>
	Eventually businesses will be able to offset a liability in one 
area such as taxation with overpayments or refunds from 
another area such as GST. This will make it possible for the 
department and businesses to reconcile their accounts with one 
single cheque. This will also simplify account processing for 
businesses, improve their cash flow and reduce the cost of doing 
business with the government.
<P>
	We will also introduce a simplified combined annual business 
return. Beginning in the 1993 taxation year, small businesses 
with gross sales under $500,000 will be able to file a combined 
annual return for both income tax and GST. They will be able to 
pay both taxes with one cheque and even use a credit from one 
tax account to pay an outstanding balance from another. This 
will bring existing GST legislation in line with the fairness 
policy which was recently developed for income tax filers. This 
policy gives Revenue Canada officials flexibility when dealing 
with persons who have not met their obligations due to 
circumstances beyond their control.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Revenue Canada is also piloting a new way of doing business 
with its commercial clients starting with pilots in the 
automotive and aerospace sectors.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="949"> 949 </A></B>
<P>
	The new business relationship changes the way customs 
interacts with its commercial clients by re-engineering 
processes and requirements and reducing red tape and 
paperwork.
<P>
	This new approach will generate significant savings for 
clients. The big three North American automakers and the 
aerospace industry together estimate a $180 million saving over 
the next decade, something quite substantial.
<P>
	This program has been well received by a cross-section of 
Canadian businesses. Revenue Canada is committed to building 
a first class revenue administration capable of adapting to new 
economic and fiscal policies and one in which service is a 
priority.
<P>
	I tell the House today that Revenue Canada is an essential 
instrument and must be capable of meeting these challenges 
head on as an organization having service, voluntary 
compliance, and enforcement as priorities. It would make no 
sense to weaken our response capacity.
<P>
	The proposed bill will not undermine the effectiveness of 
Revenue Canada customs or make it play second fiddle to 
revenue generation. Administrative consolidation will instead 
strengthen the government's capacity in this important field. It 
is for these reasons that I recommend the support of Bill C-2.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the parliamentary 
secretary and her minister for bringing this bill in so quickly and 
congratulate the parliamentary secretary for her emphasis that 
this bill will look into and put a stop to the illegal entry of 
criminals, the entry of illegal immigrants and will provide more 
resources to combat the smuggling of the drugs and the liquor 
that are coming into this country.
<P>
	I have said many times before that there is a criminal element 
taking over the economy of this country. I am glad that this 
minister and this parliamentary secretary are acting so quickly.
<P>
	I would like to pose a question based on representations I have 
received from constituents and other people. When Canadians 
return to Canada if they have been out of the country a very short 
time they can bring tax exempt goods back with a maximum 
value of $20. If they have been out of the country for 48 hours 
they can bring goods back worth $100. If they are away for seven 
days they can bring back goods worth $300.
<P>
	I wonder if this bill does address this. If not, would the 
parliamentary secretary take representations about looking into 
increasing the exemptions? Many families come back and they 
cannot even buy goods for their children for $100.
<P>
	My recommendation and their recommendation would be to 
increase those exemptions perhaps to $50, $200 and $500, or 
something like that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Whelan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform the hon. 
member that this bill does not address that issue but we will 
certainly take that under advisement and look into it.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and referred to a 
committee.)

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CROWNLIABILITYANDPROCEEDINGSACT">CROWN LIABILITY AND PROCEEDINGS ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (for the Minister of Justice)</B> moved that 
Bill C-4, an act to amend the Crown Liability and Proceedings 
Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise to introduce debate on the second reading of 
Bill C-4, an act to amend the Crown Liability and Proceedings 
Act.
<P>
	Last summer Canada, the United States and Mexico 
concluded two agreements which were additional and 
complementary to the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
One of these agreements is the North American agreement on 
environmental co-operation. This agreement commits the three 
countries to environmentally sustainable economic growth, to 
effective enforcement by each country of its environmental laws 
and regulations and to increased co-operation in the 
development of such laws and regulations.
<P>
	The other is the North American agreement on labour 
co-operation which promotes improvement of working 
conditions in the North American workplace for all workers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Under these complementary agreements, the three countries 
must not only enforce their labour and environmental legislation 
but also correct any pattern of failure to effectively enforce the 
existing legislation. These complementary agreements have 
created international obligations for Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In order to enforce these obligations each agreement provides 
for the establishment of panels to make findings of fact and 
determinations. In carrying out these functions a panel may in 
its determination require a country to adopt an action plan to 
correct any failures to enforce its own laws or standards. In 
certain cases the panel determination may require the offending 
party to pay a fine.
<P>
	The proposed amendments to the Crown Liability and 
Proceedings Act, for which the Minister of Justice is 
responsible, are before us today to permit domestic enforcement 
by the Federal Court of Canada of determinations relating to 
Canada's international obligations which may be made by these 
trinational  panels. Without these amendments no mechanism 
exists in Canadian law whereby our domestic courts can be 
employed to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="950"> 950 </A></B>
<P>
require the government to live up to its international 
obligations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada respects the rule of law. It does not have a problem 
with using its national legal framework to enforce international 
rights and obligations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to outline briefly the process of how penalties 
will be enforced against Canada under the agreements.
<P>
	In the highly unlikely event that Canada were to fail 
effectively to enforce its environmental and labour laws and 
standards and had demonstrated a persistent pattern of failure to 
do so, a trinational environmental or labour panel could require 
Canada to adopt action plans to correct the problems identified 
by the panels. Canada could also be subject to fines which are 
called monetary enforcement assessments in the bill. Very 
politely, I may add.
<P>
	Under the agreements any failure to comply with an action 
plan approved or established by a panel or to pay a fine levied 
against Canada can only be enforced through the filing of the 
panel's determination with the Federal Court of Canada. It 
would then become a judgment of that court and is enforceable 
as such against the federal crown.
<P>
	A panel determination that is made an order of the federal 
court would be enforceable in the same manner as any other 
order of the court subject to certain limitations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This mechanism could not impose such an order on a 
provincial court unless the province has signed the agreement in 
question and the order relates to an area of provincial 
jurisdiction. In such a case, the province would have to amend 
its enabling legislation so that the order can be tabled in the 
province's superior court of competent jurisdiction. Such 
amendments would have the same effect as Bill C-4 for the 
federal government.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada negotiated the right to set up this process thereby 
avoiding other remedies such as trade retaliation which will be 
applied in the case of the United States and Mexico. Many of us 
heard about this negotiating process and the results of the 
process frequently during the election campaign.
<P>
	I would also draw the attention of the House to provisions in 
the bill which promote the finality of the enforcement 
procedures. Under the proposed legislation there would be no 
right of appeal against a panel determination or an order or 
decision made by the Federal Court in any enforcement 
proceedings.
<P>
	Because this is a strictly international determination which 
calls for particular expertise and complex international issues, 
Canadian courts would not be allowed to override the panel's 
determination.
<P>
	The bill also contains a privative clause to exclude domestic 
judicial review of the panel proceedings, panel determinations, 
enforcement proceedings taken in the Federal Court and orders 
and decisions made by the Federal Court in any enforcement 
proceedings.
<P>
	This provision is similar in some respects to one already in 
place concerning the North American Free Trade Agreement.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government is presenting these amendments early in the 
parliamentary session to fulfil its commitment towards the 
United States and Mexico.
<P>
	In an exchange of diplomatic notes with the United States and 
Mexico on the coming into force of NAFTA, the minister 
promised on behalf of the government to ask Parliament for 
permission to implement these extra-judicial settlement 
mechanisms at the national level. He made a commitment to 
submit this request as soon as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I commend this bill to the House for consideration and I urge 
all hon. members to lend their support.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
the 102nd day that the Liberal Party of Canada has been in power 
and we are presented with two bills. This is a big first, and I want 
to congratulate the Minister of Justice who is showing the most 
courage by presenting Bill C-2 and Bill C-4 this afternoon.
<P>
	First, I should say that the Official Opposition will support 
Bill C-4 introduced by the Minister of Justice. Over the last few 
years, a consensus has developed in Quebec regarding the 
opening of our society to international competition. Quebec 
must participate actively to any initiative intended to reduce 
trade barriers and to promote international trade. To that effect, 
our support for that Bill also applies to the principle of NAFTA 
and to the objectives set out in the side deals.
<P>
	However, I would like to convey to the House some of our 
concerns regarding the Canadian process for passing accords. 
Quebec has, for a long time, made it known that it wanted to be 
involved when international issues relating to its jurisdiction 
were being discussed. This is part of what we might call the 
traditional demands of Quebec. This involvement was upheld by 
a 1937 decision of the Privy Council, which confirmed that the 
federal government had to have the agreement of the provinces 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="951"> 951 </A></B>
<P>
to implement international accords affecting their jurisdictions. 
It is on the basis of that decision that Ontario lodged an appeal to 
the courts disputing the legitimacy of federal action in this 
matter.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	I repeat that the Official Opposition approves the principles of 
NAFTA. Let me remind this House that Quebec was the 
strongest advocate of NAFTA and of the free trade agreement 
between Canada and the United States. During the 1988 election 
campaign, the Conservative Party used the free trade agreement 
to get votes in Quebec. With the support of the Parti québécois, 
the Conservatives were able to win a lot of seats in Quebec and 
thereby get a second straight mandate.
<P>
	If Quebecers were so strongly in favour of free trade, it is 
because they understood that the future of a small and dynamic 
modern society such as ours is contingent upon being open to the 
world and having access to major markets. Far from advocating 
a rigid and inward-looking form of nationalism, Quebecers are 
confident in their ability, and they are ready to face international 
competition and conquer new markets.
<P>
	The federal structure never allowed Quebec to fully affirm its 
autonomy and extend its jurisdiction to an international level. 
Quebec can no longer endure this situation which limits its 
possibilities; the failure of the Meech Lake Accord confirmed 
the dead end in which Canada put itself.
<P>
	Let us not forget that Quebec was always willing to 
participate in federal-provincial consultations on NAFTA, and 
always strongly defended Quebecers' interests at those 
meetings. The terms and conditions relating to Quebec and 
Canada in the side agreements must take into account Quebec's 
legitimate wishes and reflect the jurisdictional realities that 
exist in Quebec and Canada. Under the 1867 Constitution, the 
Official Opposition will not approve any agreement before 
receiving assurances that Quebec's areas of jurisdiction will be 
respected.
<P>
	Negotiations are under way between Quebec and Ottawa in 
order to implement the side agreements. The Official 
Opposition is keeping a close watch on these negotiations. It 
would be totally unacceptable for the federal government to take 
advantage of Quebec's agreement in principle to unilaterally 
impose its own environmental and labour standards, two areas in 
which Quebec is determined to maintain its prerogatives and its 
autonomy.
<P>
	Quebec cannot be satisfied with a hasty consultation when 
issues affecting it so deeply will be discussed in committee. We 
will soon find out whether the federal government's appetite for 
centralization will gain the upper hand once again.
<P>
	So that is the position of the Bloc Quebecois and Official 
Opposition.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, today I am 
speaking as chairman of the Reform Party committee on 
international trade.
<P>
	The topic is Bill C-4 which will permit the full Canadian 
enforcement of two NAFTA side agreements: the North 
American agreement on environment co-operation and the 
North American agreement on labour co-operation.
<P>
	I will begin my statement by saying that the Reform Party 
supports this bill, although we do have a few areas of concern 
that I will be expanding upon later in my presentation. Our 
support of NAFTA is on the condition that Canadian businesses 
can take full advantage of this important agreement by reducing 
government spending and lowering taxes in this country; by 
eliminating interprovincial trade barriers, and by shifting 
emphasis from welfare to retraining and technological 
development.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Because we support NAFTA we support the necessary 
enacting legislation introduced in Bill C-4. I would like to 
commend the government for signing NAFTA. I was encouraged 
in the throne speech by the promise of an activist trade policy 
and by improving access to export sales. I was especially 
encouraged by the promise to work with provincial governments 
to eliminate internal trade barriers.
<P>
	Canada is a trading nation and benefits enormously from trade 
liberalization. Canada produces a surplus of many goods and 
services which are in demand around the world. Yet Canada 
cannot possibly produce the full range of goods and services that 
Canadians need so it is to our advantage that we maximize and 
optimize trade. Greater and freer world trade will open up new 
markets and new opportunities. It will provide more jobs, raise 
our real income levels and add to the strength of the Canadian 
economy. The overall prosperity of Canadians will be enhanced.
<P>
	In Canada, trade accounts for one out of every four jobs 
generated. In my riding of Peace River we are very dependent on 
trade to provide jobs; in the agriculture sector, oil and gas, and 
also in forestry. Twenty-five per cent of everything we produce 
is exported and the total value of exports is increasing all the 
time.
<P>
	This underlines the importance of participating in both 
NAFTA and the GATT trade agreements. The NAFTA 
agreement allows Canada to reach its long-term objectives and 
will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="952"> 952 </A></B>
<P>
strengthen environmental co-operation in North America; 
promote sustainable development on a continental basis; create 
an effective institution to oversee this agreement; effectively 
enforce and enhance compliance with domestic environmental 
laws.
<P>
	In the area of labour co-operation, NAFTA will improve 
working conditions and living standards in all three 
participating countries and it will protect, enhance and enforce 
basic workers' rights.
<P>
	In order to benefit fully from any trade deal, the government 
must ensure that Canadian businesses are in a position to 
participate fully in the new opportunities that exist.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Southwest and many of my 
colleagues have spoken about the importance of bringing down 
the cost of doing business. We must eliminate deficit spending 
so that we can finally lower taxes. We must eliminate 
interprovincial trade barriers.
<P>
	There are many categories of barriers. In the agriculture and 
food processing industries over 100 barriers exist. They include 
production quotas, differential labelling, quality and packaging 
standards, and transportation and stabilization subsidies.
<P>
	In the liquor, wine and beer industries we have provincial 
production requirements, local bottling requirements, 
differential mark-ups, quotas, packing requirements and 
marketing favouritism.
<P>
	In the transportation industry, we have different licensing 
requirements, size and weight requirements, safety regulations, 
provincial transportation board discretionary powers, and 
varying fuel and sales taxes.
<P>
	In the area of government procurement, we find explicit and 
implicit preferences for local suppliers and requirements for 
locally produced materials. With government procurement 
expenditures exceeding $100 billion per year, approximately 20 
per cent of GNP, this is by no means insignificant.
<P>
	In the area of labour mobility, there are different licensing 
requirements for professionals and trades persons from 
province to province. These barriers create significant 
impediments to people wishing to move to another province 
since skilled workers have to meet additional licensing 
requirements.
<P>
	In the area of capital mobility there are industrial incentives, 
local investment funds and local tax incentives. Such carriers 
are often used for regional development and create an inefficient 
allocation of our financial resources.
<P>
	The cost to our nation of these and other internal barriers is in 
the neighbourhood of $6.5 billion per year. Interprovincial trade 
barriers have fragmented the marketplace and hindered 
Canada's ability to compete internationally. Furthermore, these 
barriers give competitive advantages to large firms that can 
afford to comply with the stringent rules imposed by 
government. At the same time they hinder small businesses 
from reaching their market potential. Unless we can improve 
competition within our own borders and can lower the cost of 
doing business by providing some tax relief, we will never be 
able to reap the full rewards of the expanded trade opportunities 
that exist.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	I have outlined our party's concerns on the need to let 
businesses take full advantage of this trade agreement. We 
expect the government to take the necessary steps to allow this 
to happen.
<P>
	Let me get back to Bill C-4. Under NAFTA a compliance 
mechanism has been established in the event an arbitral panel 
finds persistent patterns of failure by a country to effectively 
enforce its labour and environmental laws. If a country fails to 
correct the problem, the panel may impose sizeable fines. In the 
event that a fine is imposed on Canada, and it is very unlikely 
this will happen as one speaker said earlier, the fine would 
ultimately be enforced by domestic courts.
<P>
	At this stage we support this bill and its enabling legislation in 
order to move quickly to bring this trade deal into full effect. But 
we do have a few specific concerns that need to be addressed.
<P>
	First, the bill states clearly that any panel determination that 
would enforce Canadian labour laws or standards cannot be 
appealed. We would favour the addition of an appeal process.
<P>
	Second, we would insist that Canadian members on this panel 
be chosen on the basis of fair regional representation.
<P>
	I trust that the standing committee reviewing this legislation 
will address our specific concerns.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak 
today on Bill C-4. Many members will realize this was a central 
issue for us not only during the last campaign but during the last 
Parliament.
<P>
	Many of us participated in the around the clock debate when 
the then government brought in the NAFTA. Our critic for 
labour, the member for Kenora-Rainy River, led the debate. 
We did our best to get the government to include side deals on 
NAFTA related to labour and environmental standards that we 
believed to be so necessary and so important for the integrity of 
this agreement.
<P>
	We did not have such luck. But it was amazing during the 
election how our NDP opponents forgot about that debate. They 
forgot that we debated around the clock and we did our best to 
fight for amendments to the deal. In fact I remember at one time 
during the campaign they said that the Liberals were really 
going along with the Conservative Party package on NAFTA 
when that was not the case.

	I am happy to speak in the House today, approximately 100 
days since the government was sworn in. It was the Prime 
Minister who within the first week of taking office declared that 
we would only get behind NAFTA if we could have enforceable 
side deals. Therefore, I think it is important for all Canadians to 
know that NAFTA has been strengthened and improved. I 
believe the side agreements on environmental and labour 
co-operation will go a long way in allaying the justifiable fears 
of Canadians in these areas.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	I specifically like that this tripartite commission which will 
be set up will be so specific in its area of responsibility and 
priority that it will include limits on specific pollutants, 
assessing projects with transboundary implications and 
reciprocal court access. This is the specific type of thing those in 
Canada who were opposed to the NAFTA, myself included, 
wanted attached to the agreement.
<P>
	Also with respect to the environment the minister of trade 
went to extra lengths in the area of water. In the last Parliament 
we listened to lawyers and experts from across Canada who had 
the view, as did many members, that the issue of water was not 
clear. In fact they could have access to our water either through 
the free trade agreement or the NAFTA. Many of us were very 
concerned about that. I give credit to the minister of trade who 
went the extra distance to cite water specifically. In fact under 
these side agreements there is absolutely no way the Americans 
or Mexicans have unfettered access to our water.
<P>
	The last point I want to make is in relation to labour. In my 
riding labour was a major concern and I supported this concern. 
We are going to have to be very diligent about this issue because 
many people are concerned about the labour standards in 
Mexico, especially with this notion of hiring young children and 
the working conditions. No one in this country could tolerate 
those working conditions with any kind of conscience at all.
<P>
	Under the very specific mandate to the labour commission in 
this side deal we can assure Canadians if there is any action 
taken in any corporation or any activity in Mexico they can 
appeal to this commission. We will have representation there 
that will bring the matter to the attention of this Parliament and 
that is ultimately what Canadians want.
<P>
	I am happy to see that all three parties are united on these side 
agreements to the NAFTA. However, we are going to have to be 
very diligent and watch this agreement very closely because I 
know that a large number of Canadians are still very dubious 
about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I make a comment for clarification on this additional 
measure.
<P>
	Can it be explained in plain language on the record, how a 
local citizen or a company could intervene when they observe in 
the marketplace that these new orders of the Federal Court, 
generated from this tripartite commission, can bring others to 
account, that these new orders will be obeyed and observed both 
here in Canada and in comparable jurisdictions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
parliamentary secretary to the minister of trade will be speaking 
momentarily.
<P>
	My understanding of this agreement is that when there is a 
situation having to do either with the environment or labour 
where we believe the agreement is not being followed, then we 
would report this to the commission which has the jurisdiction 
and will allow the claim to be analysed. If the claim is justified 
and someone is defaulting then action can be taken right away.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Mr. Speaker, the commission makes a ruling. I 
believe that ruling will then become an order of the Federal 
Court of Canada. There is the issue of compliance with that 
order. I am certain that companies will be looking at the 
marketplace to see whether those orders are being complied 
with. Are they then to go back to the commission that made the 
order in the first place?
<P>
	I am looking for some clarification in that respect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member raises a valid point. This is my understanding of it and I 
stand to be corrected by the parliamentary secretary to the 
minister of trade.
<P>
	Let us imagine there is a court ruling that labour standards are 
not being followed which essentially would violate the terms 
and conditions of the agreement. It is then incumbent upon the 
parties who signed that agreement to implement the direction of 
that court or panel. We have to have some basic goodwill. If that 
type of judgment is asserted then the parties involved would 
make sure that the implementation or correction would take 
place.
<P>
	The member raises a very good point. When I debated this 
point in opposition we heard from many people that the 
implementation of the agreement whether it be on 
environmental standards or labour standards would be the great 
challenge.
<P>
	The fact that we have isolated from the agreement a special 
commission both in terms of labour and environment is almost 
like an enhanced scanner on those two types of activities. My 
understanding would be that all parties would be much more on 
alert knowing those panels exist to monitor all activities.
<P>
	That is our greatest hope. I have not heard of a better way to 
put some teeth into the agreement.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege for me to 
rise to speak to this bill, an act to amend the Crown Liability and 
Proceedings Act.
<P>
	I would first like to congratulate our Canadian representatives 
who worked tirelessly to ensure that there is fairness in our trade 
relations. It will open a tremendous market for Canadian 
business and Canadian industries abroad.
<P>
	At the same time I want to congratulate all those who were 
involved in the negotiations in the three countries, particularly 
when it came to the side agreements. I know how difficult it was 
at times in pursuing these negotiations.
<P>
	The object and purpose of this legislation can be stated in a 
few words. This legislation ensures that trade sanctions cannot 
be taken against Canada under the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, on environmental and labour co-operation.
<P>
	What this legislation does is give effect to the unique 
provisions written into these agreements for Canada which 
provide that our own Federal Court of Canada would enforce a 
panel determination against Canada in the unlikely event that 
this should ever occur.
<P>
	This was the agreed outcome of the trilateral negotiations 
when Canadian negotiators insisted that for Canada the trade 
sanctions were an unacceptable recourse and remedy 
particularly for environmental and labour disputes. Canadian 
negotiators proposed instead, and it was accepted by the 
American and Mexican negotiators, that the Canadian courts 
would enforce the integrity of the agreement as it operated in 
Canada.
<P>
	The bill before us gives us legal effect to the negotiated 
outcome that Canada achieved in the so-called NAFTA side 
agreement negotiations on environmental and labour 
co-operation.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	This amendment is the only legislative measure necessary for 
Canada to completely fulfil all of its obligations under the North 
American Free Trade Agreement on environmental 
co-operation and labour co-operation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The environmental and labour co-operation agreements 
protect Canada's interests in these fields, with respect to the 
North American Free Trade Agreement. These agreements 
reinforce and broaden important commitments made by Canada, 
the United States and Mexico.
<P>
	The three countries have pledged to work together to 
co-operatively pursue environmentally sustainable growth and 
promote the rights of workers across North America.
<P>
	More important, both agreements reinforce NAFTA's 
provisions regarding labour and the environment. They 
guarantee that the increase in trade we are seeking will not 
happen at the expenses of the environment or Canadian workers.
<P>
	At the present time, we are setting up a commission, under the 
North American Agreement on Environmental Co-operation, 
which will work to foster close and ongoing co-operation 
among the three countries. It will have as a mandate the 
promotion of sustainable development, the development and 
implementation of environmental regulations, and the 
settlement of disputes arising from non-compliance with 
existing legislation.
<P>
	The commission will ensure the implementation of an agenda 
reflecting priorities, including setting limits on certain 
pollutants, evaluating projects having an impact on both sides of 
the border, and guaranteeing reciprocal access to tribunals.
<P>
	The commission, in co-operation with the Free Trade 
Commission, will also ensure that the objectives of the 
Environmental Co-operation Agreement are met.
<P>
	Established pursuant to the North American Agreement on 
Labor Co-operation, the Commission for Labor Co-operation 
has the same purpose. It will promote the application of a 
comprehensive set of principles considered essential by the 
three countries involved.
<P>
	The Commission will also give effect to the promise made by 
all parties and set forth in the NAFTA preamble, that is 
``improve working conditions and living standards'' and 
``protect, enhance and enforce basic workers' rights'' in the 
three countries, on ``their respective territories''. The 
Agreement guarantees that legislation governing health and 
security, children's work, as my colleague mentioned earlier, 
and minimum wage will be respected in the three countries.
<P>
	The agreements are based on a very close and permanent 
co-operation between the three countries, but they go much 
further than mere co-operation. In fact, each country signing 
these agreements will be committed to enforcing on its territory 
any national legislation concerning environment and labor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The North American free trade agreements on environmental 
and labour co-operation in fact does strengthen and improve the 
environmental and labour objectives of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement.
<P>
	Through these side agreements Canada, the United States and 
Mexico have pledged to work together to co-operatively pursue 
environmentally sustainable growth and promote the right of 
workers across North America. Achieving these agreements met 
two of the conditions set out by the Prime Minister for 
proceeding with NAFTA on January 1, 1994.

<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	In addition, the government sought a subsidy code, an 
anti-dumping code, a more effective dispute resolution 
mechanism, and maintenance of Canada's energy security.
<P>
	Through these discussions with the governments of the 
United States and Mexico, we were able to successfully 
negotiate improvements to NAFTA that addressed these 
Canadian concerns. Understandings were reached on subsidies, 
dumping and national sovereignty on water resources.
<P>
	At Canada's insistence, the three NAFTA countries have 
established working groups on subsidies, countervail and 
anti-dumping. Through these working groups we will seek rules 
and procedures on subsidies and dumping to make cross-border 
trading conditions more secure.
<P>
	Ultimately, these badly needed improvements will make 
dispute settlement more equitable and substantially improve the 
business climate among the three partners countries.
<P>
	In order to correct some of the false interpretations about 
NAFTA and water, the three governments have made a joint 
declaration on water. It states that there is nothing in the North 
American Free Trade Agreement that could force Canada, the 
United States or Mexico for that matter to export water.
<P>
	The government's declaration on energy spells out our 
commitment to energy security for all Canadians, an important 
element of our overall economic priorities which also states that 
Canada will continue to be a strong and reliable supplier of 
energy to our customers, reinforcing our industry's expanding 
role in the North American energy market.
<P>
	Taken together, these improvements enabled the government 
to proclaim NAFTA on January 1, 1994 and the government is 
satisfied that the North American Free Trade Agreement will 
advance Canada's trade policies objectives as stated in this 
House by all three parties.
<P>
	I want on this note to thank all my colleagues who have made 
comments in this House and I am delighted to see this bill 
moving ahead. It is a great day for all of us and a great day for 
Canada and for the tremendous opportunities that will come as a 
result of this agreement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to express to my colleague, 
the Minister for International Trade, how delighted I am that this 
bill has come before the House today, so quickly after we have 
taken office.
<P>
	There are many Canadians who have been concerned about 
this issue and I want to put a question to my colleague because I 
have a very special and specific interest in this.
<P>
	Recently Ovide Mercredi, Bob White, head of the Canadian 
Labour Congress, and others made a visit to Mexico during 
which they were investigating conditions that exist there today, 
or are purported to exist, under  which people already were 
maybe taking advantage of the relationship that we have in this 
trade agreement. I have been notified of this and many people 
think that those of us as Liberals who campaigned against 
NAFTA have walked away from that commitment.
<P>
	I have a question for my colleague. Is it his view that these 
side agreements and this piece of legislation that we are putting 
through the House so quickly today will supply us with the teeth 
necessary so that when incidents such as were described in the 
papers recently in terms of people in the community being 
repressed, et cetera, for certain activities they will help us in 
addressing that type of incident?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for his 
comments on this issue.
<P>
	Everything we do as a country and as a society has and 
continues to be in the best interests of our workers and our 
businesses. We will continue to further the dialogue between our 
partners both in the United States and Mexico in order to ensure 
that the quality of life that our workers enjoy here in Canada is 
enjoyed elsewhere. This bill will further these initiatives for the 
best.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That appears to be everybody who 
wishes to speak. I call on the parliamentary secretary to the 
government House leader to close the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
just wanted to answer the question raised by the hon. member for 
New Westminster-Burnaby. It was a very careful question and 
slightly tricky from the legal point of view.
<P>
	The decisions that will be registered in the Federal Court of 
Canada and that thereby become enforceable in Canada will be 
decisions that are made against the Government of Canada for 
breaches of its international obligations.
<P>
	My understanding is that having been made against Canada, 
the decision becomes an enforceable obligation of the 
Government of Canada by virtue of its registration in the 
Federal Court of Canada and the Government of Canada, like all 
good citizens, complies in all respects with the orders of its 
courts. Therefore, there should not be further need for 
enforcement. If it is a fine that has been levied on the 
Government of Canada payable to the other countries, the 
Government of Canada would then comply with the order of its 
domestic court and pay the money to one of the other countries if 
that is who the fine were payable to.
<P>
	So I think that is the answer to the hon. member's question. 
Because it is a court order in Canada by a Canadian court, the 
Government of Canada would pay it. He will note that the
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="956"> 956 </A></B>
<P>
amendment is to, I believe, the Crown Liability Act which is 
designed to allow the courts to make the orders against the 
crown.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and referred to a 
committee.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, in view of the excellent progress 
we have made and the co-operation that has been forthcoming 
on all sides of the House, I think Your Honour will find a 
disposition on the part of all members to call it four o'clock.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the disposition of the House to call 
it four o'clock?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being four o'clock p.m., this House 
stands adjourned until Monday next at eleven o'clock a.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 1.14 p.m.)
<P>
