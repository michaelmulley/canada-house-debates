the House has resumed sitting but there is one person missing from 
our Brome-Missisquoi team.
<P>
	One month ago, my assistant Stéphan Brodeur died of cardiac 
arrest. He was 32 years old. He was working in my riding but was 
supposed to move to our Ottawa office in September. A tireless 
worker, party man and team player who was always cheerful, 
Stéphan left us much too soon.
<P>
	I join with the whole Brome-Missisquoi team, his family and 
friends and Benoît Corbeil in paying him the posthumous tribute he 
deserves.

served so well, I wish to pay homage to you, Stéphan.

Governor General's Performing Arts Awards.
<P>
	Among those honoured for their contribution to Canadian and 
Quebec culture were songwriter Luc Plamondon, folk singer and

<P>
	The remarkable career of each of these winners shows not only 
their huge talent but also the extraordinary creativity that drives our 
performers.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois commends in particular Mr. Plamondon's 
decision to donate his prize money to a bursary for young artists 
who want to write musical comedies or improve their skills in this 
area.

Speaker, winning a world championship is an amazing feat. 
Winning two in a row is unprecedented, but that is what Burnaby's 
Simon Fraser University Pipe Band did recently at the elite world 
competition in Glasgow, Scotland.
<P>
	I ask that all members of this House join with me in 
congratulating each of the band members for their outstanding 
achievement and first class representation of Canada, with special 
mention to 13-year old Arran Campbell, the youngest musician 
ever to compete at the world's.

<P>
UN's review of the  new agenda for Africa, a UN program that past 
Canadian governments played an instrumental role in establishing.
<P>
	At the same time that they are distancing themselves from the 
UN action, the Liberals have decided to take a leading role instead 
in the Global Coalition for Africa, a private, undemocratic, 
unaccountable, American dominated organization linked to the 
World Bank's structural adjustment program and the global 
corporate agenda, both of which are at the root of so many of 
Africa's problems.
<P>
	So much for the Liberal rhetoric on the UN. They love to parade 
the UN when it declares Canada to have the highest standard of 
living in the world, but sit on their hands when the UN tries to do 
something for those in sub-saharan Africa who have the lowest 
standard of living in world.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THELATESAMUELVICTORRAILTON">THE LATE SAMUEL VICTOR RAILTON</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay 
tribute to one of my predecessors, Dr. Samuel Victor Railton, 
Liberal member of Parliament for the riding of Welland who 
passed away this summer on July 23 in his 91st year. I was 
privileged to know Vic and his first wife Ruth and their family.
<P>
	During his seven years as a parliamentarian, Dr. Railton was 
deputy whip, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans 
Affairs and chair of the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs, 
serving with distinction in every capacity.
<P>
	Vic Railton was a member of Parliament who regularly brought 
the concerns and achievements of his Welland constituency to this 
House. His <I>Hansard</I> record shows numerous excellent 
interventions on the issues of energy policy, veterans affairs, 
industry policy, health, welfare, social security and the very 
important St. Lawrence Seaway.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	Doctor Railton's maiden address to the House of Commons was 
made during that great emotional debate on the abolition of capital 
punishment and illustrates a man with great personal convictions 
and principles. He said: ``I do not think members of Parliament 
should vote in any way except for that in which they believe-we 
must stand up for our personal principles, no matter how they may 
be received''.
<P>
	Vic Railton served his country in peace and in war as a kind 
family physician, a talented surgeon and finally, as a dedicated 
parliamentarian. Canada has benefited from this hard working 
conscientious servant to the public. All of us-

	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Timiskaming mourns today the death of one of its most 
distinguished citizens, Mr. Arnold Peters, who devoted over 20 
years of his life to public service as MP for Timiskaming. Not only 
did Arnold Peters serve the riding of Timiskaming in the House of 
Commons from 1957 to 1980, but he was first and foremost a 
grassroots politician and a people's person.
<P>
	As the present MP for Timiskaming-French River, I wish to 
express my personal appreciation for the valuable service and 
selfless dedication he provided to the citizens of Timiskaming. He 
will be sadly missed. On behalf of all the constituents of 
Timiskaming-French River and all my colleagues in the House of 
Commons, I wish to extend our deepest sympathy to his family and 
friends.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to tell this House that the Service d'entraide Basse-Ville is 
celebrating 25 years of community work in my riding.
<P>
	The record of this not for profit organization is simply 
remarkable. In 25 years, volunteers have distributed approximately 
three million pieces of clothing, cooked hundreds of thousands of 
meals, and repaired, remodelled and patched all sorts of things.
<P>
	Hundreds of organizations like this one can be found in my 
riding. This level of involvement reflects how generous the 
community is, of course, but also, and more importantly, how 
extensive the needs are.
<P>
	The government absolutely must reconsider the restrictions 
recently imposed by Human Resources Canada on socioeconomic 
organizations. Hiring personnel to support the work of volunteers 
will be extremely difficult in the future, as these organizations will 
be denied access to HRC programs because of the new criteria. 
This is yet another sign of this government's insensitivity.

and Labrador and for the lower north shore of Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4337"> 4337 </A></B>
<P>
	I welcome that announcement. A food fishery has long been an 
integral part of the Newfoundland way of life and a staple of our 
diet, which explains why we are so much smarter than you mere 
mortals.
<P>
	At the same time I applaud the minister's caution. He says it is 
going to be a limited fishery, closely monitored and that abuses will 
not be tolerated, which is exactly as it should be.
<P>
	We cannot lose sight of the overall objective here, which is the 
reopening of a commercial fishery, the economic mainstay of the 
people of coastal communities.

	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
tomorrow the Fraser Institute will be releasing a study calculating 
the cost of regulation on businesses and families in this country.
<P>
	Although we will have to wait until tomorrow for the exact 
figures, allow me to whet members' appetites. If the Liberals were 
to eliminate government red tape, every Canadian family would 
have thousands of dollars more to spend on the things they need. 
More often than not, government red tape is nothing more than a 
hidden tax.
<P>
	The choice is clear. The Liberal government will continue to 
burden us with its big government vision of the country and its tax 
and regulate policies. The Reform Party is committed to giving 
Canadians a smaller, more efficient government and to slashing 
job-killing red tape.

pleased to draw the attention of the House to the fact that last week 
Dr. Maxwell Yalden, Canada's chief human rights commissioner, 
was elected to the UN human rights committee.
<P>
	This UN committee is a select body of independent experts that 
monitors implementation of the international convention on civil 
and political rights, one of the central pillars of the international 
human rights system.
<P>
	Dr. Yalden's election in the face of strong competition reflects 
both his strong personal credentials as a candidate and international 
respect for Canada's leadership on human rights issues.
<P>
<B>(1410 )</B>
<P>
	Dr. Yalden has extensive experience in the field of human rights 
both in Canada and abroad. I believe he will make an outstanding 
contribution to the work of the UN human rights committee. The 
presence of a Canadian expert in this important body represents 
another contribution by Canada to the promotion of international  
human rights, an issue which is at the heart of Canada's foreign 
policy agenda.
<P>
	I hope that you will join me in offering Dr. Yalden 
congratulations.

Speaker, this summer I spent a lot of time talking and working with 
many of the companies and businesses in my riding of 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore. Their message was clear: Our local 
economy has shown encouraging signs of sustainable recovery and 
economic growth and we must continue to work together.
<P>
	By providing programs designed to improve infrastructure, 
support youth initiatives and enhance access to information and 
high technology, this government is assisting key sectors of the 
economy to create a climate that encourages job creation.
<P>
	My constituents are taking advantage of expanding Canadian 
exports, better training for youth, the greater emphasis being 
placed on our innovative technological expertise. These 
partnerships will not only create more jobs for the people of 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore, but will contribute to the strong economic 
growth taking place in Canada.

recipients of the 1996 Governor General's Performing Arts Award.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At the press conference where the Governor General's 
Performing Arts Awards were announced, Luc Plamondon 
commented that he looked on this award he was about to receive as 
an attempt to bring Canada's two solitudes closer together.
<P>
	Like him, we feel that bringing the French Canadian and English 
Canadian communities of this country closer together will, 
needless to say, promote the preservation and development of our 
cultural identity as Canadians.
<P>
	We share this vision of cultural development in Canada and are 
striving to promote the talents of all Canadian artists who are a 
credit to this country.

<P>
	However, since March 1996, when it was announced that Mr. 
Broadbent, the president of the Centre, would leave at the end of 
his term, on September 1, 1996, the government has not found the 
time to appoint a full time successor, preferring to give to the new 
chairperson of the board, Maureen O'Neil, the additional 
responsibility of serving as acting president for a period of three 
months. Moreover, five of the thirteen positions on the board are 
vacant, pending a government decision.
<P>

cares about the protection of human rights and democracy. What is 
the government waiting for to fill these positions?

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today marks the one-year anniversary of the Supreme 
Court decision that shot down the ban on tobacco advertising. 
Tragically it also marks the one-hundred thousandth death from 
smoking related illnesses since the 1993 election.
<P>
	Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Canada and 
kills over 42,000 people per year. This government has lowered 
cigarette taxes, allowed tobacco companies to advertise and has 
produced a 29 per cent increase in smoking rates among our youth. 
There are over 6.5 million smokers in this country. The 
government's legacy to Canadians is inaction on legislation which 
has committed thousands of children to a lifetime of addiction and 
illness.
<P>
	Taxpayers, health care workers, parents and teachers demand 
that this government institute effective measures to decrease 
tobacco consumption in Canada.

children in this country.

today over 100 Canadians from all regions and backgrounds will 
arrive in Ottawa to take part in the National Conference for Youth 
hosted by the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The conference, entitled ``Taking Responsibility in the New 
Economy: Challenges and Choices'', is about challenging 
employers, labour, educators, governments, youth serving 
organizations and youth themselves to define their roles in the new 
economy. It is also about  identifying the choices these 
stakeholders can make to improve our prospects for the future.
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	To achieve this, we have invited young people from as far away 
as Vancouver and St. John's, from Yellowknife to Ste. Julie. We 
have invited representatives from the high tech sector, agriculture, 
mining, the learning community, labour, youth service 
organizations, all working together to devise a plan of action that 
will allow all Canadians to participate fully in the new economy. It 
will allow Canada to lead the way into the 21st century.

moratorium on sovereignty, Bernard Landry said yesterday that a 
moratorium could not be imposed on the destiny of a people.
<P>
	Earlier this week, Quebec's three central labour bodies got 
together to state their position regarding the socio-economic 
summit that will take place this fall. The theme of their campaign is 
that jobs are the priority.
<P>
	It is clear that no one in Quebec, except the nostalgic and the 
power mongers of the PQ, wants to hear about these issues. The 
destiny of a people, Mr. Landry, is to be able to live, to develop and 
to prosper as a community, in the dignity that employment 
provides.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ORAL QUESTION PERIOD</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THESOMALIAINQUIRY">THE SOMALIA INQUIRY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister had some rather harsh and 
somewhat critical comments to make on the Somalia inquiry. He 
accused it of ``grilling public servants as if they were almost 
criminals''. Those are the exact words of the Prime Minister. He 
also complained of the slowness of the process, and its cost.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Can he explain why he 
has criticized the inquiry so harshly, considering that all it is doing 
is seeking to cast some light on the behaviour of the Armed Forces 
in Somalia and the role of General Boyle in the cover up?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we want to find out the truth, and that is precisely the 
reason we set up such an inquiry. We want the results as soon as 
possible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4339"> 4339 </A></B>
<P>
	Why? Because the Armed Forces and the Department of 
Defence are somewhat on hold, as long as the inquiry is still going 
on. We would like to have the inquiry's conclusions as promptly 
as possible, so we may take the appropriate remedial action.
<P>
	This commission was set up in order to determine what 
happened during the former government's involvement in the 
Somalia operation. We are most anxious to find out whether 
changes need to be made in the command process in order to avoid 
a repetition of such incidents.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is particularly surprising to hear from the Prime 
Minister's lips that the army is on hold until the results of the 
inquiry come out. There was one way to solve that: change the 
chief of defence staff, and that is what he was asked to do.
<P>
	Instead of attacking the commission, could the Prime Minister 
admit that, if its work is taking too long and is costing too much, is 
precisely the fault of the Armed Forces and their commander, 
whose exact role in the cover up is not yet clear?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are going to wait for the Commission report. Let us 
allow it to finish its work. The sooner we get the report, the better it 
will be for everyone, for we will then be able to react accordingly. 
That is what I want, that is what this House wants, and I am sure it 
is also what the Armed Forces and the Canadian public want as 
well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, is the Prime Minister not trying to discredit the 
commission with what he had to say about it yesterday?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Is he not trying to discredit the commission in order to justify 
keeping the general and the minister in their positions? Is he not 
indeed trying to discredit the commission in order to serve his own 
ends?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister has been in his portfolio for three years. 
Yesterday I indicated that I had decided very early on in this 
administration to have a minister of defence who would remain in 
his position for a long time, in order for there to be an authority in 
place capable of making decisions.
<P>
	I must apologize for saying in the House that there had been six 
ministers in nine years under the Conservatives. I was wrong, there 
were 17. Under the circumstances, I feel that the minister's job is a 
very difficult one.
<P>
	He is working under even more difficult circumstances than his 
predecessors, because we are obliged, in the interests of good 
administration and deficit reduction, to reduce defence spending, to 
reduce staff and to reduce the number of bases.
<P>
	The minister has accomplished all of those difficult tasks, and 
now he, like all the rest of us, is awaiting the commission's report, 
which we hope to see as soon as possible in order to take the 
required action.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. On a number of occasions in 
recent months, the official opposition has called for the Somalia 
commission, whose work will continue for a long while yet, to 
table an interim report after it has finished looking into the 
allegations of cover-up by top army brass.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister finds that it is taking too long, as he said 
yesterday, why does he not ask the commissioners to quickly 
produce and make public an interim report on the cover-up 
operations so that everyone, himself included, can draw the 
appropriate conclusions?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the terms of 
reference for this inquiry are well known. They are well 
established. The commission is to issue a report when it concludes 
its deliberations.
<P>
	Those are the terms of reference given to the commission and 
those are the terms of reference with which the commission is 
comfortable. I ask the hon. members to await the conclusions of the 
commissioners.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is the 
Prime Minister who thinks that it is taking too long, it is the 
government who decides on the mandate. If he wants to have 
results and be able clean things up quickly and restore the 
credibility of the armed forces, why does he not ask for an interim 
report on the cover-up operation? Why does he not act quickly?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again 
members of the opposition are prejudging testimony and coming to 
conclusions about the evidence that has been presented to the 
inquiry. That is not the way the inquiry process works and that is 
not the way Canadian justice works.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member will do everyone a favour and wait for 
the report to be issued by the commissioners so that everyone's 
testimony and all the facts can be judged in a clear cool light.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is amazing what can come out through the old process 
of word association.
<P>
	Yesterday I asked the Prime Minister about cover up at the 
Somalia inquiry and for some reason he started talking 
immediately about the Watergate affair in the United States, a 
Freudian slip. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4340"> 4340 </A></B>
<P>
You may wish to check  whether the tapes of yesterday's question 
period were erased. Surely the Prime Minister did not mean that the 
tampering and political interference at the Somalia inquiry had 
reached Watergate proportions.
<P>
	What precisely was the Prime Minister trying to say when he 
drew some parallel between his handling of the Somalia inquiry 
and the Watergate affair?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I guess the leader of the third party needs a new speech 
writer.
<P>
	I said earlier in French that we instituted the commission 
because we wanted to get to the bottom of the Somalia affair and 
receive recommendations so that we can change what has to be 
changed. When we were in opposition we did ask for a commission 
like that. We established that commission and we would like to 
have the report as quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	The leader of the third party yesterday asked if we wanted to 
have the report before the election. I would be delighted to have the 
report tomorrow so we could act. We are not trying to cover up 
anything. We instituted the inquiry and we want the result in the 
shortest term possible so that we can have a report.
<P>
	To please the party of the Leader of the Opposition, who wanted 
to have it before the election, I do not know when I will have an 
election. If I were him I would not hope for a quick election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister's comments on the Somalia inquiry 
have been contradictory and confusing and they are again today.
<P>
	Yesterday the Prime Minister told the House he did not meet 
General Boyle until he appointed him chief of the defence staff. Yet 
his communications director told the <I>Globe and Mail</I> that the 
Prime Minister actually conducted the job interview.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, Monday the Prime Minister said the 
Somalia inquiry would be allowed to do its work without political 
interference. Yesterday, however, the Prime Minister took a shot at 
the inquiry by saying it was too slow, too expensive and too hard on 
witnesses.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister explain these contradictions? Did the 
Prime Minister not know who General Boyle was until he was 
appointed or did he conduct the job interview? Is the inquiry 
independent or is the government telling it through the Prime 
Minister that it is too slow, too expensive and too hard on 
witnesses?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course I knew of Mr. Boyle because I had studied the 
files of many candidates and I had some recommendations. But I 
did not know him personally.
<P>
	When he came I interviewed him, but I knew a lot about him and 
it was rather good. But I had not met him. Sometimes we know a 
lot about candidates in many fields without meeting them. I do that 
regularly in appointments. Because we receive recommendations 
and we name somebody, that does not mean that we had a beer with 
the guy the day before. That means that we looked at his cv, the 
recommendation, the abilities and we made a decision.
<P>
	After I met General Boyle-he was on a short list-and I knew 
at that moment that he could fill the bill. Let him do his job. When 
the inquiry is done we will have the results. The sooner the better 
because yesterday the leader of the third party was afraid that the 
report would come after the election, so he should ask them to do it 
as fast as possible to have it before the election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister's handling of the Somalia inquiry and 
Somalia affair is symptomatic of the government's management of 
a lot of other things.
<P>
	National defence is a $10 billion department. Its work is vital to 
the national interest. Its international peacekeeping is a source of 
pride for all Canadians, yet for three years under this government 
its affairs have been mismanaged and its reputation has been 
allowed to deteriorate with no end in sight.
<P>
	Do not the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces and 
the Canadian public deserve something better?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, they really deserve the support of the third party for the 
very good job they are doing today in the former Yugoslavia, the 
job they are doing today in Haiti and in other places in the world. 
They are doing a good job.
<P>
	It is because I have a lot of respect for them that I decided it was 
not to be a revolving door for the political leadership of that 
department. I gave them an experienced politician and a good 
administrator to do the job, to stay there and do what is needed to 
have the most modern armed force available that is possible at this 
moment.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Youth unemployment has reached disastrous proportions. If we 
consider both those who are  unemployed and those who left the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4341"> 4341 </A></B>
<P>
labour market, many because they were discouraged, today at least 
479,000 young people in Canada between the ages of 15 and 24 are 
unemployed.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister say he is satisfied with his 
performance on creating jobs when he knows perfectly well only 
one out of two young people has a job?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, no one will ever be satisfied 
with the situation of the unemployed in this country, whether we 
are talking about the young or not so young, as long as anyone 
remains unemployed.
<P>
	The hon. member surely recognizes the efforts deployed, not 
only by the Government of Canada but by other levels of 
government and the private sector. This summer, for instance, 
about 60,000 young people across the country were hired thanks to 
the efforts of the Government of Canada. Furthermore, and I think 
this is worthy of mention, when we consider the efforts deployed 
by the private sector in partnership with governments and youth 
organizations, I think we will realize that although this is a major 
challenge, some progress has already been made, and even young 
people have admitted as much.
<P>
	Of course, much remains to be done, but we are not the only 
country where youth unemployment is a major problem.
<P>
	In fact, the hon. member is probably aware that this week here in 
Ottawa, we organized a conference on all aspects of the problems 
facing young people in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
there are 25,000 fewer young people employed than when this 
government came to power, and meanwhile the number of young 
people has increased.
<P>
	What kind of hope can the Prime Minister give hundreds of 
thousands of unemployed young Canadians and Quebecers, when it 
is a fact that he himself excluded funds targeted to young people 
from negotiations on manpower policy transfers to the provincial 
governments which, as he himself has admitted, work more 
efficiently, preferring to spread funding around his government's 
employment programs for purely political purposes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, if we seriously want to help 
young Quebecers and young Canadians across the country to find 
jobs, we must create a climate of stability within our economy.
<P>
	If anyone is aware of the problems facing young people in the 
Montreal region, for instance, where we know the unemployment 
rate is very high, it is certainly the hon. member opposite. But we 
must all be aware of our responsibilities. If we want the private 
sector to play its role, which should always be to create jobs, we 
should  provide the right kind of economic climate, and we should 
listen to young people like Mario Dumont, who know what has to 
be done in this country.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Minister of National Defence talked 
about fairness. Let us explore that today.
<P>
	Colonel Haswell has been charged. Corporal Purnelle has been 
charged. However, General Boyle receives preferential treatment 
after admitting that he lied to military police and that he broke the 
spirit of the Access to Information Act. Canadians are saying quite 
clearly that he should be fired.
<P>
	General Boyle has admitted responsibility. Why will the 
minister not hold him accountable?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, not only has the 
hon. member and his colleagues shown contempt for the inquiry by 
continually reflecting on evidence at the commission, but today he 
goes further. He is reflecting on the military justice system. He is 
bringing forward the names of individuals who are now subject to 
certain processes within the department and within the armed 
forces. He is using their names and bringing them to the floor of the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	This is something that must not be done. I am surprised at that. 
The hon. member, as a former employee of the armed forces, 
should know better than to do that in a public way. It shows 
contempt of the entire judicial process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the only contempt is shown by the hon. Minister of 
National Defence.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the minister uses the shield of the 
Somalia inquiry when it is convenient to the minister. In other 
words, to protect his own sorry butt.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Our armed forces personnel-
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sure the House is used to colloquial 
statements, however, I wish we could stay away from the human 
anatomy in question period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry. I would like to continue.
<P>
	Our armed forces personnel know what it means to accept 
responsibility. It means that you are held accountable. Yesterday 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4342"> 4342 </A></B>
<P>
the Prime Minister referred to the  Watergate incident. In Watergate 
people were fired, people were charged and people resigned.
<P>
	When will the Prime Minister fire the Minister of National 
Defence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member must get his jokes from the same barber his leader uses.
<P>
	We have here a group of people in opposition who congratulated 
the government when it established the inquiry. They do not want 
to do the decent thing and wait for the inquiry to do its work, to 
report and then make judgments.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GOVERNMENTCONTRACTS">GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. On Monday, the Prime Minister 
used the government's practice of tendering contracts to justify the 
fact that Quebec was not getting its fair share of federal spending 
on goods and services. I will remind him that a $2 billion contract 
for the manufacture of armoured vehicles was awarded in Ontario 
without any call for tenders.
<P>
	In light of what he said on Monday, how can the Prime Minister 
justify his defence minister's decision not to require GM, of 
London, Ontario, to call for tenders from subcontractors, knowing 
that Oerlikon, of Saint-Jean, Quebec, could then have put in a bid?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as members 
know, about a year ago we announced one of the purchases which 
was outlined in the white paper for armoured personnel carriers. 
This was a solely directed contract to General Motors Diesel 
Division in London, Ontario. Negotiations are taking place right 
now between the government and General Motors under the 
auspices of my colleague the minister for government services.
<P>
	There has been some concern about the nature of the work and 
how much of it will be done in Canada. A question has arisen with 
respect to the capability of a company in Quebec. Because of the 
concerns that the government and General Motors had, those 
matters were referred to an independent third party who has made a 
report.
<P>
	The negotiations are between General Motors and the 
government. This is a commercial, contractual relationship which I 
am sure will stand great scrutiny.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister tells us that an independent consulting firm was indeed 
hired to provide an independent opinion. The firm he is referring to 
is KPMG. The minister is not even through reviewing KPMG's 
report but he is already announcing that GM will be the sole 
contractor. It is clear that the report was only commissioned to buy 
some time.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that, by stubbornly refusing to 
let the construction of the turrets be put to tender, he is actually 
depriving Quebec of another contract, worth more than $600 
million, resulting in approximately 145 quality jobs being lost to 
Delco, in California.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry. I did 
not quite catch the name of the company to which the member is 
referring. Is he still referring to the armoured personnel contract or 
is he referring to the search and rescue helicopter contract?
<P>
	One thing the hon. member and his colleagues in opposition 
conveniently forget is that much of the industry of Canada's 
military infrastructure is located in Quebec. The proportion of 
work that goes to the industries in Quebec is actually higher than 
the percentage of population of Quebec versus the nation as a 
whole.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	While it may be true that in certain contracts work is not of a 
proportion that is acceptable to the hon. member, when we look at 
all of it, at the work that goes to Bombardier, to Marconi, to 
Oerlikon, Quebec does very well.

spent more than 36 years in the Royal Canadian Air Force and the 
Canadian Armed Forces. I worked for many commanders and I 
commanded a flight, a squadron, a school, and a base, so I know 
something of leadership.
<P>
	In fact, I commanded the Canadian Forces Officers Candidate 
School whose duty it was to determine the potential leadership

<P>
	Why can the Prime Minister not see this, recognize it and take 
action by removing the Minister of National Defence and the chief 
of the defence staff?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have great 
respect for the hon. member. He had a distinguished career in the 
armed forces. However, even he has to acknowledge-he has been 
a member of the defence committee, he participated in the 
deliberations that led up to the white paper, he knows despite what 
he said today-that we have revitalized the leadership of the 
forces; that we have re-engineered the department, that we are 
saving money; that we are bringing business methods into play to 
save the taxpayers' money.
<P>
	The leadership we are bringing forward now is a new generation 
that reflects the norms and values of Canadian society today. I am 
sorry the hon. member is uncomfortable with that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the minister said that if generals in the service did not 
like what was going on, they were free to leave.
<P>
	It appears that those who espouse the values of truth, duty and 
valour are to get out, while those who say ``mea culpa but I'm not 
responsible'' are not only retained but protected.
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister not take action to put the 
leadership that is required back in the Canadian Armed Forces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it is 
leadership to deal with a department that over the years of the cold 
war unfortunately had developed administrative practices that 
needed to be streamlined, that had an officer corps that became too 
large for its needs.
<P>
	We all agree on these things. I have heard the hon. member say 
them at committee.
<P>
	We have shown leadership in setting up the inquiry to deal with 
the very unfortunate events that happened in Somalia. We will 
continue to show leadership. In fact the chief of the defence staff 
today outlined his vision of leadership for the 21st century for the 
forces.
<P>
	I have met with many of the senior leaders of the forces in the 
last number of weeks. Despite the problems that are really 
wrenching at the very heart of the armed forces, they see light at the 
end of the tunnel. They see that improvements have been made so 
that they can meet the challenges of the years ahead.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at a press conference yesterday, the Minister of Justice 
announced his intention to amend the Criminal Code to keep 
dangerous offenders in prison longer and keep a closer eye on them 
after their release. This is quite normal for those who have already 
been found guilty of a crime.
<P>
	However, and this is my question to the minister: Does the 
minister confirm that, under his proposal, an individual who has 
been acquitted of or has never even been tried for a crime could 
still be ordered by the court to submit to supervision by police or 
correctional authorities and even to wear an electronic monitoring 
device?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, punishment in the criminal law and 
certainly in the Criminal Code is reserved for those who have been 
convicted of crime, and that has remained the same both before and 
after the bill I tabled yesterday.
<P>
	The hon. member will see in the bill that we have added a section 
which builds on the jurisdiction already in the code in section 
810.1. That provides the court with jurisdiction on the application 
of a provincial attorney general to order that anyone, where there is 
a reasonable basis to fear that he or she may commit a very serious 
indictable offence, may be restrained by court order in a manner 
consistent with public safety.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	Just that sort of jurisdiction was confirmed as constitutional and 
valid in a judgment of the Ontario courts last year. We are building 
on that to make the streets safer and above all to fulfil our red book 
commitment from 1993 to bring in solid and meaningful legislation 
to deal with high risk offenders.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister did not answer my question. But, since he is 
talking about this provision, can he assure the House that this 
provision does not violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, since at first sight it seems to fly in the face of one of 
our basic legal principles, namely the presumption of innocence?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I respect the hon. member's 
commitment to the charter of rights and to individual freedoms.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4344"> 4344 </A></B>
<P>
	I urge him to look carefully at the provisions of the legislation 
we tabled yesterday. I have every confidence that every part of 
that bill is completely consistent with the charter. In fact, I so 
certified it before I tabled the legislation.
<P>
	The measures to deal with high risk offenders invest the 
sentencing judge with authority to impose conditions as part of the 
sentence which is a regular orthodox exercise of the criminal law 
power. The other provisions have to do with preventing crime. That 
is at the heart of this legislation. We are taking steps to prevent 
crime before it happens by identifying those who are at the highest 
risk of reoffending and giving the courts and the system power to 
intervene, to impose conditions and supervision to keep our 
families, our children and our communities safe. That is what this 
legislation is about.

	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Nunatsiaq, Lib.):</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, in August the minister announced that this fall 
Canada was to launch a much awaited new initiative, the Arctic 
Council, which comprises eight circumpolar countries.
<P>
	Given the leadership role of Canada in this important initiative 
for Canada's northern population and for all of Canada, can the 
minister inform this House when he will act to establish this very 
important vehicle for co-operation on the environment, economic 
and other critical issues facing the circumpolar north?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to confirm that tomorrow Canada will play 
host to the inaugural meeting of the Arctic Council. In so doing, I 
want to pay tribute to the work of the hon. member and the 
Secretary of State for Youth and Training, Ambassador Simon and 
many other Canadians, particularly northern Canadians and the 
representatives, both government and non-government, of the other 
countries who have worked together over the past two years to 
bring together a brand new international organization to deal with 
the issues of the people of the north.
<P>
	In particular, I would like to point out that perhaps for the first 
time in the history of international organizations, leaders of the 
governments, ministers of the respective governments, will be 
sitting down in full partnership with the indigenous people of the 
north so that they can work together to solve the problems of 
environment, trade and industry. It is an example we hope will 
provide an important lesson for the development of international 
organizations in the years ahead.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 13 
years of Liberal-Tory rule, we find that federal taxes in Canada 
have gone up $4,000 per taxpayer.
<P>
	Despite the fact that the Liberal government promised twice in 
the last few years that it would get rid of the GST on books in this 
country, we find that the finance minister now says that he cannot 
afford to do it. Frankly, Canadians cannot afford this finance 
minister.
<P>
	Can the finance minister tell Canadians why he has $159 million 
to fund flags, propaganda and movies through the Department of 
Canadian Heritage while he reneges on yet another promise and 
doubles the GST on reading in Atlantic Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
our position on the tax on books today is exactly what I expressed 
yesterday. The member is one day behind the NDP, maybe 20 years 
behind the NDP.
<P>
	The fact is that the removal of the tax on books would cost $140 
million. The decision that has to be taken is, is that the best use of 
$140 million or in fact are there other uses to which that money 
should be put. At the same time, given that those who wish to 
remove the tax on books are people who basically want to promote 
literacy, a view that all of us in this House share, then the debate we 
have to have is whether that in fact is the best way to promote 
literacy. Under those circumstances we are certainly open to 
examining the possibilities.
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
question is: What is the Prime Minister's word worth? He promised 
in writing to the Don't Tax Reading Coalition that he would remove 
the GST on books.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister appears before his bank machine, how 
does he rationalize this latest Liberal cop out?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps I should tell you what the real issue is. The real issue is 
whether the government's revenues are going to increase. Because 
of increased economic activity they are in fact doing so.
<P>
	The issue is what did the new government do after it took over 
from a previous government that increased taxes 39 times? I will 
tell you, Mr. Speaker, that we did not in our first, second or third 
budget, not once did we increase personal income taxes. That is our 
view.
<P>
	Why is it that the Reform Party, which has so much difficulty 
talking about increases in government revenues, in its first budget 
suggestion talks about increasing government revenues by over 
$26 billion?

	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of International Trade.
<P>
	Today we learned, once again through the media, that 
negotiations on free trade between Canada and Chile have reached 
an impasse, after nine months of talks.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us if the cancellation of the visit that the 
Chilean president, Mr. Frei, was scheduled to make in early 
October is somehow related to the deadlock in the negotiations on a 
free trade agreement between Canada and Chile?
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member will be pleased to know that 
the negotiations with Chile have not reached an impasse. The eight 
series of negotiations were completed last weekend and the parties 
have gone off for further consultations.
<P>
	I am hopeful that we can bring the negotiations to a very quick 
conclusion and bring about this agreement in the near future. In 
fact, they have been going at a very strong pace. In the case of 
Mexico it took us some 16 months and in the case of Israel almost 
two years to get to the point of signing an agreement. Yet in nine 
short months we have come a long way and there are but very few 
issues for us to resolve.
<P>
	When that is done I would expect that the postponed visit of 
President Frei will be put on again. I know that President Frei is 
looking forward to coming to Canada and looking forward to a free 
trade agreement that will help give Canadian companies access to 
the market in Chile.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister refers to previous agreements. Canada recently signed a 
free trade agreement with Israel. This agreement was signed in 
secret. The same thing is happening again with Chile.
<P>
	Could the minister at least pledge greater transparency before 
signing a free trade agreement with Chile or with any other 
country?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the agreement with Israel will be brought 
before this House and there will be every opportunity to consider 
every aspect of it in a very short period of time, as there will in the 
case of the agreement with Chile. Both of those agreements will 
help to increase our exports and our opportunity for market access.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when you are flying in a plane at 30,000 feet and the 
engine fails, passengers on board a Canadian airline will find little 
comfort in the fact that the minister's department examined the 
paperwork, not the actual aircraft, when issuing a certificate of air 
worthiness.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Transport guarantee the safety of the 
Canadian public when his department inspects paperwork instead 
of inspecting aeroplanes?
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the safety audit that identified the 
two deficiencies is part of established procedures that are going on 
and are well understood within the entire airline industry.
<P>
	We expect that all airlines will meet the highest safety standards 
and it is our job to ensure that they do. Until such time as that 
happens and the concerns of the minister are met, the minister is 
not prepared to risk the safety of the travelling public.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the parliamentary secretary offers words of reassurance 
but those words do not square with the facts. The facts are that 
when any airline's planes take off in Canada for the first time, they 
have not been inspected by Transport Canada. It only inspects the 
airline's paperwork.
<P>
	I again ask the parliamentary secretary: How can he guarantee 
the safety of the Canadian public when his department only 
inspects the paperwork, not the plane?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member refuses to accept 
the fact that there are procedures in place where the paperwork 
entails that the maintenance individuals in charge of that aircraft 
are the ones responsible to ensure the safety of that aircraft.
<P>
	In the case of WestJet of which he is speaking, it is a responsible 
airline. WestJet is working diligently to meet all of the 
requirements that are being put down by the Minister of Transport. 
Unfortunately yes, the travelling public were a bit inconvenienced 
in their flight plans, but the majority of WestJet passengers I am 
sure would agree that it is better to deal with any deficiencies in the 
aircraft on the ground and not at 40,000 feet.

<P>
	The United States is currently taxing Canadian seniors on social

less than subsistence income and would not be taxed if this income

<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member has shown a great deal of concern for the plight of 
a considerable number of low income Canadians who have been 
affected by this move taken by the United States.
<P>
	Indeed members within our own party and members on both 
sides of the House have expressed the same concern. The member 
is absolutely right. There are a considerable number of low income 
Canadians who have suddenly found themselves without any 
possibility of adjustment, without any possibility of appeal and are 
in a very serious financial condition as a result of this action taken 
by the U.S. administration.

minister is now making every effort to get the aboriginals and the

reach an agreement in order to resolve this dispute, which leaves

Heritage. It concerns the continuing cuts to the CBC.
<P>
	Despite promises made in the Liberal red book during the last 
election, the government is proceeding with a further cut of some 
$190 million to the CBC budget. This will result in a 35 to 40 per 
cent reduction in both TV and radio services and a loss of some 
2,500 jobs.
<P>

parliamentary mandate as a public broadcaster with these massive 
cuts to its budget?

<P>

<B><A NAME="4347"> 4347 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the cuts that were 
announced in last February's budget were $123 million, not the 
figure quoted by the member.
<P>
	Unfortunately those cuts were announced on top of the previous 
cuts which total a very difficult circumstance for the CBC. The 
total package of cuts will result in reductions of about 23 per cent.
<P>
	Over the last three years one of the things we have had to do as a 
government is to cut very significantly. We have had to let 40,000 
people go across the public service. We have had to cut in 
ministries and we have had to cut across departments.
<P>
	The CBC management and board have been working very hard 
to ensure that in the face of very difficult circumstances they can 
continue to occupy a very unique niche in the marketplace.
<P>
	Unlike certain members of the opposition who are calling for the 
privatization of the CBC, I believe that the CBC has a very 
important public role to play. We are still investing almost a billion 
dollars of taxpayers' money in the CBC.

prominent in the news these days and its adverse effect on 
Canadian business, and as Canada opposes the Helms-Burton bill, 
does this mean that we are soft on Cuba? Does it mean that we 
endorse the Castro administration?

efforts to bring about a more open and democratic system in Cuba, 
to bring about economic reforms and respect for human rights.

	Unlike the United States, we have preferred a policy of 
engagement, as opposed to isolation, which quite frankly has not 
worked in the 30 years it has been in place.

	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to present to the House 
two petitions signed by residents of York North.
<P>
	The first petition is about the Helms-Burton law. The petitioners 
draw to the attention of the House that the Cuban liberty and 
democratic solidarity act attempts to impose American domestic 
policy on other sovereign countries and, therefore, violates 
international law.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	The petitioners further draw to the attention of the House that 
Canadians' interests, rights and businesses must be defended with 
strength and vigour.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore call upon Parliament to pursue all 
avenues available to ensure the rights of Canadians are protected.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SMALLBUSINESS">SMALL BUSINESS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition draws to the attention of the House the important 
role small businesses play in our economy. The petitioners call 
upon Parliament to continue to create a healthy environment for 
small businesses to ensure they have access to the financing they 
need and to help them explore and capitalize on new opportunities.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have the honour to present a petition signed by many Manitobans. 
They are concerned that the Liberal government is on the verge of 
drastically reducing coast guard services on the major lakes in 
Manitoba, with Lake Winnipeg being the 10th largest lake in the 
world. They are concerned this reduction plan includes 
decommissioning the <I>Namao</I> and <I>Avocet</I>, the only two coast guard 
ships on the lake.
<P>
	They call on Parliament to direct the Government of Canada, 
especially the Ministers of Transport and Fisheries and Oceans, to 
reaffirm the preservation and maintenance of coast guard services 
on the lakes in the province of Manitoba so as to ensure that public 
safety and protection will remain a top priority.

Speaker, I am pleased and honoured to rise today to draw the 
attention of the House on behalf of many of the constituents in my 
own riding and around the lower mainland to the following: That, 
Canadian law does not prohibit convicted criminals from profiting 
financially by writing books, setting up 1-900 lines, producing 
videos.
<P>
	The petitioners pray that Parliament enact Bill C-205, introduced 
by the hon. member for Scarborough West, at the earliest 
opportunity so as to provide in Canadian law that no criminal 
profits from committing a crime.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a petition on the Young Offenders Act that is signed by 440 
constituents in my area.
<P>
	This is based on an incident where two young alleged thieves 
were caught breaking into cars in a parking lot. They tried to run 
down a witness. They did not conceal their names from the police. 
They were quite free to give them because they knew they could 
not be prosecuted because of their ages. Because of this, the 
petitioners request that the Young Offenders Act either be 
abolished or revised so that the rights of ordinary citizens come 
ahead of the rights of young offenders of this sort.

villages of O'Leary, Bloomfield, Ellerslie and Alberton.
<P>
	These 60 petitioners are very concerned with the inadequacies of 
the sentencing practices concerning individuals convicted of 
impaired driving charges. They are also concerned that Canada 
must embrace a philosophy of zero tolerance toward individuals 
who drive while impaired by alcohol or drugs.

	These petitioners would like that very serious consideration be 
given to the bill that is coming up shortly for a vote.

	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to present a petition from my constituents which draws

inadequacies in the sentencing practices concerning individuals 
convicted of impaired driving charges; and that Canada must 
embrace a philosophy of zero tolerance toward individuals who 
drive while impaired by alcohol or drugs.
<P>
	Therefore, the petitioners pray and request that Parliament 
proceed immediately with amendments to the Criminal Code that 
will ensure that the sentence given to anyone convicted of driving 
while impaired or causing injury or death while impaired does 
reflect both the severity of the crime and zero tolerance by Canada 
toward this crime.

pursuant to Standing Order 36, I too would like to table a petition 
with several hundred names on it, most of them  from the 
constituency of Beaver River but some from Edmonton and 
perhaps Edmonton Southeast and other cities.
<P>
	Resulting from a murder this spring in the town of Bonnyville, 
these people are very concerned that there be stricter penalties for 
young offenders who commit crimes causing bodily harm or death. 
These individuals should be held in custody pending their court 
hearing. Young offenders 16 years and older who take the law into 
their own hands and cause death should be charged and treated as 
adults and tried in adult court without the consent of judges.

Speaker, the second petition signed by 47 petitioners asks and prays 
that we conduct a full public inquiry into the relationship between 
lending institutions and the judiciary and to enact legislation 
restricting the appointment of judges with ties to credit granting 
institutions. The idea is that there is some sort of collusion between 
the judiciary and credit granting institutions which has resulted in 
the fact that credit granting institutions are never ever taken to task.

the Canadian Association of Retired Persons. The petitioners bring 
to the attention of this House and request that Parliament take the 
necessary measures to ensure that Canadian citizens who are

government House leader when I can expect an answer to my 
question on the order paper No. Q-4.
<P>
	A little bit of history is in order here. The question was first 
placed on notice on February 27, 1996 and I requested an answer 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4352"> 4352 </A></B>
<P>
from the government within 45 days. As of today, 204 days have 
passed. This same  question was on the order paper for 71 days 
before the government prorogued the House in the last session. 
This has become a very serious matter. It is a total of 275 days that 
the government has had to prepare a response.
<P>
	The answer to this question is a matter of public safety, 
specifically regarding the unsafe storage and theft of firearms from 
police and military armouries.
<P>
	On May 29, 1996 the parliamentary secretary to the government 
House leader responded to my previous point of order saying we 
could expect him to provide us with the information very soon. Mr. 
Speaker, 104 days have passed since the parliamentary secretary 
promised the information very soon. This is now bordering on the 
absurd. My question is: How long do my constituents and I still 
have to wait?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of </B><B>the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
hon. friend is right. There has not been an answer yet to his 
question.
<P>
	I think he would recognize that the question which was asked 
was one that required some detailed information from a wide 
variety of sources. I am sorry to say that we do not have the 
question available. We will have it as soon as it is available. I am 
sure he would realize that the very scarce resources available in the 
departments for these kinds of matters involving very specific 
questions, which is what in fact has been raised by my colleague, 
just do not make it possible to make the information as 
forthcoming as he would like it to be. In order to make it accurate, 
we are doing the very best we can.

the best answer I can offer my colleague.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Vote 1, in the amount of $40,713,000 under Parliament-Senate-Program

	He said: Mr. Speaker, this is a very important day. Today this 
House will consider the motion to concur in the main estimates for 
the current fiscal year.
<P>
	Under the Constitution, as members know, Parliament must 
approve all spending from the government's consolidated revenue 
fund. Today, we, as members of the House of Commons of Canada, 
are continuing this honourable tradition as we debate the main 
estimates for 1996-97.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4353"> 4353 </A></B>
<P>
	We also have before us at least two motions to oppose specific 
items contained within these estimates. Consequently, the 
government has on the table a similar number of motions to 
reinstate opposed items.
<P>
	Since the main estimates were presented on March 8, 1996, 
members have had opportunities to present their views and 
concerns to the standing committees of the House. Today all parties 
have an opportunity to participate in the final review of these 
estimates.
<P>
	Some members will recall the frustration that all parties 
expressed in the House when the full supply debate took place last 
year. This frustration resulted in all-party support for the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to undertake a 
comprehensive review of the business of supply.
<P>
	In support of the work of committee members, I have made 
improved reporting to Parliament a priority for the Treasury Board 
Secretariat. We have initiated the improved reporting to Parliament 
project, or IRPP, so that we can work more closely with the 
committee and other parliamentarians.
<P>
	We are proposing changes to split the information now provided 
in part III of the estimates into two distinct documents: a 
departmental expenditure plan which will deal with the proposed 
expenditures for the next three years and be tabled in the spring and 
a fall performance report which will account to Parliament on what 
has been achieved.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Why are we doing this Mr. Speaker? There are two overarching 
reasons. First, this government promised in the red book that it 
would restore public confidence in government institutions and, 
specifically, in the role played by Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Without the right information at the right time, Parliament 
cannot perform its proper function. Second, this government 
believes that to get government right, we must engage Parliament 
in a meaningful discussion of government priorities, plans and 
performance. The government realizes that it is not just cabinet 
ministers and bureaucrats who may shape the future of Canada.
<P>
	Before I outline our plans and proposals for improving such 
information, I would like to describe how we have arrived at this 
point. The process we followed reflects the care we have taken to 
ensure that these proposals truly represent the needs of 
parliamentarians and other users. Before we developed our 
proposals, six departments and agencies presented their Part III 
documents in a new format.
<P>
	These documents were tabled in the House in March of this year 
as part of a pilot project. An evaluation of the pilot documents 
showed broad support for replacing Part III with separate planning 
and performance  information documents to be tabled at different 
times of the year.
<P>
	Extensive consultations with nine House standing committees, 
the Senate Finance Committee, academics, the media, the auditor 
general and others confirmed support for this approach. I would 
like to thank the hon. member for St. Boniface for his continuing 
efforts to bring about changes to the way the House reviews 
estimates.
<P>
	As a result of these consultations, the procedure and house 
affairs committee recommended that 16 departments and agencies 
table performance reports this fall as a pilot project. The report 
containing this recommendation was unanimously adopted. The 
pilot performance reports will provide Parliament with succinct, 
meaningful, results-oriented information in the fall, when 
Parliament can consider that information more fully.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These performance reports will allow parliamentarians to focus 
on the results expected from government programs and the results 
those programs actually achieved. This focus should in turn lead to 
more meaningful parliamentary discussion of longer term 
government plans and priorities. The pilot performance reports will 
be tabled in October in conjunction with my report on improving 
results measurement and accountability.
<P>
	The 16 companion expenditure planning documents 
incorporating the Outlook document will be tabled as part of the 
estimates project in the spring. Departments not participating in 
this round of pilots will be able to improve their spring 1997 part 
III documents by incorporating many of the improvements tested 
last spring. The 16 pilot departments will also table in year update 
reports which will alert Parliament to significant changes in 
planned expenditures or program delivery.
<P>
	The IRPP is working with departments and the House to improve 
electronic distribution of pilot documents which may include using 
the Internet. If an evaluation of the 16 fall performance reports is 
positive, the government may ask Parliament to require the tabling 
of separate spring planning and fall performance reports for all 
departments and agencies to begin in the following year.
<P>
	If the House adopts these changes, I am optimistic that they will 
help the committee deal with the remaining part of its mandate 
which is improving the processes by which the House and its 
committees consider and dispose of the estimates.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am confident that our efforts to improve the quality of 
expenditure and performance information will make  Parliamenta-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4354"> 4354 </A></B>
<P>
ry debate more meaningful. This will be, I hope at least, another 
important contribution to a more accountable government.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we are not yet at the point of changing our 
procedures for supply. Today, we must follow the usual process. 
But before this House addresses the opposed item before us, I 
would like to provide the overall context for the 1996-97 main 
estimates.
<P>
	The main estimates represent the results of a number of 
initiatives by this government designed to put Canada on the right 
track-to reduce the budget deficit and to more clearly define the 
role of the Government of Canada. When I tabled the estimates in 
March, I described the process of program Review, which has 
contributed so strongly to ``getting government right.'' I also 
stressed that ``getting government right'' means modernizing 
federal programs and services to meet the needs of Canadians, as 
citizens and clients, today and in the future.
<P>
	The steps we have taken recognize that the effects of 
globalization and technological change, fiscal pressures, and the 
evolution of Canadian society require us to simplify and 
streamline. These days, it is fashionable to talk about fiscal 
responsibility and the need to reduce spending at all levels of 
government. While it is not difficult simply to cut spending without 
regard for the consequences, it requires great care to meet 
necessary fiscal targets while ensuring that government policy 
supports the priorities of Canadian society.
<P>
	In asking the House to concur in the appropriation bill, I would 
like to remind members that the Estimates we are considering 
today reflect the care taken to reduce spending and, at the same 
time, to target that spending on what is most important. For 
example, we have reduced direct support to industry in favour of 
policies that will stimulate growth and jobs. We have reduced costs 
by transferring the air navigation System and airports to 
not-for-profit corporations. We have taken steps to reduce 
subsidies to Canada Post and to Via Rail. We have reduced defence 
spending by $200 million in 1997-98 and by another $600 million 
in 1998-99. These are just a few examples of the actions we have 
taken to meet our fiscal responsibilities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
The impact of these changes is significant. In 1994-95 program 
review yielded savings of $3.9 billion which will grow to $7.2 
billion annually by 1997-98. The 1996 budget announced further 
annual savings of $2 billion for 1998-99.
<P>
	This year's main estimates call for $157 billion in planned 
budgetary expenditures compared to $164 billion last year.
<P>
	I believe that the record shows that we are succeeding in meeting 
our goals but we cannot rest on these achievements. Getting 
government right is an ongoing process. We will continue to use 
the principles of program review to seek further opportunities to 
improve.
<P>
	In closing, I ask members of the House to support our request for 
full supply. These estimates reflect appropriate action to meet our 
fiscal targets while establishing a role for the government that is 
right for the times.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to know whether we are at 
questions and comments on the speech of the President of the 
Treasury Board.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member. He is quite 
right. I forgot all about this during the summer. It is now time for 
questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the President of the Treasury Board. 
What he said raises many questions.
<P>
	Apparently the government has established a system to control 
expenditures and to improve budgetary preparations and 
consultations, and is well on its way to providing satisfactory 
program evaluation. The newspapers, however, are still full of 
examples of poor expenditure control, and I would like to quote a 
few.
<P>
	For instance, millions of dollars are lost annually because the 
system for issuing paycheques at the Department of National 
Defence does not work properly. Will the situation be remedied this 
year? Will the controls that have been put in place be able to correct 
this situation?
<P>
	The other point I would like to make is that in many 
departments, especially at the senior executive level, the same 
structures still exist that were there before the government started 
reducing subsidies to industry.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board mentioned the fact that 
these subsidies had been reduced, and industry, provided everyone 
is treated the same, is all for it. Has the government embarked on 
the requisite downsizing at the level of deputy ministers, 
consulting services and the bureaucracy, considering that, although 
there is no more money for subsidies, people are still being paid to 
run programs that no longer exist or are no longer operational? Has 
anything been done about this?
<P>
	There is one more sector that intrigues me a great deal, and that 
is tax expenditures. Last year we saw a document that gave an 
overview of tax expenditures entitled ``Tax expenditures 1995''. I 
would like to quote a few examples from this document, where it 
says there is no information available on the subject. It means the 
government is unable to indicate the impact of these tax 
expenditures, which makes it look pretty silly. Here are some 
examples.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4355"> 4355 </A></B>
<P>
	By the way, these are not mere details. These are important 
issues that are connected with tax fairness. For instance, deferred 
capital gains or transfers between spouses. They cannot tell us the 
real impact of this measure.
<P>
	Non-taxation of certain non-monetary benefits. Here again, they 
cannot tell us a thing.
<P>
	Taxation of realized capital gains. Imagine all the capital gains 
that have been realized, and they are unable to evaluate the impact 
of such a measure.
<P>
	I will quote just a few more, before concluding. The 
non-taxation of incomes of Indians on reserves. Today, they cannot 
indicate the impact of this situation.
<P>
	Non-taxation of donations and bequests. I will conclude with an 
item that will be a contentious issue in future debates, the fact that 
the Senate refuses to be accountable for its budget to the House of 
Commons. Some nerve. The members of a non-elected House who 
are not accountable to the public for the results of their work are 
actually saying they do not have to account for their budget. Will 
this $43 million really be used for practical purposes? Is there no 
duplication of the work done by members of the House of 
Commons? Have some practices not become obsolete?
<P>
	These are the kind of questions the government should answer. 
Especially on this point, I would appreciate the opinion of the 
President of the Treasury Board who has shown a concern for 
genuine expenditure control. I think the government should set an 
example in this respect for the Canadian public.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Mr. Speaker, the three points listed by my hon. 
colleague are important and deserve a closer look.
<P>
	There are unfortunately cases in which government funds were 
not used properly. It is obvious that, in some departments-as the 
auditor general himself discovers each year-government funds 
could, in certain cases, be used in much better ways.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	What is important in a business with total expenditures of $157 
billion is that we must be able to implement controls at two levels.
<P>
	First, at the macroeconomic level, where members can control 
the policies themselves and ensure that the money allocated by 
Parliament to implement certain policies is used to attain the real 
objectives of these policies. Most of the time, Parliament exercises 
control primarily by allocating the money needed to implement 
certain policies and, as I pointed out in my speech, this process is 
now undergoing extensive reforms.
<P>
	Treasury Board also has a responsibility to ensure that 
departments follow the proper procedures in specific cases so that 
money is spent in accordance with regulations and with the 
provisions of the Financial Administration Act.
<P>
	We must remain vigilant in these areas because each year every 
department develops new ways of doing things and some of their 
new procedures are not suitable and therefore result in 
inappropriate expenditures.
<P>
	This role of reviewing examples in every government 
department, which is shared by the auditor general and the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts, must have the full 
support of Treasury Board, and it does. Whenever new procedures 
or ways of doing things to reduce the misappropriation of funds are 
brought to our attention, we implement them.
<P>
	The second point mentioned by the hon. member is that certain 
departments still have not made in-depth changes and there is a 
possibility that, while some subsidy programs may have been 
considerably reduced or even abolished, the person-years required 
to deliver these programs have not been subject to the same kind of 
cuts.
<P>
	This is why we have a system whereby every department must, 
each year, submit to Treasury Board a plan for delivering their plan 
of action. This means that, each year, Treasury Board's five deputy 
ministers review how the various departments intend to bring 
changes to their structure, to the way they use their person years, to 
their programs and to the implementation of these programs, so as 
to better reach their objectives.
<P>
	Today, in my speech, I indicated that we also intend to conduct a 
performance analysis and that we have already conducted a number 
of pilot projects in this regard. The idea is to review the budget, not 
the way we currently do it when we allocate funds, but by obliging 
departments to submit a report on their use of funds and on the 
extent to which their objectives are met, with, where possible, 
some quantitative measurement of departmental performance. My 
colleague was very clear in making that point and we are trying to 
improve service delivery and evaluation measures.
<P>
	The third point mentioned concerns the impacts of tax 
expenditures which are not measured sometimes. Obviously, 
evaluation issues are always very difficult. They are difficult 
because there are a lot of results that cannot be examined or that 
cannot be quantified.
<P>
	For example, the impact of certain expenditures on the health 
and general welfare of Canadians is impossible to measure 
sometimes. We can measure the impact of certain specific actions, 
but it is sometimes difficult to measure the impact of preventive 
measures, for example, because we have altered a situation and it 
then becomes extremely difficult to measure exactly what the 
results would have been without these preventive measures.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	There are methodological problems. Each year we try to have 
quantitative measures that are more accurate, but it is obvious that 
we still have work to do in some areas. I can assure my colleague 
that the Treasury Board understands perfectly well that there are 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4356"> 4356 </A></B>
<P>
still a lot of improvements to be made and is working towards 
making these improvements.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, very 
briefly, I would like to ask the President of Treasury Board, since 
he is the one to handle the cabinet's big budget, if he does not 
sometimes have to act like a bad government to be able to 
distribute the money. I would like to give the example of the 
commercial investment credit.
<P>
	A number of farmers from the vast Eastern Townships region 
have complained to my office-justifiably, I think-that, two or 
three years later, the revenue department wants to recover, with 
heavy interest charges, the 10 per cent, the credit to which they 
were entitled and which ended on January 1, 1994, which they used 
in good faith for purchases prior to that date.
<P>
	As the President of Treasury Board, how could he explain that 
these directives have gone solely to the Sherbrooke regional office?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Mr. Speaker, you will understand that it is not easy 
for me to have a detailed knowledge of all the applications of all 
the Treasury Board directives in the 24 or so federal government 
departments. With respect to this question, I shall look into the 
example given by my hon. colleague and see whether it is possible 
to solve the difficulties he refers to.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to seek the unanimous 
consent of the House to table the third report of the finance 
committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

to prevent trust funds from transferring money abroad, like the $2 
billion funds that recently left the country tax-free. Instead, the 
Liberal majority attacked the auditor general's credibility and, 
instead of closing the door, threw it wide open so more funds could 
leave the country.

	The House resumed consideration of the motions for 
concurrence in the Main Estimates.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to oppose the motion to concur 
in the main estimates. The Reform Party has argued that, since the 
Senate refused to defend its budget before the committee on 
government operations, we should not approve its budget. I think 
this position is quite defensible. The members of the Senate were 
not elected but appointed for partisan reasons.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Let us look at the latest appointments to the Senate: a former 
executive of the Liberal Party of Canada and a former minister of 
agriculture.
<P>
	For the past three years, the Liberals have been looking for a way 
to regain control of the upper House because they were dealt a 
devastating blow last June, when a bill aimed at preventing the 
privatization of Pearson airport died in the Senate, voted down by 
people who were not elected. Now I have seen it all! In this day and 
age, in a democracy that brags about being one of the most active, 
the most efficient in the world, the unelected House of Parliament 
killed a bill in which hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake. 
This will cost money to taxpayers, regardless of the solution. All of 
us, elected members of this House, could only watch the other 
place make the decision instead of us. These non-elected people 
made the decision.
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians are tired of this situation. The senators 
added insult to injury by not appearing before the Standing 
Committee on Government Operations to justify the need for such 
funds. This alone is sufficient reason for opposing at least the 
allocation of these funds.
<P>
	However, we must go further in our review of the situation. In 
Quebec, the legislative council was abolished 30 years ago, after it 
was realized that non-elected houses no longer reflected the current 
reality.
<P>
	We went to the public. I personally tabled a motion in the House 
which is supported by all Bloc members and by other members of 
the opposition. Our petition on this issue is receiving strong 
support, certainly in Quebec, whether people are staunch or soft 
federalists, or whether they are sovereignists or independentists. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4357"> 4357 </A></B>
<P>
Everyone is fed up with the Senate. We get this support because, 
ultimately, people want two things from us: that we focus on jobs 
and that we put an end to all this useless spending. The Senate is a 
political example; it is an important symbol, which we must 
absolutely target. We must abolish a house that is no longer 
representative of Canada.
<P>
	Let us not forget that the Senate was originally established to 
represent the regions. Senators were appointed to represent 
regions. I invite you to visit your constituents and systematically 
ask them this question: Which senator represents you in the 
Senate? What is his name. I am not asking you to have them tell 
you that person's responsibilities, just their name. The response 
rate will be shocking, because the senators have never assumed this 
responsibility of regional representation. Not at all.
<P>
	Nowadays, senators are appointed in the following manner: the 
Prime Minister chooses someone he has decided to reward 
politically. He calls them up and says: ``You should buy yourself a 
piece of property; you need something worth $4,000 in such and 
such an area. This is the condition you have to meet to become a 
senator''. Often, the only time people hear about their senator is 
when he goes to the registry office to check that the property he has 
just bought has in fact been registered. The rest of the time, he is 
not often seen.
<P>
	I also heard this criticism of the Senate from all those I met last 
year during the protest over employment insurance reform. They 
said to us: ``If it were at least equal, if everyone at least had to 
contribute equally''. But it was during these same months, if you 
recall, we saw the senators asleep on television. They are paid, just 
as we are, but they were seen sleeping on television during the 
throne speech.
<P>
	If the claim is that their role is one of decorum, let them at least 
perform this role, but even that is beyond them.
<P>
	I therefore think it important that the government be given a very 
clear message, that citizens from throughout Quebec and from 
Canada, whatever their province or territory, tell their MP that they 
think the senators have outlived their usefulness, that they are not 
representative. We think that the Canada of today must look closely 
at all government programs, as the President of the Treasury Board 
was saying. And the first target should be the Senate, because its 
budget, the direct expenditure budget-I am not talking about all 
the incidental expenditures, for example, the expenses assumed by 
the House of Commons, which in fact are incurred by the senators, 
but the direct budget-is around $43 million.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	A figure of $43 million a year out of the overall budget does not 
seem astronomical, but it means that our  system can still afford 
today to pay out expenses amounting to half a million dollars, per 
riding, per senator, for a useless role.
<P>
	The other function of a senator was to see to better laws. When 
the Senate was created it was said that the members of the House of 
Commons would need people with more education, who would be 
able to put the finishing touch to pieces of legislation, to finalize 
them. It might have been true 125 years ago. Today with the kind of 
members we have, the research departments, the assistants, 
legislative or otherwise, it is not necessary any more. We have 
everything we need and, in this respect, the senator no longer has a 
role.
<P>
	Since nature abhors a vacuum, the Senate has developed a new 
role for itself. It has become the representative of all organized 
lobbies in Canada. In this sense, it is highly detrimental to 
democracy.
<P>
	It seems to me that the study of this year's estimates provides the 
perfect opportunity to give a clear message to the government, to 
give a clear message to Canadians, to give a clear message to 
Quebecers, to the effect that yes, indeed, we are really going to deal 
with useless expenditures, we are committed to tackling useless 
symbols.
<P>
	We could also talk about lieutenant governors in Canada. They 
cost money. They cost eight million dollars a year. People see them 
about twice a year.
<P>
	It has been said that in our system, in our beautiful country as the 
federalists call Canada, there are still many things that are 
unacceptable. These are only two symbols, but the one I would like 
to draw your attention to is the whole issue of the Senate.
<P>
	I find it interesting that so many members want to speak to this 
motion. All speakers of the official opposition will split their time 
to make sure as many members as possible have the opportunity to 
speak and convey the message they received from their 
constituents. During the summer, a period we consider to be quiet, 
we have seen people sign thousands of petitions asking for the 
abolition of the Senate.
<P>
	I have visited many corner stores and met people sharing my 
political opinion and some with a different opinion, but they all 
agreed on this point. Members of senior citizens' clubs, employees 
in companies, representatives from chambers of commerce and 
community workers all agreed that we should send a clear message 
to the government saying that the Senate must be abolished.
<P>
	In short, we have an institution which is outdated and too 
expensive, which has an inflated opinion of its lobbying function 
and which is a patronage haven. For all those reasons, it seems to 
me we absolutely must oppose this specific item if the Senate's 
expenditures are included in the government's overall 
expenditures. It is like a first step, a first signal, but I think that 
before long,  when we reach the point where we have to deal with 
the substance of this issue and vote on the motion I tabled asking 
the government to abolish the Senate, then each member of the 
House will have to see if his constituents think, and if he feels in his 
heart and soul, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4358"> 4358 </A></B>
<P>
that the Senate is an institution that must go on or if it is one we can 
no longer afford, one that no longer contributes to democracy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I 
would like to congratulate the hon. member for his spirited and 
passionate speech pointing out the unnecessary spending the other 
institution can entail.
<P>
	I would also like the hon. member to talk about his private 
member's bill to limit the amounts available to senators and to tell 
us about the petitions he is receiving from people who want to 
express their opposition to the Senate.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Perhaps, at the same time, other colleagues may also want to 
sign this petition, so that his bill can receive more support. 
Increasingly, Canadians are wondering whether the Senate is really 
an institution that has outlived its purpose or whether it ought to 
undergo major reform.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague's comments remind me 
of something that was discussed a few years ago, namely an 
equitable and equal Senate. One thing is for certain: today's Senate 
is inequitable and unequal.
<P>
	Inequitable because senators are appointed for partisan reasons 
and do not have a mandate from the people. Unequal because 
representation is totally inconsistent with the role originally 
intended for the Senate. For these reasons, but especially because 
of the unnecessary spending, because we saw some senators dozing 
off on television, I think the Senate should be abolished. This may 
sound like grandstanding but, as we know, in practice the Senate's 
role is much more often to represent big business and the banks.
<P>
	Who are the campaign chairs or co-chairs for the major parties? 
Senator Hervieux-Payette, and Senator Nolin for the Tories. All the 
old parties that have appointed senators are using them as political 
organizers. This makes a mockery of democracy. This is something 
we should get rid of. That is why there is popular movement to 
abolish the Senate.
<P>
	You may tell me that this will not eliminate Canada's deficit, but 
people expect their members of Parliament to make symbolic 
gestures to show we are willing to cut at all levels and not always 
on the backs of the same people.
<P>
	I expect the third hour of debate on my motion to abolish the 
Senate to take place in October, probably in the second half. Until 
then, I would like my campaign to pick up speed and to collect even 
more signatures for my petition. I hope we can convince a majority 
of members  that most Canadians are clearly in favour of 
abolishing the Senate in its present form.
<P>
	We want the public to support us. I will table petitions signed by 
thousands of people, as will the hon. members for Frontenac and 
Champlain. Altogether, I think we have collected between 20,000 
and 25,000 signatures so far. I think this clearly shows what the 
people want.
<P>
	In Quebec, people clearly told us that they want to get rid of this 
institution; they feel that it is unnecessary, that it costs too much for 
no good reason. They are tired of having to pay the salaries of 
people without mandates, whom they are unable to get rid of until 
they reach the age of 75. To add insult to injury, some of them are 
even appointed Lieutenant Governor of Canada after having 
slapped Quebec in the face.
<P>
	This kind of situation is unacceptable and that is why we must 
reject the government's estimates, especially the money allocated 
to the Senate, because it is a blot on Canadian democracy.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, in my remarks, I mentioned that all members of the 
Bloc Quebecois, including myself, will be sharing their time, each 
of us therefore speaking for 10 minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank my hon. colleague. As he 
indicated, he is sharing his speaking time. Therefore, the hon. 
member for Frontenac has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I rise today to participate in this debate of 
particular significance to several of my colleagues and to myself, 
of course. And I will not even mention how pleased some of my 
constituents from Frontenac will be when they read what I have to 
say.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	Today's debate plunges us into what I would venture to describe 
as parliamentary nonsense and political burlesque. I could go on 
and on about how futile I find the role the Senate plays, or rather, 
should be playing.
<P>
	First, I would like to thank the many senators who are following 
this debate, either from their offices or from the gallery, this 
afternoon. In this regard, I would like to read you at this time, if I 
may, a few lines from the March 1995 issue of the <I>Reader's Digest</I> 
(French edition), on page 31, under the title ``Très chers sénateurs'' 
or ``Dear Senators''. I will just make a few remarks, particularly 
regarding their salary.
<P>
	``I think all Canadians should know how much it costs to keep 
the Upper House here, in Ottawa. On top of a $64,000 sessional 
allowance, a $30,000 research allowance, a $20,000 allowance for 
office expenses, and a tax-free expense allowance of over $10,000, 
senators receive benefits of a totally different nature''. I will spare 
you the details.
<P>
	Canadians should also know that senators must be very fit. Of 
course, they are only allowed to sit until the age  of 75 nowadays, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4359"> 4359 </A></B>
<P>
whereas they used to sit for life. ``To keep in shape, to maintain 
their physical condition, senators have at their disposal a gym 
which is fully equipped, including climbing simulators, stationary 
bicycles, bodybuilding equipment, free weights, and I could go on, 
as well as an aerobics room, with instructors. Only one thing is 
missing in these state-of-the-art facilities, the senators themselves. 
One senator only is a regular at the gym: Colin Kenny from 
Ontario''.
<P>
	In 1991, the then auditor general, Kenneth Dye, dared to take a 
look at the Upper House. Not to worry, Mr. Speaker, for to audit the 
senators' expenses, the auditor general had to get the authorization, 
not of the Prime Minister, but of the senators themselves. This is 
incredible. Of course, after much negotiation I presume, he 
obtained the authorization to audit the books.
<P>
	In concluding, I also invite the Canadians who wish to know 
more on the subject or to voice their opinion about it to call a 
toll-free number that I will now give. Canadians who wish to call 
the senators' office can dial 1-800-267-7362.
<P>
	Before coming in, I made sure to get the list of Quebec senators. 
There are 24 of them and, of those 24, there is one independent 
senator, who was appointed by Mr. Mulroney and who represents 
the Senate division of de La Salle. There is only one independent 
senator on my list, Marcel Prud'homme, who, incidentally, closely 
follows the proceedings of the House of Commons. There are, of 
course, several other senators from the Liberal and Conservative 
ranks.
<P>
	This summer, when I went around asking my constituents to sign 
the petition to abolish the Senate, I would often ask them to name a 
few senators.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	To be sure, the senator who represents my riding is a total 
stranger. I am referring to the Senate division of-you see, Mr. 
Speaker, I am a member of Parliament and I have already 
forgotten-oh yes, Kennebec and the senator is Guy Charbonneau, 
who is from the Trois-Rivières area.
<P>
	Seriously, I was not able to find anyone who could name more 
than one senator. The best known senator this summer appeared to 
be Thérèse Lavoie-Roux, since her name came up a few times in 
the news.
<P>
	So, as far as Quebecers and Canadians are concerned, senators 
are total strangers. And this is costing us a fortune. The figure of 
$43 million has been mentioned, but I think the real figure would 
more likely be $65 million a year.
<P>
	There are asbestos mines in my riding. France is about to ban 
this product on its soil. The French decision has been known for 
two and a half months already. Up till now, except for a few 
diplomatic notes, the federal government has not spent a nickel to 
defend some 2,000  jobs directly related to the mining industry. The 
banning of asbestos by France will have a disastrous impact on my 
area and on the Asbestos area.
<P>
	If we can spend $65 million to maintain 101 jobs, almost for life, 
for political friends, could we not find $2, $3 or $4 million to 
promote the use of asbestos and to counter the French decision to 
ban asbestos on its soil?
<P>
	Several ministers of this government have travelled across the 
great region of the Eastern Townships and the asbestos area, saying 
that they would take that matter up with their colleague responsible 
for international trade or with their colleague responsible for 
natural resources. However, nothing has happened and yet the 
French decision will get implemented in two or three months from 
now, on January 1 next.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am asking you, which means could we use to try 
to make this government understand that it should help us abolish 
the Senate? You are going to tell me that this would require 
unanimous consent and that senators would have to accept their 
demise. How could we do it?
<P>
	I will give you the recipe. First, we should stop immediately 
appointing new senators. One of them, Jean-Louis Roux, just 
resigned. He headed for Quebec City with a slight raise. He now 
has $94,000, a chauffeur and a nice limousine, and he can also 
appear on the stage. That is what we call double dipping.
<P>
	At least, there is a vacancy following the departure of the former 
senator Jean-Louis Roux. Let us not appoint a new senator to 
replace him. We would have at least one vacancy, which will save 
us over $100,000, with all the expenses related to this job.
<P>
	As soon as some of the senators reach 65 years of age-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Seventy-five.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Seventy-five years of age, yes, 
thank you for reminding me, let us not appoint new ones.
<P>
	At some point, there will be no senators left, although when we 
reviewed the list earlier on, we realized that the government, 
especially the current prime minister, has been generous. I noticed 
that some senators have been appointed until 2023. Can you 
imagine, until 2023. As you know, job security, even in the civil 
service-as I look at the table clerks, is a thing of the past. It does 
not exist any more. But we still appoint senators until 2023. That is 
simple awful, as you will agree.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Quebec will be sovereign before that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> I hope that Quebec will indeed 
become sovereign before that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4360"> 4360 </A></B>
<P>
	I am telling you, in my riding, the best known senator is Thérèse 
Lavoie-Roux, and the senator who has just resigned has also 
become quite famous, Jean-Louis Roux. But of course he is not 
responsible for the fame he has acquired, because it is our good 
old Prime Minister who did not deign to consult, as is the tradition, 
his counterpart in Quebec in order to arrive at an agreement on 
an appointment.
<P>
	I see here, for example, Marie-P. Poulin, who was appointed 
until the year 2020. This is terrible.
<P>
	Of course, while our fellow citizens have to tighten their belts, 
while both spouses often have to work, while everybody in a 
household has to work, in Quebec, an education-employer sectoral 
round table was set up to ask employers not to work students too 
hard, because it has a negative impact on their studies. In many 
households, 14, 15 or 16-year olds must work to help their parents. 
But here, in the House of Commons, we appoint senators who 
profit from the system.
<P>
	Only this week, I read about a poll done in Great Britain. 
According to this poll, 52 per cent of the respondents said they 
were in favour of the abolition of the monarchy; 52 per cent of 
British respondents said that, while here, in Canada, we have a very 
British system with a representative of the same Queen who is also 
costing us a fortune. And all provinces, even the smallest ones, 
must have a lieutenant governor who is the Queen's representative.
<P>
	So do you not think that the time has come to put an end to this 
scandalous waste of public funds? While we are unable to find, at 
Treasury Board, $3 or $4 million to help save 2,000 jobs in the 
asbestos mines, we will spend-and I do say spend-needlessly, 
without getting anything in return, $65 million this year to sustain 
the Senate. It is a shame. It is outrageous.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, of 
course, I want to congratulate my colleague from Frontenac for his 
speech and for giving his voters a chance to express themselves 
through the petition which is being circulated in his riding.
<P>
	I would like to ask him a double question. He talked about the 
senators' involvement in regional issues. On the asbestos issue 
particularly, the hon. member, like the people from the industry, 
must have a lot of work to do, and, normally, there should be a 
senator from the area to help them in their efforts.
<P>
	During the three years he has been here, did the hon. member see 
the senator for his area work on an issue of direct regional interest? 
We do not see those people very often around here. Maybe things 
are different in his riding. I would like to have his opinion on the 
subject.
<P>
	You know, we do not see the senators very often. Of course, there 
are the two or three we regularly meet in the corridors, like Senator 
Rivest and Senator  Prud'homme. As for the others, we do not see 
them very often.
<P>
	The second part of my question is this: Since there is currently a 
debate on the question in his riding, is it true that his voters think 
that the Senate should be reformed? What do the people he talked 
to about Senate reform think? I would also hear his views on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, my distinguished 
colleague from Témiscamingue should know that the percentage of 
success in these tests is very low. If I could, I would ask my 
colleague from Témiscamingue to give me the name of his Senate 
division and the name of his senator. I would be willing to bet $10 
that he does not know.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	In response to his first question, I can tell the hon. member that 
the senator who represents the division of Kennebec is Guy 
Charbonneau, who, until recently, was Speaker of the Senate. If he 
visited the riding of Frontenac, he did it very quietly since we never 
heard about such a visit. I have never seen the name of our senator 
mentioned in the newspapers, yet I read them from cover to cover. 
Even worse, at a press conference held six months ago, I did the 
test with reporters from the asbestos region and none of them could 
name the senator who represents us. Yet they all knew the names of 
the Speaker of the House of Commons and his three assistants. 
That was good, at least.
<P>
	The second question is this: Has the senator for our senatorial 
designation ever tried to do anything about important issues in his 
designation? To my knowledge, we have never had the slightest 
assistance from our senator, never.
<P>
	This afternoon, we were visited by a group of Belgian senators. 
In Belgium, the senators are elected. In the United States, they are 
as well.
<P>
	When we were trying to bring about a major constitutional 
reform, which was blocked by a few people-I can still remember 
the feather-we wanted to have a Triple E Senate, which meant 
equal, among other things. In Quebec we have 24 for a population 
of seven million, whereas in Prince Edward Island they have three 
for a population smaller than that of Sherbrooke; four MPs, four 
senators, they are overrepresented or we are underrepresented. In 
any event, looking at the results, there is no big difference. But, if 
senators were elected, I would be in favour.
<P>
	I remember very clearly a senator saying to me on the way out of 
the parliamentary restaurant last spring: ``As far as I am concerned, 
the day we are required to campaign to get elected is the day I quit 
the Senate''. That might be a good way to weed out some of them, 
and it would get results.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4361"> 4361 </A></B>
<P>
	My colleague from Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup was again 
telling us just now in his speech about the television news clip 
that showed four senators sleeping soundly. Is that not shocking? 
I remember when television was introduced in the British 
Parliament and the camera panned the House and showed one MP 
with his eyes shut; he lost his seat.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ha, ha.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> You are right to laugh. He lost his 
seat.
<P>
	I understand that it is not funny for Senator Prud'Homme, who, I 
agree, is an excellent senator. It is sad for him, but a number of our 
constituents remind us, and rightly so, of the news program where 
they saw senators sleeping. There is no more than one throne 
speech every two years. He could have gone to bed a bit earlier the 
night before-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ha, ha.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> -because he had to work the next 
day.
<P>
	Now, we wanted a triple E Senate. Efficient, not asleep on the 
job. When I used to hire people to work on our farm, if I had found 
the guy I was paying to clear stones asleep on the job, he would not 
have worked for long.
<P>
	Thank you for your kind attention, and long live a triple E 
Senate, maybe.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time is well and truly 
up.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
be splitting my time with the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
	I am pleased to initiate the first motion to amend the main 
estimates. My motion, seconded by the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster, will amend vote 1. It proposes that 
vote 1, in the amount of $40,713,000 under Parliament-Payments 
to the Senate, program expenditures in the 1996-97 main estimates, 
be reduced by $10 million.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to give some background to that motion. It goes 
back to the government operations committee. Last March I moved 
a motion in committee that we invite the Senate to come before the 
committee to examine the estimates of the Senate. We debated that 
motion and the vote was relatively close. The Bloc and the Reform 
voted in favour and the Liberals were split. However, it went 
through committee.
<P>
	In order to send a letter to the Senate there has to be unanimous 
consent of this House, which we got. The letter went to the the 
Senate inviting it to come before the government operations 
committee to basically go over the estimates for the $40 million for 
the Senate. This was not an untoward request. Any business, 
household, this House or any other institution has to justify how 
they are going to spend money. All we were asking was for the 
Senate to come forward and justify how it was going to spend the 
$40 million.
<P>
	However, the senators ignored that request. Subsequently I sent a 
letter to Senator Kenny, the head of the Senate finance committee, 
which was also ignored. We asked for a conference between this 
House and the Senate to discuss these issues. That was ignored. We 
simply have heard nothing.
<P>
	My point is that if the senators refuse to come before the 
committee to justify their expenses, there has to be a reason. What 
is the reason? The reason could be that they figure they are way 
over there and that they should not have to justify their expenses, or 
perhaps they do not want people looking into the estimates because 
there are areas that they do not want to or cannot explain. I would 
suggest that could well be the case.
<P>
	In 1991 the auditor general looked into the accounting process 
within the Senate. Unfortunately it was a bit of a horror show. This 
request, which originated from Reform, also has the backing of the 
auditor general's accounting into the Senate. In 1991 he basically 
found that it is an inefficient and poorly managed institution. There 
has been plenty of time, five years, for the Senate to address the 
concerns of the auditor general and to come before the Canadian 
public. It was an excellent opportunity to come before the 
committee and say: ``Okay. We are open and above board. The 
auditor general said there were some major concerns, but we are 
quite willing to come before the Canadian public and justify our 
expenses''. That did not happen.
<P>
	I would like to go through some of the points because they are 
significant in that some areas, including travel and how the 
accounts are processed, really leave a lot of room for concern for 
the Canadian public. I will go through a number of these points but 
I will not belabour them.
<P>
	These are from the auditor general's report: ``The Financial 
Administration Act does not apply to the Senate. Therefore the 
usual accountability mechanisms simply do not apply''. Another 
point: ``The Senate has neither formally nor informally delegated 
clear responsibility to management, nor has it made it clear what it 
will hold management accountable for''. Basically, it is a very 
loose relationship within the Senate management team. Again: 
``The Senate does not adequately report on its administrative, 
financial or human resource management performance and does 
not possess significant information to enable it to do so 
systematically''. Again, it is a very loose system of managing the 
support staff within the Senate.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4362"> 4362 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	The public reporting provided by individual committees does not 
reflect all expenditures and does not provide detailed information 
on expenditures, so we have a number of committees basically out 
on the loose. Their expenditures are not recorded correctly. This is 
simply not the way to run a business.
<P>
	If that is the way things were going in this House, we would 
clean up our act. However, because it is the Senate, apparently it 
can do whatever it likes. That is the appearance and that is what has 
Canadians' backs up. They feel that group refuses to be 
accountable for its actions and refuses to come forward and have its 
books audited.
<P>
	To continue with the auditor general's points, basic facts about 
Senate administration such as organizational structure, operational 
goals, plans and performance are not published. Amounts reported 
in the public accounts are incomplete and do not give sufficient 
information to determine whether the expenses incurred were for 
``the service of the Senate as required by the Parliament of Canada 
Act''.
<P>
	Senators are incurring expenses and those expenses cannot be 
back traced to show that they are related to Senate business. It is 
really getting to the point of being bizarre. Surely there must be 
some points. We have the Parliament of Canada Act, yet the 
senators refuse to abide by it.
<P>
	I could go on and on. Anybody can pick up the 1991 auditor 
general's report on the Senate. Auditor General Kenneth Dye went 
into great detail on some of the areas that need to be tightened up.
<P>
	The auditor general's report is long and scathing and it notes 
many areas of possible abuse. That is the point and that is the 
reason I moved the motion in committee to have the Senate come 
before our committee.
<P>
	We have a Liberal government across the way. Before the last 
election the Liberals took the position: ``Elected representatives 
must be permitted more influence on decisions regarding 
expenditure priorities. This will require their meaningful 
involvement in the process before government's actual spending 
estimates are formally prepared''. I would like to ask members 
across the way how much input they had on the estimates going to 
the Senate. I would venture to say that it was very little, which is 
unfortunate.
<P>
	Talk of Senate reform has gone on for years. My colleagues from 
the Bloc are advocating abolition of the Senate. My Reform 
colleagues do not advocate abolition; we feel the Senate has to be 
reformed. It is an institution that can work and can work very well. 
However, it cannot work in its present form.
<P>
	In 1991 the current Prime Minister told the House of Commons: 
``Reform of the Senate is extremely  important. I believe in it. 
There is nothing sacrosanct about the present division of powers. 
We must look for a division of powers that best serves the interests 
of all the people, all the Canadian people''. This is from our current 
Prime Minister. If this quote is accurate, I would expect that 
Liberals across the way and Reformers would all want to have a 
Senate that works, that is not a patronage haven for the old boys 
and the old girls, but an institution that works.
<P>
	I will return to the American and the Australian examples 
because their Senates work. In each case, oddball goofy legislation 
does not go through the lower house because they know it will 
never go through the upper house. Those are Senates that work. 
Unfortunately some of that legislation goes through this House and 
lands on a Senate that is ineffective and inactive.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to sum up with the issue of accountability. We have 
a vote this evening on the estimates of the Senate. I challenge 
members on the government side. They do not know what they are 
voting for in the estimates for the Senate. They cannot because 
other than lump sums, the Senate committees have failed to come 
before us to justify exactly what the expenditures are.
<P>
	Are government members going to vote as they are told or are 
they going to question these estimates? If they are going to 
question them, why are they not putting more pressure on the 
senators to come before the government operations committee to 
bring forward their reasons why some of the travel budgets, some 
of the staffing and some of the accounting procedures are so out of 
whack?
<P>
	I sum up with the analogy of the dinosaur and where I see the 
Senate right now. A group of dinosaurs are sitting on the edge of 
the swamp. They can either carry on there and in a hundred million 
years we will find them as a lump of coal, or they can turn around 
and back up. Others will say the dinosaurs are gone anyway.
<P>
	The point is that the Senate has an opportunity right now to come 
into the 20th and 21st centuries and not become dinosaurs but 
become part of an institution that really works, an institution that 
this country is crying for. We need the two Houses to work well 
together and right now they are not. Right now we have a lower 
House that moves through the legislation and the upper House that 
is just rubber stamping it.
<P>
	My last point is that we must have accountability. The Senate has 
refused to be accountable. My motion to reduce the estimates by 
$10 million stands and I move that motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy 
to ask a question of my colleague from the third party. The hon. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4363"> 4363 </A></B>
<P>
member mentioned that the  senators have refused to come before 
the committee to account for the funds they received.
<P>
	I have two questions for him. First does he believe that the 
Senate could justify what it receives considering its present 
political relevance? Secondly, since my colleague compared 
senators to dinosaurs, ma question is the following: If a majority of 
Canadians were in favour of the abolition of the Senate since 
dinosaurs have disappeared, should the Senate be abolished to 
make way for a new political vision? Otherwise, what would be the 
solution?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the 
questions. If I understood the question on relevance correctly I 
believe it is relevant to have the senators come before the 
committee. What is quite relevant is the fact that the Senate is 
being handed a blank cheque for $40 million of Canadian 
taxpayers' money. There has to be accountability and that is the 
whole reason for the motion.
<P>
	On the second point the difference between the views of the Bloc 
and Reform of the Senate is whether the Senate should be 
abolished, as the Bloc is basically moving toward, and the Reform 
view that it needs to be brought into the 20th and 21st century as a 
triple E Senate.
<P>
	I used the analogy of the dinosaurs. If the senators keep going 
the way they are going with no reforms they will join the dinosaurs. 
If members wandered into the Senate these days they might think 
they are mired in a swamp a hundred million years ago.
<P>
	I hope I have answered my colleague's questions and if there are 
any more I would be delighted to answer them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am in great sympathy with the motion from my 
colleague from the third party.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	I point out to the House that what is at issue is not just 
accountability, which is key to the issue, but also that the Senate 
would like the country to believe it is a house equal in authority to 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	The reality is that there is only one highest authority in this land 
and that is this House of Commons which is responsible to every 
aspect of the land. It is the ultimate chamber of accountability. The 
Senate must be subject to that because it is not elected as are we in 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	I strongly endorse the motion put forward by the member for the 
third party, even though he is a political opponent. He is right. He is 
on the right track. Accountability from the Senate will make a 
responsible Senate and the Senate can therefore contribute 
materially to this nation in a very responsible way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the privilege of speaking to my 
colleague's motion to reduce the estimates of the Senate by some 
$10 million.
<P>
	The member for Comox-Alberni spoke very eloquently 
regarding the Senate. He gave us a lot of facts and he also told 
about the unaccountability of the Senate. I too will touch on the 
unaccountability but I want to talk a little about some principles 
and some attitudes as well as accountability with regard to this 
matter.
<P>
	First of all, whose money are we talking about? If we look at the 
estimates, it says $40.700-some for the Senate. Someone might say 
that this is the Senate's money. It is not the Senate's money. It is 
Canadians' money because these are taxpayers' dollars. Some of 
that money is yours and mine and the other 29 million Canadians 
who support the Senate through their tax contributions.
<P>
	We are talking about reducing spending by the Senate by $10 
million in this motion. That $10 million is not the Senate's dollars. 
We are not taking $10 million from the Senate. What we are doing 
is talking about how we are going to spend $10 million of 
taxpayers' money.
<P>
	In Kindersley-Lloydminster, if someone is speaking to a group 
or to an individual and wants to draw a laugh, start talking about 
the Senate. That is the esteem in which the Senate is held by 
average Canadians. We are spending $40 million for something 
about which Canadians do not think very highly. The attitude of 
Canadians is that the Senate, in the form in which it now exists, is 
not a very good investment.
<P>
	I can guarantee that if someone surveyed Canadians from one 
end of this country to another and if they had any criticism of this 
motion, they would say that they are not reducing the Senate's 
spending by enough. Ten million dollars is pretty modest. After all, 
that is our money and we think it could be put to better use.
<P>
	I think of my own riding of Kindersley-Lloydminster. How 
could that money be used in Kindersley-Lloydminster? Because 
of health care funding cuts, hospital have been closed in the 
Kindersley-Lloydminster constituency. It means that while there 
are still some good health care facilities available, some people 
might not get there on time. Lives may actually be lost because of 
the health care cuts experienced in Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
	I also have a stretch of the Yellowhead highway that goes 
through my constituency near Lloydminster and also near 
Saskatoon. A lot of that highway is still two-way traffic. It is one of 
the major transportation arteries across this country. Funding in 
part to upgrade that highway is a federal responsibility. There has 
been talk and commitments of upgrading the Yellowhead highway.
<P>
	I know the constituents in the Lloydminster area would much 
rather see this $10 million go into highway  construction on the 
Yellowhead than see an unaccountable Senate spending those 
dollars on what we know not.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4364"> 4364 </A></B>
<P>
	The concern of Canadians is why would they fund something for 
which they have no respect? Our concern should be then, what do 
we do about it? Immediately, what we can do is reduce their 
funding. There are some longer term things that need to be done. 
My colleague from Comox-Alberni has touched on that.
<P>
	Certainly he has tried to initiate some accountability from the 
Senate and I appreciate his endeavour. He requested the Senate to 
appear before this House and account for how those dollars are 
spent. It was not a very threatening request. It was fairly civil and 
fairly reasonable, in fact very reasonable and very important. It was 
an opportunity for the Senate to justify the way it has been 
spending tax dollars but it ignored his request. That tells us a bit 
about the attitude of the Senate itself. Canadians' attitude may not 
be good toward the Senate but it is reciprocated by the Senate, 
which has a very low opinion of Canadians and of its role in 
accounting for the money that it spends.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	There is a difference between this House and the other place. In 
this House we are held accountable. We can hold one another 
accountable in debates and so on and how we vote on legislation, 
but there is that accountability that comes at election time.
<P>
	One of our colleagues actually wrote a letter to the Saskatoon 
<I>Star-Phoenix</I> which is published in today's edition and it is 
absolutely wrong. This member for Saskatoon-Humboldt said: 
``In June I spoke in the House of Commons in opposition to a 
Reform Party motion aimed at the destruction of the Canadian 
Wheat Board''. People who read <I>Hansard</I> could look there and they 
would not find one word by one Reformer who ever called or 
indicated any aim of ours to destroy the Canadian Wheat Board. 
We talked about reforms to the board, improving the board and the 
long term viability of the board but in no case did we ever talk 
about the destruction of the board. In fact we said that is not what 
we want to accomplish.
<P>
	The member for Saskatoon-Humboldt can be held accountable. 
We can talk to her constituents and they have an opportunity at the 
next election not to vote for her if she was wrong on this issue, 
which she was, and in other areas in which she may be wrong.
<P>
	That is not the case with senators. They are not accountable. 
They are patronage appointments. Once they have that seat in the 
other place they are pretty comfortable. They can pretty well do 
whatever they want. They can make statements that are rather 
ridiculous like the statement made by the member for 
Saskatoon-Humboldt and nobody can challenge them. Canadians 
have no way to hold them accountable. They  do not have to be 
answerable for their actions, for their words and for their deeds.
<P>
	Everyone in this House would agree that is not a very healthy 
situation. We need to bring more accountability to the Senate. 
Perhaps if we vote them $10 million less of Canadian taxpayers' 
dollars to spend it will wake them up. Some of my Bloc colleagues 
have been talking about them sleeping. Sometimes when you take 
some money out of your back pocket it wakes you up if you are 
sleeping and that is what this motion intends to do.
<P>
	We have on record Liberal promises to the effect that the Liberal 
Party, if it was in government, would reform the Senate. There are 
more broken promises. We have a promise from the Prime Minister 
that he is committed to an elected Senate. He has not kept that 
promise which is one of many that the Liberals have broken. We 
wonder how much longer Canadians will let the Liberals get away 
with making promises that they have absolutely no intention of 
fulfilling.
<P>
	We do not even need a constitutional change to invite the 
provinces to elect senators. We have already had one elected 
Senator in this place, Senator Stan Waters, who has since passed 
away. He was elected by the people of Alberta and the then prime 
minister appointed an elected person to the Senate. It seems funny 
to appoint an elected person, but because of our Constitution that is 
the only way it can be done. A long term project would be to fix 
that process.
<P>
	As the House knows, I am a committed supporter of the triple E 
concept. I want to see an elected, an effective and an equal Senate. 
It is certainly very important to the people of Saskatchewan. For 
the Liberals, as I said, who promised an elected Senate we just have 
to look at the record. Since they took office in the fall of 1993 they 
have appointed 18 Senators and most of them for a very partisan 
activity.
<P>
	It is very interesting for me because I am the agriculture critic 
that one of the senators is Eugene Whelan who has a long history of 
being involved in agriculture. He was appointed on August 9. It 
would be great to have someone who is a voice for agriculture in 
the Senate if they were accountable. If farmers could say: ``We 
want you to vote this way and if you don't, we don't want you in the 
Senate any more''. Of course Mr. Whelan is in there until he is 75 
years of age. The farmers have no way of removing Mr. Whelan 
from the Senate should he not represent their interests in the 
Senate.
<P>
	Mr. Whelan is from Ontario and so he should be representing the 
interests of Ontario farmers; the corn producers, soybean producers 
and the milk producers. However, Mr. Whelan can just support the 
Liberal agenda no matter whether it is good for the farmers of 
Ontario or not. That is extremely unfortunate. I do really think that 
when one makes a promise it is extremely important to keep it.

<P>
	We talked about the attitude of Canadians toward the Senate. 
Canadians have an attitude toward us in this place as well. We had 
better be on our toes and perform for Canadians, or the attitude or 
esteem they hold us in may not be much better than the attitude or 
esteem they have for the Senate. The one way to build up people's 
confidence and trust is to keep one's promises.
<P>
	In the red book the Liberals criticized the Conservative practice 
of choosing political friends when making thousands of 
appointments to boards, commissions and agencies that cabinet is 
required by law to carry out. They also campaigned on integrity in 
government, patronage appointments and lack of accountability in 
the Senate. They have clearly broken these promises.
<P>
	I quote from the Prime Minister. In October 1990 in the province 
of Alberta, out west where there is real call for Senate reform, he 
spoke to the federal Liberal Party and said that in two years the 
Liberal government would make it elected. Obviously the Liberals 
were in opposition then so we have to understand that he meant two 
years after the Liberals formed the government. I think that is fair 
to say.
<P>
	Let us look at when the Liberals formed the government. It was 
in October 1993. A little simple math tells us that two years later 
would be October 1995, which is almost one year ago, and this 
promise has not been kept. There is not even the slightest 
indication in the throne speech that the Prime Minister intended to 
keep his promise. There have been no words from members on the 
other side that the Liberals intended to keep this promise. What are 
we to conclude but that he never meant it. It is another broken 
promise.
<P>
	In 1991 the Prime Minister changed a bit. He said that he would 
propose a 2E and a 1R Senate: elected, effective and representative 
of the regions. This is not what we called for but it is an 
improvement. We would look for the Liberals to do what they 
usually do, and that is a half-baked job. They have not even done 
that.
<P>
	It is time to conclude my presentation. I certainly support the 
motion to reduce spending in the Senate by a mere $10 million. I 
could have supported more. To wake senators up perhaps we need 
to make them a bit hungry. If they were a bit hungry they would not 
be going to sleep over there. In fact they might be a little more 
interested in reforming themselves. They might be a little more 
interested in coming over here and accounting for tax dollars they 
are spending, which would make Canadians feel a whole lot better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think we should set the record straight. In 1992 the Reform Party 
had an opportunity to support major Senate change in the 
Charlottetown accord. Of course the Reform Party campaigned 
against  it. So much for the Reform Party's credibility on that issue.
<P>
	On the motion brought forward by the hon. member, our friends 
opposite are mixing two issues. One is the issue of Senate 
accountability and the other is the issue of the future of the Senate. 
I do not think there is anyone in the House of Commons who does 
not want major change when it comes to the Senate. I certainly 
want major change. I am not even too sure whether we should have 
a bicameral legislature.
<P>
	The other issue-and the member should not be mixing the 
two-is the issue of accountability. I would be much more 
impressed if the hon. member, a number of months ago, had simply 
walked down the halls of Parliament to the Senate, presented 
himself to the Senate's finance committee, and demanded a change 
in the way the Senate accounts to Parliament and to the Canadian 
people. When he did what he did in trying to force the Senate's 
hand through the committee on government operations, it looked 
like grandstanding. It looked like he was trying to put on a show.
<P>
	For all intents and purposes the other place is autonomous and 
separate from this Chamber. If we want greater accountability from 
the other place, which is what I want, we have to follow proper 
procedures. This motion and what the hon. member tried to do in 
the last few months only get the senators' hackles up. If we want to 
do this properly and with credibility, we go to the Senate and force 
it to hold a hearing to deal with this question. We should not do it 
the way the hon. member has tried to do it. It simply does not have 
credibility and will not work. It has been shown that in the last few 
months his attempts have fallen flat. He got absolutely nowhere 
with senators because they have their pride whether or not it is 
wrongly placed. Those are my comments.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Winnipeg 
St. James for his comments. My colleague followed the proper 
procedure. He was not grandstanding, which is proven by the fact 
that the House gave unanimous consent. Members of the Liberal 
party supported what he was trying to do. Unanimous consent is the 
consent of the NDP, Bloc, Liberal and Reform. All agreed that the 
Senate should be held more accountable. The member for 
Comox-Alberni met in a very respectable way with Senator 
Kenney to request that type of co-operation, and they thumbed their 
noses at a very responsible approach.
<P>
	The member mentioned the Charlottetown accord and said that 
Reform refused its opportunity to support Senate reform. He must 
have a very short memory. He probably does not recall some of the 
changes called for in the Charlottetown accord regarding the 
Senate. It was actually kind of a racist approach to Senate reform. 
If I remember correctly, Senate seats were based on heritage,  
ethnic origin. There had to be so many francophone senators and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4366"> 4366 </A></B>
<P>
the majority of them had to vote for legislation that affected 
language and culture. Talk about pulling scabs off wounds inflicted 
hundreds of years ago.
<P>
	Anyone who supported the Charlottetown accord and the type of 
Senate reform that it was calling for would have done a terrible 
disservice to Canada. Canadians supported Reform's opposition to 
the Charlottetown accord by voting against it and by voting against 
the judgment of the Liberals and Conservatives who tried to 
impose this terrible piece of legislation on Canadians.
<P>
	I applaud Canadians. I am very disappointed in the member for 
suggesting that anyone should stoop to supporting to Charlottetown 
accord.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member who just spoke opened his speech by 
stating the reason he was making his points was that the federal 
government had responsibility for reconstructing a road in his 
constituency. Could the hon. member give the House a yes or no 
reply to the question whether he is agreement with the Reform 
party's budget published last year, which said the federal 
government should get out of the business of road construction and 
turn it over to the private sector so that the general public could pay 
for the road through tollgates?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member does not pay 
very much attention to what Reformers have been saying about 
roads. If he had done so, he would realize why we did so very well 
in the Labrador byelection when we talked about a road that needed 
to be built in that part of Canada for which the Liberals had 
absolutely no regard and almost lost the byelection over. Reform 
had zero votes in 1993 and almost won the byelection in 1995.
<P>
	I take some solace in the fact that Reform listens to Canadians 
and knows where they want to spend dollars. Reform does not 
support spending where the federal government does not belong. 
We stand by our budget. We stand by spending money for federal 
infrastructure where the federal government is required to play a 
role.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the 
opportunity to speak to members of the House today on the subject 
of full supply of the estimates for fiscal year 1996-97. This year the 
main estimates total $157 billion, a reduction of $7.2 billion 
compared to the 1995-96 main estimates.
<P>
	Of the $157 billion, $111.7 billion or 71 per cent represents 
statutory payments authorized by Parliament in previous years. The 
government is seeking approval to spend the remaining $45.3 
billion for programs that rely on annual appropriations.
<P>
	To improve the information available to parliamentarians on the 
main estimates and their relationships to the budget, this year the 
government  introduced a new document entitled ``Program 
Expenditure Detail: A Profile of Departmental Spending''. This 
new document, while not formally constituting part of the 
estimates, combines federal program spending details previously 
presented in both part I of the estimates and the budget. Presenting 
spending information on a basis consistent with the expenditure 
plan contained in the budget provides parliamentarians with a 
bridge between the budget document and other estimate 
documents.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	The government has maintained its resolve to reduce program 
spending. In 1996-97 program spending including public debt 
charges is $109 billion or $5.4 billion less than the 1995-96 main 
estimates. This is an important achievement. It demonstrates that 
the government's program review continues to have a significant 
impact on the level of program expenditure requirements.
<P>
	If we examine the composition of spending, it is evident that 
most sectors of government show a decrease in planned program 
spending compared to the 1995-96 levels. In the estimates we 
categorize program spending in 10 sectors. Expenditures on social 
programs represent the largest component of program spending at 
46 per cent.
<P>
	Social sector major transfers to persons which include veterans 
pensions and allowances, unemployment insurance and elderly 
benefits constitute 34 per cent of this amount. The remaining 12 
per cent is allocated to social programs directed primarily at 
employment, health and housing initiatives, programs that benefit 
aboriginal peoples, and immigration and citizenship programs.
<P>
	Direct program expenditures for 1996-97 in the social sector are 
$13.2 billion or 2.4 per cent less than in 1995-96. Reductions in 
direct program expenditures in the social area have been facilitated 
by clarification of core mandates of the social program 
departments, a key element of the program review process.
<P>
	I will provide the House with a few examples of adjustments 
departments in the social sector are making to serve Canadians 
better with declining resources.
<P>
	Health Canada is achieving spending reductions by maximizing 
efficiencies, refocusing its programs and implementing cost 
recovery initiatives, more specifically to shift the burden of paying 
for some services away from the general taxpayer to industry 
clients that benefit most directly from them. These were introduced 
for some health protection services.
<P>
	In addition, efficiency measures are being undertaken by 
consolidating food inspection services in Health Canada with those 
of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans into a single food agency.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4367"> 4367 </A></B>
<P>
	Another department in the social sector implementing 
innovative approaches while reducing program spending is Human 
Resource Development Canada. HRDC's program spending will 
decrease by $419 million in 1996-97. Yet HRDC will continue to 
develop further its services orientation with an increased emphasis 
on responding to the needs of specific communities and on 
management by results.
<P>
	To illustrate this, over the next years a new service delivery 
network will combine offices, kiosks, electronic online services 
and community partnerships to integrate the department's services 
and improve access for our clients. Programs and services will 
reflect local priorities and offer more points of service through the 
application of new technologies.
<P>
	The heritage and cultural program sector is important to all of us. 
It supports the growth and development of Canadian culture and 
life, the nation's linguistic duality, its diverse multicultural 
heritage, and the preservation of parks and historic sites. 
Expenditures in this sector amount to $2.5 billion in 1996-97 or 
approximately 5 per cent of the total direct program spending.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	The main estimates in this sector have also decreased. For 
example, planned spending for the Department of Canadian 
Heritage in 1996-97 will decline by 4.4 per cent relative to the 
1995-96 level.
<P>
	Many are aware of the significant changes which are occurring 
in the natural resource based program sector. This sector, which 
accounts for 5 per cent of direct program spending, supports 
sustainable development to maximize economic benefits while 
protecting and enhancing the quality of our environment.
<P>
	For example, in agricultural programs we are moving in 
partnership with the provinces from commodity based agricultural 
subsidies to a whole farm safety net focusing on income 
stabilization rather than income support.
<P>
	Costs are also being reduced in the natural resource based 
programs by addressing overlap and duplication. Consolidation of 
activities, such as the merging of the Canadian coast guard fleet 
with that of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans delivers 
services more efficiently to clients.
<P>
	In the industrial, regional and scientific technological sector 
program orientation has been altered significantly. Our objective in 
this sector is to foster economic growth and job creation through 
measures that stimulate private sector investment across Canada, 
encourage regional development and promote and a stronger 
science and technology capability in Canada. Program 
expenditures of $3.6 billion will shift from direct business 
subsidies to more active business support measures. The focus of 
federal regional agencies will be on community based economic 
development and improving access by small and medium sized 
enterprises to commercial financing.  Any remaining direct 
contribution programs will be fully repayable.
<P>
	As a result of the major restructuring initiatives which are under 
way in the transportation sector, transportation programs will 
spend $400 million less in 1996-97 than in 1995-96. Program 
expenditures of $1.9 billion will be redirected from operating and 
subsidizing specific elements of the transportation infrastructure to 
focusing on policy development and ensuring standards for safety 
and security. Furthermore, commercialization of many services is 
being implemented to increase effectiveness in the transportation 
sector and to enhance responsiveness to local needs.
<P>
	The general government services sector includes departments 
and agencies which provide central services in support of 
operations of government. It also includes, under the department of 
finance, transfer payments to the provinces and territories which 
are paid pursuant to the federal-provincial transfer payment 
program.
<P>
	Although transfer payments are not part of the direct program 
expenditures which have been the focus of my remarks, these 
transfer payments to other levels of government like social sector 
transfer payments to persons described earlier, are part of the total 
program spending.
<P>
	Major transfers to all levels of government include the Canada 
health and social transfers, transfers to territorial governments, 
fiscal equalization payments and other major transfers such as 
statutory subsidies and grants in lieu of taxes to municipalities. In 
1996-97, major transfers to other levels of government will total 
approximately $29.1 billion.
<P>
	To return to direct program expenditures, the government 
services sector has rethought how it delivers services in order to 
increase efficiency and cost effectiveness. For example, the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services contains 
three special operation agencies: the Canada Communication 
Group, Consulting and Audit Canada and the Translation Bureau, 
which are financed on a revenue dependent basis. The net spending 
of the Department of Public Works and Government Services will 
decrease by $98 million in 1996-97 as the department continues to 
explore ways to streamline operations and reduce costs.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I would like to conclude my remarks in support of a full supply 
by noting that the government will continue to use innovative 
approaches, new technologies and organizational reforms because 
of the positive results it is achieving in all sectors. The government 
is improving efficiency, reducing costs and making programs more 
responsive to the needs of Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4368"> 4368 </A></B>
<P>
	I trust that members will support our request for full supply in 
the 1996-97 main estimates. We are on the right track of fiscal 
responsibility combined with a better program and service 
delivery for Canadians.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to the speech by the hon. member for 
Bruce-Grey, but I think he did not spend enough time on a 
number of important aspects of votes, which are basically 
unnecessary expenditures.
<P>
	Last week we read in the newspapers about the pay system at the 
Department of National Defence, which is after all pretty 
fundamental and basic and which should work properly. It seems 
that some $40 million were wasted because of a lack of 
modernization in a department that has certainly not lacked for 
funding during the past 20 years. It has always received enough 
money, in generous and significant amounts. During the last few 
years there were cutbacks and bases were closed in the regions, but 
as far as the bureaucracy is concerned, are we not seeing a situation 
where, when we look at the votes, there is a tendency to slowly but 
surely starve the regional branches of a department, while those at 
the decision-making level, in the bureaucracy, at the deputy 
minister level whom we see around here in Ottawa, have been able 
to survive quite easily?
<P>
	I have another question for the hon. member regarding the 
Senate votes. Does it seem reasonable and normal to you that a 
non-elected House, after the Standing Committee on Government 
Operations, whose meetings you attend regularly, adopted a 
resolution, should say: ``Sorry, we will not come and defend our 
budget, we do not have to, we are above that sort of thing''? Does 
this position on the part of the senators seem normal to you? 
Excuse me, I ask this question through you, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jackson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure I can comment on the 
other place, but at the outset let me make this point clear. The 
government intends to make its operations very efficient and 
effective. It intends to be a leaner organization. When we get 
interventions from members of the opposition or the auditor 
general we will try to do the best we can to make the system better.
<P>
	Earlier an hon. member of the Bloc Quebecois asked a similar 
question of my minister. He responded to the first part with regard 
to the department when he said that information will be 
forthcoming.
<P>
	Treasury Board was established to review spending of 
departments and agencies in accordance with the Financial 
Administration Act. In the case of the institutions of Parliament 
such as the House of Commons and the Senate, Treasury Board 
does not perform a review of spending plans but agrees to table 
before the House for consideration their main estimates and  
supplementary estimates. It is a customary courtesy that we 
perform.
<P>
	Questions regarding the detailed spending plans of the Senate 
which are approved annually by Parliament should be referred to 
the chair of the Senate committee on the internal economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for his 
excellent speech and the excellent job he is doing as parliamentary 
secretary to the minister.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to ask him, in his position as parliamentary 
secretary, whether he is happy with the performance of the 
Government of Canada as now being the leader in the world in 
economic development and its prospects for the future. Is the hon. 
member happy to be a parliamentary secretary in a government that 
now leads Japan, the United States, England, Germany, France and 
all the other countries?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jackson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member from Gander for 
his excellent intervention. He is one of those gentleman who I have 
admired since being here.
<P>
	One is never satisfied with what is happening. We are always 
trying to do better. If we are a team and want to be number one 
most of the time, we always have to watch our backs because 
number two is coming up.
<P>
	This House and all its members, not only on the government side 
but on the opposition side, by working together for Canadians who 
have such great resources both in human and in natural resources, 
once we focus on what we do as a country and a government, once 
we look after our young people, our young pages here, our people 
who will come up with the ideas, once we stop the infighting and 
once we have opportunity for everybody within our communities, 
we will continue to be the best country in the world. I thank my 
friend from Gander for asking that question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the 
member for the riding of Saint-Hubert and on behalf of my 
colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois, I would like to say that we are 
opposed to the motion by the President of Treasury Board on Vote 
1, in the amount of $40,713,000 under the heading 
Parliament-Senate being concurred in.
<P>
	The Bloc has always maintained its opposition to the very 
existence of the upper House. We believe that it is not only an 
anachronism but useless. It is particularly outrageous in this day 
and age to ask taxpayers to sink millions in such an institution, 
when the economy is on the verge of collapse, unemployment is 
dangerously high, and services to the public are being drastically 
reduced.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4369"> 4369 </A></B>
<P>
	In a time of budgetary restraint, when Canada's total debt is 
over $500 billion, and when the government is constantly asking 
people to tighten their belt, it is unacceptable to give 104 senators 
a $40 million budget.
<P>
	Over and above a $64,000 annual salary, a $30,000 research 
allowance, a further $20,000 for their office expenses, and a tax 
free expense allowance of more than $10,000, senators enjoy other 
benefits very difficult to justify.
<P>
	The main duty of the Senate is to study bills coming from the 
House of Commons and pass them. The role of the Senate 
duplicates that of House, nothing more, nothing less. Sir John A. 
Macdonald, when defining the role of the second House, called it a 
``House of reflection''. I must admit that in times of budget cuts, I 
find that reflection to be very expensive.
<P>
	Former senator Chaput-Rolland once said that this other House 
was simply a large dormitory. Please do not misunderstand me; I 
have nothing against the senators. It is the institution itself we must 
question. As far as we are concerned, this institution is nothing but 
a club of venerable old partisans whose only purpose is to reward 
friends of the party in power.
<P>
	When we read the Confederation debates, we see that the Fathers 
of Confederation thought the other House was very important. Both 
Macdonald and Cartier wanted it to be a forum for reflection that 
would curtail what they called ``the excesses of democracy''. It is 
logical, a Senate which is not elected but appointed does not have 
to abide by the principles of democracy. On one of the walls in the 
upper House, we can see Cicero's maxim which states: ``The role 
of nobility is to counter the instability of the people.''
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	Therefore, members of the other House are supposed to control 
the elected members of Parliament. In fact, the very existence of 
the Senate is a remnant of elitism which, in a way, runs counter to 
legitimate democracy.
<P>
	Since members of that House are appointed by the Prime 
Minister, it would be absurd to think they would add a reasonable 
and moderating influence to any legislation proposed by the House 
of Commons, without any kind of partisanship.
<P>
	Seats in the Upper House have always been filled by friends of 
the party in power. It is a well-known fact, senators are chosen for 
their political allegiance and their long record of service.
<P>
	When former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau was in 
office, 81 senators were appointed, 71 of whom were of Liberal 
persuasion. When former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney was in 
office, he appointed 42 senators, 41 of whom were Conservatives. 
Since September 15, 1994, the current Prime Minister has 
appointed 17 senators, of course all good Liberal supporters.
<P>
	Consequently, the institution is in no way representative of 
Quebec and Canadian people. Members of that House are at the 
most representatives of the prime minister who appoints them. 
Even though the Upper House has impressive powers and the 
institution is protected in some way by the Constitution of Canada, 
it does not play a very significant role in the federal regime as we 
know it today.
<P>
	As everyone knows, the Upper House of Parliament was created 
by the 1867 Constitution Act to defend regional interests in the 
country and to contribute to political stability by acting as a 
counterbalance to the House of Commons. However, it was 
realized very quickly that this mandate was incompatible with the 
objectives of a centralizing government. In fact, very early in our 
history, it became obvious that the provinces themselves were 
promoting their own interests.
<P>
	Even Senator Peter Bosa said in an article that was published in 
the <I>Canadian Parliamentary Review</I> in 1982 that the Upper House 
did not really represent the regions. He said, and I quote: ``The 
belief that the Senate does not really represent the regions is, I 
think, justified''.
<P>
	While the bicameral system still prevails at the federal level, all 
the provinces where this type of institution existed have considered 
it wise to simply abolish it. That was the case of the province of 
Quebec, which abolished the legislative council in 1968. Quebec is 
no worse off since abolishing this institution.
<P>
	Countries such as New Zealand, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and 
Spain, to name but a few, have a political system based on a single 
representative assembly, not two as in the case of Canada.
<P>
	I realize that a constitutional amendment is required to abolish 
the Upper House. More specifically, under section 41 of the 1982 
Constitution Act, such a change requires not only the unanimous 
approval of the House of Commons and of the provincial 
legislatures, but also the approval of the Upper House itself. 
Moreover, the current constitutional status quo plays in favour of 
maintaining this institution, even though polls show that the public 
supports its abolition.
<P>
	According to a Gallup poll conducted in 1993, 54 per cent of 
Canadians are in favour of abolishing the Senate. In Quebec, the 
results are more conclusive since 68 per cent of Quebecers support 
such a measure. Quebecers and Canadians are very clear on this 
issue.
<P>
	For the Bloc, which not only promotes the interests of Quebec 
but also the democratic values of Canadians, the contradiction 
between the arm's length relationship expected of a House of sober 
second thought and the partisanship actually displayed by that 
House is reason enough to oppose any funds that may be allocated 
to that institution.

<P>
	Moreover, since the Upper House does not have to be 
accountable for its financial management, what are Canadians to 
do to get a clear idea of how the public funds allocated to the other 
place have been used? Quebec and Canadian taxpayers are entitled 
to know how public funds are used. After all, taxpayers are those 
providing the money allocated to that House.
<P>
	Yet, we had to wait up till 1991 before a historical first audit of 
the administration of the other House was ever made. The Auditor 
General of Canada thus tabled a report in which we found that the 
Financial Administration Act and the accountability mechanisms 
do not apply to the other House. So, how can Quebec and Canadian 
taxpayers be satisfied that the expenditures of that Parliamentary 
institution are managed efficiently?
<P>
	If my memory serves me well, my colleague for Terrebonne told 
us recently in the House of Commons about a senator who allowed 
himself the luxury of having his office renovated in order to get a 
better view, and this for a mere $100,000. In any case, the auditor 
general put forward in his report 27 recommendations to deal with 
the flaws in the administrative management of the other place. 
However, since the release of that report in March 1991, strangely 
enough, the Upper House has not been subjected to further audits.
<P>
	In my opinion, it is high time this government understood that 
sound management of public administration must begin with a 
careful and above all efficient use of taxpayers' money.
<P>
	Since the Upper House does not contribute at all to the working 
of our modern democracy, I find it useless to allocate $40 million 
every year to that institution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this debate on the outrageous symbol the 
Senate has become, given our current political and economic 
situation.
<P>
	There is obviously something repugnant in the fact that senators 
refuse to appear to justify their budgetary votes. These people are 
not elected, they are not accountable to anybody except their 
friends who have appointed them, and they refuse to appear before 
the elected representatives to justify their operating expenditures 
and the total budget allocated to them.
<P>
	When we talk about the Senate as a whole, the expenditures we 
are talking about today are only the vote of $43 million allocated to 
the Senate, but there is more. We know other costs are paid in part 
by the House or result from the presence of senators here. So, the 
actual costs are much higher. We are talking here of an average of 
at least $500,000 for each senator.
<P>
	Do you think that, in the current context, we can really afford to 
waste tens of millions of dollars year in and year out? Just imagine 
what that adds up to over a period of 20 years. It is more than a 
billion for these people.
<P>
	We can conclude that, after 25 years of constant deficits, the 
amount that has been spent on senators and their operating 
expenditures tops a billion dollars. We figure that a few billion 
dollars of the debt are due to this political institution, which has 
totally outlived its purpose and which has no tie to any serious 
political process that could yield some concrete results.
<P>
	What do they do? That is the question the people in my region 
keep asking me. What do they do? Not much. They come here for a 
few days of rest, they get their pay cheque and then go back where 
they came from. I recently read in a newspaper: ``We contacted the 
senator at his home''-in Fort Lauderdale, I think it was. Fort 
Lauderdale. Indeed, they had contacted him at his home. It is really 
something else to live outside the country when you sit in the 
Senate of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	I would like these people to account for their actions and to 
explain why we should set aside some budgetary votes to pay for 
their operating expenditures. I hope their travel expenses do not 
include their trips between Canada and the United States.
<P>
	Do they have any legitimacy? I said earlier that these people are 
appointed by the Prime Minister or his office and that sometimes, 
depending on the circumstances, the appointment can be seen as 
some kind of reward. Anyone can be appointed, a minister we want 
to get rid of, someone we want to keep out of the way, or a friend 
who did us a few favours. These people are being rewarded for 
services rendered.
<P>
	When you do a Prime Minister or someone who could some day 
become Prime Minister a favour, it is like buying a 6-49 ticket: if 
you are lucky, some day, you could win a seat in the Senate. If you 
are young, you can hit the jackpot, because you get appointed until 
you reach 75 years of age. And at 75, you are not left in the lurch, 
there is a pension plan for senators. Do not worry, you are entitled 
to a gold-plated pension, a nice little cushion.
<P>
	We can laugh about it, but at some point it no longer makes any 
sense and somebody has to put a stop to it. I know that a votable 
motion concerning the abolition of the Senate will be put before the 
House in the near future. I cannot wait to see it. I look at my 
colleagues in this House, especially the hon. member for 
Brome-Missisquoi, who will vote on this issue and will surely 
support our position. He will not have any choice. I know his 
constituents. Some of my relatives live in his riding. These people 
want to sign the petition which is being circulated in my riding to 
have the Senate abolished. I am asking him to circulate the same 
petition  in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4371"> 4371 </A></B>
<P>
his riding. While he is getting people to sign it, he will get to know 
his constituents better and try to convince them. I wish him good 
luck.
<P>
	In short, my colleague talked about a poll where 68 per cent of 
the respondents said, in 1993, that they were in favour of the 
abolition of the Senate. Just think about what that percentage is 
today when cuts are made in social programs, in unemployment 
insurance, when the economic situation is very bad. Listen, the 
number of people in favour of the Senate's abolition cannot double 
because it would exceed 100 per cent, but I am convinced it is 
higher now.
<P>
	In my riding, I started a petition with my colleague of 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup no more than a week ago. We sent 
it to a number of organizations, and answers have started to come 
in. I am even thinking of hiring another staff member in my office 
to handle the petitions because there are so many of them. We got 
close to one thousand signatures in a few days. Think about it. To 
get so many signatures in just a few days is significant. Most 
members who tried it in their riding found out readily that the 
people are spontaneously in favour of the Senate's abolition.
<P>
	And there is something else I would like to add. Not only the 
senators do not do much here, but they do not do much either in 
their region. Normally, most senators are appointed for an area or 
represent a region.
<P>
	In the three years I have been a member of Parliament and have 
followed various matters very closely, I do not recall having 
worked with a senator who represents us. In fact, there is one who 
comes from our region, but he does not represent a specific area, 
just the province of Quebec. When there was heated debate in the 
Senate on such things as the GST and free trade, Prime Minister 
Mulroney, a Conservative, who did not have the support of the 
majority in the Senate, used his power to appoint additional 
senators. The senator from our region is one of those new senators. 
There is probably another senator on the list who is supposed to 
represent us; our region must be grouped together with other 
regions, but nobody knows who the senators are. We do not see 
them. They are not working on any issues. They are not there, they 
are not active, they are nothing but ghosts. They are not even there.
<P>
	I am sure there are people from Abitibi-Témiscamingue 
watching us. If somebody somewhere remembers a matter about 
which a senator actually did something, call and tell us. We would 
really like to know. However, I am sure the phone is not about to 
start ringing because we have not seen any senators regularly.
<P>
	By the way, if you want to sign the petition and you do not know 
where to find it, you can call our office at 1-800-567-6433 and we 
will be happy to send it to you. You can then circulate it in your 
area.
<P>
	Some of my colleagues talked about the process. Not only is it 
outrageous to waste money, but look at how inflexible our political 
system is. Despite the obvious will of the people, particularly in 
Quebec, to see the Senate abolished, and even if the House of 
Commons were to vote in favour of abolishing the Senate, which I 
hope it will soon, the senators themselves would also have to say 
yes for the Senate to be abolished.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	We are therefore giving them a veto, as it were, over their future, 
and do you think that in the end they will agree to disappear of their 
own accord? The only way that will happen is if there is so much 
pressure that they are forced to resign, because it is embarrassing to 
be a senator and they can no longer show their face. They will have 
the option of joining our other colleague in Fort Lauderdale. That is 
one possibility, but, that aside, for those of them who want to live 
in Quebec and in Canada, it will be difficult explaining to people 
that they are taking money from the federal government to sit in the 
Senate.
<P>
	This shows clearly how far they have gone to protect themselves. 
It proves one thing, which is that these people were probably 
worried about being criticized one day and having their future hang 
in the balance.
<P>
	This being the case, what we can hope for is more support. I urge 
people, particularly those in my riding, in my region, to add their 
voices and their signatures to the petition that is circulating and that 
will be tabled here in the House, particularly around the third hour 
of debate that remains on a motion by the Bloc Quebecois to have 
the Senate abolished. That is one thing we can do, something 
concrete. The more signatures we get, the more it will show that we 
have the support of the public.
<P>
	Now, there are people who would like to reform the Senate, 
make a few adjustments, fix it up. That, too, has serious 
limitations, because I am not sure that the public wants to see 
another political level added. Take the case of Quebec, where 
people are already voting in municipal, provincial and federal 
elections. And school boards are elected as well, I almost forgot 
about that. More and more, people are talking about 
decentralization, but we do not know exactly what is going to 
happen. Probably, when decentralization comes, there will be some 
accountability. We can therefore assume people will exercise their 
franchise at a more local level, but in any case above the municipal 
level.
<P>
	Are we going to add, on top of all that, a level of elected 
representatives in Ottawa who will monitor other elected 
representatives? Our best monitors are the public. When these 
people get sick and tired of having us around, after four years they 
can wield their pencils and turf us out.
<P>
	In fact, if we look at the last election, they exercised that right 
brilliantly and quickly changed the colour and  perspective of 
Parliament. So I think they are capable of looking after their own 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4372"> 4372 </A></B>
<P>
interests. Citizens are informed and follow the debates and the 
major issues. The media are there to pass the information on.
<P>
	The concept of having a committee of elders, even if they were 
to be elected, is something I am not sure the public would accept. 
In fact, we are working very hard to get rid of a whole political 
level. And we certainly would not want to add another one with the 
Senate.
<P>
	That being said, I am personally not very keen on this debate. It 
is also a fact that some provinces would like to take advantage of 
this debate to make all provinces equal in Canada. However, 
Quebec will never tolerate having only one-tenth of the 
representation in a Canadian parliamentary forum, when it has one 
quarter of the population. In Quebec, that would not get much 
support.
<P>
	When there were discussions on proposals by western Canada 
for Senate reform, Quebec Liberals did not support those 
proposals.
<P>
	As I said earlier, it would be interesting to see in the weeks to 
come-because this fall, this will be a much discussed issue-what 
the attitude will be of members opposite. Liberal members who tell 
us about the need for efficient and effective management, for 
cutting waste and unnecessary spending, and I see some members 
here in the House who have said so many times, who do so in 
committee and who attack all fiscal expenditures and the rest, they 
will have to prove they mean what they say.
<P>
	Now, those people may mean what they say about making an 
effort and tightening their belts, but they are not even called to 
account. Sure, they will make cuts in places where they have 
friends, friends they appointed, and it may hurt them a little. We 
call that cutting the fat. That will not hurt anyone.
<P>
	Besides, these people are not penniless. They are paid for 
services rendered. I do not think this will dramatically affect the 
financial situation of the people who are there. It will not cause a 
major social tragedy. There will be no need to set up committees of 
therapists or psychologists to help people cope with the shock of 
losing a job with the Senate. So there will no serious damage.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	Consider that between now and the year 2000, between 250 and 
300 million dollars will be wasted. Will this be stopped? We say 
yes. We say it must stop. I hope members opposite will have the 
courage to act accordingly, including the hon. member for 
Brome-Missisquoi.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with some degree of attentiveness to the member's arguments that 
he was putting forth in his speech. There are a few questions I 
would like him to  answer based on what he was telling me, which 
of course does not conform with Reform Party policy.
<P>
	He talked about wanting to abolishing the Senate. That is fine. 
However when we take a look at what the Bloc's sister party is 
saying in the province of Quebec and indeed what the Bloc 
Quebecois is saying, it is that they will not respect the rule of law 
regardless of what the court decides for example in the Bertrand 
case; that the rule of law can be ignored, thrown out the window by 
a political party such as the Bloc Quebecois and its sister party, the 
Parti Quebecois in Quebec.
<P>
	The Senate has been as we know a chamber of sober second 
thought. The reason we have a chamber of sober second thought is 
that periodically, maybe once in a hundred years, there are times 
when we need a check and a balance on the headstrong attitudes of 
people who are elected to office. That time is perhaps now when we 
see what is happening here in this House by a party of separatists 
who want to break up the country and by a party in Quebec which is 
in government yet has stated quite clearly and quite succinctly that 
it will ignore the courts and the rule of law in this country.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has stood in this House repeatedly and 
told us how important it is in a democracy. Surely the need for a 
Senate to guarantee that sober second thought is important in a 
democracy rather than abolishing it and allowing a party 
headstrong, without real commitment to democracy to go ahead 
and do what it thinks is right. I would like the hon. member's 
opinion on the sober second thought versus the abolishment.
<P>
	Another point I was concerned about is the waste of money and 
of course we as Reformers are concerned about wasting money. He 
was quite critical of the cost. He mentioned the pensions and 
everything else that we pay for members in the other place.
<P>
	I think back to about a year ago when the government introduced 
a gold plated pension plan, which Reformers objected to. 
Reformers felt that we could not participate in it because there are 
so many thousands of Canadians out there who have practically no 
money at all, who are virtually destitute. Yet this government felt it 
more important to give themselves a gold plated pension plan 
rather than looking after the seniors and the poor people, but that is 
another argument.
<P>
	My point is that the Bloc Quebecois members voted for the gold 
plated pension plan to be paid for by Canadians while they want to 
leave the country. I found that a bit confusing. They want to leave 
but they want us to pay for them after they have left. To me that 
would seem to be a tremendous waste of money. Canadians would 
have to pay a pension to separatists after they had left the country.
<P>
	I would like the member to comment on the waste of money on 
pensions to MPs, especially separatist MPs,  versus money paid to 
pensions in the other place. Also, I am serious when I ask about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4373"> 4373 </A></B>
<P>
sober second thought. It may only be once in a hundred years that 
we need that sober second thought, but perhaps this is the time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, as caucus chairman, I might have told 
the hon. member that he was out of order, but I can understand that 
great tolerance is shown.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	I find that somewhat regrettable. Reform members always talk 
about members' pensions. This issue seems to bother them quite a 
lot; it seems to be their main concern. I do not know if it is because 
they have financial worries, but there are many other problems 
which have to be examined. It is somewhat regrettable that their 
analysis is so simplistic.
<P>
	I would like to come back to a comment made by the hon. 
member, in particular with regard to respect for the law. Of course, 
he toed the same line as the Minister of Justice, saying that 
sovereignists have no respect for the law, that they would not abide 
by the law or the Constitution.
<P>
	What I want to point out is that, as one involved in politics, my 
primary concern is respecting the will of the people, respecting the 
democratic will. That is what democracy is all about. As well, 
when that opinion is voiced in a consultation like a referendum, I 
think that respecting democratic will ought to be the primary 
concern. And so it was. In the last referendum, 49.5 per cent of 
people said they wanted sovereignty. Yet no one said: ``Let us go 
ahead anyway, because 49.5 per cent is enough''. Everyone said: 
``No, we did not succeed and will have to work harder to try to win 
next time''. Not only will we try, but we will win next time.
<P>
	That is what respecting the democratic will of the people is all 
about. I am pleased to see that we even seem to be gaining 
supporters from the other side.
<P>
	As politicians, our first concern must be to respect the will of the 
people. As for abolition of the Senate, that we will not do, because 
it is impossible, the law does not allow it. Since the law does not 
allow it, let us not change the situation. If the law does not allow it, 
and the will of the people is something different, let us change the 
laws to reflect the will of the people, particularly if that will is 
expressed in democratic consultations held within the rules. That is 
what we sovereignists are doing.
<P>
	I would like to tell the hon. Reform member that he should be 
consistent. He is so concerned by public finances that, instead of 
wanting to bolster the Senate, improve its powers, he should 
instead rally around a position that is far closer to current reality 
and to what people want, which is to demand, and what is more to 
ensure, that the government will be forced to vote for the  
disappearance of an institution that is useless, out of date, and very 
costly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity this evening to talk 
about the main estimates.
<P>
	I would like to begin my comments by clearly and unequivocally 
stating that I support the government in its spending estimates. I 
also support the adoption of the full estimates. I reject all of the 
amendments that have been placed on the Order Paper by the 
opposition.
<P>
	I support the Prime Minister, the finance minister and indeed all 
of the cabinet. I believe and the Canadian people have 
demonstrated in poll after poll they understand that we have 
demonstrated sound fiscal management of this nation over the past 
three years. That is reflected in poll after poll where we hear 
Canadians saying very clearly that they have confidence in the 
Prime Minister and the Liberal Party but have very little 
confidence in those parties which sit opposite in this House.
<P>
	There is a very clear reason for that. It is because the Liberal 
government clearly understands that it has a dual responsibility in 
government. It understands that it has a fiscal responsibility. It 
understands that it is necessary to make sure that there is full value 
for every tax dollar that is spent and that Canadians have an 
efficient government and one that is operating like a business 
although understanding that it is not a business.
<P>
	Besides the fiscal responsibility, this government understands 
that it has a social responsibility. We collectively have a social 
obligation to each other in society. We have operated in this nation 
for well over 50 years with a collective understanding that we will 
not allow individual Canadians to fall below a certain level.
<P>
	When people go to a hospital in this country the first question 
they are asked is not how much money they have or what is their 
insurance plan. They are asked: ``How are you ill and how can we 
help''?
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	We have people in this country who need social support from the 
government. This government is determined that it will adhere to 
that social responsibility in addition to its fiscal responsibility.
<P>
	The sound management of our country has worked well. It has 
led to good economic fundamentals which have led to economic 
growth, which has increased job creation, all while maintaining 
those critical support programs for Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to spend a few minutes looking at the 
responsibilities the government has undertaken, both fiscally as 
well as on the social side. The Minister of Finance in his last three 
budgets has clearly demonstrated sound fiscal management.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4374"> 4374 </A></B>
<P>
	We have taken the nation from a deficit of approximately 6.4 
per cent of GDP and as we promised in this fiscal year we will 
have reduced that amount to 3 per cent of GDP. The minister in 
his last budget went beyond that and indicated it will be 2 per cent 
of GDP in the following fiscal year.
<P>
	Percentages can sometimes be difficult to grasp. To put it in 
dollar terms, the finance minister will be reducing the deficit by 
some $25 billion. Even more important than the actual amount of 
the deficit reduction has been what has been done in terms of 
borrowing needs, the actual amount the government must borrow 
from the markets, the amount on which is incurred additional 
interest costs. When the government came to power it was 
borrowing almost $30 billion annually. By the next fiscal year it 
will be reduced to $6 billion. It will be the lowest level of 
borrowing by a federal government in almost 30 years. That is the 
key. If borrowing is reduced, interest costs will be reduced. If 
interest costs are reduced then financial resources are available to 
use in other critical areas. The government has done that well.
<P>
	The government has done a good job of reducing expenditures. 
The program review undertaken by the President of the Treasury 
Board shows a $14 billion expenditure reduction. The government 
has gone from a program expenditure of 16 per cent of GDP down 
to 12 per cent. That 12 per cent figure is the best a federal 
government has done since World War II. Since World War II it has 
done as good or better than any other government in taking control 
of its program expenditures.
<P>
	When we look a the cumulative effect of the finance minister's 
three budgets and the cumulative effect on the 1998-99 budget 
period, it will be collective savings of $28.9 billion. That is a 
government that is committed to sound fiscal management and 
committed to keeping its expenditures under control.
<P>
	The size of government has been reduced. The size of the civil 
service has been reduced. We are making sure that government 
does things right, prudently and efficiently.
<P>
	We made another major change from previous governments with 
absolutely no increases in personal income tax. Compare than to 
what the finance minister mentioned during question period, the 39 
tax increases in the previous government's regime.
<P>
	We do not have sound fiscal management just for the sake of it. 
The interest is not just simply to keep individuals on Bay Street, 
Wall Street or Tokyo or London markets happy. That is not the 
motive for sound fiscal management. The motive is to create an 
environment in which jobs can be created. Sound fiscal 
management is allowing things to happen because we have been 
able to see strong economic fundamentals exist in this country. 
These strong economic fundamentals are  allowing the private 
sector to do what it does best and that is create jobs. It is working.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	The unemployment rate has dropped from 11.1 per cent to 9.3 
per cent and 650,000 new jobs have been created. Is it enough? Is it 
something to which we just say great and rest? Obviously not. 
There is much more work to be done on the job creation side. Good 
and substantial progress has been made. It is coming about because 
of sound management by the government. Those economic 
fundamentals that I speak of are familiar to us all but I would like 
to enunciate some of them because it is important.
<P>
	Interest rates are low. They have dropped almost four points in 
the last year. Indeed, for the first time in a long time, short term 
interest rates are actually below those of the Americans. That has a 
real and important impact on Canadians. If there is a three point 
decrease in interest rates and a person's $100,000 mortgage comes 
up for renewal, that means a saving of about $3,000 a year in after 
tax dollars. That is putting money back into the hands of 
Canadians. It is stimulating consumer demand and creating jobs.
<P>
	Inflation is at its lowest sustained level in 30 years. It is a strong 
economic fundamental that is encouraging people to invest in 
Canada, to invest in jobs.
<P>
	Canadian exports have increased by 40 per cent in the last three 
years. The government has worked hard in that area, on the whole 
Team Canada approach where the Prime Minister has gone abroad 
and helped sell Canadian business. Through the Team Canada 
approach, almost $20 billion in new trade contracts have been put 
together.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier in continuing with economic 
fundamentals, the reduction of the deficit and, most important, the 
reduction of borrowing needs means that the government is no 
longer crowding out the private sector for much needed investment 
capital. All these economic fundamentals are leading to job 
creation. Six hundred and fifty thousand-plus jobs is the net 
increase since the government took office.
<P>
	The Liberal government also understands that there are times 
when it is necessary to directly intervene in critical areas of the 
economy to help with job creation and with employment. In the last 
budgetary cycle and since, there have been some good examples of 
the targeting of resources to areas where they are needed and where 
they will have the best impact.
<P>
	In the last budget the finance minister announced a $315 million 
investment in youth employment, an area of critical importance, an 
area of critical need. The government has recognized it and has 
responded to it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4375"> 4375 </A></B>
<P>
	High technology is a growth area in Canada. It is an area that 
is capable of creating jobs in large numbers. The government has 
invested in the high technology area.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry announced a $150 million fund which 
will grow to $250 million to help support growth in the high tech 
area. It is not simply government throwing the money at the high 
tech area. It is being done in partnership with the private sector, 
with a sharing of risk and a sharing of reward on those things that 
are successful. There has been a $50 million investment in the 
Business Development Bank of Canada to assist in the high tech 
field, again to support emerging growth industries that can help 
create jobs.
<P>
	I mentioned one of the fundamentals. The export area is an area 
of growth and an area of job creation. The last budget had a $50 
million increase in the money available to EDC to help firms that 
are exporting.
<P>
	Over the three years of the government, important investments 
have been made. The infrastructure program was widely accepted 
across the land. It has helped not only create short term jobs, but 
also long term jobs by putting in place the infrastructure that is 
needed for the development of industry that is needed for the 
development of long term jobs. That has taken place as part of this 
infrastructure program.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	There has been other assistance for job creation. The Minister of 
Human Resources Development has put together a $300 million 
transitional fund which is meant to help areas of high 
unemployment with economic development and job creation. It is a 
specific need, and a specific action has been taken to meet that 
need.
<P>
	We have seen the five employment tools brought out as part of 
the employment insurance reform which will help individual 
Canadians in obtaining employment and helping them to be 
reintegrated into the workforce.
<P>
	The government has always understood that one of the engines 
of the economy, one of the things that drives job creation, drives 
economic growth, puts the people back to work, particularly in an 
area like mine of Parry Sound-Muskoka, is the support of the 
small business sector. It is the engine that drives the economy. It is 
where new jobs are being created in the Canada of 1996 and well on 
into the 21st century.
<P>
	Many things have been done to help in that area. A major thing 
has been working to increase the access to capital for these 
businesses, not simply by saying that government can be the lender 
to all businesses, but by working with the private sector to insist 
that it provides additional capital to the small business men and 
women, the entrepreneurs who are out there.
<P>
	Over the last two years through the work of the industry 
department and in particular the industry committee, a number of 
tools have been developed with  the chartered banks: a code of 
conduct that governs the relationship between a bank and the small 
business person; an alternative dispute resolution system; a 
mediation process when there are disputes; an ombudsman in each 
of the banks; an industry ombudsman that can deal with problems 
that cannot be dealt with within the organization.
<P>
	Most important, the banks have agreed to provide Parliament 
quarterly with their small business lending statistics. Then we can 
evaluate. We will know it is not just words we hear that these codes 
of conduct mean something. We can actually see what their lending 
is to small businessmen and women in this country. We can react 
when we do not believe it is happening the way it should.
<P>
	These are important tools. Progress is being made. Much yet 
needs to be done in terms of access to capital but progress is being 
made and we are working to help small businessmen and women.
<P>
	There are some direct things we have been able to do in that 
respect as a government. The amount of money available to the 
Business Development Bank of Canada this past year has been 
increased from $3 billion to $15 billion. There is the small business 
loan program, a government guaranteed loan program, which the 
chartered banks and others administer. That has been increased 
from $4 billion to $12 billion, again to allow more access to the 
small business sector.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry began the community investment plan. 
Communities will be allowed to bring together the small business 
people in their areas with individuals who have investment capital. 
The two will be brought together in partnership to help their 
individual communities grow.
<P>
	Recently I had an opportunity to work with both the chartered 
banks and the community futures organizations. They have entered 
into a program that will see $2 million flow from the chartered 
banks to community futures in rural Canada, rural Ontario. This 
will provide more capital at the higher risk end. Small businessmen 
and women who are having difficulty accessing capital can go to 
the community futures and be able to borrow.
<P>
	Obviously we have worked hard in the area of small business to 
provide it with the tools it needs to create jobs in our communities.
<P>
	It is not just a matter of fiscal management, it is not just a matter 
of getting the economic fundamentals right. All of that is important 
in government, but we also have to remember our social 
responsibility, and this government lives up to that very much.
<P>
	Look at some of the expenditure figures from the last budget: 
OAS, $21.9 billion; employment insurance, $13.8 billion; CHST, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4376"> 4376 </A></B>
<P>
$26.9 billion; veterans affairs, $1.8  billion. This is a government 
that cares about individual Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, when evaluating whether or not these things have 
worked for Canada, when you evaluate whether this government 
has done a good job for Canada it is simply a matter of asking some 
questions. Is the unemployment rate down? Yes it is. Are more 
Canadians working today than three years ago? Yes there are. Has 
the deficit been reduced in the last three years? Yes it has. Are 
expenditures down? Yes they are. Are interest rates down? Indeed 
they are, by more than three points. Are exports up? Yes, 40%. Has 
our tourism deficit been reduced? Absolutely, by more than $3 
million. The best question to ask, and it has been asked three years 
in a row by the United Nations, is Canada the best country in the 
world? Absolutely, it is the best country in the world. We have 
made good progress as a government. There is still much to be 
done and we are committed as a government to doing it.
<P>
	Our government's actions and performance has been one of 
strong actions, hard work and most of all, as I just indicated, one of 
accomplishments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in his speech, my 
colleague from Parry Sound-Muskoka tried to praise the 
government for its good management, comparing the running of 
the government to that of a major corporation or any business 
doing well in the private sector.
<P>
	I would like him to tell us how he can make such a comparison in 
view of certain careless mistakes on the part of the government and 
certain measures it did not take when it could have. We realize that, 
in the private sector, decisions are made every day to ensure that 
each department of a particular company is financially viable, that 
the business turns a profit, and that every penny which can be saved 
is.
<P>
	The most recent example is CP Rail, which has just been 
privatized. We noticed that, as soon as it was privatized, CP Rail 
took all the least profitable parts of its system to form one 
company, which is going to try to make the eastern system more 
profitable. This company is giving itself three years to succeed.
<P>
	This is the kind of management you find in the private sector. 
Has the government done the same thing with the Senate since 
1867? How can the government claim it has taken the necessary 
steps to reduce expenditures to the bare minimum, and that it has 
gotten rid of the non-profitable parts of its enterprise?
<P>
	How can the member justify a propaganda campaign such as was 
undertaken concerning the Canadian flag? Is this ongoing $23 
million expenditure justifiable under  the broad principles of good 
management referred to by the member?
<P>
	Could the hon. member tell me which large and well managed 
company, which large Canadian, Quebec or Ontario company 
would keep 104 directors who, most of the time, are asleep at their 
desk, and that we pay presumably to check decisions already made 
by other directors?
<P>
	Always from the point of view of sound management, would a 
single profitable company behave in such a fashion? Yet, that is 
what the government is doing with the Senate. Today, we are being 
asked to approve a $50 to 60 million budget, for a single year, to 
support 104 senators who no longer have anything to do regarding 
the profitability of the large Canadian company called Parliament.
<P>
	Could the hon. member tell me that sound management 
principles apply in the case of the Senate? How can the hon. 
member reconcile this ignorance of Parliament for an obsolete 
institution which should be done away with as soon as possible? I 
would like the hon. member to answer that question.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to clarify a number of points 
the hon. member made.
<P>
	In terms of comparing the government to a business, I said very 
clearly that the government had to operate in a businesslike manner 
but at the same time understand that it was not a business.
<P>
	We undertake things in the House not to make a profit. We 
support medicare not to make a profit. We support Canadian over 
age 65 not to make a profit. We make sure there is an EI system not 
to make a profit but because government understands it has a social 
responsibility and acts collectively on behalf of all Canadians. It is 
important to understand that.
<P>
	We talked a bit about fiscal management. What is the fiscal 
management of the government? I will remind the hon. member of 
a $25 billion reduction in the deficit and collective savings of $28.9 
billion. That is fiscal management.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about propaganda. I want to tell all 
members in the House and everyone watching television that 
having pride in Canada, being patriotic about the country, 
understanding its history or living day by day with a love of the 
country in one's heart is not propaganda. It is being a good 
Canadian. I am proud of the country and the Canadians who live in 
it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the member's long speech on anything other than 
the other place, which is the motion we are supposed to be debating 
at the moment. We are debating the estimates and the motion 
pertaining to the  other place at the moment. We will vote on the 
larger issue of the estimates later today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4377"> 4377 </A></B>
<P>
	Many Canadian feel the other place is largely superfluous and 
perhaps is a waste of money. If we have to listen to more speeches 
like we have from the member, Canadians will start thinking that 
this House is superfluous. There was nothing but unabashed 
promotion of what the government thinks it has accomplished for 
Canadians.
<P>
	I remember jobs, jobs, jobs as being the cry during the last 
election. We all remember that. Unemployment is barely less than 
10 per cent today and families need more and more part-time jobs, 
several jobs. It is more difficult for them to make ends meet. They 
feel more and more pressed as their standard of living is getting 
squeezed. These are the real facts being published in the tons of 
paper emanating from government offices. When we look at the 
fine print we find that Canadians are not enjoying greater 
prosperity and they do not have all these jobs the government 
promised.
<P>
	When we take a look at the deficit we see that it is coming down, 
but the point is that the deficit has come down strictly because tax 
revenues have gone up. A $25 billion reduction is exactly the 
amount of additional revenue the government is getting from the 
Canadian taxpayer, and government members stand and say what a 
wonderful job of management of the deficit they are doing.
<P>
	A month from now the Minister of Finance will have an 
announcement saying our new target is 1 per cent of GDP. He will 
not say that it will come down because we will squeeze even more 
taxes out of Canadians. He will talk about the fact that he has not 
raised taxes. That is wonderful but he does not say he is eliminating 
tax deductions for seniors. He proposed in his last budget that the 
first $1,000 of pension income which used to be tax free would no 
longer be tax free. That sounds like a tax increase to me.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> It is a grab.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams: </B>Seniors who have been entitled to an exemption 
of around $3,000 to $4,000, to reduce their tax bill because they are 
over 65, will have that tax deduction eliminated. That seems to me 
to be an increase. Why does the hon. member feel he can stand and 
tell Canadians that everything is coming up roses when they feel 
things are getting bad out there?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I differ with the hon. member's 
interpretation of things. If we look at pollster after pollster who 
talks to Canadians, they come back each and every time and 
demonstrate confidence not only in the government but in the 
Prime Minister. The member is right that more work needs to be 
done, but 650,000 new jobs were created.
<P>
	He went on to talk about nothing being done on the deficit. 
Indeed the deficit is coming down by $25 billion. Then he said that 
we cannot count new revenue coming in; that is not allowed. He 
ought to talk to the finance critic in his party who puts together its 
budgetary plan which calls for over $20 billion of new revenue to 
come into the government.
<P>
	Maybe he would want to talk to his finance critic if he does not 
accept the fact that economic growth is one of the ways to bring 
down the deficit. Perhaps he wants to be like all the other 
Reformers who feel the only way to do it is to slash and burn and 
take away from the most needy Canadians. A balanced approach 
does things: economic growth along with sound fiscal 
management.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Could you 
clear up the matter of what is under debate right now? Reformers 
have made the point that they believe we are confined to a debate 
on the Senate. Is that correct? Or, are they wrong again?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The member has put the 
Chair in a strait-jacket. Suffice it to say I will not rule on right or 
wrong.
<P>
	The debate is open in its fullness on the estimates. Correctly a 
notice of opposition was put forward by the Reform Party with 
regard to the other place. Other notices of motions have been put on 
the order paper with regard to other departments. However this 
debate, which could last until 10 p.m. this evening, is on the 
fullness of the estimates. I hope that answers the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am glad to see that you are not caught in a strait-jacket. That would 
be unfortunate.
<P>
	It will be difficult to top the bombastic statements we just 
endured from the other side. Maybe I am capable of it. We will see 
as the debate goes on.
<P>
	I want to talk about the other place somewhat. The issue today is 
a good one. I saw it starting today in a press conference. Today was 
the day the Senate was asked to appear before the House some time 
before the end of this sitting day to explain itself, to account for the 
money it is spending.
<P>
	On May 9 the member for Comox-Alberni, when on the 
Standing Committee on Government Operations, sent a letter 
asking the Senate for an accounting of how it was spending its 
money. It was not an absurd request. It is a public body and has a 
$40 million budget. It is spending taxpayers' dollars and we think 
we should be entitled to see how it is spent.
<P>
<B>(1830 )</B>
<P>
	The Senate says it is not going to respond to the letter. Not only 
that, it is not going to respond to any demands by the House of 
Commons. It answers to no one, which is not entirely true. It does 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4378"> 4378 </A></B>
<P>
answer to someone and it does  dance to a tune, but it dances to the 
party tune of the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	I was in the House when the Prime Minister stood and said: ``I 
will appoint people to the Senate and the people I appoint will be 
good Liberals who will do as they are told''. The senators answer to 
no one publicly. They answer behind the scenes to the man who sits 
over at that desk, and that is a shame.
<P>
	There are people in Canada, especially in the west-I will not 
speak for all of Canada; I do not claim to have omniscience. People 
in most parts of Canada have said for a long time that we need 
some Senate reform and if there is going to be a Senate, it should be 
accountable. It should be through election so that if the senators are 
not doing their jobs of representing their home provinces or 
regions, they can be yanked out of office. As Mr. Manning Senior, 
the former senator, said in times past: ``It is a place of protocol, 
Geritol and alcohol''. Is that true? I hope not, but if it were, the 
senators should be accountable. They should be accountable. They 
should be able to be pulled back through an election but that cannot 
happen.
<P>
	Senators should have some job to do. Does anybody really know 
what the job of the Senate is? We in this place know that the 
Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod traipses in here once in a while. 
He hammers on the door and we traipse there, they traipse here, but 
does anybody really know what they do?
<P>
	I suppose senators do some effective work but we cannot know 
because we cannot look at the budget. They will not explain where 
they spend their money. They will not tell us. They just send us the 
bill and we just sign the cheque. That is unacceptable.
<P>
	This is not just a Reform Party issue. In 1926 there was a study 
published entitled ``The Unreformed Senate of Canada'', by Robert 
MacKay. I do not think anybody here was involved in writing this. 
Here is what was said some 70 years ago:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The House of Lords still represents an important class in the community; the 
American Senate, even before it was elected directly by the people of the various 
states, represented the states-the Canadian Senate as a House of Parliament 
represents nothing. The Senate-is a bribery fund in the hands of the Government, 
and paddock for the `Old Wheel Horse' of the Party, nor on its present footing, can it 
ever be anything else-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Probably on no other public question in Canada has there been such unanimity of 
opinion as on that of the necessity for Senate reform.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	People were saying that 70 years ago. Maybe some people define 
Canadianism as not being American.
<P>
	The other common thread we seem to be hearing often on the 
Senate in answer to the question ``do you respect the Senate'' is 
that they do not. This answer comes from all Canadians whether 
they are from Quebec-the members sitting here-from the west 
or  from Atlantic Canada. The reason is the Senate does not give 
them a chance to respect it.
<P>
	As we are talking about the estimates tonight, the Senate will not 
account for the money it is spending. We are coming up to an 
election year. It is possible that an election will be held in the 
spring of 1997, the fall of 1997, who knows? As we gear up toward 
that election, what is the Senate spending its money on? I have 
some suspicions.
<P>
	I see prominent members of the Senate appointed to prominent 
positions on the Liberal campaign team. They seem to be chief 
fundraisers, chief message boys, chief organizers, chief election 
readiness people. I saw a similar thing happen. I was an observer at 
the PC convention-I do not want to pick only on Liberals-but 
their chief organizers were from the Senate. Why? Because the 
taxpayer pays the bills.
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	Senators travel the country, they do not have to account to 
anybody, they do not have to show up, they do not have to sit on a 
committee. They do not have to do anything. All they have to do is 
answer to the person in the chair over there, the leader of the 
government. That is all they have to answer to.
<P>
	There are limits on spending for political parties. There are 
limits on how much we can raise and spend on advertising, all that 
kind of stuff, but there are no limits on what is being spent 
indirectly through the Senate. That is unfortunate and there seems 
to be no thirst or willingness on the part of the government-and 
there is complicity in this, of course-to force the Senate to come 
forward.
<P>
	We do not have to give these people the money. We could force 
them to come forward. Maybe they are spending it wisely. I have 
my doubts but at least we could come forward and debate that if we 
could see it but we cannot see it.
<P>
	I have a quote from the auditor general in 1991. He said: 
``Frequently senators and senior management do not know whether 
operations are achieving their intended purposes or are being 
carried out in an economical and efficient manner''. This is from 
our auditor general, a neutral person, who says that they do not 
even know in the Senate whether they are spending their money 
wisely or efficiently. All of this would be a moot point-maybe I 
am a snarky Reformer with a bad attitude-if that were true.
<P>
	In 1990 the Prime Minister said: ``The Liberal government in 
two years will make the Senate elected''. That promise is gone. In 
1991 the Prime Minister said it again. It is in Hansard. What has he 
done so far? He has appointed 14 people to the Senate. The 
headlines in the paper read: ``Chrétien Senate plums make 
Mulroney look like a piker'' and ``The PM's sad slide on the 
Senate''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4379"> 4379 </A></B>
<P>
	The Senate should be elected. More than that, it should be 
accountable. It should have to account for the money it spends. 
I should have to out of my member's budget; this House should 
have to; the Speaker in the Chair should have to; all of us should 
have to account for public funds. The fact that the Senate will not 
account for it and will not report back is an indictment in and of 
itself.
<P>
	It is an unfortunate development. I wish the senators had listened 
to the committee and I wish we did not have to have this debate. 
Unfortunately somebody has to call the Senate on the carpet. If the 
Reform Party is the one to do it, I am happy to raise the issue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 
listening to the comments made by my colleague from Fraser 
Valley East, I have a question for him regarding his party's 
platform with regard to the Senate, since what we are hearing on 
this issue is less and less clear: Does the platform of the Reform 
Party of Canada still include an elected, equal and effective Senate 
where each province would have the same number of senators 
chosen by the people?
<P>
	In this respect, I would like to know, in view of the great 
disparity of population between provinces, and I will raise this 
again when I deal with the substance of the motion, how would 
electing senators make them more effective? In my opinion, the 
more equal the Senate becomes, and if it is totally equal as the 
Reform Party has been suggesting so far-total equality among the 
ten provinces-the more likely it will be for its effectiveness to be 
zilch. The Senate will be able to block a piece of legislation for 20 
or 30 days, that is all; as far as money bills, supply bills, and 
allotment of public moneys are concerned, we would still be in the 
same situation.
<P>
	Is the triple E Senate a concept which is still defendable in view 
of the analysis conducted by our colleagues from the Reform 
Party?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly the hon. member has 
identified the party's platform on the triple E Senate. The triple E 
Senate of course has always been the first of our principles in our 
published papers. We do believe in what we call a triple E Senate, 
which is equal numbers from each of the provinces, elected and 
effective. In other words, it needs a job to do, something that 
senators can put their teeth into.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	Our argument on the Senate has always been that the Senate's 
job originally was to represent the regions. Here we have 
representation by population. Quebec is well represented in 
numbers here with the Bloc. I do not always agree with their 
politics, but in numbers it is represented according to population.
<P>
	The Senate on the other hand represents each province with an 
equal number. What we have said is that by doing that, a message is 
sent. For example, in this place where Quebec has 75 seats, it has a 
significant influence on the House of Commons. It is a very 
dominating force. It has a lot of influence and people in key 
figures. It is able to influence matters in the House of Commons 
very well. However, to protect the outlying regions, say a weakly 
populated province like Prince Edward Island or Saskatchewan, 
which are not well represented numberwise, the Senate would 
represent those provinces in the other place, in the Senate itself.
<P>
	By doing that, there is a balance. In the House of Commons, 
there is rep by pop. Rep by pop allows people to know that they 
have as much say as any other one person in the province through 
their representative here. To protect the regions and to protect the 
provinces that do not have huge populations, something else is 
needed. We say that that something else should be a Senate.
<P>
	What could a Senate like that do? The arguments go back and 
forth. Our current Prime Minister said in 1991 that ``the regions of 
Canada need to be more involved in decision making and policy 
making at the national level to meet the hopes and dreams of those 
who live in the west and the Atlantic'', and that ``a reformed Senate 
is essential. It must be a Senate that is elected, effective and 
equitable'', as he called it. ``Such a Senate should have the power 
to examine appointments to important federal institutions and 
agencies''.
<P>
	What that means is there is consensus that the Senate needs a 
job. One of the things it should do is approve of important 
appointments to federal institutions and agencies. If, instead of the 
wife of the current defence minister being in charge of patronage 
appointments-that is her job-would it not be something if we 
had a Senate including the province of Quebec that would be able 
to say: ``On the appointment to the CRTC, we in Quebec have a real 
problem with this person, what they have done, what their 
academic record is, what they stand for and what they have been 
doing''.
<P>
	Someone could step in at that stage and say: ``I am going to put 
the kibosh on this. I will stop this now''. So could people from B.C. 
So could have Alberta during the national energy program. So 
could have people from Manitoba when the F-18 contract was 
hived off. There could be a check and a balance in there.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister said, that would be a good job for the 
Senate. Its job now is not that. Its job right now is election 
readiness. That is its job right now. It is a place where all kinds of 
people who are on the organizational shelf of the Liberal Party have 
been plugged into the key positions. Taxpayers are paying the bills; 
we do not know how much. Senators travel the country at 
taxpayers' expense. They do whatever they want. Nobody knows 
because they are not accountable to anybody. The only one they are 
accountable to is the Prime Minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4380"> 4380 </A></B>
<P>
	That is not right. As the Prime Minister himself has been saying 
for some years now, that is a lousy way to run an upper house. 
The upper house needs to be reformed. It needed to be reformed 
said Mr. MacKay in 1926. It needed to be accountable said the 
auditor general in 1991.
<P>
	In 1991 the Prime Minister said that a reformed Senate is 
essential. Why? ``To meet the hopes and dreams of those living in 
the west and in the Atlantic regions, a reformed Senate is 
essential''. That is the Prime Minister. I wish he would go back and 
read some of his old speeches. I wonder if he realizes the impact 
that this status quo stuff is having on British Columbia.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	When I hear promises being made and then not delivered on I 
wonder if that is part of what makes Quebecers so angry. They were 
promised distinct society in the Constitution and it was not 
delivered. That is a broken promise. Would that not make 
Quebecers angry?
<P>
	From our perspective in the west we were promised Senate 
reform. The Prime Minister promised that within two years an 
elected Senate would be in place. He did not deliver. In 1991 he 
said it has to happen. If we are going to keep the hopes and 
aspirations of the west and Atlantic Canada we have to do 
something to provide an elected Senate. He did not deliver on that. 
In the west what are we supposed to take from that? Was he saying 
what he thought we wanted to hear during the election campaign? 
Did he really sincerely believe it and then find out there was too 
much pressure from within his party or other regions that he could 
not deliver?
<P>
	I do not know what goes on behind closed doors. But I do know 
that in British Columbia the support for the Senate in its current 
form is approaching zero. It is seen as a waste of money. That is 
what we are trying to address here today.
<P>
	If we could address some of those concerns and say to the people 
of British Columbia that the budget is like so, the travel budget is 
like this, and office budgets and so on, then we could say it looks 
like it is all in order and above board. But when we get the auditor 
general saying they are inefficient and have no accountability for 
the way they spend their money I cannot guarantee to the taxpayers 
of B.C. that their money is being well spent.
<P>
	Certainly at a political level when somebody says, including the 
current Prime Minister, that it is not effective, I am not going to 
argue with him. I agree. The message it sends, both on 
accountability and the reform of the political institution itself, is it 
just does not matter and we do not care what you say, or what the 
people in B.C. think, or Quebec or any other region. If that message 
is consistently hammered home by the Prime Minister leading up 
to the next election I do not suppose he will be surprised when he 
comes out to British  Columbia to find a less than hearty welcome 
from people who are expecting some changes.
<P>
	The old poem says that a promise made is a debt unpaid. It is 
from Robert Service. I think that is true for most of us. For 
example, I promised to opt out of the MP pension plan. I did not do 
it because I want to live a life of poverty when I grow old. I did it 
because I promised to do it during the election campaign. I 
promised also to fly economy class, not that I like my legs shoved 
up around my chin. However I made a promise to try and save a 
few dollars. I promised to move into the office of my predecessor 
and make no changes to the furniture. As a matter of fact I used the 
same phones and everything he had so it would not cost any money. 
Those were promises made and I have kept them.
<P>
	I also promised to treat tax dollars as funds held in trust on 
behalf of the taxpayers. I can go back in the next election and say 
that I have kept my promises and I am willing to do it again 
because I will be running again in the next election.
<P>
<B>(1850 )</B>
<P>
	I do not know what we are supposed to read into the fact that the 
Prime Minister will not keep his promise. What Reform reads into 
it, of course, is that the Prime Minister is using this for expediency. 
He is not really interested in Senate reform. He is not really 
interested in accountability. He is not interested in saving a few 
dollars. And he is not really interested in doing better than the 
treading of water that we have seen for three years.
<P>
	I heard the hon. member from the Liberal Party say that he was 
proud of the employment rate that is pushing 10 per cent. I am not 
happy with that. The government has taken $25 billion or more out 
of the economy and I am not happy with that.
<P>
	I am not happy that whenever the heritage minister seems to be 
in a pickle the finance minister can come up with another $150 
million to try to get her out of that bind.
<P>
	I am not happy that the budget is going to be balanced at some 
indefinite date off in the future. I want to see a date where we can 
look forward to some tax relief. There are no promises of tax relief 
and there never will be unless the government makes a promise, 
lays out the plan and then follows through. Following through 
means when you give your word on something. That is a promise 
and it will happen.
<P>
	We had the GST promise which set this in motion but can we 
take them at their word? So far we have not seen any action on the 
GST. The GST that the government will be placing on reading 
material in Atlantic Canada will double once this new agreement 
comes into place.
<P>
	What did the Prime Minister promise? What did the finance 
minister promise when he was in opposition?  There will be no tax 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4381"> 4381 </A></B>
<P>
on reading material. Next month it will be 15 per cent on reading 
material. It is no wonder people are cynical.
<P>
	The Senate in the example we are trying to deal with today is 
numero uno on many people's books of why they feel so cynical 
about Parliament and the way it is run. There is no accountability. I 
believe the government wants us to put up a fuss over this item. 
That is why this particular item on the main estimates has been 
challenged by Reform. We think that Canadians deserve an 
accounting for the money that is being spent on their behalf.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will entertain one other 
question if there should be one to the hon. member. I would ask the 
co-operation of the House. If members from each party 
participating in this debate would indicate to the Chair by way of a 
message to the side later as to whether they are going to be 
speaking for 20 minutes or will be splitting their time allocation 
with a colleague it would be appreciated.
<P>
	I interrupted the hon. member for Fraser Valley East. I believed 
that they were splitting their time. It was not the case in this 
instance so I allowed more time for questions or comments. There 
would be approximately four minutes remaining in that block of 
time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to comment and to reply to the member for Fraser Valley East. I 
was so enthralled with his speech that I ran here from my office just 
to ask this question. It is good to see the hon. member has not lost 
his step or his form since June. I congratulate him on his elevation 
to whip for his party.
<P>
	The GST seems to be an issue that comes back time and time 
again. The hon. member may not be aware of this but in the 
province of Ontario the premier, the day before he was elected, 
made a very solemn commitment to the people of the province of 
Ontario in the same way that we made the same commitment 
toward replacing the GST.
<P>
	The hon. member talks about words and I tend to perhaps fall 
into the category of those cynical voters who want to make sure 
they see something in writing and what they saw was replace the 
GST.
<P>
<B>(1855 )</B>
<P>
	What a lot of people forget, and perhaps this is one of the reasons 
the Reform Party has yet to make any inroads in Ontario, which 
may not happen for some time, is the recognition that the province 
of Ontario and its premier is committed and on record to harmonize 
which is exactly what the government has committed to do.
<P>
	I spent some time over the summer dealing with a number of 
constituents. We had four public forums. I was amazed and 
overtaken by the amount of goodwill, by the number of plaudits 
and by the amount of concern  and support for the last budget 
presented by the Minister of Finance. People from all across the 
political spectrum, people from all backgrounds and all incomes 
were very supportive of the budget in a way that I have not seen 
before.
<P>
	How would the hon. member suggest we can at one time bring 
down the deficit, we can address the financial problems this 
country currently faces and yet at the same time somehow throw 
away or cast fate into the wind with respect to raising revenues, in 
particular the GST? Perhaps the hon. member can refresh my 
memory since he seems to have so much to offer as to whether we 
actually got into the question of the elimination of the GST or does 
he remember reading, as most of my constituents did, replace the 
GST.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know that the member for Ontario 
wants to hear the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I 
am going to give it to him.
<P>
	I know what the red book said. It said replace the GST. 
Canadians all know why the member from Hamilton had to resign. 
It was going to be scrapped, turfed, abolished, done away with, or 
whatever phrase was used. The Prime Minister said: ``This thing 
will be gone, eliminated, trashed''. I know it was in print but I also 
know it was on television and that is why the member had to resign.
<P>
	For ourselves, from the Reform Party's perspective, our words 
during the last election were consistent with our printed material 
and our public pronouncements. What we said was that it was at 
that time not feasible to eliminate the GST but what we had at that 
time was our zero in three plan to eliminate the deficit and then 
reduce and eliminate the GST.
<P>
	We realized during the election campaign that we could not 
promise to eliminate the GST at that time. We were upfront about 
that. I know in my own case in my riding the Liberal candidate said 
he would lie down on the railroad tracks and he was going to fall on 
his sword and commit hara-kiri and what all he would not have 
done because ``you can count on me, that GST is gone''. It was a 
little embarrassing for me to stand up and say: ``The Reform Party 
can't make that promise because it is not the truth'' and so we did 
not promise that.
<P>
	I ran on it and probably lost votes because it is easy to say: 
``Let's get rid of it''. On campaign issues I like to try to tell the 
truth. I am sure the member for Ontario did as well during the 
campaign. Not every politician does. However, on Senate reform 
and on accountability, I am only reading back to him the words of 
his leader. Those words said that Senate should be elected, it should 
be accountable, it should be effective, it should represent the west 
and the Atlantic region and to follow up with the auditor general's 
comments, it should be in whatever form it is efficient and 
accountable for the taxpayers' dollars.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4382"> 4382 </A></B>
<P>
	I stand by those words and I will campaign on those words.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to take part in this debate on the Main Estimates for the 
fiscal year ending March 31, 1997.
<P>
	The session has just begun once again and I must tell you at the 
outset that, as the member of Parliament for Brome-Missisquoi, 
and like many other members in the House, I took advantage of the 
summer months to travel a little around my riding and its 
municipalities to meet people and discuss with them the problems 
that concern them.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	I think it is somewhat the role of a member of Parliament to 
come to the House and to show the colours of the people he 
represents, that is, to relate their concerns and to ensure the 
government responds to these concerns, and that is what the 
government is doing.
<P>
	I will say first of all that the main concern of people is 
employment. We hear about ``job creation'' everywhere. 
Employment is the main concern of people. I would say the second 
one is taxes. People have had it, they are sick and tired of taxes.
<P>
	The third concern is paperwork, bureaucracy. The next one is 
duplication. I will come back, in relation to the main estimates, to 
what we are doing as a government to deal with these issues.
<P>
	The public also wants public administration, at the federal as 
well as the provincial level, to be closer to the people. I am listing 
these concerns in the order in which they were submitted to me. 
Another concern is the need for Quebec's distinctiveness to be 
recognized.
<P>
	Before dealing specifically with the main estimates, it may be 
useful to look back at what the finance minister said when he tabled 
his budget on March 6, 1996. He stated, on behalf of his 
government, the principles for securing the future.
<P>
	First principle for securing the future: governments created the 
deficit problem; now, governments must resolve it. I will come 
back to this later and try to demonstrate that the deficit problem is 
in the process of being resolved.
<P>
	Second principle for securing the future, according to the 
estimates tabled last March for the fiscal year ending next March: 
we must provide hope for jobs and for growth. This is important, 
and it is precisely what we have heard and what elected 
representatives travelling around to meet their constituents have 
heard.
<P>
	Third principle: we must be frugal in everything we do. This 
means spending less money. Simply put, waste is simply not 
tolerable.
<P>
	Fourth: no new spending. We must avoid additional spending 
and reallocate instead. Fifth: we must always be fair and 
compassionate.
<P>
	Those are the principles on which the finance minister's last 
budget was based. In terms of the goals and objectives pursued 
through this budget, we were told that the government should to be 
more responsive and that certain government activities should be 
more focused and affordable.
<P>
	Let us look at some examples, starting with a problem I 
mentioned earlier, namely duplication. Here are two areas where 
we should try to eliminate duplication through legislation. First, 
agriculture. Just for food inspection, you have the Ministry of 
Agriculture and marketing board involved at the provincial level, 
in Quebec, as well as Health Canada and Agriculture Canada at the 
federal level. For a restaurant operating in Montreal, the City of 
Montreal's department in charge of monitoring restaurants in terms 
of public health is also involved.
<P>
	As we can see, a single place can easily be visited by four or five 
different inspectors for the same purpose or for similar purposes. 
The government has introduced a bill respecting the national food 
protection agency. We must look for ways to do better, to improve 
coordination by avoiding duplication. That is what the people want 
and how they expect us to run the country.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	Here is another example. We can talk about revenues. As you 
know, taxes are collected at about every level. At the federal level, 
there are all kinds of taxes, including customs duties. At the federal 
level, taxes are collected in several areas.
<P>
	It is the same thing at the provincial level. That is why the 
government proposed the Canada revenue commission. I think the 
vast majority of Quebec citizens, who are part of Canada, would 
prefer not having to fill out two income tax returns. So it would be 
nice if both levels of government could come to some sort of 
agreement and establish a common, efficient mechanism for 
collecting taxes without resorting to a war of flags.
<P>
	If they could agree, for example, that the federal Deputy 
Minister of Revenue and his Quebec counterpart would sit on this 
or that commission, people could send their money to one place 
and part of this money would go to the federal government while 
another part would go to Quebec. What we want is something 
simple and effective. I think this is important.
<P>
	We said earlier that we must also keep a sense of fairness and 
compassion in all this. In this regard, I would remind the House 
that, as far as social programs are concerned, the Minister of 
Finance has given the provinces guarantees that cash transfers 
would never fall below a certain level in the next few years. So, 
under the new Canada social transfer for health and social  
programs, the federal government has made a commitment until 
the year 2003. For example, in 1999-2000, it will give the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4383"> 4383 </A></B>
<P>
provinces $25.1 billion, which should rise to $27.4 billion by 
2002-2003.
<P>
	This is important, because there are poor people in our society, 
as we recently saw on the news, especially in Quebec, where the 
cuts hurt. It is hard to understand-and the federal government's 
generosity is not in question-but it is hard to understand how 
some people do not have access to basic health care.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier the importance of these transfers, whether it 
is money or tax points, in the health, education and welfare sectors. 
The federal government will continue to fulfill its obligations, as it 
undertook to do in the last budget speech.
<P>
	Another issue which I want to discuss and which people have 
raised is that of job creation. If I refer to the main estimates in 
relation to job creation, it is because of the student summer 
employment program. You will recall that such a program was 
announced and the monies earmarked for young Canadians were 
increased from $60 million to $120 million.
<P>
	I should tell you that, for the young people whom I met this 
summer, not just in Brome-Missisquoi but in other ridings too, 
this initiative worked perfectly well. Let me give you an example. 
Thanks to this program, and every member in this House can do the 
same, I arranged for a group of some 30 young students from 
Brome-Missisquoi to work in other Canadian cities. Five were 
from Cowansville and went to work in Victoria, B.-C. Similarly, 
five students from Victoria came to work in Brome-Missisquoi. 
The same arrangement was made for students from other cities in 
my riding, who went to work in Edmonton, Prince Edward Island 
and three ridings in Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	These young people found this to be an extraordinary 
experience. It was a learning experience, and I will get back to this 
later on, to learn or become more proficient in the other official 
language. It was an experience to live with a family and to develop 
a better understanding the other Canadian culture. This is 
important. Then there was the work experience.
<P>
	It is a fact that students have difficulty making ends meet. They 
struggle with increasing tuition fees and maintenance expenses. 
The program's first goal is perhaps to make sure that they get a 
summer job. This is for our generation of tomorrow.
<P>
	Employment, as this example shows, is very important. With 
regard to job creation, I would like to deal with another small issue, 
that of research and development. In Canada, the government is 
currently spending, one way or another, some $7 billion on 
research and development, $2 billion in tax credits for corporations 
doing research and development and $5 billion in federal  programs 
or federal agencies, whether in agriculture, in research centres or 
the National Research Centre, and so on.
<P>
	There again, in order to do better, the government announced 
early in the summer the creation of a committee that will report on 
how to better commercialize the findings of research and 
development. That too generates employment.
<P>
	All along, however, we must keep in mind the need to restore 
fiscal order. That is being done. When the Liberal government 
came to power, the federal deficit stood at $42 billion for 1993-94. 
A year later, it had gone down to $37,5 billion, and down to $32,7 
billion the year after. In 1996-97, according to the Minister of 
Finance's budget speech, the deficit will have been reduced to 
$24,3 billion, and will get down to $17 billion in 1997-98. Thus, 
the deficit will have gone down from $42 to $17 billion. Over the 
last few years, we will have seen the annual deficit decrease by at 
least $7 billion every year.
<P>
	As you can see, at that rate, we should get very quickly to a zero 
deficit situation and see what we can do when we have a zero 
deficit.
<P>
	Another tool that is very useful to the members of this House is 
the public accounts committee. This is an important House 
committee that reviews the operations of various departments and 
hears from senior civil servants and deputy ministers who have to 
explain how they manage public funds.
<P>
	Let me give you two examples where the committee, made up of 
a majority of government members, but chaired by an opposition 
member and with representatives from every party of this House, 
reviewed last year's budget, based on the auditor general's report. 
At one point, we realized that in the maritimes, about a hundred 
million dollars were spent on transportation. We were told quite 
plainly that subsidies under the program amounted to about 50 per 
cent of all transportation costs. Some people told us that they found 
out the bills were ``boosted'' or ``inflated'', that is how they put it, 
but the civil servants who manage the program said: ``Checking the 
bills is not part of our job description. It is not part of our duties. 
We only issue cheques for 50 per cent of the total amount''.
<P>
	I think elected members of Parliament have to ensure that such 
things do not happen again. Let me give you another example.
<P>
	When we looked at the moving expenditures for civil servants, 
we realized that the total amount for all departments put together 
exceeded something like $100 million dollars a year. That is how 
much the federal government has to pay to move civil servants 
from one end of the country to the other, from one province to 
another, from one city to another, and so on.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4384"> 4384 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	When I talk about moving civil servants, I mean moving their 
furniture, their dining room sets, their bedroom sets, etc. It is a lot 
of money. The Standing Committee on Public Accounts has 
examined these matters so that these things do not happen again. 
All that under the guidance of the auditor general. This is the role 
members of this House have to play.
<P>
	I could give other examples, but I just added the concept of the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts to the concept of sound 
management exercised by the present government. Sound 
management in terms of deficit reduction and in terms of 
expenditure review.
<P>
	I realized something a few weeks ago. There was a meeting of 
public accounts committee representatives. The federal 
government is not the only one that has a public accounts 
committee. Every province is supposed to have a public accounts 
committee chaired by an opposition member to examine 
expenditures and management in a somewhat independent fashion.
<P>
	Do you know there is one province in Canada that does not have 
such a committee with the same characteristics as the ones that 
exist at the federal level and in the other provinces? That province 
is Quebec. Quebec does not have a public accounts committee.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to salute the courage and the 
open-mindedness of the two Quebec representatives at that national 
meeting, Mr. Baril, MNA for Arthabasca, and Mr. Chagnon, MNA 
for Westmount-Saint-Louis, who both said in front of their 
colleagues from the rest of the country that it would be important 
for Quebec to have a public accounts committee, particularly 
today.
<P>
	There is an important example in all this. I will take the example 
of the heritage department. When we talk about the Main 
Estimates, yes there is a large budget for the heritage department, 
and part of that budget is set aside for official languages. This is 
important.
<P>
	After visiting the students in Brome-Missisquoi, who travelled 
to various parts of the country this summer, I saw how important it 
was for students, families, everyone, that children, this future 
generation in the making, be able, if they wish, to learn our 
country's second language.
<P>
	In this regard, the official languages program that provides 
assistance for French as a second language in the other provinces, 
and for English as a second language in Quebec, is a very good 
thing. It is important to ensure that our francophone communities 
outside Quebec, the one million francophones outside Quebec, can 
count on the federal government as they do.
<P>
	And does Quebec get its fair share in all this? Yes, it does. The 
federal system is much more than a large book of account. In 
addition to a mathematical fair share, it must be remembered that 
Quebec benefits from a fair  share that is difficult to quantify. 
NAFTA, the G-7, Canadian influence within the G-7, and the 
Commonwealth are also important and cannot be assigned a dollar 
value.
<P>
	Mr. Landry claimed that the Quebec economy did not represent 
20 per cent of the Canadian economy. In fact, Quebec's gross 
domestic product constitutes 22.4 per cent of Canada's gross 
domestic product.
<P>
	I would like to add that Quebec receives much more than its fair 
share. Quebec was responsible for 21.4 per cent of federal 
government revenues, but was the beneficiary, in 1994, of 24.5 per 
cent of federal government spending.
<P>
<B>(1920)</B>
<P>
	In all this, there is a good place for Quebec. In all this, the 
government must go ahead and pass the main estimates, and I can 
tell you that I will be voting in favour.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to most of my colleague's speech. He talked 
about jobs. I would like him to give us his views about the surplus 
in the unemployment insurance fund. At the present time, in the 
financial statements, in the government's allocations, there is a 
surplus in the unemployment insurance fund that compensates for 
the deficit, but basically, this fund is 100 per cent financed by 
employers and employees and they have no control on its use.
<P>
	I do not know if he is aware that a vast segment of the population 
is presently without a job and is often composed of people who do 
not have specialized training, who need jobs that require their skills 
but that are not necessarily jobs created by the new economy.
<P>
	It is all fine and well to talk about the new economy. It is true 
that people who have adequate training get jobs more easily, but 
there are also all the people who are to some extent the victims of 
these technological changes. Does the hon. member feel that there 
is some willingness on the part of the government? Will anything 
be said somewhere and fast so we can put these people back to 
work?
<P>
	I have another question for him. As a member of Parliament 
from Quebec, as someone who has to travel in his riding in Quebec, 
does he find that his constituents want the Senate to continue as 
before, to continue to spend about $40 million year after year, 
without its members being elected, with them being appointed 
almost for life, or at least until the age of 75, without being 
accountable, and being able, for example, to kill bills like the one 
on Pearson airport-a move that was a slap in the face to the 
government, because that bill had been passed by the government 
and was killed by a House that was not elected by the government?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4385"> 4385 </A></B>
<P>
	Does he intend to do something so that, in controlling spending, 
we deal with this symbol, the Senate, and find a way to avoid 
funding such an outdated organization?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paradis:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I understood correctly, the first 
point had to do with the UI fund surplus, the need for jobs, and the 
new economy. Those are the words my colleague used earlier.
<P>
	As for the Quebec economy, we are having a hard time these 
days. Let me give you an example. The other day, I was walking on 
Rue de la Montagne in downtown Montreal, between Maisonneuve 
and Sherbrooke Streets. You should try it. Every second door was a 
boarded-up shop or restaurant. The economy is dying. But, as Mr. 
Dumont said, there is something really simple that could be done. 
Economic prosperity cannot be founded on uncertainty.
<P>
	The former leader of the Bloc Quebecois, who is now in Quebec 
City, is holding a sword of Damocles above our heads. Will a 
referendum be held in one, two or three years? How reassuring can 
it be for an investor to be told: ``We do not know what will happen 
in one, two or three years''? This makes no sense. What we need is 
a truce. Mr. Dumont is absolutely right. We need a truce that would 
last at least 10 years. As members of the Bloc Quebecois, you 
should speak to your former leader and ask him to call a truce so 
that the Quebec economy can pick up again.
<P>
<B>(1925)</B>
<P>
	If Mr. Bouchard had seen former U.S. President Harry Truman's 
desk, he would have read the sign saying, ``The buck stops here''.
<P>
	My colleague's second question concerns the Senate. It is a 
totally legitimate question on cost effectiveness, but we must keep 
in mind that we are debating the main estimates. If we wanted to do 
something else like abolishing the Senate, we would need a 
constitutional amendment. The Senate is in the Constitution. I am 
asked if people in Brome-Missisquoi and in other ridings would 
like-Indeed, some would, but we would still need a constitutional 
amendment. This is not something that can be done through the 
main estimates, because our institutions must be able to operate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Stop appointing them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paradis:</B> Not only the people of Brome-Missisquoi- The 
hon. member for Bellechasse was on the same committee as I was 
the other day and we had a chance to discuss this.
<P>
	But we should get rid of this mental block. As you know, Mr. 
Bouchard attended the first ministers' conference. The first thing 
he said was: ``No discussion whatsoever on constitutional 
amendments''. In the meantime, our friends here, our colleagues, 
are saying the Senate should perhaps be abolished, but this would 
require a constitutional amendment. Mr. Bouchard does  not even 
want to broach the subject, so I have trouble understanding whether 
or not he continues to issue orders from Quebec City. This is 
something I have trouble understanding.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as usual we 
heard a very positive speech from the member on the government 
side about how things are coming up roses right across the country. 
He told us about the problems on Sherbrooke Street in Montreal. I 
think I am quoting him properly when he said that at every second 
door a restaurant or a retail store was closed down.
<P>
	Do members remember the old slogan jobs, jobs, jobs? Yet every 
second business on that street in Montreal, which is a major 
shopping street if I am correct, is closed down and one family in 
four in Montreal is on government assistance.
<P>
	This government is supposed to be the federal government that 
governs the people on Sherbrooke Street in Montreal, on Jasper 
Avenue in Edmonton, and on Perron Street in St. Albert, which is 
my constituency. The member said that in order for the government 
to do its job it wants a truce from the Bloc Quebecois and the 
separatists in Quebec. Its job is to govern.
<P>
	I would like to know from the hon. member from 
Brome-Missisquoi when the Liberal government will start 
governing and representing the people on Sherbrooke Street in 
Montreal, Quebec. When will it start delivering on the old cliché of 
jobs, jobs, jobs that it promised to the people of Quebec, to the 
people of Edmonton, and to the people in my riding of St. Albert?
<P>
	The government said it would deliver. It did not say give us a 
truce from the separatist and we will see if we can deliver. We are 
still waiting. When will it deliver?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paradis:</B> First of all, Mr. Speaker, it is true-and I cited 
Montreal, and the stretch of de la Montagne street between 
Maisonneuve and Sherbrooke in particular, as an example-that 
every second business is closed down, but let me tell you about 
Brome-Missisquoi.
<P>
	In terms of jobs, there are two main areas around the two largest 
cities of the riding, the first one being the Cowansville-Bromont 
area, which is doing well, with its IBM plant, General Electric, 
research and development facilities and so forth.
<P>
<B>(1930)</B>
<P>
	At the other end of my riding is Magog, with its textile industry 
and plans for a 20,000-foot expansion in that industry and another 
20,000-foot expansion in the plastics industry. That is the situation 
in Brome-Missisquoi in a nutshell. That is what is going on in this 
riding where, must I remind the hon. member for St. Albert, the 
population is made up of 20 per cent anglophones and 80 per cent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4386"> 4386 </A></B>
<P>
francophones and we are all  living in perfect harmony, somewhat 
shielded from the winds of separation.
<P>
	I have the honour of representing the riding of 
Brome-Missisquoi in this Parliament, while Pierre Paradis, a 
relative of mine, represents the same riding at the Quebec National 
Assembly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member for St. Albert will surely have the opportunity to 
speak after the member for Richelieu, with whom I will share my 
time.
<P>
	The issue of a second House in Canada is not something new; it 
goes back to 1774. That year, the pyramid was started from the top, 
in the sense that institutions were established for the British North 
America of the time. In 1774, only institutions approved by a 
legislative council were set up. Our structures were rather simple, 
with a governor representing the Crown and a legislative council 
appointed by the governor.
<P>
	This was a bit of a family compact. There was little discussion 
when laws were passed and budgets approved. When democratic 
movements called for an elected house to represent the population 
and have a say in the government of the colony of the time, many 
voiced their opposition to the idea.
<P>
	In the end, rather significant support from the United Empire 
Loyalists led to our country's having elected houses. But do you 
know what happened at the same time? Canada was divided in two: 
Upper Canada and Lower Canada, to make sure that French 
Canadians would never succeed in passing their laws and in 
imposing them on the rest of the country.
<P>
	Today, as we try to get our powers back and to govern ourselves, 
we meet with strong objections and are told that we cannot do that. 
Two hundred years ago, they would not let the majority govern in 
this country. The pendulum has swung back.
<P>
	So, in 1791, the Constitutional Act amended the Quebec Act to 
create the Houses of Assembly. We still did not have a responsible 
government. However, we had an elected House of Assembly, with 
an extremely restricted role to play, and the legislative council was 
maintained in both Upper Canada and Lower Canada. While the 
Constitutional Act of 1791 was in force, this legislative council, 
whose members were appointed by the governor, systematically 
opposed every decision made by the House of Assembly. The 
elected representatives had little success in imposing their final 
decisions during the period from 1791 to 1838, at which time the 
Special Act was passed to suspend the Constitutional Act of 1791, 
following the Patriots' Rebellion in 1837.
<P>
	The Union Act of 1840 maintained the legislative council and an 
elected House, of course, but the legislative council could oppose, 
under any circumstances, all the decisions made by the elected 
representatives of the population. For 16 years, the  members of 
this legislative council would be appointed by the governor and 
could do everything they pleased to oppose the decisions of the 
elected representatives.
<P>
	In 1858, a timid but still significant reform was initiated, with 
the election of the members of the legislative council, although 
vested rights were maintained. Those who had been appointed 
before the 1856 act, which provided for the election of the 
legislative council members, were able to keep their seats, but had 
to sit next to members who were elected on a rotational basis.
<P>
<B>(1935)</B>
<P>
	It must have been strange to have an elected member and a 
member appointed for life sitting side by side in the same House. It 
is as if my colleague, the hon. member for Shefford, was there for 
life and I had to go back to the voters every four years, I would not 
be too amused.
<P>
	Change had begun, and with it government instability and the 
decision of the elite, not the public, to change the form of 
government. These were the people known as the Fathers of 
Confederation, the grand term used to describe those who decided 
that there would be a federal government in Canada's future. There 
was never any desire to consult the public about this.
<P>
	A great Liberal, Antoine-Aimé Dorion, proposed in the House of 
Assembly in Parliament, here in Ottawa, that a referendum be held 
on the change in Canada's constitutional status in 1867. This highly 
democratic proposal to let the public decide on the future status of 
Canada was defeated. The changes proposed by a small elite were 
adopted. In Quebec, numerous county and municipal councils 
opposed the constitutional change, sensing the trap into which we 
were heading. By letting go of our equal representation in the 
Parliament of the United Canada, that is, from an institutional point 
of view, we were saddled with a lame duck. At the beginning we 
had a third of the seats in the Senate and the House of Commons, 
but today we no longer even guaranteed a quarter of the seats.
<P>
	In the next election, Quebec will have only 75 members out of 
301, which is below the critical threshold of 25 per cent 
representation which has always been one of Quebec's traditional 
demands.
<P>
	Perhaps I may, oh irony of ironies, quote Senator Jean-Claude 
Rivest, who represents the district of Stadacona. Speaking before 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, he said 
that 25 per cent was the minimum, was the critical mass Quebec 
needed in the House of Commons. This 25 per cent will be lost in 
the next election.
<P>
	In 1867, they talked about what they would do with these 
institutions. When I say: ``they'', I am referring to the Fathers of 
Confederation. There were other constitutions in the past. There 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4387"> 4387 </A></B>
<P>
was the Constitution of  Great Britain and there was a tendency to 
refer to the Constitution of Great Britain, the United Kingdom.
<P>
	The first preamble to the British North America Act, 1867, 
forms the basis of all provisions dealing with the Senate in our 
institutions. I will read it to you:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have 
expressed their desire to be federally united into one dominion under the Crown of 
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with a Constitution similar in 
principle to that of the United Kingdom.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	A constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom 
provides for two Houses of Parliament. In the United Kingdom, as 
in this country, there is a House of Commons, but also an upper 
House, the House of Lords. We wanted to establish one as well. I 
am not an agriculture critic but we have our own little lords.
<P>
	So we established another House, the Senate. This House has the 
same powers the House of Lords had at the time: the power to fully 
obstruct decisions of the House of Commons. This was in 1867, 
when the House of Lords systematically opposed all bills that 
would give back to Ireland its institutions, which had been 
suspended for many years.
<P>
	In any case, one would have to be totally lacking in political 
vision to be oblivious to the fact that someday, the other House, the 
Canadian Senate, which was not elected and was not accountable to 
any one would obstruct major legislation. We saw it happen during 
this Parliament.
<P>
	Earlier, the hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup 
referred to the bill concerning Pearson Airport. The bill was 
defeated in the Senate. An important bill on electoral boundaries 
readjustment, Bill C-69, on which the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs worked for weeks on end, was never 
passed and died on the Order Paper in the Senate.
<P>
<B>(1940)</B>
<P>
	There is something odd about an unelected house coming to tell 
us how to get ourselves elected.
<P>
	We cannot, of course, as Bloc members and sovereignists, 
subscribe to the Reform proposals, which will perhaps be useful to 
a Canada in which Quebec is not represented, but we certainly 
cannot subscribe to a Senate which would be elected, effective and 
equal. If there were any equality, it would have to be between the 
two nations, the two founding peoples, not one between provinces. 
And what would an elected Senate mean? It would mean another 
House with popular legitimacy which would act as a buffer 
between the provincial and federal governments. If there is one 
thing we do not need right now, it is that.
<P>
	The hon. member for Brome-Missisquoi has just said that a 
constitutional amendment is needed to abolish the Senate. Of 
course we need a constitutional amendment; it  is the 7-50 rule 
which applies: 7 provinces representing 50 per cent of the Canadian 
population. Let the other provinces reach agreement among 
themselves to abolish the Senate and we will probably be rid of it.
<P>
	I would like to close with an acknowledgment that, of course, 
there are some good people sitting in the other House. It is not my 
intention to discredit those who are there, but rather to state that, in 
1996, the existence of a House of this nature is no longer justified. 
The best way to see it abolished quickly is to hit it where it hurts the 
most, in the pocket book, by choking off its operating funds, and 
then there is a good chance that it will fall on its own sword.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the comments of the Bloc Quebecois member. I found 
it very interesting to hear the hon. member, as well as those who 
preceded him, talk about the future and about his plan for the 
Senate, that is, not to have another House.
<P>
	I found it rather interesting to see that, perhaps for the first time, 
the Bloc Quebecois is in full agreement with the third party, the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	I know well the fate of francophones outside Quebec, because 
when I was younger, in high school, we studied two or three 
historians, Guy Frégault, Séguin and Brunet, who were always 
talking about the underrepresentation of Quebecers in the House of 
Commons when it came to seat allocation and distribution.
<P>
	I find what the hon. member just said very interesting, and 
perhaps he can easily answer this fundamental question for me: if 
we let the Senate go or abolish it, what good will come of it for 
Quebecers who have to deal with demographic pressures for which 
Canada is not to blame, but which your province, our neighbour, 
has to bear?
<P>
	As your former leader explained it well, the issue of not having 
enough children could have an impact on the strength of your 
population. Is the rest of the country to blame for a decrease in the 
population of Quebec? If that is the case, as it was said, would 
abolishing the Senate not boil down to affecting or decreasing the 
importance of Quebec in this House and in this Parliament?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the Upper House, the Senate, 
Quebec has a constitutional guarantee of 24 seats. Unlike any other 
province, Quebec counts 24 senate ridings.
<P>
<B>(1945)</B>
<P>
	In 1867, Quebec was divided into 24 ridings. A thing to 
remember, a small anomaly of which I will remind my colleague, 
the member for Ontario: in 1912, Quebec borders were altered by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4388"> 4388 </A></B>
<P>
adding to it the Ungava area. Quebec borders were changed, but the 
Senate map was not. All of northern Quebec is not represented in 
the  Senate. Today we are asked if Quebec would be less 
represented? Probably over a third of it is not represented at the 
moment. I cannot see where the problem is.
<P>
	As far as the problem of demographics is concerned, I have 
trouble putting it in context. With regard to procreation, I would be 
more inclined to trust the members of this House, especially my 
colleague from Témiscamingue, who recently had a little Félix, 
than the members in the other House. I fail to see the connection.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague:</B> Congratulations!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> I am wondering too. The member for Ontario, 
who is also very vigourous and represents around 250,000 people, 
must feel very frustrated these days knowing that he will have to 
face the electorate and justify his policies and the fact that the 
promise to abolish the GST has not been fulfilled; he might have a 
hard time.
<P>
	There are people roughly his age in the other place, they are 
there until they turn 75, without being held accountable to anyone. 
It is incredible. There is something wrong somewhere. We all will 
have to go home. In your riding of Stormont-Dundas, maybe it 
will not be so difficult, Mr. Speaker, but in Bellechasse it might be 
harder, we will see.
<P>
	In any case, we will return, we will all take the plunge without 
any guarantee whatsoever to see what seat will be occupied. The 
206 members who were replaced in this House all know what it 
means to have no job security.
<P>
	I went to the other House earlier. What a nice sunset I saw. It was 
the darkness in that room that struck me the most; sometimes the 
darkness is in the minds. They speak about a House of sober second 
thought, but it looked more like a dormitory.
<P>
	We will be sitting until ten this evening. Over there, they are not 
sitting at all. Evening debates are rare enough because the number 
of days are limited.
<P>
	Section 31 of the British North America Act of 1867 states that a 
senator loses his seat do you know when? When he or she is absent 
from sittings during two consecutive sessions. That means a 
senator who was a member of the Senate in 1993, at the beginning 
of the 35th Parliament, and who has not yet been present in that 
House, still has two more years to attend at least one sitting in order 
to keep his seat.
<P>
	If we did that here, if we were absent from this House, our 
constituents would quickly boot us out. We would be subject to 
procedures much harsher than impeachment, the newspapers would 
demand our resignation, would require that we either sit or quit and 
return our salaries. In the other place they can do that, but not here. 
It is time to abolish that institution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
happy to participate in this debate. Since I was  elected in 1984, two 
political parties in this House have come out in favour of 
abolishing the Senate. Among the Tories who were elected in 
Quebec, at a famous meeting in Laval, 92 per cent of 800 delegates, 
including at least 10 from every riding in Quebec, voted in favour 
of abolishing the Senate. But the Liberals, even those elected in 
Quebec, never had the courage to make this decision.
<P>
	Of course, as my colleague pointed out, our saying that the 
Senate should be abolished does not mean we do not respect its 
members. On the contrary, I know some eminent senators. I am 
surprised, however, that these people have accepted this job, if it 
can be called a job, or this political reward.
<P>
	But I am not here to judge them. I want to talk about the 
institution itself, what Senator Prud'homme called a relic of 
colonialism, before he himself was appointed to the Senate by 
former Prime Minister Mulroney for services rendered. Since he is 
sitting in the gallery, he could even confirm what I am saying with 
a nod of his head.
<P>
	One of my colleagues who is now in the Senate was talking 
about the great dormitory and the hon. sleepyheads. Ms. 
Chaput-Rolland was also appointed to the Senate and she suddenly 
discovered the virtues of its appropriations, I suppose.
<P>
	We may look at it from every angle, but no one can justify the 
existence of such an undemocratic institution.
<P>
<B>(1950)</B>
<P>
	This is the most undemocratic institution in the western world. It 
is incredible. There is no other such senate in the whole world. 
Appointments to the Senate are made by the Prime Minister as 
political rewards. My colleague, the Liberal member for 
Brome-Missisquoi, indicated earlier that the Senate could be 
abolished but that a constitutional amendment is required to do so. 
There is simple way around this. Just stop making appointments; in 
time, there will be no one left. It is that simple, no big deal.
<P>
	But no, in the past year, the Prime Minister has been appointing 
his friends: Sharon Carstairs, who worked with him to make the 
Meech Lake accord fail; Mr. Whelan, the former Minister of 
Agriculture and a good friend of the Prime Minister in the Trudeau 
government; Céline Hervieux-Payette, the candidate from 
Montreal who was defeated three times in Laval. They did not 
know what to do with her, so they appointed her the Senate to get 
rid of her. And the list of patronage appointments goes on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4389"> 4389 </A></B>
<P>
	At least the Conservatives had the decency to consult the 
provincial premiers. In those days, Bourassa was the one getting 
rid of his dead wood by shipping it to Ottawa.
<P>
	Thinking back on Senate appointments, it is appalling to be 
spending approximately $60 million on this relic of  colonialism, 
as Mr. Prud'homme called it, without even considering eliminating 
it when cuts are being made everywhere else.
<P>
	You know, as early as 1920, Mackenzie King was talking about 
Senate reform, but nothing came of it. The only reform the Senate 
ever underwent took place in 1975, when Mr. Pearson decided, 
with great courage, that senators were to retire at age 75. Those 
who were appointed before 1975 are still in the Senate. I believe 
that Senator Olson is 94 years old now, and he is still there. He still 
gets his salary. But let us not make a judgment on age either. 
Elderly people can serve their country very well. The problem is 
not the people sitting in the Senate, but the institution itself.
<P>
	Let me also point out that, originally, as the hon. member 
explained earlier, this institution was meant to act as a brake to the 
zeal of the elected members. Since this was the first responsible 
government, there was a danger that its elected members might try 
to change everything. So, the Senate was established. Later, the 
existence of this Senate was justified by saying it would act as the 
defender of the interests of the various regions. Since Canada had 
become a large country with its ten provinces, the Senate was to 
offset the House of Commons, where the central provinces could 
wield much power.
<P>
	Such were the historical justifications. However, our political 
customs have since changed, our democracy is now extremely well 
structured, and we have other ways and means to put pressure on 
elected representatives. For example, would my constituents go to 
the Senate to complain about something? Never. People are now 
extremely well organized, whether it is seniors or union members, 
and they have a platform to voice their claims and to reach their 
objectives.
<P>
	This is not to mention the federal-provincial conferences, which 
the provinces use to impede the centralizing power of the federal 
government or to have a say in its decisions. And then we also now 
have a very aggressive press, which is quick to react if the 
government somehow exaggerates in terms of its legislation or 
behaviour. We also have the royal commissions we set up regularly.
<P>
	So, as you see, nowadays, the power of the regions and of 
individuals is taking a new form and does not involve the Senate, 
which is supposed to offset the House of Commons, should it 
become too strong.
<P>
	So, the Senate only exists on a structural basis. In reality, it 
serves absolutely no purpose. Who, among our constituents, would 
say: ``I will complain to my senator''? Less than 0.1 per cent of the 
people of Canada know the name of their own senator.
<P>
<B>(1955)</B>
<P>
	What is the purpose of the Senate? Individuals and interest 
groups do not consider the Senate as an appropriate body to receive 
their claims and offset a piece of legislation. They are not 
structured that way.
<P>
	Think of all the energy spent every year to question the very 
existence of the Senate and it never gets us anywhere. Reform 
would not change anything. It would only create another kind of 
problem. For instance, if the Senate were elected, we would have 
24 senators from Quebec who would claim to speak on behalf of 
Quebecers, while 75 members of Parliament would say the same.
<P>
	What would the provincial government think of an elected 
Senate existing alongside elected members of Parliament, and how 
would it negotiate with the federal government? Would it have to 
go through the elected Senate or would it have to deal with both the 
federal government and the Senate? What would happen if the 
Senate and the government were of different political stripes? Can 
you imagine the mess we would have with an elected Senate?
<P>
	The solution is to abolish the Senate. Three or four provinces had 
a Senate, which they abolished. By abolishing its Senate in 1968, 
did Quebec lose ground in terms of meeting the expectations of the 
people is concerned? Did it lose ground with regard to its 
institutions? Not at all. Were the regions affected by the abolition 
of the Quebec Senate. Not at all. Is new legislation any worse 
because there is no Senate to improve upon it? Not at all. So, we 
have every right to demand a stop to this utter waste of money.
<P>
	Given the current economic situation, there is no reason to spend 
between 50 and 60 million dollars on an outdated Senate. It does 
not make any sense. We could also talk about the position of 
governor general, or the positions of lieutenant governors, which 
are another shameful waste of money.
<P>
	We are asked to renew the Senate appropriation, so why not 
make the proper decision once and for all and cut off its budget. We 
will then have the chance to see if the senators will be zealous 
enough to keep coming here to sit or sleep in the Senate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in sitting hear listening to the debate tonight, there is such 
a contrast in opinions about the Senate in this House that I think the 
average person is wondering what is going on here.
<P>
	It is absolutely amazing that members of the separatist party are 
in this House talking about the future of the Parliament of Canada 
and the Senate when on a daily basis they talk about leaving the 
country. I fail to see  what their interest is in the future of how this 
institution is set up. It is a conflict in philosophy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4390"> 4390 </A></B>
<P>
	At the same time, the Liberals on the other side defend the 
Senate institution which everyone in Canada knows is 
unaccountable, ineffective and unelected. It is basically a rubber 
stamp for the government of the day, if it happens to be the 
majority in the Senate. The Liberals of course seized that 
opportunity as vacancies became available and appointed their 
people to Senate positions. I was going to call it a wonderland, and 
perhaps it is, but it is probably one of the plushest patronage 
appointments the Liberals and Tories could ever dream up in this 
institution.
<P>
	It is very timely that the Reform Party is sitting in this 
Parliament. Down at the other end of the hall we have an institution 
that basically serves little or no purpose in this country except to 
rubber stamp the government's bills.
<P>
	The Reformers came to this Parliament, beginning with the 
member for Beaver River, and began talking about a triple E 
Senate: equal, elected and effective. That rings a fairly common 
sense idea to most Canadians. Why should someone represent the 
people who is not elected by the people, they ask? Why should 
someone be in a position of senator without really having much to 
do, being basically ineffective? Why is the Senate so 
unaccountable? It comes to Parliament and asks for $40 million to 
run its operations. We ask what it is for and the Senate says that we 
do not really need to know, that it would just like the $40 million.
<P>
<B>(2000)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I hate to interrupt but there 
are only five minutes of questions and comments. Perhaps the 
member has a succinct question to put to his colleague. Otherwise I 
will give the floor to the next member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that we can make 
comments and ask questions. I have a question for the hon. member 
from the separatist party who just spoke.
<P>
	He is a parliamentarian. If his party is so bound and determined 
to leave this country, why is there such a tremendous interest in 
abolishing part of the institution of Canada? Why do those 
members have this interest if they simply want to leave anyway?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. The answer is very simple: we pay 25 per cent. We 
represent 25 per cent of the population and we pay for this 
dormitory, this nursery, this utterly useless place. As long as we 
stay within the federation, we will pay our $30 billion in taxes 
every year and we do have a say in the way that money is spent.
<P>
	I am surprised every time somebody here, in the House of 
Commons, questions the legitimacy of this party and of its 
members who were democratically elected. I received 70 per cent 
of the votes in my riding, which means that 70 per cent of those 
who voted shared our party's position.
<P>
	What is my party's position? It is different from that of other 
parties, obviously, because we are advocating a new kind of 
relationship with the rest of Canada based on two founding peoples 
with two strong governments bound by economic ties only.
<P>
	The Liberals are advocating the 1982 Constitution, the 
Conservative Party is advocating constitutional amendments for 
the distinct society clause based on the principles contained in the 
Meech Lake accord, and the Reform Party has a different vision of 
the future of the two peoples because it is looking at issues such as 
official languages. Each party in the House has different ideas and 
has the right to express them.
<P>
	Each time we rise in this House to talk about financial issues that 
concerns Quebecers as well as Canadians, we are asked why we, 
who want to destroy Canada, should have the right to express our 
views. We do not want to destroy Canada, we want to build 
Quebec. We want to build a country and we want to have friendly 
relations with the rest of Canada, we want to have economic ties as 
would any majority in the world. That is the goal of the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
	When we call for the abolition of the Senate, we defend 
Quebec's higher interests. That is why we were elected. We were 
sent here to promote Quebec's sovereignty and we are doing it 
democratically. We have the right to do it and I am sick and tired of 
hearing people question the sacred right of a people to choose its 
own destiny every time we rise in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to take part in this debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With reference to the motion brought forward in opposition to 
the funding of the other place, I should remind colleagues that we 
have a longstanding tradition that both Houses of Parliament work 
independently to fulfil the important work entrusted to both 
Houses. Both Houses actively review important legislation and 
policies in their work as parliamentarians. Both have processes in 
place for the approval of expenditures of funds.
<P>
	I would argue that hon. members of the third party had an 
excellent opportunity to participate in the reform of the other 
House but chose to oppose the Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	I would vehemently argue that the motion of the third party 
simply tinkers at the fringes, tinkers at the edges. Those members 
have chosen to attack the other place in such a manner that they are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4391"> 4391 </A></B>
<P>
unable to defend themselves.  I would therefore argue that this is 
yet another example of the third party's opportunistic approach.
<P>
<B>(2005)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is quite simply meanspirited.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Rather than deal in a meaningful rational kind of way with 
change, rather than look at the reasons why one might go about 
changing an institution and bring forward hard data and rational 
arguments, they play politics. Cut a bit here, cut a bit there. That is 
the approach of Reformers. They do not know where they are 
going, so why in the world would they know what to do with the 
other House?
<P>
	The parliamentary system needs a chamber of second thought to 
pass good legislation. Perhaps it needs to be changed. Yes, I would 
agree and so would they, but what is being proposed is not change. 
What is being proposed is to use another House as a target to try to 
enhance their imminent electoral defeat. That is what they are 
trying to do. They are trying to deflect. They do not know what they 
are doing so they are thrashing about trying to find an issue. That is 
what is happening.
<P>
	Parliamentarians in the other House come from all backgrounds. 
We know many of them. They have much experience and a great 
deal of knowledge in many fields. Some of them would embarrass 
members of the third party in terms of what it is that they know 
about Parliament, about democracy, and about the Houses in which 
we sit and serve. They bring a great deal of wisdom and a wealth of 
information to various committees and discussions held throughout 
the dominion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	But they want to grandstand. That is what they want to do 
because they have no plan. They spoke about the deficit and the 
debt. That did not work, because Canadians did not believe them. 
They spoke about violence in society and proposed extreme 
measures that would have solved absolutely nothing. So what do 
they do? They try to find a target, something to bring them back to 
life. We cannot revive a political party that is so feeble.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am surprised members of the third party did not congratulate 
and commend the government for its performance and fiscal 
management. They know the government took a hard line on 
deficit reduction. They know the government is meeting and 
exceeding its targets. It is keeping its promises in the red book. 
They know interest rates have declined. They know inflation is at 
the lowest sustained level in 30 years. They know that as a result of 
job creation efforts on the part of government and the private sector 
close to 700,000 new jobs have been created since November 1993. 
They know  Canada is projected to have the highest employment 
growth of any G-7 country, but they refuse to accept it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	They know very well that the government has made enormous 
progress in a number of areas. I have mentioned them: interest 
rates, inflation, reducing the deficit, the debt, job creation. They 
know that the vast majority of Canadians feel that the government 
has been very successful. They know it, but they do not want to 
admit it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	They know we have a great deal to be proud of as Canadians. 
They know we should be applauding what we have as a nation, 
what we have as citizens.
<P>
	I will spend some time discussing some of the many changes we 
in government have implemented. The main estimates for 1996-97 
represent the results of a number of initiatives by the government 
designed to reduce the budget deficit while providing the services 
Canadians need. It is a challenge to reduce what is spent and 
provide equal or better services.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The federal government's goal was to clarify its role and its 
responsibilities in order to make the federation more effective. It 
wanted to follow up on the public's call for better and more 
accessible government.
<P>
	This means modernizing federal programs and services so that 
they better meet the needs of Canadians as citizens and as clients, 
today and in the future.
<P>
<B>(2010 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As pointed out by the President of the Treasury Board, this 
year's main estimates show $157 billion in planned budgetary 
expenditures compared with $164 billion last year, a difference of 
$7 billion.
<P>
	The government has set clear priorities to guide the process of 
deficit and therefore debt reduction. It has articulated the roles of 
the national government thereby identifying areas where it is 
uniquely positioned to best serve Canadians.
<P>
	This improves on the traditional techniques of modernizing 
public administration practices through doing more with less or 
through across the board cuts. These approaches have been 
replaced by more strategic choices about what programs and 
services should be treated as priorities and how best to deliver 
them.
<P>
	The House will recall that the federal government launched 
program review and sector specific policy reviews to assess all 
policies and programs. It will also recall that the chief achievement 
or program review will be structural changes to the business of 
government, for example withdrawing from programs providing 
direct financial support to industry and not renewing resource 
sector regional development agreements when they expire while 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4392"> 4392 </A></B>
<P>
maintaining a presence in areas such as international trade, science 
and technology.
<P>
	It will address overlap and duplication by consolidating 
activities to make program delivery more efficient and effective, 
for example merging the Canadian Coast Guard fleet with that of 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	Federal spending has been refocused to meet changing priorities. 
Departmental spending devoted to economic programs will decline 
significantly between 1994-95 and 1998-99, reflecting the shift in 
the government's role from providing direct support to business to 
setting framework policies.
<P>
	Therefore it should be completely and totally evident from these 
initiatives that the government is acting responsibly. It is reducing 
spending while putting priority on programs which are the real 
business of the federal government and are delivered in a cost 
effective manner.
<P>
	For this reason members of the House should concur with the 
government's request for full supply.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By the way, I am absolutely astonished, I would even say 
appalled, by the motion of the Bloc Quebecois member for 
Richmond-Wolfe who proposes to cancel the grants and 
contributions under Heritage Canada. Do you realize this means the 
hon. member is actually proposing to cancel subsidies to 
francophone communities outside Quebec? Yes, to cancel subsidies 
to francophone communities outside Quebec.
<P>
	I would have expected this kind of gesture or initiative from the 
Reform Party, perhaps, but not from the Bloc. Someone must have 
failed to consider the consequences.
<P>
	The hon. member also wants the government to stop subsidizing 
programs for native communities, which are included in this 
budget. Imagine. That is what he suggested. I think it is appalling.
<P>
	He wants to do away with bursaries for athletes in amateur sport, 
with exchange programs for students and all multicultural 
programs. This motion hits at francophones outside Quebec, native 
people and participants in multicultural programs. Unlike the Bloc 
Quebecois, which seems to have no compunction about abandoning 
these programs, we will never abandon the multicultural aspect of 
our country. We will never abandon Canada's francophone and 
Acadian communities. Never.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> There will not be any 25 years from now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> I just heard someone say there will not be any 25 
years from now. Well, 20 years ago someone came and told us we 
were dead ducks, and one of those dead ducks is speaking here in 
the House of Commons.  He has children who speak French and 
will have grandchildren who speak it as well.
<P>
<B>(2015)</B>
<P>
	Now, would you please stop saying we are going to disappear? 
We will never disappear, never.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, I want to talk about a project that is particularly 
important to me entitled ``Improved Reporting to Parliament''. The 
government made a commitment to restore public confidence in 
government institutions and specifically the role played by 
Parliament. Without the right information at the right time, 
Parliament cannot perform its proper function. Furthermore, in 
order to get government right, we must engage Parliament in a 
meaningful dialogue of government plans, priorities and 
performance. In order to have an informed dialogue, 
parliamentarians need good information.
<P>
	We are improving the information. We are in the process of 
piloting new documents. Later this fall we will table 16 pilot 
performance reports. These reports, supported by the members of 
my committee, which is an all-party committee and not the people 
who are yelling in this House tonight. They are being co-operative. 
They recognize the importance of this project.
<P>
	These reports will provide Parliament with succinct, meaningful, 
results oriented information. They will allow parliamentarians to 
focus on the results expected from government programs and the 
results those programs actually achieve.
<P>
	Furthermore in the spring complementary departmental 
expenditure planning documents will be tabled as part of the 
estimates process.
<P>
	Overall improvements to reporting will allow committees to 
improve the processes by which estimates are considered and 
disposed of. I am confident that improved information will make 
parliamentary debate more meaningful and make an important 
contribution to overall government accountability.
<P>
	I am delighted to chair this all-party interparliamentary 
committee. I have received a great deal of co-operation from all of 
the members who are part of it and I am most appreciative.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In concluding, I want to say that I support this proposal by the 
government and am rather shocked by the proposals made by the 
opposition. If the two political parties on the other side of the 
House continue to react the way they did this evening, they will 
stay where they are for a long time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with some interest to what our Liberal colleague over there had to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4393"> 4393 </A></B>
<P>
say on this subject. I find it curious that this evening we are 
discussing the money to be allocated to the Senate, yet this hon. 
member refuses, not surprisingly, to speak of the Senate.
<P>
	It is in the culture of the two old parties in Canada, the Liberals 
and the Conservatives, to hope that one day, if they are really good 
and have worked hard-and we know what that means if a person is 
in a large national political body, that they have served their party 
well-they can hope to fulfil their dream of finishing out their days 
in the Senate.
<P>
	What does that involve? Finishing out one's days in the Senate 
means that one has all the benefits. Let me explain some of those 
benefits to you. I have had the opportunity of travelling in Canada 
and elsewhere with a joint committee. A joint committee is a 
committee made up of MPs and senators. I have seen how that 
works here in Canada.
<P>
	First of all, senators have the title of ``honourable'', becoming 
honourable when they are appointed, and thus a rung above the 
members of the House of Commons. Travelling with them, I have 
heard a Canadian colonel on one occasion announce ``senators 
first''. People who have not been elected, who were appointed by 
the Prime Minister, who are there until the age of 75. They can be 
35 when they are appointed, or 40, and will sit as senators until they 
reach 75.. And whom do they represent? No one.
<P>
<B>(2020)</B>
<P>
	Last summer, I was in England at a symposium where 25 nations 
were represented. You know, when we speak of Canada while 
abroad, we describe ourselves as a great country, an 
ultrademocratic country, the most democratic in the world. When 
we tell people that we have a second House, made up of unelected 
members who are there to the age of 75, they are amazed. They just 
do not understand. Appointed? For what reason? For various 
reasons.
<P>
	The Liberal caucus, which meets weekly, is made up of MPs and 
senators. When they are preparing fund raising campaigns for this 
party, who are the ones with the time and the contacts for rounding 
up all the money this party needs to operate? The senators 
primarily. They have nothing else to do, so they become the 
bagmen for the two old parties.
<P>
	This is a vicious circle. You will note that the Liberals are talking 
about all manner of things this evening except the Senate, because 
in their heart of hearts they hope, one day, to be appointed to it, if 
their leader so decides. Imagine the advantage of not having to run 
in elections. No longer any need to be present in the riding. 
Imagine all the advantages of being in the Senate.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois say, and I think my colleague has said 
it clearly: ``No taxation without representation''. As long as the 
Bloc Quebecois remains in Ottawa, we are entitled to our opinions. 
What we are calling for is abolition, pure and simple. Why? 
Because we cannot agree. We have not for 35 years.
<P>
	When I was a student at the University of Ottawa and the Senate 
was being discussed, there was a chapter this long in our book on 
the Canadian Senate. I remember that the Senate was described as a 
kind of British hybrid in Canada. Why was it called a senate? 
Because we are in North America, and there is a senate in the 
United States.
<P>
	You know, when we are travelling we find that no one knows the 
Senate is appointed. People just do not know. And that is the 
question I would like to ask my colleague.
<P>
	We are still in a federal system, with two levels of government. 
To lighten the federal structure, not to mention the tax burden on 
Canadians and Quebecers, would now not be the time to abolish the 
Senate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's 
comments.
<P>
	He started by saying: ``I listened with some interest to what my 
colleague had to say''. I would have rather that he had listened with 
great interest.
<P>
	He seems to believe that I want to become a senator. Frankly, I 
have not spent much time dreaming about it. Certainly not. I do not 
think so. While I was listening to him, and I did carefully, I seemed 
to detect a trace of jealousy. When someone says ``senators first'', I 
do not have a problem. If someone was to tell my colleagues ``you 
first'', I would not have a problem with that. I will not feel put 
down if I go through the door behind others, in the middle of the 
pack or anywhere else, I have no problem with that. Frankly, some 
people have quite a complex.
<P>
	Personally, I like to see senators go first in front of me. I have no 
problem with that.
<P>
	Another thing, you know, what I find really shocking, and I am 
not kidding any more, I said in my speech that I was ready to talk 
about Senate reform, and this is why I have been following the 
debate with a certain interest. But this is not a reform. They are 
playing politics to try to attract some attention. This is not serious, 
cutting.
<P>
	Why not say: This is what I propose?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> We propose to abolish it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Yes. Come up with a clear proposal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Will abolition do, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Abolition, abolition.
<P>
<B>(2025)</B>
<P>
	Dear friends, come up with a proposal in due form. I am asking 
you to come up with a proposal in due form abolishing the Senate. 
Do it tomorrow morning, I am looking forward to it.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how much time do I have?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Three minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Let me make a comment and ask a question. ``I 
think my gold plated pension is okay'', says the hon. member for 
St. Boniface. The member talked about performance reports. Let 
me give him a performance report and then I will get to my 
question.
<P>
	Here is a Liberal performance report. Early next month the 
national debt is going to reach $600 billion. Performance: The 
Liberals contributed fully two-thirds to that debt. The Liberals 
contributed about two-thirds to raising the interest payment on that 
debt to an astounding $48 billion. Performance: The Liberal 
government has driven the national debt up by $100 billion since it 
took over in 1993. Soon the Prime Minister will be known all 
across this country as the $600 billion man.
<P>
	Does the member for St. Boniface really believe that this 
Parliament should give the Senate $40 million with no question 
asked? Does he believe that is the proper and accountable thing to 
do?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted that my colleague 
should rise and make a few comments. They are as profound as 
they normally are. We contributed supposedly two-thirds to the 
debt. Frankly, he is very poor in mathematics or he is really trying 
to be very misleading because that is totally inaccurate.
<P>
	I received on my desk today an analysis of some of the statistics 
that Reform uses when trying to scare the Canadian population 
about violence in society. It was deplorable. I will give an example. 
Reformers took a crime rate that was used at one time by Statistics 
Canada before Ontario was involved. Ontario then became 
involved and they took that first figure and compared it to the 
whole of Canada proving that there had been 1,000 and some-per 
cent increase. They would be great in finance. These kinds of 
statements are deplorable.
<P>
	Reformers are down to 7 per cent or 8 per cent in the polls 
because Canadians do not believe them any more. They make 
outlandish statements that one cannot even add up. They make 
absolutely misleading statements that people no longer believe. 
They were at 20 per cent, went down to 14 per cent, now at 7 per 
cent and I suspect they will be at 2 per cent pretty soon. I do not 
know how one can get below 0 per cent, but if it is possible for a 
political party to get below 0 per cent I am betting it is going to be 
the Reform Party. I believe this party will be the first party to attain 
that noble goal. That is what Reformers deserve with that kind of 
rhetoric, those kinds of misleading statements, the poor research, 
the exaggeration and the bluster.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I was not sure exactly what 
it was I missed about this place over the last several months but I 
am giving a new definition to wonderful Wednesday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, you are 
right, there are some things about this House that we can miss over 
the summer. I certainly enjoyed the peace and quiet of the country 
back in Morinville, Alberta. It was just wonderful. We are now 
back into the fray and debating the estimates.
<P>
	I have a couple of points. The previous speaker, the member for 
St. Boniface, takes pride in his accomplishments. It is a real 
accomplishment that he has been able, through the chairmanship of 
his committee, to provide a pilot project that would give new 
information to Parliament. We hope it is going to provide better 
and more useful information to this House.
<P>
<B>(2030 )</B>
<P>
	The point unfortunately is that once we have this new and 
improved information and once we are able to see how the 
government intends to spend the money and we make 
recommendations to reduce that amount, we are absolutely and 
totally stonewalled by the members of the government because 
they say: ``Confidence is the order of the day. There is nothing that 
we can do. Whatever they say they want has to be voted through''.
<P>
	That is the shame about this House, not the other one, this 
House: the fact that the democratic will of this House is thwarted 
because the Prime Minister says that confidence applies to the 
estimates. Therefore any backbencher in the government who 
wishes to oppose, challenge, reduce or change any figure in these 
estimates had better think twice. They would not want to be back 
out in the hustings trying to get re-elected because the government 
might fall because of one backbencher. They are not prepared to 
stand up to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	As a result, the estimates as tabled by the President of the 
Treasury Board are rammed through this House without any change 
of any kind being tolerated, regardless of whether or not we get 
new and improved information courtesy of the member for St. 
Boniface. It is not to detract from his work which is real and serious 
work. It is to say that in this House the democratic principle of 
representation of the people who sent us here to talk about these 
estimates and to act upon these estimates only allows us to talk 
about these estimates. That is most important.
<P>
	Of course, there is the other house. I was quite surprised at the 
two members of the Bloc Quebecois. The member for Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley talked about challenging their legitimacy 
to sit in this House. I thought they would blow a gasket. Their 
blood pressure went up. The rhetoric got hot and I thought they 
would stomp right out. Very sensitive they were to the challenges to 
their legitimacy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4395"> 4395 </A></B>
<P>
	The other House is well and truly entrenched in our Constitution 
as a legitimate part of this Parliament, albeit unelected, yes. 
Nonetheless it is part of our Constitution; it is entrenched and has 
a place in this Parliament. Does the Bloc have a place in this 
Parliament? That is a serious question and that is why when one 
questions their legitimacy to sit in this House, Bloc members get 
so hot under the collar that we have to stand back. Members know 
how it is.
<P>
	Anyway, there is the other House. We heard the member for St. 
Boniface. If they make us an offer, we are prepared to debate the 
issue.
<P>
	There was an article in the August 5, 1996 Edmonton <I>Sun</I>. The 
headline is ``PM's sad slide on the Senate''. I will read from it:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Back in October 1990, the then opposition leader had a vision for the Senate, one 
he promised to enact. At the time of this momentous disclosure the Prime Minister 
was addressing 400 delegates at the annual general meeting of the Alberta branch of 
the federal Liberal Party.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He was speaking to his own converted people. Going on, he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Saying it was only the presence of Liberal senators that made the chamber of 
second thought effective at all, he went on to vow that ``The Liberal government in 
two years will make it elected''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is now nearly six years later, and the Senate is more a palace of patronage than 
ever. And as far as we know, the Prime Minister has never uttered the words 
``elected'' and ``Senate'' in the same sentence since he was elected in 1993.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Talk about promises, talk about the red book. They enact the 
promises. The Prime Minister stood up in 1990 and said: ``I want to 
see an elected Senate because they have almost stopped the GST 
from being rammed through against Canadians' will''. That is why 
we need a House of sober second thought. It is to ensure that 
Canadians are represented. What they want is what they get. When 
they do not want the GST, they do not want the GST.
<P>
<B>(2035 )</B>
<P>
	The Senate had its finest day in years. The senators were on 
television every night as they stomped out of the chamber. Of 
course the Liberal majority frustrated the will of the Tory 
government in this chamber until the Prime Minister of the day 
said: ``I will fix that. I will appoint a bunch of my cronies to 
outnumber your cronies and then we will get what I want through 
that chamber because it is not elected''. That is hardly democracy.
<P>
	I asked the Library of Parliament for some background on the 
other place and they were kind enough to give me a paper that they 
had prepared for the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association 
30th Canadian regional conference in New Brunswick in August 
1990. I will quote from that paper.
<P>
	On page 2 on the powers of the Senate it states: ``The powers of 
the Senate, which have not been amended since 1867 except with 
regard to the amendment of the Constitution, are impressive on 
paper. In formal terms the Senate comes immediately after the 
Queen and before the House of Commons in the list of components 
of the Canadian Parliament. For a law to pass it must be agreed to 
by the Senate. If a bill passed by the House of Commons is 
amended in the Senate the amendment must in turn be approved by 
the Commons failing which the entire text will die on the Order 
Paper.
<P>
	``Supremacy was conceded to the Commons only in the terms of 
financial initiatives. Money bills have been subject to dispute since 
Confederation. In the United Kingdom under the Parliament Act of 
1911 it is up to the Speaker of the Commons to certify bills as 
money bills but no such procedure exists in Canada. It is generally 
accepted that tax bills, bills of supply and bills of appropriation fall 
into this category and that such bills may only be introduced in the 
House but must pass both chambers''.
<P>
	It continues on page 3, where the paper prepared quotes from a 
book by Mr. Robert A. Mackay, <I>The Unreformed Senate of Canada</I> 
revised edition 1963, pages 94 and 95 and it states: ``The Senate 
cannot be said to have abused its powers over money bills. It must 
be recognized that whatever its legal powers, it has not the same 
political authority as the Commons and that accordingly on money 
matters the commons has a clear priority and that the Senate's 
responsibility and rights are secondary''. They are secondary.
<P>
	I read those quotes because a committee of this House asked the 
Senate to appear before the House of Commons committee, which 
has supremacy on money matters clearly and obviously, to tell this 
House why we should give the Senate $43 million to carry on its 
business and it refused.
<P>
	This House has supremacy, clearly, obviously and distinctly. We 
are elected by Canadians. We represent Canadians from coast to 
coast. We, the House of Commons, are the ones who have the 
power to tax Canadians and we are the ones who have the authority 
to decide how that money is to be spent. The other place, which is 
secondary and subordinate to this House on money matters, has 
refused to appear before us to explain why it needs it. Yet the Prime 
Minister, his government and his backbenchers later on tonight, I 
can guarantee it, will vote the Senate every nickel that it has asked 
for without one question being answered as to why it needs the 
money and how it is going to spend it.
<P>
	That is an affront to the people who sit in this House. It is an 
affront to Canadians who have to pay taxes that we will give the 
other place $43 million even though it says: ``Put it in your face. 
We are not going to show up and answer your questions as to why 
we need the money''. It is an affront.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4396"> 4396 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me say no more about the other place until it is reformed.
<P>
<B>(2040 )</B>
<P>
	On a broader scale, members have heard me talk about the fact 
that the Prime Minister asks and the Prime Minister gets as far as 
the estimates are concerned. Whatever we say in this House is of no 
matter.
<P>
	Last year the Reform Party put up quite a fight on the estimates. 
As a result of that fight the government said that it would create a 
subcommittee of the procedure and House affairs committee on the 
business of supply to see what could be done to reform this process. 
I did not think it would be a long, drawn out and complicated affair 
but unfortunately I have to advise that the subcommittee is still in 
existence. It has still to file its final report, and here we are 15 
months from the time the committee was created.
<P>
	We have heard the witnesses. We have listened to the people who 
put the current procedures in place as to why they put them in place 
and how they feel it is not delivering what they had anticipated. I 
hoped we would have reported back to the House before now, that 
we would be discussing these estimates under an amended 
procedure based on the work of the subcommittee on the business 
of supply, but it is not to be.
<P>
	As the Reform Party critic for the Treasury Board, as a gesture of 
goodwill, we allowed the old process to prevail today. However, we 
feel this government has no desire to move and to amend the 
business of supply. We have been absolutely stonewalled about 
changing and reducing these estimates regardless of how legitimate 
our arguments are. Be assured that next year when the estimates are 
presented to the House the Reform Party will vigorously defend to 
the best of its ability its right to challenge the government to ensure 
that Canadians become fully aware of the charade that goes on here 
once every year, and also when we have the supplementary 
estimates.
<P>
	It is just a done deal before we even vote because confidence is 
called by the Prime Minister and they on the other side all fall into 
line and say: ``What the Prime Minister wants, the Prime Minister 
gets''. This is regardless of what the people think, the people who 
sent them here. Regardless of what they think, what the Prime 
Minister wants, the Prime Minister gets.
<P>
	We have heard the stories of responsible management, 
downsizing, efficiency and so on. What is the government doing? I 
am sure Canadians are not really aware what it is doing.
<P>
	Look at some of the numbers: Enterprise Cape Breton 
Corporation has an increase in budget of 69 per cent. Its budget is 
going from $10 million last year to $17 million this year, an 
increase of 69.3 per cent. We have heard the speeches. They have 
been wonderful and glorious speeches about how the Liberals are 
cutting the budget  and about how the deficit is coming down 
through their hard work.
<P>
	Here is something else: The Canadian Museum of Civilization. I 
am sure we create a lot of jobs down there. It has an increase in its 
budget of 21 per cent from $38 million to $46 million.
<P>
	The Canadian Museum of Nature has a 37 per cent increase in 
budget, from $18 million to $24 million. They must create a lot of 
jobs in museums these days.
<P>
	The National Gallery of Canada has a budgetary increase of 20 
per cent, from $27 million to $33 million. More museums: The 
National Museum of Science and Technology has an increase of 33 
per cent, from $15 million to $20 million. There is no end.
<P>
	Remember how critical the Reform Party has been of the 
minister of heritage and her flagrant and spendthrift waste, waving 
flags courtesy of the taxpayer. Everyone knows the story.
<P>
	Status of Women, Office of the Co-ordinator has an increase of 
222 per cent, from $4 million to $15 million. All these areas are 
under the control of the Deputy Prime Minister, that newly elected, 
wonderful member from Hamilton East who is also the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage. I am sure she is doing her bit to cut the size of 
government. Right?
<P>
<B>(2045)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Oh yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Right.
<P>
	Let us talk about the Minister of Finance. He is the one who is 
prudent and tight with the dollars. He says he is wrestling the 
deficit down. There was increase in the Department of Finance of 
19.1 per cent from $49 billion to $59 billion, largely because the 
debt is going up and up. It will be $100 billion more during the life 
of this government using an 8 per cent rate. That is another $8 
billion each and every year out of the pockets of the taxpayers.
<P>
	The largest transfer program in the history of Canada is the 
transfer from the poor taxpayers, the downtrodden, hardworking 
Canadian taxpayer and it is going to the moneylenders, the bankers, 
the investors, the overseas people who are buying our bonds. The 
largest transfer program in the history of Canada is the $50 billion 
to the rich financiers around the world.
<P>
	Is that fiscal management? Is that prudent management? Is that 
sound management? Is that what the Liberals tell the people at 
election time? No, they say jobs, jobs, jobs and the unemployment 
rate is stuck at 10 per cent. The next time around it will be jobs, 
jobs, jobs and the unemployment rate will be stuck at 10 per cent. 
Not a single word will be said about the fact that the interest costs 
on the debt has gone up 10, 20, 30 and 40 per cent. It is now $50 
billion and by the turn of the century that will be $60 billion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4397"> 4397 </A></B>
<P>
	We heard the member for St. Boniface talk about how the coast 
guard and the department of fisheries were working closely to 
reduce costs. At fisheries and oceans the increase is 15.7 per cent 
from $775 million to $896 million.
<P>
	At Indian affairs, that wonderful department that creates all these 
jobs, has an increase of 6.2 per cent from $4.9 billion to $5.2 
billion. The Federal Court of Canada has an increase of 60 per cent 
from $19 million to $31 million. It is all here.
<P>
	Is that fiscal management? No. Is there prudent management? 
No. Help themselves to the taxpayers money? Absolutely yes. 
Absolutely yes because every nickel has come down on the deficit 
as being from increased tax revenues. There has been no reduction 
in unemployment to speak of. They have helped themselves to the 
money from the working people by refusing to reduce the 
unemployment insurance premiums. Now the government has a $6 
billion slush fund that the Minister of Finance is using to say: ``I 
have met my deficit target''.
<P>
	High unemployment insurance premiums kill jobs. We know the 
Minister of Finance is sitting on top of a slush fund so he can say he 
has met his target. He is putting people out of work because UI 
premiums are too high. Let that message be put out. Let the 
message go out to Canadians that this is irresponsible management. 
The government refuses to allow the a legitimate expression of all 
members as to what they think of these estimates. That has to 
change in this House and the way they are appointed and elected 
down the hall. That House has to change too.
<P>
	There is no end to the improvements that the Reform Party could 
and will make.
<P>
<B>(2050)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very carefully to what the hon. member from the Reform Party had 
to say and, while he was speaking, I was thinking how lucky 
Quebec voters are to have members of the Bloc Quebecois 
representing them here in this House. How lucky they are and how 
lucky we in the Bloc are to be able to come to this House to defend 
Quebec's interests and share our views with members of the other 
parties. Our views are often different from theirs because we are 
linguistically and culturally different.
<P>
	In 1968, the Government of Quebec was led by Daniel Johnson 
Senior. There is a big difference between the father and the son. I 
can tell you that the father was a great premier. So the then Premier 
of Quebec, Daniel Johnson, abolished the legislative assembly, 
which was equivalent to the federal Senate. Believe it or not, 
Quebec has continued to function since then. We realized that we 
did not need two Houses in Quebec. If this works for every 
province, why would it not work for the central government? This 
would resolve an enduring situation that has been deteriorating for 
a long time. We have talked about reforming the Senate for a long 
time. We now see that it is impossible to reform because we cannot 
agree on anything.
<P>
	The Reform Party favours an elected Senate. It would not be so 
bad, at least, if senators were elected. But what is the advantage of 
having two Houses of Parliament?
<P>
	We are a middle power with a population of 27 or 28 million. 
Every Canadian province has its own government. There are 
governments in all 10 provinces and in the territories. We have a 
central government, municipal governments and school boards. 
Why not do away with the Senate?
<P>
	In my school days, we were told that the Senate was a Canadian 
creation modelled on the House of Lords. It was decided at the time 
to copy the British parliamentary system. The title of lord is 
hereditary. In the Canadian system, it was decided to appoint 
senators. It may have been a good thing at the time, not knowing 
how educated the members of the Lower House would be, to have 
slightly more educated people sitting for a longer period in the 
Upper House. But what good is it today?
<P>
	One thing matters: those who represent the people must be 
elected. This prompts me to ask this question: Would Canada not 
do better with just one House instead of reforming a Senate that is 
beyond reform?
<P>
	There was talk about reform in 1970 and again in 1975 and 1978. 
When I was in school, we kept hearing about all these plans to 
reform the Senate, but no agreement was ever reached. As a result, 
the Senate remains the same and carries on.
<P>
	I think that not to abolish the Senate at this time is to show lack 
of respect for Canadian voters, who work hard to send people to 
represent them in this place. These representatives work hard, very 
hard. We all know how expensive it is to run a Parliament. The 
Senate alone costs $43 million per year at the lowest estimate and 
$65 million, when everything is taken into account. What a saving 
this would be: $65 million. With this money, we could afford to 
build one or two hospitals per year in Canada, and these would be 
much more useful than a Senate.
<P>
	Nowadays money must be invested where it will be profitable. A 
Senate is not a profitable investment. All a Senate does is give the 
Prime Minister in office an excuse to appoint his friends, to reward 
those who have served the party well. So, instead of wasting our 
time stubbornly insisting on reforming an archaic institution, why 
not just abolish the Senate?

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, one notes that when the members 
from the Bloc talk about legitimacy they get very sensitive about 
the issue. I think it is because they feel quite sensitive themselves 
about being here and wondering about the legitimacy of why they 
are here in the first place or how they can stay here.
<P>
	I believe I talked about this earlier on this evening. There is a 
need sometimes for the house of sober second thought, as the other 
Chamber is currently considered at this point in time. I have 
reasons for saying that. Let us take a look at a couple of situations.
<P>
	A couple of years ago the GST created a furore in this House. 
The prime minister of the day used his majority to ram that 
legislation through this House before sending it down the hall to 
the other House for the sober second thought. The opposition party 
had the majority down there at that time. There was tremendous 
animosity around the country and this hated tax was not to be 
introduced.
<P>
	The prime minister of the day used a very small quirk of the 
Constitution which had never been used before to change the 
majority down the hall to guarantee passage of his hated 
legislation. If that had been an elected Chamber, a Chamber where 
all the regions were properly represented and could not be 
tampered with by the prime minister of the day then or today, we 
would not have to tell Canadians that we would scrap the GST. The 
Deputy Prime Minister would not have had to put her seat on the 
line because she would not have had to make an election promise 
that she would scrap the GST. There is a very real reason for that 
House.
<P>
	The other reason, as I said, is that sometimes we get a little 
headstrong in here and sometimes we get carried away. No better 
example is down the road in the province of Quebec, in the city of 
Quebec and the legislature of Quebec where the premier of the day 
says: ``I don't care about the rule of law. I don't care what the court 
says about whether my actions are legal or illegal or whether they 
are legitimate or illegitimate. I get what I want''. We need a second 
House to ensure that democracy is protected in this country. Even if 
it only pops up every so many years it is very important.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I just have a few words. I want to share my time with the 
hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester.
<P>
	First, as far as the Bloc is concerned, it was not very long ago 
when its members stood in this House and praised the Senate. It 
was not very long ago when they were suggesting that perhaps the 
Senate was the only place that could protect the people from the 
legislation of the Tories, for example, the old age pension cuts and 
the GST.
<P>
	What was the last piece of legislation that the Bloc stood in the 
House and supported that involved massive tax changes? What was 
it? Was it a bill from the government? Was it a bill from this 
Chamber? No, it was not. It started with the letter <I>S</I>. The letter <I>S</I> 
denotes the Senate. The Bloc stood in this Chamber and fell over 
backward. They tripped over one another to praise the Senate and 
all the work it had done on this massive tax change that was called 
S-9. They praised the committee system of the Senate. It was a 
massive, sweeping tax change. It was probably the biggest tax 
change we have had in about 20 years.
<P>
<B>(2100 )</B>
<P>
	Why? Because the Bloc said: ``This is a wonderful bill coming 
from the Senate. What it does is reduce taxes as it relates to the 
United States. We represent the people of Quebec who like the 
United States. Therefore, we are all in favour of what the Senate is 
doing''.
<P>
	They fell over backwards. In fact, they were kissing cousins with 
the Reform Party. They were hugging one another. They stood up, 
both of them, praising this legislation, a bill with an <I>s</I> on the front. 
It did not have a <I>c</I>, which means Commons; it had an <I>s</I>, which 
stands for the Senate. It came from the Senate. It originated from 
the Senate banking committee and they stood as one, the Bloc and 
the Reform Party. They praised it and they praised it and they 
praised it. Now the Bloc stands today and says that they are asleep 
in the Senate.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They are.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> The Reform Party of course says that it is a waste of 
money. The Reform Party says everything is a waste of money. I 
was looking at their alternative to these estimates. I was looking a 
moment ago at what they regarded as being a waste of money in 
health care, page 24.
<P>
	What do Reformers say about health care in Canada being a 
waste of money? They say: ``Medicare in which everyone receives 
everything health care professionals wanted to deliver is not only 
intolerably expensive, it is undesirable for other reasons. 
Consumers should be allowed to stay outside the publicly funded 
system completely if that is their wish, or to supplement publicly 
funded care with additional privately funded care if that is their 
wish''. A waste of money.
<P>
	Then the Reformers went on to say that roads and bridges were a 
waste of money. Let us see. They say on page 14 of their budget: 
``Typically, physical infrastructure refers to traditional features like 
highways, ports, railways and airports. Given our current fiscal 
climate however, governments are ill equipped to spend money on 
such improvements. In Canada this saving can be done by 
privatizing aviation, privatizing airports''. Then number two, 
``allowing private sector companies to build and maintain roads 
and bridges''. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4399"> 4399 </A></B>
<P>
Imagine the cost of driving the Alaska highway if that were the 
case with the Reform Party in power.
<P>
	Then the Reformers went on to say on page 46 that 
unemployment insurance was a waste of money. They suggested an 
incredible thing. They suggested that the premiums not be reduced.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Not reduced.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> No. ``Don't reduce the premiums'', they said, ``until 
all the deficit is taken care of, until a new fund has been built up''. 
In other words, sock it to the employers, sock it to the employees. 
They said that after all this has been done, then they could pass on 
some savings to the employees and the employers. With the 
Reform Party everything is a waste of money.
<P>
	What are we debating here today? We are debating to concur in 
the main estimates for the year ending March 31, 1997. For what 
country? To listen to the Bloc and the Reform, boy, what country do 
members think they are thinking about?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Burundi.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Let us take the G-7. Could it be Italy? Its growth rate 
is 1.2 per cent minus, no, not Italy. Is it France? Let us come up a 
little further now at 2 per cent, no. Is it the U.K. at 1.5 per cent? 
That is not what we are debating. Is it Germany at .8 per cent? No. 
Is it the great country of Japan? No. We are not even close to the 
top in economic performance. Oh no, it is not Japan. Is it the United 
States at 3.4 per cent? No, it is not. What country is it that we are 
doing the estimates on? Could it be that it is the country that has 
been judged by the OECD as being the richest country today in 
economic growth of all of the G-7 countries, the country of 
Canada? Is that what we are talking about today?
<P>
<B>(2105)</B>
<P>
	These figures are not from an organization in downtown Toronto 
or downtown Montreal. Where do these figures come from? Hon. 
members from the Reform and the Bloc should visit the 
parliamentary library and pick up the OECD Economic Outlook. 
Twenty-seven countries in the world whose job is to do what? They 
are representatives of 27 governments of the industrialized 
democracies of the world who discuss and attempt to co-ordinate 
their economic and social policies. What do they say? They say that 
Canada since the fall of 1993-what happened then? Wow, is that 
not a coincidence? Since the fall of 1993 to the beginning of 1996, 
for those three years Canada had the strongest employment growth 
of all of the G-7 countries. They did not stop there. Then they said 
for the year 1997 in terms of economic growth, Canada is projected 
to rank first among the G-7 countries.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Say that again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> That deserves repeating. We have to repeat it, Mr. 
Speaker, because we are dealing with estimates of that country 
called Canada. Who has been the leader of that country, judged to 
be the most progressive nation in the world today, that the Bloc and 
Reform are saying here today is an absolute disaster? We are led by 
the most successful Prime Minister, the greatest Prime Minister 
this country has ever had and he will lead us into 1998 and beyond.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
somewhat embarrassed by comments made in this House. The 
member who just spoke said that Canada is the richest country and 
that it enjoys a very high rate of economic growth. However, the 
member seems to overlook another Canadian reality.
<P>
	There is no reason to brag when one looks at all the shameful 
cuts made to social assistance and to unemployment insurance, and 
when one considers that one out of five children does not have 
enough to eat. I am somewhat embarrassed by such comments, 
because I think the economic reality is not that pretty.
<P>
	I feel like we are in a school yard during recess and that we are 
discussing whether we could cut $40 million and give this very 
amount to sectors that have suffered these shameful cuts.
<P>
	I wish to call to order the member who boasts about playing a 
role in a flourishing Canadian economy.
<P>
	I wonder about that. Canada is no longer the country it used to 
be. The federal government keeps making cuts in transfer 
payments to the provinces. It gives the provinces the responsibility 
of maintaining a social safety net, while it no longer has the means 
to send-Quebecers pay $30 billion in taxes and they receive less 
and less.
<P>
	To use a popular expression, this is nothing to write home about.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. That is why I mentioned right at 
the very beginning of my comments how incredible it was that the 
Bloc turned around and heaped such praise on the Senate and the 
banking committee for all of those changes that gave the big tax 
cuts to the big multinationals in the United States and in Canada. 
Some people agree with that. It is a legitimate way of looking at 
things, the way the world is going with globalization and so on.
<P>
<B>(2110)</B>
<P>
	I was shocked that the Bloc members would stand in this 
Chamber on behalf of those poor people they purport to represent 
and approve en masse the biggest tax cut to the wealthiest people in 
North America that we have seen in this century. And they are 
supposed to be the official opposition. There was no examination at 
all by the official opposition except for some members on  this side 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4400"> 4400 </A></B>
<P>
of the House. No, we did not vote against the legislation but we 
used our privilege and our positions in this great democratic party 
that we represent to question the actions of the Bloc and the Reform 
Party who welcomed those cuts for the rich so much.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls earlier in 
his presentation quoted from the document that is known in these 
circles as the ``Taxpayers Budget'' released by the Reform Party a 
couple of years ago, it reminded me of the day I brought home a 
shiny brochure of a nice new car. I put it down on the kitchen table 
and my wife went ballistic. I asked: ``What is the matter, dear?'' 
She said: ``I know it is only a brochure on the table today, but it is 
going to be in the driveway tomorrow''.
<P>
	That is exactly what we will see with the taxpayers budget. It is 
on his desk today and it is going to be in their red book tomorrow, 
because it is a pathfinder. It is where the Liberals get their 
direction.
<P>
	Where did we get the $600 billion debt? We all acknowledge the 
fact that we have a wonderful country. But we have a sacred trust to 
pass this wonderful country on to our children and their children 
and their children in at least as good a shape as we got it. How can 
we do that if we give them a legacy of $600 billion of debt, if 40 per 
cent of every dollar taken in by the federal government goes to pay 
interest on the debt, money that we have already spent? Our 
generation has enjoyed the benefit. If we do not make the tough 
decisions that the Liberals will make because they are forced to by 
the Reform Party, we will never get our House in order. If we had 
not kept the Liberals' feet to the fire there would not even be a sniff 
of a chance that we would be as far down the road as we are today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Mr. Speaker, it still has not sunk in to the Reformers 
that since the fall of 1993 Canada has become the fastest growing 
economy of all of the G-7 countries. We have done that and will 
maintain that. But we will also maintain our commitment to senior 
citizens and we will maintain our health care system.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is a hard act to follow.
<P>
	These days it is fashionable to talk about fiscal responsibility 
and the need to reduce spending at all levels of government. While 
it is not difficult simply to cut spending without regard for the 
consequences, it requires great care to meet necessary fiscal targets 
while ensuring that the government policies support the priorities 
of Canadian society.
<P>
	In asking the House to concur with the appropriation bill, I 
would like to remind members that the estimates we have 
considered effecting today are taken to reduce program spending 
and at the same time to target  spending on what is most important 
to the Canadian public.
<P>
	For example, we have reduced direct support to industry in 
favour of policies that will stimulate growth and jobs. We have 
reduced costs by transferring the air navigation system and airports 
to not for profit corporations. We have taken steps to reduce 
subsidies to Canada Post and to VIA Rail. We have reduced 
defence spending by $200 million in 1997-98 and another $600 
million in 1998-99. These are just a few examples of the actions we 
have taken to meet our fiscal responsibilities.
<P>
<B>(2115 )</B>
<P>
	Under program reduction, many costs in services have been cut 
to the Canadian people. But one program brought in over the last 
three years was the infrastructure program. In Quebec alone, there 
were more than 2,400 projects. That brought in a total of more than 
$2 billion to the Quebec economy, resulting in more than 29,000 
jobs.
<P>
	In my province of Nova Scotia, there were more than 316 
projects, which brought more than $200 million to the economy 
and more than 4,000 direct jobs. This is significant and it is 
particularly significant in the east, not only in Quebec but in Nova 
Scotia where the infrastructure is antiquated and much in need of a 
boost.
<P>
	I would remind the House that this year's estimates are a vital 
component of that program spending regardless of the program 
cuts, and this year's estimates alone call for $157 billion in planned 
budgetary spending compared with $164 billion last year. This is a 
significant reduction while at the same time serving the Canadian 
people in programs they desire.
<P>
	That intent and the reality has been that we wish to secure our 
nation's financial future, and that has been done that through 
serious, very methodical but very fair cuts, and through very 
serious methodical consideration of what the Canadian people 
want, while at the same time investing in the future which is the 
future of our youth.
<P>
	When we went to the Canadian people looking for a mandate to 
govern the country, we set targets as a government and we set 
goals. The first goal was to reduce the deficit. When we took power 
in 1993, members will know that the deficit was around $42 billion 
a year. That is nearly 6 per cent of gross domestic product which 
had a very negative impact on the economy.
<P>
	It was mandatory that we set responsible, credible financial 
targets that we could meet. For the first time in many years, the 
government has been credible. It has written the plan and it has 
followed through. There is confidence from the Canadian people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4401"> 4401 </A></B>
<P>
	The goal is that by the end of the fiscal year 1996-97, we will 
be at that real target of 3 per cent of GDP in deficit reduction and 
be around an annual deficit of $24 billion.
<P>
	This is extremely important as we vote tonight on estimates that 
will pay for program spending over the next few months. What it 
has done is send a message to the Canadian people and to the world 
markets that the Canadian government is a very credible, very 
realistic government.
<P>
	What it has done is bring inflation under control and interest 
rates down. Short term interest rates have declined by more than 3 
percentage points since March 1995, which has brought the debt 
charges down. We are paying less money out on debt servicing as 
well.
<P>
	We have also provided cost competitiveness in this country. This 
is the best it has been for the Canadian public for more than 45 
years. That is a significant component of the Canadian economy.
<P>
	We also have the largest trade surplus that we have had in 
decades. It is this trade surplus that sets Canadians in the front on 
the world stage. We can manufacture, we can market and deliver 
those goods competitively throughout the world. This is a very 
vital and a very important component of the overall economy.
<P>
	As well, by reducing the deficit we have reduced our foreign 
dependency on dollars to simply manage the economy on a day to 
day basis. That alone is a significant part of the stability in our 
financial segment and of presenting ourself as a great leader among 
the G-7 nations.
<P>
	The economy has generated more than 650,000 jobs over the 
past three years. That is also important because it is not the 
government that is creating the jobs, but it is government policies 
that are allowing the private sector to create the jobs.
<P>
<B>(2120 )</B>
<P>
	It seems to me that the government has focused on the goals it 
set. It has delivered on what was offered to the Canadian public. 
The job is not all done but it will continue.
<P>
	It seems to me that the reason the Reform Party put this motion 
to abolish the other place is because the government has set the 
goals financially and has been responsible fiscally and it has no 
argument on the financial front and so we now have to take a new 
debate and put it in place. The government has spoiled Reform's 
platform because it has delivered and provided a credible, fiscally 
responsible and socially responsible government.
<P>
	I say to the members of this House that the opposition parties 
had plenty of opportunity through the Meech Lake accord, through 
the Charlottetown accord, for which both parties expressed their 
distaste and their  opposition. However, they had the opposition at 
that time to deal with the other place. It would have provided an 
opportunity for restructuring and for looking at some of these 
issues that we are looking at here in the government. The 
government has been about restructuring for three years, about 
program cuts, program spending and it is dealing with it in a 
realistic manner. It will have the opportunity again to deal with the 
other place.
<P>
	It is my belief that every member in the other place probably 
would look for restructuring as well because as this century closes 
and we move into the 21st century time is moving so rapidly with 
so many changes that it is imperative that every institution in all 
parts of society must come forward and look at restructuring in 
order to keep pace with the rapid changes.
<P>
	Over the summer months I did a survey in my constituency and 
throughout Nova Scotia. I made the statement that the government 
had set a strategy at the outset of reducing the deficit, keeping 
inflation at a manageable level and lowering interest rates to 
generate a fiscally responsible climate so that the private sector 
might come forward and the entrepreneurs flourish in creating jobs 
and developing that very competitive economy. That strategy was 
set by this government in 1993. I asked my constituents: ``Are you 
in favour of the government strategy''.
<P>
	I would like to tell the House tonight that in those questionnaires 
that came back to me through the summer months more than 97 per 
cent of respondents indicated they were in favour of the 
government's financial strategy and their policies and that we 
should proceed in that direction.
<P>
	The public is in favour of this fiscal strategy, of the program cuts 
that the government has made. They are not all perfect but they are 
done fairly and equitably across the country. I have suffered them 
as many members have in their ridings, but the public is aware of 
how difficult it is.
<P>
	I believe that this is why we are debating the other place tonight. 
It is because the government has followed through on its financial 
commitments and delivered a responsible government. It is my 
belief that in fiscal year 1997-98 the size of the debt in relation to 
Canada's economy will decline. It will be the first time in many 
years that the economy will grow faster than the debt and deficit.
<P>
	I believe we have answered the challenge from the opposition 
parties as the Government of Canada. We have fulfilled our 
promises. We have set the stage and have been responsible 
financially. The passing of the estimates tonight will support what 
Canadians believe, that what we are doing is appropriate for them. 
Because we have become responsible fiscally, we have stolen the 
platform from the opposition. That is why they would  rather 
debate the other House. The time has come to restructure the other 
House as well.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with a great deal of interest to my Liberal colleague's speech. 
However, I would still like to say that I find the Liberals have 
drifted away from what liberalism and the philosophy of liberalism 
are advocating in this government. I will explain.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4402"> 4402 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2125)</B>
<P>
	This government has made cuts, it had to, everyone agrees. 
Everyone elected to this House realizes and understands that the 
size of government has to be reduced. We have an accumulated 
deficit of $600 billion. It is so large that it is difficult to calculate.
<P>
	In the past, the philosophy of the Liberal Party was always to 
redistribute the wealth. This was where its strength lay and what in 
fact made the difference between our society and that of the United 
States. Here in Canada, we believed that the wealth should be 
redistributed.
<P>
	Let us look at what this government has done since it came to 
power. What has it done? First of all, it has reformed 
unemployment insurance, now known as employment insurance, 
but this is really just semantics. It has reformed unemployment 
insurance to the detriment of the unemployed and of workers, who 
will now receive much less. They will now have to work many 
more hours to qualify for the insurance they are paying for, despite 
the fact there are surpluses in the fund. That is one thing the 
government has done.
<P>
	Second, they have cut provincial government subsidies. The 
Minister of Finance has very cleverly offloaded the deficit on the 
provinces. That is what he has done. The provinces cannot do this 
because they are another level of government. The minister was 
clever, but he must be denounced. Less money for welfare, less 
money for families.
<P>
	Finally, who pays? Low wage earners, the middle class, and the 
most defenceless are the ones who will pay and who always pay. 
We know that the philosophy of this big party which governs the 
country was to redistribute wealth. At the moment they have 
forgotten about that. It is far easier for them to tax the poor than to 
go looking for the money where it really is, so that is what they do.
<P>
	The government lacks courage. I see them looking into their 
book and not saying much. They know I am telling the truth. It is a 
government lacking in courage. They have made cuts, and 
everyone agrees that cuts had to be made, but they have not cut 
where they ought to have. They have cut back on the budgets for 
the poor, the low wage earners. I find that a great pity.
<P>
	A program was announced in the red book-remember the red 
book?-about creating daycare centres. They have forgotten about 
that.
<P>
	Before asking my question, I would like to speak of the 
infrastructure program. That was a good program, one of the few 
good ones, maybe the only one, they brought in. You will recall that 
this is a joint program with the provincial and municipal 
governments, so there are three levels working together, each one 
contributing a third.
<P>
	In my riding, there is no money left. The question I am asking 
the hon. member is whether we ought not to bring back this 
program, as soon as possible, in order to create short term 
employment?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member asks where is our 
liberalism and are we not defenders of liberalism. I would say that 
yes, indeed we are and part of the restructuring that we have done is 
to secure Canada's financial future and the future for our youth.
<P>
	When we talk about infrastructure and the past, the program 
costs over the past two and a half years totalled $6 billion: 
one-third for municipal, one-third for provincial and one-third for 
federal. Ladies and gentlemen, do you know that $2 billion-
<P>
<B>(2130)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. member to address 
her comments to the Chair, not to ladies and gentlemen. 
Unfortunately that term cannot be used in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, and hon. members of this House, I 
would like each one of you to be aware that $2 billion-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am going to stop the hon. member each 
time she does not address her remarks to the Chair and if she 
continues to do it I am going to recognize someone else.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, $2 billion of the $6 billion went to 
the province of Quebec. That is the point. We have shared in that 
liberalism. It is my hope that the infrastucture program will be part 
of the next platform of the government. The hon. member believes 
it is very valuable in the province of Quebec. I know that province 
quite well myself. I have many friends there.
<P>
	It is important because of the antiquated infrastructure that 
exists. It is the same in the province of Nova Scotia and the eastern 
region. There is much need to build basic infrastructure, sewage 
treatment plants, water systems for industry, preventing sewage 
from going into the Bay of Fundy and into our oceans. We have 
advocated this for many years but it has never been done. It is 
extremely important as we move into the 21st century that we have 
another infrastructure program.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure as a parliamentarian to take part in this vigorous debate 
this evening in order to reject a proposal to renew a $40 million 
budget for the Senate and demand its abolition.
<P>
	My colleague pointed out earlier that the Bloc Quebecois is 
intervening specifically on the motion to renew a $40 million 
budget for the Senate and not on other budgets allocated to various 
programs. We could have intervened just as well on the amount of 
$25 million set aside for social housing, which is clearly 
inadequate, or on the amount of $15 million to be extended for the 
status of women, which is also clearly inadequate. However, when 
$40 million is spent like that, $40 million to produce duplication 
and overlap, and you know that duplication and overlap have 
always signalled the call to arms for the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	It is no secret that the people of Quebec are fed up with the 
Senate and have been for a long time. It is a fact that a broad 
consensus existed in Quebec on the abolition of the Senate when 
the Charlottetown talks were being held, but this consensus was 
reached well before that time, as early as 1980.
<P>
	During the referendum year of 1980, federalist politicians, 
without sovereignist leanings, I may add, were already demanding, 
as expressed by Claude Ryan in his beige paper, the abolition of the 
upper House. My point is that this is not just a quirk of the big, bad 
separatists.
<P>
	The position of Quebecers on the subject has not changed since 
1980, on the contrary. Barely two weeks ago, a petition was 
circulated in my riding and all other ridings in Quebec in support of 
the motion of my colleague from Rivière-du-Loup, which will 
demand the abolition of the Senate, no less.
<P>
	The text of the petition is quite clear, and the reasons introduced 
to support abolition of the Senate are as follows: Whereas the 
Senate consists of non-elected members who are not accountable 
for their actions; whereas the Senate refuses to be accountable for 
its expenditures to committees of the House of Commons; whereas 
the Senate does not fulfil its representational mandate; whereas the 
Senate duplicates the work done by members of the House of 
Commons; whereas the Senate-and finally, it is necessary to 
ensure there are parliamentary institutions.
<P>
	Four hundred senators who are not elected share a budget of 
about $40 million, at a time when cuts are being made everywhere. 
That is why today the Bloc intervenes specifically on the 
appropriations allocated to the Senate. Although the petition has 
not been publicized in any way, it has already attracted hundreds of 
signatures in my riding that will be added to thousands more from 
other ridings and tabled by the hon. member for Rivière-du-Loup 
here in this House.
<P>
<B>(2135)</B>
<P>
	I sincerely believe that, in Quebec, my fellow citizens strongly 
desire the Senate's disappearance. More than two years ago my 
colleague from Richelieu gave us a very interesting historical 
background on that institution. I think it deserves to be quickly 
restated.
<P>
	My colleague said that the other House is a leftover from 
colonial times, that it was created to protect the wealthy 
landowners against the more populist endeavours of the elected 
members, our predecessors. The proof is that, at the time, senators 
had to be worth at least $15,000. Do we realize how much that was 
at the time? Obviously only rich people had that much money. 
They were protecting the interests of their wealthy citizens, a 
practice which has not yet disappeared, far from it, although it is 
now under a new guise.
<P>
	Of course the role of senators has changed, but nevertheless they 
are no longer needed. As with many other institutions, the 
theoretical role and reality are very far apart. The wealthy 
landowners have been replaced by faithful political lackeys. All 
sorts of abuses have been noted and publicized. There is no need to 
come back on that. The work done by members of that House has a 
lot more to do with the political agenda of the major parties than 
with fundamental research. The Senate has become the tool used by 
the government to avoid contradicting itself publicly and 
preserving its reputation when it realizes that it has made a 
mistake. It is now a very discrete and reliable tool, used by elected 
members of the main parties.
<P>
	A very good example of this is the process used for the bill on 
electoral boundaries, where the party in office benefitted greatly 
from this redistribution of representation. It was so blatant that 
several members condemned this practice in the House.
<P>
	Recently we were also able to see how undemocratic was the 
Senate. Last June, we could read in all the newspapers that the 
Senate had refused to pass the bill on the Pearson airport. There is 
no better example of what the Senate is and what power it has. How 
can we accept that people who are not elected, who are not 
accountable to the people, can decide on their own authority to 
reject a bill that was seriously examined and debated for several 
hours here in the House?
<P>
	Even though I was opposed to the bill in question, the fact 
remains that I am shocked to see people who were appointed for 
political services rendered either to the Conservatives or to the 
Liberals-it often boils down to the same thing-people who are 
not accountable to anyone, giving themselves the rights to decide 
the future of the biggest airport in Canada.
<P>
	How do the members of the party in office, the members of the 
same party that made sure to get a majority in the Senate, feel 
today, knowing that even some of the people they appointed to be 
their standard  bearers in the other House helped defeat a bill that a 
vast majority of them in this House were in favour of? How do they 
feel knowing that, instead of proposing amendments, the other 
House rejected the bill outright? That is not very flattering for the 
Liberal deputation. This is ridiculous. Some elected representatives 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4404"> 4404 </A></B>
<P>
bring in a bill, which is later rejected by a group of non-elected 
representatives called senators. This is the best example of what is 
so absurd about the Senate and the best reason to call immediately 
for its abolition.
<P>
	Whether they like it or not, Quebecers are paying for an 
institution that they do not support any more. The costs are very 
high, at $43 million, and there might also be some other expenses 
related to the senators' functions. In 1995-96, the budget is set at 
$42 million.
<P>
<B>(2140)</B>
<P>
	In the supply motion debated today, the amount shown is $40 
million. Unemployment benefits were reduced to allow the 
government to save on the backs of the unemployed. Single 
mothers living under the poverty line could see their welfare 
benefits reduced because provinces are receiving less from the 
federal government.
<P>
	Young people, looking for a first job are suffering from the 
absence of a job creation policy. The elderly could see their 
pensions cut.
<P>
	Can you imagine the frustration felt by all these people who 
know that huge amounts, to the tune of $40 million, are spent year 
after year on an institution that lives off the fat of the land, an 
institution that does not serve any more its initial vocation and that 
these people have not wanted any more for a long time now. Since 
1980, the people of Quebec have pronounced themselves in favour 
of the abolition of the Senate. That being, some wonder why our 
fellow citizens drop out, why that have become so bitter with 
regard to the politicians.
<P>
	Far from approving these supplies of $40 million for the Senate, 
the Bloc Quebecois is asking for its abolition pure and simple 
because the Senate has lost its raison d'être. We have to modernize 
our institutions, but the Senate is an outdated institution. Its raison 
d'être is no more justifiable with people suffering cut after cut in 
social assistance, in unemployment insurance, in youth programs, 
women's programs, day care centres and so on. These $40 million 
are used to make duplication and overlapping.
<P>
	When will this government have the courage to abolish that 
institution serving only partisan purposes? Today in this House, I 
am calling for its abolition pure and simple. Let us allocate money 
to programs aimed at helping women, at creating more day care 
places. I am waiting for this government to take the right decision 
at last.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
evening in dealing with the main estimates I have  had an 
opportunity to listen to a number of members discuss the Senate. 
The Reform Party has spent a lot of time outlining its policy of an 
elected Senate and each and every speaker from the Bloc 
Quebecois has used this aspect of the estimate to say that the 
Senate should be abolished because it has outlived its time.
<P>
	As all members know, there has been a lot of work done over the 
years on reforming the Senate. Even as this place has to reform 
itself from time to time, there are things that can be done to 
improve it.
<P>
	The member indicated that the Senate killed the Pearson bill and 
was it not awful that this unelected, unaccountable body can kill a 
bill. The bill was stopped but the government can still bring back a 
further bill if it wishes to pursue it further.
<P>
	I want to ask the member a question about accountability. 
Notwithstanding that she has suggested that the Senate should be 
abolished, she mentioned that it is an unaccountable body. She 
knows that there are 104 Senators which is about one-third the 
number of members of Parliament. That means that each senator 
effectively represents somewhere in the neighbourhood of about 
300,000 people. It also means that if they were elected and were 
accountable the way the member suggested they should be, then 
they would have to run in ridings three times larger than the 
member's own riding. In addition, they would have to have some 
kind of constituency facility and a bureaucracy within the 
constituency to be able to serve their electors.
<P>
	Then there is the problem of how we rationalize the 
responsibilities of an elected senator and an elected member of 
Parliament. Who do the constituents go to?
<P>
	It is very easy to reach conclusions to abolish, reform or elect the 
Senate. But none of the impacts of making bodies such as the 
Senate accountable have been thought through. What would be the 
implications to the whole system?
<P>
<B>(2145)</B>
<P>
	The Canadian Parliament has three parts: this Chamber of the 
House; the Senate; and Her Majesty the Queen as represented by 
the Governor General. The Senate is an integral part of Canada. It 
is very clear that the position of the Bloc-and I hope the member 
will comment on this-has nothing to do with fiscal responsibility 
but very much to do with the need to break up Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I never said in my comments that 
senators should be accountable to the electorate. When I say that 
they are accountable, I do not mean they are accountable to the 
public, because they are not elected representatives. I never meant 
to say senators should be elected by the people.
<P>
	What we are demanding is actually the abolition of the Senate, 
pure and simple. I cannot figure out how the member could draw 
these conclusions. The abolition of the Senate is what we want. I do 
not want an elected Senate.
<P>
	I think these $40 million for the Senate is just money thrown out 
the window. What the Senate does is nothing but duplication and 
overlap. After bills are discussed here, there are debated once 
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4405"> 4405 </A></B>
<P>
more, which delays the  passage of some of them. An appointment 
to the Senate is a kind of old age security for deserving friends of 
the Liberals or the Conservatives. In these days of fiscal restraint, 
when we cut different programs for the young, for women and for 
the destitute, it may be a good idea to consider areas where there is 
some fat to pare.
<P>
	Senators are not accountable to the people and they are not 
elected by the population, but I repeat for the sake of the hon. 
member that I do not want senators to be elected by the population. 
What I want is the abolition of the Senate in order to get these $40 
million back and use them in areas where they are badly needed. 
Quebec is not the only province subjected to federal cuts. That is 
why we should turn to areas where cuts can be made.
<P>
	What do we need the senators for, nowadays? To pass bills that 
have already been passed by this House? I do not see the rationale. I 
am pretty sure many people in Quebec and Canada are in full 
agreement with the Bloc Quebecois position, which is the abolition 
of the Senate, pure and simple.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, you have the 
pleasure of hearing me as the last speaker tonight. I will try to be 
interesting for you, Mr. Speaker, for my colleagues and also for all 
those who are watching us on television.
<P>
	I believe it would be worth recalling the motion on which will 
have to vote in a few minutes. It reads as follows: ``The President 
of the Treasury Board requests that the House concur in Vote 1, in 
the amount of $40,713,000 under Parliament-Senate-Program 
expenditures, in the Main Estimates for the fiscal year ending 
March 31, 1997.''
<P>
	Forty million dollars, and we should add to that a few more 
millions provided for services offered by different departments and 
other federal agencies to maintain that honourable and noble 
institution. In fact, the exact amount of the funds granted to the 
Senate will be close to $55 or $60 million at the end of the year.
<P>
	Before granting such an amount of money to an institution like 
the Senate, we must ask ourselves what purpose it serves. We must 
ask ourselves what the Fathers of Confederation had in mind in 
1867 when they created a Parliament with two Houses. During 
those 22 years, the senators had to debate 18 bills from the House 
of Commons, which did not received royal assent either.
<P>
<B>(2150 )</B>
<P>
	More than 125 years ago, the Fathers of Confederation thought it 
was a good idea to have these two assemblies, one of which is non 
elective, namely the Senate. But it would be interesting to look at 
the Senate's record since the birth of our federation. I examined the 
list of interventions made by the Senate from 1867 to 1996, the last 
year for which statistics are available.
<P>
	Let us round the numbers off and take the period from 1867 to 
1900. In the first 33 years, the Senate proposed amendments to 
House of Commons bills which never received royal assent. There 
were 105 bills during the Senate's first 33 years of existence.
<P>
	During the next 25 years, from 1900 to 1925, there was a slight 
decrease. The Senate proposed amendments to 93 bills which never 
received royal assent. That gives us a cumulative total of 198.
<P>
	From 1926 to 1963, that is during the next 37 years, the work of 
senators decreased even more. They proposed amendments to 49 
House of Commons bills which, after having been passed in the 
Senate, did not receive royal assent. So from 1867 to 1963, a period 
of 96 years, the Senate made a grand total of 247 interventions with 
regard to bills presented in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Starting in 1963 there was a period of lethargy that lasted 11 
years during which the Senate did not propose any amendments to 
House of Commons bills. It is probably during this 11 year period 
that senators fell into a deep coma that they are still having great 
difficulty getting out of.
<P>
	Then suddenly, from 1975 to 1996, that is during the past 22 
years, the work started again. During those 22 years, the senators 
had to debate 18 bills from the House of Commons, which did not 
received royal assent either.
<P>
	Overall, during its 129 years of existence, the Senate had to 
examine 265 bills from the House of Commons that never received 
royal assent, which means these bills were discussed in the Senate 
but never became law. So, with 265 bills in 129 years, for an 
average of 2 bills a year, I can understand that the senators fall 
asleep and can not stay awake even in front of television cameras.
<P>
	Now, lets look at the bills that were introduced in the House of 
Commons, amended in the Senate and received royal assent. I went 
back to 1960 only. In the 22 years from 1960 to 1982, 35 bills were 
amended in the Senate, sent back to the House of Commons and 
received royal assent.
<P>
	In the following 14 years, from 1982 to 1996, the Senate 
recommended amendments to 30 bills that were later adopted by 
the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(2155)</B>
<P>
	In all, from 1960 to 1996, for the 36 years of statistics that I 
noted down there were 65 bills. This is just short of 1.8 bills a year 
or less than two bills annually. At such a pace, one can hardly stay 
awake and justify a salary. This is why those people do not feel the 
need to go before the public and account for what they do.
<P>
	It would be embarrassing to show such a record to their 
employer, the taxpayers who pay the salaries of the senators. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4406"> 4406 </A></B>
<P>
would really be embarrassing to face taxpayers and say: ``My 
friends, this is the work we have done in 129 years on bills 
introduced in the House  of Commons which did not receive the 
royal assent and other bills introduced in the Commons which we 
managed to amend and which were then passed by the House of 
Commons''.
<P>
	No wonder there is a temptation to reform the other place. Since 
1960 only, 52 bills on the Senate have been introduced in this 
House to modify its role or its functioning or even to abolish it.
<P>
	Those 52 bills aimed at abolishing the Senate. Stanley Knowles, 
an honorary member of this House, alone has attempted 18 
times-between 1964 and 1981-through motions presented in 
this House and through private bills, to have the Senate abolished.
<P>
	Despite all these attempts, it has never been possible to make 
any significant changes to the operations of the Senate or to its very 
existence.
<P>
	Its role was understandable at the time of the creation of the 
federation, in 1867 and in 1900. The Senate was seen as a sort of 
chamber of sober second thought. Its members calmly considered 
the legislation, free from public pressure. This was understandable 
in 1867, but the role of the Senate today is far different because of 
the practical limits on its powers.
<P>
	Is what is called in English ``double checking'' or in Quebecois 
``double vérification'' still necessary nowadays? The primary role 
of the Senate was to double check the laws passed by the House to 
ensure that the first chamber had not made any mistake, had not 
made serious mistakes for the taxpayers, and it was the role of the 
Senate to correct any mistake or to propose amendments to bills.
<P>
	But nowadays, given the modern means of communication, 
television, the Internet, it is no longer possible to pass laws 
expeditiously without arousing among people increasing interest, 
which leads the lobbying groups to come and tell the government it 
is making a mistake or is being unfair towards a certain segment of 
society. This is why we no longer need this double checking 
institution.
<P>
	In the five provinces that used to have a Senate, this type of 
political institution has been abolished. That was the case in 
Quebec in 1968. Quebec was the last province to abolish the 
Senate, and it did so because this institution was no longer needed. 
The same thing could be true for the Canadian Senate.
<P>
	When, in 1968, the legislative council was abolished in Quebec, 
if it had not been commented in the media, we would still not know 
that it was done away with, because we went on passing laws, and 
the same thing is true in the four other provinces where the 
legislative council was abolished.
<P>
	Nobody complained that laws had become unfair or less 
equitable for the people. We now have a public that is better 
informed and members of Parliament that are better prepared. 
Nowadays, with the political and legislative systems we have, 
members are able to get all the information they need.
<P>
	I do not believe it to be necessary to spend between $50 and $60 
million a year to keep an institution that does not double check, to 
all intents and purposes, but mostly acts as a place where some 
friends of the party in power are sent as a reward for services 
rendered-and when their senator's earnings are not enough, they 
are appointed as lieutenant governor. Fortunately, there are only ten 
positions of lieutenant governor. Otherwise, there would not have 
been enough of them for all the senators interested in a new job.
<P>
	For these reasons, we think it would be improper to support 
appropriation for an institution which does not have our confidence 
and which we would like to see not only changed, but abolished 
outright.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We have about 60 seconds. That means a 
30-second question and a 30-second answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Senate, as the member knows, also provides an important 
opportunity for women to be represented in the Parliament of 
Canada. One member I can recall very specifically, whom the hon. 
member may want to comment on, is the Senator from Etobicoke, 
Joan Neiman. Although no longer a senator, while in the other 
place she chaired a wonderful committee dealing with euthanasia.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would comment on the value that 
women in the Senate contribute to the Parliament of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin: </B>Mr. Speaker, it is not the presence of the Senate that 
allowed women to sit in the House of Commons because, for 
decades, the Senate, in its wisdom, never introduced legislation 
suggesting to the House of Commons that it give women the right 
to vote and to sit in the House.
<P>
	If there are women in the House today, in increasing numbers, it 
is because women took matters into their own hands, because 
women are better informed and they have made their case. No 
Senate allowed women to reach the status they have nowadays.

	The House resumed from September 17 consideration of Bill 
C-45, an act to amend the Criminal Code (judicial review of parole 
ineligibility) and another act, as reported (without amendment) 
from the committee.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The House will now proceed to the taking of the 
deferred recorded division at the report stage of Bill C-45.
<P>
	The question is on Motion No. 1. A vote on Motion No. 1 applies 
to Motions Nos. 3 and 5. An affirmative vote on Motion No. 1 
obviates the necessity of putting the question on Motions Nos. 2, 4 
and 6. A negative vote on Motion No. 1 necessitates the question 
being put on Motion No. 2.
<P>
<B>(2240 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, if you were to seek it, I believe you 
would find unanimous consent that the members who voted on the 
previous motion be recorded as having voted on the motion now 
before the House with Liberal members voting nay on this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to be recorded as voting for 
Motion No. 1.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am afraid there is no unanimous 
consent on this. We are going to have to vote on this one.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We will be voting on this motion.
