</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK4">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should ensure 
that the contributions of women veterans are properly recognized 
and honoured in every provincial capital city by way of monument 
or statue. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this is a motion I first introduced in 
the House close to three and a half years ago.  I might add that 
the motion did not come from me.  It came from hundreds of women 
who I represent in the various legions throughout my riding. 
Since then, hundreds of other women in legions clear across the 
country have phoned, faxed or e-mailed to indicate their support 
for this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to say that we as parliamentarians, past and 
present, should always be very proud of the valiant efforts of 
our Canadian military.  Whether in World War I, the Korean 
conflict, World War II, the Gulf war, and so on, we should be 
very proud of the fact that our men and women were willing to 
risk their lives for us.  However, for every person we sent over 
in World War I, World War II and the Korean war, the majority of 
them were men.  Those men left behind sisters, mothers, daughters 
and wives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will focus my comments basically on World War II.  In World 
War II we had over 48,000 women who served in the Canadian 
military in uniform.  However that does not count the thousands 
of women who served in other capacities in our military 
component.  They worked in the factories, the fields and the 
hospitals.  Not only did they supply the materials needed for the 
war effort, they also looked after the families.  We basically 
took women out of the traditional role of the family, of staying 
at home more or less, and all of a sudden, because of the urgent 
need for women to assist, we moved them into the military.  We 
also moved them into the factories in order to assist us to keep 
the war production going.  Without the brave efforts of these 
women, we would not have been successful in our conflicts of 
years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An article was written in the <I>Daily News</I> on November 11,

country but the part that is neglected many times in our 
conversations is the valiant effort of women and what they 
contributed to our country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women's history month was created in 1992 to encourage greater 
awareness among Canadians of the historical contributions of 
women to our society.  The Veterans Appeal Board, which was a 
great help, set up a website where the stories of women veterans 
and women who participated in various conflicts around the world 
can be posted, stories of what they and their mothers, 
grandmothers, daughters and sisters have gone through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the great city of Winnipeg, one of the leaders in the country 
in promoting these values, there is a statue and a monument 
dedicated to women who served in the war, who served in conflict 
and who served in various capacities to assist in the war effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the motion today asks is that a statue or a monument, 
similar to what Winnipeg has, be erected in every capital city in 
the country so that we properly recognize the women who served 
and gave so much, in an effort to honour them for what they have 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is a person in the country who does not get 
tears in their eyes on Remembrance Day when they see the silver 
cross mother lay the wreath at the cenotaph here in Ottawa, 
symbolizes a woman gave up her child for this country so that we 
could all live in a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the people who benefited from that was myself.  My 
parents and oldest brother were liberated by the Canadian 
military in the liberation of Holland in 1945, the country where 
I was born.  My father met a young Canadian soldier and asked him 
why Canada gave so much to help Holland.  The young man said that 
they had a job to do.  With that my father always said that if 
Canada had a military like that, can we imagine what kind of 
country they came from?  In 1956 my parents made the decision to 
immigrate to Canada.  That young Canadian soldier probably had a 
sister, mother, grandmother, wife or daughter back in Canada 
keeping the home fires burning so that he could do the job he was 
asked to do by his country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many times we as members of parliament talk about our families 
and the support they give us, which is very important for all of 
us in all political fields.  In order to do our jobs effectively 
and do the nation's business, it is good to know that our loved 
ones and children are back home running their day to day lives. 
Without that support we could not do what we are doing.  The same 
is true for military personnel, especially in times of conflict. 
Without the support of women back home keeping the home fires 
burning, looking after the families and working in the fields and 
factories, we would not have been successful in the war efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion was not deemed votable by the parliamentary committee 
but I ask the indulgence of the governing party and others to 
support this initiative.  Our women veterans are fading very 
quickly.  Every day we lose more of them.  This initiative came 
from women in legions and various organizations clear across the 
country who very simply have asked for their country to honour or 
recognize their efforts in perpetuity so that their stories will 
never be forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the House, after careful reflection, will look upon this 
and realize that in terms of financial costs it is minimal, but 
in terms of psychological costs it is tremendous.  What it will 
do for women is to tell them that Canada values their 
initiatives, their support, the work they have done and the 
sacrifices they have made for our military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a proud Canadian and one who was not born here, I know very 
well that I owe everything I have to the efforts of our 
governments and our military who sacrificed so much during World 
War I, World War II and the Korean conflict so that I could be 
free and millions of other people around the world could be free. 
Now our peacekeepers are doing the same around the world.  They 
are trying to keep the peace and trying to bring stability to 
wartorn countries around the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to note who was there waiting for members of 
the military the other day in Gagetown when they came back from 
Ethiopia: their wives, their mothers, their daughters and their 
sons.  The look on their faces when they were reunited showed 
that those men had a job to do for their country, not just for 
this country but in protecting and serving democracy around the 
world.  They could not do that unless they had the support of the 
women back home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important in this time in our history to reflect upon 
that and to pay tribute to these women in a most fitting way.  If 
we do this, if we move forward in a non-partisan way, we will be 
doing a great thing not only for the women of Canada but for 
ourselves as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the debate.  I appreciate the opportunity to 
stand in the House on behalf of people such as Lily Snow of 
Beaverbank, Granny Crosby of Eastern Passage, Val Mooney of the 
legion of Eastern Passage and many others who have asked me to 
bring forward this motion on their behalf, which I now have had 
the privilege to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak 
to the motion which advocates that the government ensures the 
contributions of women veterans is recognized and honoured in 
every provincial capital city by way of a monument or statue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On its surface it is a very worthwhile motion, one deserving of 
our support.  If we were to determine our support on the basis of 
the sincerity of the member opposite who just spoke in bringing 
forward this motion and on his good intentions, certainly we 
could support it.  Unfortunately, when we scratch the surface we 
find it is not a simple motion.  It is not one without its own 
complications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I preface my remarks by noting that the wording of the motion 
makes a comprehensive discussion of its merits somewhat 
difficult, not by what it suggests, that women veterans be 
honoured by way of a monument or statue, but rather by what it 
does not say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, which women veterans does the hon. member mean we 
should honour?  Is it wartime women veterans, peacetime veterans, 
veterans who serve on or near war fronts, or veterans who serve 
in a particular battle or campaign?  What about war era veterans 
who had service only in Canada?  These are important questions 
for which we need answers before a reasonable debate can take 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is also silent on the issue of cost and how these 
monuments should be paid for.  Who will design and build them? 
Will the provincial governments want to have their say in where 
such monuments might be placed and whom they should honour?  How 
would veteran organizations be involved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit these questions because it is one thing to be in favour 
of the motion that seems to suggest a good and honourable deed. 
However, on closer examination, it presents a whole slew of 
questions and problems that do not lend themselves to easy 
answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, acquiescence to the motion would definitely be a 
matter of easier said than done.  There is no denying the fact 
that women veterans have made a huge contribution to Canada, 
particularly during the war years of the last century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often first think of the incredible dedication of Canada's 
nursing soldiers.  They have a very proud legacy of military 
service that dates back as far as 1885 when for the first time 
Canadian nurses were sent to care for soldiers wounded during the 
north-west rebellion.  When the great war came more than 3,000 
would volunteer their services.  Casualty clearing stations were 
set up close to the frontlines and in harm's way. 
Not only were they subject to danger from the enemy, but 
contagious disease ran rampant in the terrible killing fields of 
that atrocious war.  Some 46 gave their lives through enemy fire 
or debilitating disease.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members need only walk down the Hall of Honour in centre 
block to see the memorial panel that honours the sacrifices of 
the nursing sisters of Canada.  On one part of the panel are two 
nursing sisters in uniform tending to a wounded soldier, surely 
symbolizing the courage and self-sacrifice of all those who 
served in war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to 1941 women had only served in the Canadian military as 
army medical corps nurses.  The decision was taken in June 1941 
to create a female branch for each of the fighting services 
rather than a single women's corps.  Women immediately began to 
enlist:  more than 21,600 in the Canadian women's army corps and 
more than 7,000 in the women's division of the RCAF where they 
served in Canada and overseas as wireless operators, clerks, 
parachute riggers and photographers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1942 the navy followed suit by creating the Women's Royal 
Canadian Naval Service, the WRENs.  The WRENs signed up more than 
7,100.  No women were assigned to combat duties but some came 
under enemy fire.  In all, approximately 8,000 women served 
overseas.  The nursing service was expanded to all three branches 
of the military:  the navy, the army and the air force, with over 
4,400 serving.  Many of them found themselves within range of 
enemy guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What of the women who served so ably on the home front?  When 
war was declared, 569,000 women worked in Canadian industry, 
mostly in clerical jobs.  As the war progressed and more and more 
men were sent overseas in uniform, the government turned its 
attention to the large pool of female labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within a short time 960,000 women were engaged in jobs in 
industry and another 800,000 were employed on farms.  Fully half 
of them were engaged in what had once been considered men's work: 
operating machines, welding, riveting, painting, driving street 
cars, building weapons and loading freight.  It is clear that the 
war effort could not have been sustained without the work of 
these civilian veterans on the home front.  Surely they are as 
worthy of honour as those who served in other capacities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course women in uniform continued to serve with distinction 
during the war in Korea and continue to do so in peacekeeping 
missions the world over.  Today they too are veterans 
distinguished as such by their service, not by their gender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now turn from the history of service to the history of 
Canada's memorials to our fallen veterans.  It has been our 
tradition to bury and remember our war dead in the places where 
they served.  The memorials overseas were constructed on 
principal battlefields and the geographical areas of importance 
in wartime.  Most of them are inscribed with the names of those 
whose remains were never found or identified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are naturally hundreds of different memorials over the 
globe.  Their history is inextricably entwined with the work of 
the Commonwealth War Graves Commission whose history dates back 
to the first world war.  Its mandate was, and remains, to mark 
and maintain the graves of members of the Commonwealth who died 
in the first world war and second world war, to build memorials 
to those with no known grave, and to keep records and registers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This work was founded on principles which have remained 
unaltered:  that each of the dead should be commemorated 
individually by name, either on the headstone on the grave or by 
an inscription on a memorial; that the headstones and memorials 
should be permanent; that the headstones should be uniform; and 
that there should be no distinction made on account of military 
or civil rank, race or creed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the war graves commission Canada has agreed to share 
along with other participating governments the cost of 
maintaining the graves and memorials in proportion to the number 
of her war dead.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada independently funds other memorials such as the Vimy and 
Beaumont memorials in France and the National War Memorial in 
Ottawa.  In the case of the latter I should note that the war 
memorial shows both men and women passing through the granite 
arches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I underscore that these memorials honour those who fell by 
virtue of their service and sacrifice in a battle or a campaign 
and not by virtue of their gender, their race, their church 
affiliation or ethnicity, not because of the accident of their 
birth but by their deliberation to serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For its part the Departement of Veterans Affairs honours the 
accomplishments and 
sacrifices of Canada's veterans in many ways.  For example, last 
year's initiative of establishing the tomb of the unknown soldier 
was embraced by the entire country.  Through the extensive 
television coverage of its installation, the new memorial 
garnered incredible attention and resulted in much discussion 
about the contributions of veterans to their nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that I am running out of time.  I will come quickly to our 
position in this regard.  In summing up, the motion is not 
supportable for essentially three reasons.  First, if approved, 
the motion could be seen as favouring one group of veterans over 
another.  Second, there are other effective ways to ensure that 
our wartime legacy is preserved and communicated to future 
generations.  Third, the cost is prohibitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building a monument to women veterans in each provincial and 
territorial capital would be a multimillion dollar expenditure to 
which ongoing maintenance costs would have to be factored in, not 
to mention the logistical and jurisdictional issues that would be 
raised when seeking the agreement and co-operation of each 
provincial and territorial government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is an honour to stand in the House to address this very 
important issue to Canadians.  It is said that if we lose sight 
of our history, we lose our vision of the future.  There is a lot 
of truth to that concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by commenting on the process today.  Once again we have 
an interesting private member's bill or motion.  We have the 
privilege of speaking to it for an hour, at the end of which the 
motion, being a non-votable item, will be dropped from the 
order paper.  For the umpteenth time I say we ought not to be 
using the time of the House of Commons debating issues which 
cannot be drawn to a conclusion.  Either we want to do this or we 
do not.  We should vote on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather interesting that this non-partisan private member's 
motion is from a member who belongs to the NDP caucus that has 
expressed opposition to having every motion and private members' 
bill votable.  Of course the government is in favour of it, but 
when asked today whether we can vote on it, the government will 
say that we cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an impasse which could be easily solved.  When a private 
member finds an issue that is of enough importance that he or she 
chooses to bring it forward for debate in the House, it is also 
important enough to give us the opportunity to stand and to 
indicate in a tangible fashion whether we are for it or against 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now spend a little time addressing the motion.  The 
motion is quite narrow, as I read it: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the government should ensure that the contributions of women 
veterans are properly recognized and honoured in every provincial 
capital...by way of monument or statue. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us would recognize, concede or admit that whenever 
Canada has participated in a military conflict its war efforts 
have been supported by a much larger group than simply those who 
enlisted.  My understanding of the word veteran is a person who 
was at one time enlisted in active service.  It is a very narrow 
motion, particularly because I think the greatest contributions 
of the majority of women who participated in the war efforts in 
the past were probably in the area of the non-enlisted. 
They contributed wholeheartedly indeed but they were not in the 
ranks of those who had actually enlisted.  There were many others 
who were enlisted and in fact offered much great service.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we were talking, I remembered hearing of a woman who was 
actively engaged in the ferry service, and I had to wrack my 
brain to remember her name.  At that time aircraft were being 
produced in North America and in Canada then had to be ferried 
across the ocean in order to be brought into active service.  The 
name of this woman is Vera Dowling.  Those members who know 
military history may have heard her name.  She was one of these 
people who ferried the aircraft across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members may well know, for the most part those people were 
not subject as much to enemy attack as they were to all of the 
vagaries of weather.  However, during the second world war, Vera 
was of course subject to the fact that the aircraft was not as 
reliable in transoceanic flight as it is today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we should certainly award an appropriate accolade 
active, engaged, enrolled armed forces members like Vera 
Dowling performing important activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, for many years Vera was a flight instructor in 
Edmonton who taught many young pilots how to fly.  I was never 
able to take the course, but I am told by those who did take her 
classes said they were very interesting.  While giving 
instruction on what to do under certain circumstances, Vera 
always had an interesting story or anecdote about something that 
had happened to her in her career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is of great importance for us to recognize the contributions 
these individuals make to the well-being and protection of our 
country.  As I said earlier, many of the women who served did so 
in a capacity which did not require that they be enrolled in the 
armed forces.  Mention has already been made of the almost one 
million women who actively supported the war effort at home by 
working in the munitions factories producing and turning out the 
weapons that were needed, as well as in aircraft factories. These 
women actively participated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I do not think we should say that they contributed any 
more than the mother who was left at home with young ones when 
her husband, and in some cases sons as well,  enrolled and went 
over to fight in the war.  That was a tremendous contribution and 
should not be in any way minimized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned before in this House that my wife and I have had the 
experience of having a son in an environment where the wearing of 
a flak jacket was necessary.  He was overseas working with a 
relief agency trying to bring aid to people in a war torn country 
and was in an area of great danger.  He had to where a flak 
jacket because, as he put it, he never knew when a bullet might 
go astray, and in fact one did.  I do not believe my wife and I 
suffered undue anxiety about our son when he was overseas, but we 
did indeed have a proper parental concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hence, as a newly elected member of parliament, I had the 
opportunity on November 11 to participate in Remembrance Day 
services at various spots in my riding.  Over the years I rotated 
to different locations.   When I did that, I experienced great 
emotion.  I put myself into the lives of those families, moms and 
dads, and in many cases mothers only because their husbands were 
also serving, who had their sons overseas not only being subject 
to a stray bullet as our son was, but also who were actively the 
targets of the enemy and whose probability of coming back alive 
in some cases was very low. 
What anxiety they must have suffered, and what a huge 
contribution they made in order to support the protection and 
defence of our country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say one more thing about these little ceremonies that 
I have participated in.  I usually rotate to the places in my 
riding where there are active Legions, but last year I accepted 
the invitation to go to Chipman, a little town in my riding.  I 
do not think that there are more than 150 people living in the 
town but they have a memorial site.  It is a beautiful site which 
they maintain.  It is a community project.  They built the 
statute and even took the time to have a beautiful mural painted 
on the side of their community centre, which is next to the 
statute. They commemorate and remember the contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I believe we should recognize, acknowledge and honour all 
people, regardless of gender, who supported the war effort, I 
would greatly support the government encouraging individual 
municipalities, cities, towns and villages to voluntarily put up 
monuments at their expense, to women who participated in the war 
effort, rather than the government funding them, perhaps at the 
expense of money that is available to present day veterans.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to be able to speak today on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois 
on the motion before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by adding my voice to that of my colleague 
from the Canadian Alliance on just how regrettable it is once 
again for us to be dealing with a non-votable motion.  As a 
result, my NDP colleague will probably be obliged to ask for 
unanimous consent, and judging by what we have just heard from 
the Liberal party, he can moreover expect not to obtain it. 
This is most unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that the reasons given by my Liberal colleague do not 
hold water.  They do not.  As far as jurisdiction is 
concerned, it is proposed to erect monuments in each provincial 
capital.  It seems to me that the Liberals have no scruples 
about meddling in areas of provincial jurisdiction when it suits 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being told “when it comes to honouring women and their 
contribution to the war effort well, unfortunately, we have no 
money”.  Yet we know that the Minister of Finance's budget 
forecasts constantly include several billion dollars in 
surplus, which always needs to be multiplied by five or six in 
reality, so this does not strike me as a good reason.  It is not 
a reason to raise the matter of jurisdiction.  It is not a 
reason to raise the matter of costs.  It is not a reason to 
raise the matter of unfairness to other groups of war veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the veterans have a day devoted to them.  We visit 
monuments and honour the veterans.  But, the fact that we fail to 
recognize that these veterans would not have won the war without 
the extraordinary effort of the women of Quebec and Canada is 
appalling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only did they go to the front to care for the wounded and 
provide health care—it is absolutely essential in wartime to 
have people to look after the wounded—but they contributed to 
the war effort by working in the weapons industry.  Without them, 
the wars would not have been won in the name of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel a lot of compassion and gratitude when I think of these 
people, like my father, who was a member of the Fusiliers 
Mont-Royal, who went overseas to liberate Europe.  It was an 
important cause.  It was a global cause.  It was the global cause 
of the day.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we speak of the globalization of the economy, but in 
those days, there were governments trying to undermine democracy. 
They wanted to spread their influence over all of Europe. 
Everyone knew that it would spread beyond Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people contributed to the war effort.  My father went to 
Europe and helped liberate Holland.  During this time, my mother 
worked at the Singer company in Saint-Jean.  She worked 12 to 18 
hours a day in the production of ammunition, which my father was 
no doubt using. 
Why should we now say that my mother did not make a contribution, 
because she did not go to the front? Had my father not had 
bullets to put in his gun, we would not have won the war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP motion acknowledges such contributions. It allows us to 
recognize the efforts made by Quebec and Canadian women to win 
that war. It would not cost hundreds of millions of dollars. We 
are talking about 12 or 15 statues. Quebec jealously guards its 
jurisdictions, but if Canada proposed to put up a statue to pay 
tribute to women veterans, to those who supported the economy 
during the war, I do not think there would be many objections 
raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the federal government be the one investing 
money in that area. I do not agree that these should be optional 
measures, that some people should go back to their town, city or 
province and say that it would be a good thing. Veterans come 
under federal jurisdiction. They are honoured every year. The 
Department of Veterans Affairs sends wreaths in every riding of 
Canada to honour our veterans. We see them marching to the war 
memorial on Remembrance Day, but there are only men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that my mother should march with them. We could also 
honour these women on that day, but not only in front of a war 
memorial. There should also be a statue for women veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that veterans would have any problem recognizing 
that women supported them during the last war, not just on the 
medical front, as members of health teams, but also in the 
production of military supplies.  It was women who held Canada 
and Quebec together, not men; they were all at the front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to get into the whole business of conscription, 
but my father did his duty and went overseas.  I would like my 
mother to be honoured as well.  She did her duty; she worked 12 
to 18 hour days for four years making munitions for the front. 
What we are asking for today is some sort of recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not buy the explanations of the Liberal Party.  We have no 
objection to the motion. I think the government should send a 
clear signal to the women of Canada and Quebec and tell them 
“Thank you very much for what you did.  It was not just the men 
who went to the front who saved us; without you, victory would 
not have been possible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member were to seek unanimous consent, the Bloc 
Quebecois would be delighted to give it.  I think that one day, 
if not now, then as soon as possible, recognition must be given 
to the women of Canada and of Quebec for their great contribution 
to the war effort.  We would therefore be prepared to support 
this approach at any time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is certainly an honour and a privilege to stand in support of the 
motion presented by my left leaning colleague to my right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I should say to the hon. member from the Bloc before he 
leaves that I could say hear, hear to his speech and sit down, 
because he covered the issue extremely well.  He indicated for us 
what women went through during the war, as well as how he 
addressed the response from the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat in amazement as I listened to the government member try 
to explain why we should not do anything to recognize women who 
served during the war either directly or indirectly through their 
involvement in the ammunition factories, in the preparation of 
bandages or by keeping the home fires burning.  There is a line 
in a poem which says “they also serve who only stand and wait”. 
So many people waited for their husbands, brothers and sons to 
come back, and many never did.  How can we recognize the trauma 
these people went through? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member of the governing party asked which women veterans 
would be recognized.  My answer is that all of them should be 
recognized regardless of the confrontation and regardless of how 
they were involved.  The member has also said that there were 
other agencies that could work with the provincial and municipal 
governments.  I say to the hon. member that if provincial or 
municipal governments balk or throw blockades at suggestions like 
this, then they are just as bad as the government opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For too long we have found red tape and bureaucracy to put in 
the way of doing what we should be doing.  We spend more time and 
waste more money finding reasons for not doing something than if 
we had gone ahead and done it in the beginning.  That is typical 
of the government opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was born during a time when people were not involved in major 
wars, such as World War I or World War II, but I knew many of my 
relatives, friends, neighbours and countrymen had been.  The two 
countries that fought in the war—unlike my colleague from the 
Bloc I am not saying Canada and Quebec—were Canada and 
Newfoundland.  Newfoundland was not part of Canada at the time. 
It was a country on its own.  The contribution made by 
Newfoundland, now a proud province of Canada, was second to none. 
The contribution made by Newfoundlanders was recognized not only 
here in the new world but by countries the world over.  Many 
Newfoundlanders paid the supreme sacrifice to give countries, 
such as the homeland of my hon. colleague, the freedom they now 
have.  We are very proud of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The soldiers who fought so valiantly in the wars would not have 
been able to do so without the support on the homefront and the 
involvement of women, whether it was direct involvement or the 
supportive roles that many of them served.  As our veterans came 
back home and tried to fit into life after the wars, the trauma 
they went through is something they have and always will carry 
with them.  It has not been easy for them to come back and live a 
normal life, carrying the memories that they carry with them. The 
support of the women on the homefront has helped carry them 
through it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the Canadian Legion branches established all across 
the country.  If we listed all of them we would find that many of 
them are active today because of the involvement of the women 
legionnaires.  One of them is Elizabeth Lee who is from my area 
of Riverhead-St. Mary's Bay.  Long before my involvement in 
active politics and all during my political years, whenever there 
was anything on the go it was Elizabeth who was organizing it. 
She sought out the funding and to enhance the facility.  It is 
women like her who have been the backbone behind the efforts of 
keeping this great country going.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a question of being able to afford to do something for 
these women.  It is that we cannot afford not to do something for 
them. The excuses, red tape and hurdles that have been put in 
place because of a very simple suggestion give us an idea of what 
we are going through.  We should all be together, proud of our 
heritage and culture.  Yet people just sit and fiddle while Rome 
burns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In about 10 minutes the issue will die on the order paper, but 
if my hon. colleague who introduced the motion is satisfied to 
keep it alive, I am sure many of us, certainly on this side of 
the House, would be satisfied to work with him to make sure it 
does stay alive. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, like others I was not totally 
prepared to speak to this excellent private member's motion. 
However, having listened to the debate I felt I had to rise to 
address it at least in some small way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague in the Canadian Alliance has said, we cannot 
help but remind all other parties in the House, as we work 
through private members' business in these dying days of the 
opening session of parliament, of the need to make all motions 
and bills votable.  It is high time to move toward that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Elk Island indicated, regardless of what party 
members represent, when they go to the trouble and effort to 
draft motions or bills and bring them before the House, it is 
incumbent upon all of us to participate in the debates; to listen 
very carefully to the points being made, either for or against; 
and ultimately to have the process culminate in a vote.  As 
happened in the case of a couple of my private members' bills, to 
have some of them non-votable is a huge disservice to the whole 
democratic process to which we have all talked about adhering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleague in the Progressive Conservatives, I was 
appalled at the remarks of the member for Sault Ste. Marie in his 
role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans 
Affairs.  He stood in his place and criticized the motion before 
us by questioning who should be honoured and who should pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have recently gone through a process in this place whereby 
the government in its infinite wisdom rammed through pay and 
pension benefits for its own members in a very quick fashion.  It 
seems ludicrous to me in the extreme that the government can look 
at a motion like this one which would honour people who certainly 
warrant the highest honours bestowed upon them, shrug its 
shoulders and say it is easier said than done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government certainly did not adopt that attitude when it 
came to its pay raises.  It was very quick to ensure it was 
pushed through the House as quickly as possible regardless of 
whether members were for it or against it.  It did a disservice 
to the issue and to parliament.  It left an impression with the 
electorate, with Canadians in the real world outside the Ottawa 
bubble, that somehow there were members who were ashamed of the 
process so it had to be fast tracked.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the question of who should be honoured, we should 
bestow the honour upon all women who participated in the war 
effort, regardless of whether they worked in the fields or in the 
factories; whether they went overseas; whether, as was indicated 
by a number of members, they were involved in the nursing 
profession; whether they drove a lorry; or whether they were a 
chauffeur for a general.  Regardless of what role they played or 
whether they supported the families left behind, all women who 
were involved in the years our country was at war deserve to be 
recognized and honoured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very point the parliamentary secretary was trying to make 
about this somehow being divisive and questioning who should be 
honoured was ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would pay?  It is a bit early in the process to say who 
would pay.  It could be a joint private-public enterprise as we 
have seen many times before.  Which level of government does not 
have to be spelled out or that we want to exclude organizations 
from involvement.  Special committees might spring up across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Elk Island said, many cenotaphs, statues 
and other ways of honouring people in society who have done great 
deeds in the past have been financed either at the local level or 
through a truly national initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit of a red herring for the parliamentary secretary, in 
representing the government, to say we should do nothing because 
we have not got down to the basic about who will pay.  That does 
not do any service and does not reflect well on our institution 
and on members of parliament to adopt that attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the motion. 
I commend my colleague from the New Democratic Party for bringing 
it forward.  I believe very strongly that all Canadians, 
regardless of gender, involved in the war effort protected the 
rights all of us enjoy today: the right to speak openly and to 
represent all different political stripes and parties in the 
Parliament of Canada.  These rights were protected by the people 
who we wish to honour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We honour and recognize them today if only by our words. I hope 
the motion will not die and that there are ways in which we can 
keep it alive and move it forward to proper recognition of women 
who contributed so much during those very difficult years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is a huge issue.  It is a pity the government did 
not bring forward this excellent private member's motion.  We are 
speaking about women veterans now, but in terms of paying respect 
to the men and women who did such amazing work for us and 
thinking about the sacrifice many of them made, it seems a shame 
the government was not willing or keen to bring the matter 
forward and say that we need to recognize them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my rural constituency of Beaver River, now Edmonton North, I 
spent many a Remembrance Day going around to various towns and 
paying tribute to the people who did such amazing things.  Every 
Remembrance Day I pay tribute to the veterans at the Calder 
Cenotaph and then visit the army, navy and air force vets 
association on 127th Street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a huge turnout of people young and old.  It excites and 
amazes me when I see people in the generations coming along 
behind us taking time out, whether they are cadets or 
grandchildren of veterans, to pay tribute to those who went 
before us.  It is essential.  It is amazing to see legions packed 
to the rafters on Remembrance Day and at other times as well. 
Surely the least we could do is take time out of our busy 
schedules to pay tribute to that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, my congratulations to the hon. member who brought the 
private member's bill forward.  It is a word of encouragement, I 
suspect, to the government to make sure it pays tribute here.  If 
the Speaker simply gets up and says that we spent a nice hour 
discussing it and then the issue gets the drop kick and is gone 
forever, that would be a pity.  If that is our attitude and the 
respect we pay to veterans, it is truly a sad day for parliament 
and for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly ask the government to pick up the ball and run 
with it and pay tribute to the veterans who have done such an 
amazing job for us.  Those of us who are too young to remember 
the war, the baby boomers and those who have come along behind 
us, need to pay attention to the issue and keep it burning all 
the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of blocks from Parliament Hill is the war memorial. 
What an amazing place it is for so many thousands of Canadians 
certainly, but also for people from all over the world who come 
to pay tribute to the new tomb of the unknown soldier and to the 
veterans who served in the wars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would again recommend to the government that it treat the 
issue as a fairly high priority.  I know when it puts things in 
high priority they can whiz through this place faster than the 
speed of light.  It would certainly be a good, healthy, 
respectful, positive thing if it could do that today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank all my colleagues on this 
side of the House and even my good colleague from Sault Ste. 
Marie.  I believe if he had put down the department's notes and 
read from his heart we would have heard a different speech from 
him.  That is the problem.  When one is in government one must 
sometimes speak the government line.  If the department does not 
want something to happen it simply does not get done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to my hon. colleague from Sault Ste. Marie.  He says 
that the government does not want to do things based on gender.  If 
that were the case it would never have addressed the status of 
women.  We even have a secretary of state, a minister, dedicated 
strictly to the status of women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  It is because a forward thinking government years ago 
understood that issues of women were not being addressed properly 
by the government or by the country and that women were left 
behind in many aspects of society.  It therefore created the 
ministry to build up women and give them an opportunity to 
address their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was therefore disappointing to hear the hon. member say that 
the government does not want to do things based on gender.  It 
was disappointing and I know personally that he probably does not 
believe it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my hon. colleagues from the Alliance Party, the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Conservative Party who spoke so eloquently on 
the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality it would not cost much money.  In all likelihood the 
government would get tremendous support from the citizens of the 
cities where the monuments would be.  Most important, the 
government would once and for all be able to tell the women of 
Canada, who served so valiantly and bravely that, yes, it 
recognizes them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is never too late to do a good thing.  The motion is a 
no-brainer for the government to accept.  Mr. Speaker, if it were 
votable I could almost assure you that the majority of Liberals 
back there would vote for it.  I do not see how they could not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would at this time, Mr. Speaker, seek the unanimous consent of 
all members in the House today to make the motion votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent to make this item a votable item? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  The time provided for the 
consideration of private members' business has now expired. As 
the motion has not been designated a votable item, the order is 
dropped from the order paper.

</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK14">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill S-11, an act to 
amend the Canada Business Corporations Act and the Canada 
Cooperatives Act and to amend other acts, as reported (with 
amendment) from the committee. 
<A NAME="LINK15">&nbsp;</A>

that the bill be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf 
of the Minister of Industry in support of the expeditious passage 
of Bill S-11, an act to amend the Canada Business Corporations 
Act and the Canada Cooperatives Act and to amend other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During second reading debate on Bill S-11 several hon. members 
took note that the bill would represent the first substantive 
amendment to the CBCA in over 25 years.  In that time there have 
been significant developments in corporate governance practices 
driven primarily by the globalization of capital and business 
markets.  These developments are only exceeded by the tremendous 
advances in technology that have made globalization possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members may recall that the bill is the product of 
extensive review and analysis that began in 1994.  Consultation 
with stakeholders was comprehensive.  There were nine discussion 
papers, coast to coast meetings by Industry Canada and parallel 
national consultations by the Standing Senate Committee on 
Banking, Trade and Commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reforms in the bill would improve and modernize four 
important areas of the marketplace framework statutes that govern 
business corporations and co-operatives.  First, they would 
expand the rights of shareholders by facilitating wider 
communication and encouraging more participation in corporate 
decisions through the shareholder approval process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, they would help eliminate barriers to global 
competitiveness by allowing corporations more flexibility in 
choosing directors from a wider international pool of talent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, they would more reasonably define the responsibilities 
and liabilities of directors, officers and shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, they would eliminate unnecessary regulatory duplication 
and reduce the cost of compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the reforms in the bill would give corporations and 
co-operatives greater flexibility in pursuing marketplace 
opportunities.  Because of this, shareholders large and small can 
be more confident in the future value of their investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reforms are a response to the new ways Canadian companies 
are doing business today.  They would encourage corporate 
governance practices that are geared to long term growth and they 
would provide a sound framework for prospering in the global 
marketplace.

by the dissolution of parliament last October.  However the 
interruption allowed the government time to give further 
consideration to representations made before the Senate 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would incorporate the resulting improvements, and that 
is what we would make into law.  I am confident that hon. members 
will agree that we should approve the recommendations of the 
Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and then 
approve Bill S-11 as amended. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill S-11, an act to amend the 
Canada Business Corporations Act and the Canada Cooperatives Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the main federal law governing corporations in Canada, the 
Canada Business Corporations Act, or CBCA, sets out the legal and 
regulatory framework for more than 155,000 federally incorporated 
businesses.  The Canadian Alliance supports the bill, which would 
amend the CBCA for the first time since 1975.  That is quite a 
period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several changes are necessary, in our view.  It is a real 
understatement to say that business has changed fundamentally 
since the mid-1970s.  It is high time the Canada Business 
Corporations Act reflected the transformation to the global 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous act to amend the CBCA was tabled in the Senate 
during the last session of parliament as Bill S-19.  The bill 
never made it out of the Senate.  It died on the order paper when 
the federal election was called.  The Senate committee 
nonetheless heard from over 30 witnesses between April and the 
end of June 2000.  People from the Canadian Bar Association, the 
Canadian Co-operative Association and the taskforce on the 
churches and corporate responsibility were among those who 
testified at the Senate committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 is substantially the same as Bill S-19 but it 
reflects and incorporates the recommendations that came forward 
from the hearings.  It deals with the concerns identified by the 
people who came forward as witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments seek to modernize the Canada Business 
Corporations Act in four areas:  first, by recognizing the global 
nature of the marketplace; second, by clarifying the 
responsibilities of corporate directors and officers; third, by 
reducing federal-provincial duplication; and fourth, by expanding 
shareholder rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 would reduce residency requirements for board members 
to 25% and eliminate the requirement entirely for board 
committees.  The change is long overdue and would help Canadian 
companies compete as global players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where we are these days.  There is more investment 
outside Canada by Canadians than there is direct foreign 
investment in Canada.  We have seen a sea change in what is 
happening in terms of investment in the last few years. Canadians 
are reaching out and servicing the marketplace around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is regrettable but characteristic of the government 
across the way that certain sacred cow sectors would be exempt 
from the residency requirement reduction.  We question the 
rationale regarding the book publishing industry, 
telecommunications and transportation.  Under Bill S-11 
Petro-Canada would not be permitted the flexibility to appoint 
directors based on their qualifications but would do so based on 
where they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another welcome change is an amendment that would allow Canadian 
federally incorporated companies to compete with foreign 
multinationals while expanding globally.  Bill S-11 would do this 
by authorizing foreign subsidiaries of Canadian corporations to 
acquire shares in their parent corporations under limited and 
clearly defined circumstances such as acquiring or merging with 
foreign companies and corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 would replace the good faith reliance defence for 
directors with a due diligence one which would allow corporations 
to pay for defence and investigation costs, thus encouraging 
directors to take more appropriate risks.  Bill S-11 would also 
clarify responsibility for corporate officers and directors by 
replacing the current joint and several liability regime with one 
of modified proportionate liability.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, joint and several liability would continue to apply in 
cases of fraud and to designated categories of plaintiffs such as 
the crown, charitable organizations, unsecured creditors and 
small investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 also spells out in law that under a unanimous 
shareholders' agreement the directors' liabilities and defences 
are transferred to the shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 seeks to end the costly and time consuming 
administrative and legal burdens on federally incorporated 
businesses by eliminating conflicts and overlaps between federal 
and provincial statutes and regulations.  We applaud that.  For 
example, the CBCA's provisions for takeover bids would be 
repealed to allow the comprehensive provincial codes for takeover 
bid regulations to prevail.  Bill S-11 would also repeal the 
federal duplication on provincial insider trading requirements 
while increasing the maximum fine for insider trading from the 
current $5,000 to $1 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 would allow for greater participation by small 
shareholders in corporate decision making.  It would do so by 
relaxing the rules under which shareholders communicate among 
themselves and would allow proxy solicitation through public 
broadcast or newspaper advertisements instead of by direct 
mailings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments would encourage corporations to employ new 
technologies.  The technologies are not so new now, but in a 25 
year timeframe they do seem new.  These include e-mail when 
communicating with shareholders and conducting regular 
shareholders meetings.  Bill S-11 is trying to bring Canada up to 
speed with what has been happening in the massive changes in 
communications in the last 25 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would also liberalize mechanisms for individual 
shareholders to submit proposals and aims to restrain management 
ability to block or refuse proposals from being considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance believes that Bill S-11 reflects the 
transformation of business since 1975 with respect to the global 
marketplace, the electronic revolution and the rise of 
shareholders' rights, as well as the necessity for reducing 
federal and provincial redundancies.  Because of the four changes 
I have mentioned, we believe that this would bring us into the 
modern era in terms of the regulations surrounding the Canada 
Business Corporations Act.  The Canadian Alliance is happy to 
support the passage of the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill 
S-3, the Motor Vehicle Transport Act, 1987 at third reading. Bill 
S-3 was tabled in the Senate on January 31 and was examined and 
reported by the Senate Standing Committee on Transport and 
Communications.  In the House it received second reading on May 
15 and was referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and 
Government Operations chaired by my hon. colleague from 
Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee heard from a number of witnesses, including: 
Transport Canada, the sponsoring department; public safety 
organizations like CRASH, otherwise known as Canadians for 
Responsible and Safe Highways; the Canadian Trucking Alliance, 
which represents the for hire trucking industry; the Forest 
Products Association of Canada, whose members ship products by 
truck throughout North America; the Manitoba Department of 
Transportation and Public Services, the director of which was at 
the committee representing the federal-provincial-territorial 
Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators.  We also 
heard from the Canadian Industrial Transportation Association, 
whose members ship products by truck, and the Canadian Bus 
Association, representing the scheduled intercity bus transport 
and bus charter industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These witnesses presented many different perspectives on road 
transport.  All supported the principles of Bill S-3 and none 
opposed its passage, but there were some good suggestions made 
nonetheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say that passage of the bill would solve all the 
problems of motor carrier regulation and heavy vehicle safety. 
Two principal concerns came to the fore during the discussions 
and these concerns were remarkably consistent among the different 
witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First there was a concern that commercial vehicle safety needs 
more leadership and that such leadership should be provided by 
the federal government.  Second and more specifically, the 
national safety code for motor carriers, based on the 1987 
federal-provincial memorandum of understanding, is being 
inconsistently applied across the country.  This inconsistency 
has possible safety implications.  As well, it causes 
difficulties for the national and international motor carrier 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take those concerns as statements of the challenges that exist 
in motor carrier regulation.  We are taking note of those 
statements and suggest that this House do the same.  Bill S-3 is 
an important step toward effective solutions.  The bill states 
that its objective is to ensure that the national transportation 
policy is carried out with respect to extra-provincial motor 
carriers.  Specifically it states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) the regulatory regime for those undertakings is focused on 
safety performance assessments based on the National Safety Code 
for Motor Carriers; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) the operating standards that apply to those undertakings are 
applied consistently across Canada. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3 reflects the challenges that remain for motor carrier 
regulators.  While it does not provide complete answers for all 
issues it provides an important framework or umbrella legislation 
with clear goals to address them.  Heavy truck traffic is 
increasing dramatically, and as we have confidence that our 
economy will continue to grow trucking will surely continue to 
grow with it.  It is important that we recognize this inevitable 
result of economic success and take the necessary measures to 
ensure that commercial road transport is carried out in the 
safest possible manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This point was recognized in 1987 when the national safety code 
memorandum of understanding was signed by federal, provincial and 
territorial ministers.  It was also recognized in 1997 when the 
Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators, representing 
all Canadian governments, began development of national safety 
code standard no. 14, safety rating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Safety rating is very simple in principle but very complex to 
carry out.  First, it requires that all accidents, traffic 
violations and non-compliance with motor carrier safety 
regulations be recorded in a consistent manner wherever they 
happen.  This may be anywhere in Canada or North America. Second, 
it requires those records to be related to a particular motor 
carrier and transmitted to the home province of that motor 
carrier.  Third, it requires the home province to receive data 
from all other jurisdictions and to develop a profile of that 
motor carrier.  From that profile a rating is calculated by the 
home province in such a way that the result would be the same as 
in any other jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of these steps is automatic and all require development and 
co-operation among provinces as well as judicious use of advanced 
communications technology.  The result is, however, far reaching. 
A key goal of safety rating is expressed in the introduction to 
standard no. 14, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responsibility for motor carrier safety resides, first and 
foremost, with motor carrier management. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is most important.  With many thousands of vehicles 
operating in every corner of our country and into the United 
States and Mexico, no government by itself can take 
responsibility for all aspects of commercial vehicle safety.  The 
full co-operation of each and every motor carrier is an essential 
ingredient of safe road transportation.  Safety rating is 
designed to demand and foster that co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Safety rating by one province is recognized by all other 
provinces so that duplication of safety enforcement effort is 
avoided together with unnecessary impediments to motor carrier 
movement.  Sources of information on the safety of operation of 
any motor carrier are multiplied since data is received from 
wherever the carrier operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is likely to produce red flags against unsafe motor 
carriers much more quickly than when each jurisdiction enforces 
in isolation.  It will help to ensure that motor carriers who do 
not operate safely will be rapidly removed from the road.  In a 
more positive vein, when the accumulated information consistently 
shows a motor carrier to be operating safely, that motor carrier 
will have freedom to operate throughout Canada and North America 
with a minimum of red tape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Safety is a primary goal, but the importance of trucking to our 
economy means that efficient and objective safety regulation and 
enforcement is a real bonus.  The same applies to the bus 
industry.  Extra-provincial bus transport is a much smaller 
activity in Canada than trucking, however, it supplies a vital 
transport need to many Canadians and does so with an impressive 
safety record.  The bus industry also requires clear and 
consistent safety rules.  Safety rating addresses those 
requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to return to the two challenges identified during 
the committee hearings, that is, for the federal government to 
show leadership in motor carrier safety regulation and to take 
the necessary steps to ensure that the national safety code is 
implemented consistently across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Motor Vehicle Transport Act authorizes provincial 
governments to regulate extra-provincial motor carrier 
undertakings.  Without the federal act, provincial governments 
are not able to regulate the federal motor carrier entity and can 
therefore only enforce safety standards in a piecemeal manner. 
This legislation alone is an important demonstration of 
leadership by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal-provincial-territorial consensus, national safety 
code standard no. 14, will be the standard base upon which the 
provincial governments will regulate extra-provincial motor 
carriers as well as their own local carriers.  In this way, not 
only are national and international motor carriers subject to the 
same safety standards across Canada, but so are local carriers, 
which represent nearly half the heavy trucks and buses on the 
road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are currently two sets of regulations under the Motor 
Vehicle Transport Act.  The proposed motor carrier safety fitness 
regulations would replace the current extra-provincial truck 
undertaking licensing regulations and would base motor carrier 
regulation firmly on safety performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the effort to implement these regulations, Transport 
Canada is contributing funding of about $5 million per year to 
provincial governments.  The department is also active in 
supporting research and in participating on committees and 
working groups of the Canadian Council of Motor Transport 
Administrators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is taking the lead on a project group to 
examine remaining issues of consistent national application of 
standard no. 14 and of other national safety code standards. The 
other regulation under the Motor Vehicle Transport Act is the 
commercial vehicle drivers hours of service regulations, which 
are based upon national safety code standard no. 9.  These are of 
great interest to the public and to the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments to standard no. 9 have been proposed by the Canadian 
Council of Motor Transport Administrators.  These proposals will 
be the subject of further review by the Standing Committee on 
Transport and Government Operations.  This is another example of 
federal leadership in developing a consensus based national 
standard that is applied by provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the bill we are about to pass would provide an 
important new framework for national safety standards that apply 
consistently to local, national and international bus and 
trucking companies.  The objectives of the legislation are to 
pave the way for the best available national safety standards and 
to have the many thousands of motor carriers in Canada take their 
own full responsibility for the safe operation of their buses and 
trucks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much work remains to be done to fully achieve these objectives. 
However, the federal government along with its provincial 
partners is committed to following through to ensure that the 
regulations in the national safety code would provide the right 
regulatory framework to achieve the objectives.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We look forward to our provincial colleagues to ensure that 
their safety rating regimes are in place and fully consistent 
with the national safety code standard.  The ultimate objective 
is to have Canada's roads the safest in the world while 
commercial vehicles continue to provide efficient and safe

</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge all members to support Bill S-3. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise on this important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed that the parliamentary secretary who just spoke stated 
“the bill which we are about to pass”.  I just cannot let that 
go without comment.  He is presuming that all members of 
parliament will vote in favour of this bill.  Maybe he heard 
rumours that the official opposition will be supporting it. 
Perhaps he has also heard rumours that the Liberals will be 
voting for it, so maybe it will pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was just a little comment there, a little sarcasm.  I guess 
<I>Hansard</I> does not report that the member was dripping with 
sarcasm when he said that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address this whole issue of transportation. 
When we look at the broad picture, Canada is a vast country.  I 
think that members of parliament from Ontario probably do not 
recognize it, but I am presumably a member of parliament from the 
west. When I cross over from Ontario to Manitoba my flight from 
Ottawa to Edmonton is half over.  In other words, the 
Ontario-Manitoba border is approximately the midpoint before we 
start hitting what is called the west.  Then of course there is 
another equal distance from the border all the way to Edmonton 
and another 1,600 to 1,700 kilometres from central Alberta to the 
west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To unite and serve our people with delivery of goods and 
services and to move our products across the country, not only to 
each other but also for the export markets most of which then 
goes on to ships at various places, we need to have an efficient 
transportation system.  We also are very aware that the 
transportation of people is very important, so we think of 
trains, planes and automobiles.  I make no reference to the very 
famous movie in which John Candy starred.  However, nowadays some 
of the things that we go through in Canadian airports reminds one 
of that movie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many aspects to transportation.  Certainly the 
magnitude, the very size of our country, is one of the largest 
considerations.  The fact that we are fragmented to the point 
where each province has its own rules and regulations, in some 
cases makes it very difficult if not impossible for transporters 
from neighbouring provinces to enter into the neighbouring 
province.  That is a detriment to our economy, our efficiency and 
indeed our productivity.  Productivity is a buzzword which the 
government is starting to use, that is, how productive are we? 
How much productivity do we get for each worker? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is paying specific attention to the safety aspect, 
which is of course that is important.  We want to do everything 
that we can to provide for the safe transportation of people and 
goods.  That has to be of primary importance to all Canadians.  I 
am sure they would support some level of co-operation between the 
federal and provincial governments so that this goal could be 
reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just so happens that transportation, like health care and 
education, is constitutionally a provincial jurisdiction. 
Therefore, the federal government has a substantial challenge in 
trying to bring the provinces together in the area of safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say a few things about the safety aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess when I look back at my life, some of my happiest years 
were spent in a truck.  I drove the big rigs when I was 
a youngster.  I put myself through university driving the 
semi-trailer units.  I was fortunate to live in an age before 
young people were automatically discriminated against as they are 
now. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT19"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT19"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1235
<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now if a young person of university age would like to get 
a job driving a big rig, he or she would be out of luck.  Young 
people are considered to be high risk.  Therefore, most 
transportation companies will not hire youngsters under the age 
of 25 because their insurance rates escalate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say one thing about that.  During my tenure as 
a truck driver, I worked both behind the wheel and also in another 
aspect of trucking during the years.  In all those years most of 
the accidents I saw involved people who were older than 25.  The 
young guys were eager and like myself liked to drive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took great pride in handling my unit.  I used to practise 
driving with my right wheels on the edge of the right line, so I 
gave the maximum space to the left.  People behind me could see 
if they wanted to pull out to pass and also it gave the maximum 
distance for people coming from the front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always practised an exit route.  When two cars were coming 
toward me I always practised in my mind what would I do if the 
one following the first vehicle pulled out to pass and suddenly 
was in my path.  I practised that exit strategy in my mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was always very careful when I had a load.  One thing I hauled 
was machinery.  I always inspected my load to make sure that 
none of it was insecure.  I was not the driver but I know of one 
instance where a shaft from an implement came off a truck and dug 
into the pavement.  It made about a six inch hole in the 
pavement.  Fortunately there was no car there, because this thing 
landed in the oncoming lane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act in Saskatchewan where I worked specified that it was the 
driver's responsibility to make sure the load was secure.  I took 
that responsibility very seriously.  That is certainly an area 
where there should be agreement among all provinces so that these 
types of accidents do not occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing which I find interesting is the evolution with 
respect to brakes.  Surprisingly enough, back in the mid-fifties 
and early sixties when I was driving, the braking system on the 
trucks was entirely different from what it is now.  At that time 
we had an auxiliary tank on the trailer so that when the trailer 
became disconnected from the tractor unit the air in that 
auxiliary unit would automatically activate the brakes on the 
trailer.  If the trailer became disconnected the brakes were on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the whole system, whether the units were 
connected or not, was dependent on the supply of air.  If the air 
failed and if the driver failed to take note of it, then he or 
she would suddenly be driving a unit down the road that weighed 
many tonnes without any brakes.  It was a very uncomfortable 
feeling, if the truck was approaching a hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were all sorts of warnings.  The trucks I drove the most 
had two warnings.  One was a buzzer that buzzed if the air 
pressure in the system went below 90 pounds per square inch.  One 
truck I drove actually had a little metal flag that was up behind 
the sun visor.  It was held up there by air pressure.  If the air 
pressure failed, the thing came down and waved right in front of 
the driver indicating that the air pressure was below 90 and that 
driver had better stop the truck while there were still some 
brakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We always carried chocks for blocking the wheels if we had to 
stop.  When the air was gone the only brake we had was that 
little emergency brake which did very little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The braking systems on trucks now have been vastly improved.  In 
my day the loss of air supply meant the loss of brakes.  Now they 
are set it up in such a way that the part of the braking system 
is inactivated by air pressure.  There are huge springs that 
actually apply the brakes when the air is removed.  I think we 
would have to say that is a good plan and is certainly better 
than in our day.  Now if the air system fails, our emergency 
brakes on the trailer unit, as well as the tractor, come on. This 
is much safer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I have never heard of a unit actually becoming 
disconnected from the towing unit because the safety mechanisms 
are in place.  However, I suppose it could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to digress and tell the House a sidebar.  One thing we 
did was pull a travel trailer.  This is another issue where 
perhaps governments across the country should start looking at 
some better restrictions and better training for drivers who 
drive the big motor homes and the travel trailers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having grown up on a farm in Saskatchewan and having been taught 
by my dad that safety always comes first, I always paid close 
attention to the hookups when we pulled a trailer.  I had that 
mandatory hookup so that if our travel trailer became 
disconnected from the towing vehicle, then the emergency brakes 
would be activated by the onboard battery in the trailer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were in Los Angeles with this unit.  In Los Angeles there are 
some intersections where U-turns at the intersections are 
permitted.  One could either turn left or do a U-turn and go 
back.  We missed our turn and had to make a U-turn.  Somehow the 
little cable which pulled the plug on my emergency brake became 
tangled in my hitch mechanism.  My emergency brakes came on in 
the middle of an intersection in Los Angeles.  Of course I could 
not drive forward because my brakes were on.   Fortunately or 
unfortunately in the trailers, electric brakes only work in the 
forward direction, so I was able to back up to straighten my 
vehicle enough so I could free up that little thing and get back 
underway.  It was a rather embarrassing, however it shows again a 
mechanism to provide for additional safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the trailer brakes on travel trailers are 
woefully inadequate.  Electric brakes are activated only in the 
forward direction.  Their backward braking effect is almost zero, 
which means that if people end up with a motor failure when going 
up a hill with a travel trailer combination, then start backing 
up, they better depend on the towing vehicle for brakes because 
the towed unit does not have adequate brakes in the reverse 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now back to the issue.  We are talking about interprovincial 
transportation.  When I was driving, again I hauled across the 
provinces and also into the United States.  For efficiency sake, 
for cost sake and for safety sake it is important for there to be 
constant regulations.  People should not be required to do 
something in one province, then when they cross the border into 
the next province suddenly the vehicle is illegal.  There should 
be standardization.  I believe this can be accomplished in 
co-operation with the provincial ministers of transport.  That 
needs to be done in order to provide for safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the issue of drivers.  Truck drivers generally do not 
make as much as airline pilots.  Airline pilots are given a work 
regimen which theoretically would prevent them from ever flying 
an airplane when they are totally fatigued.  They have only so 
many hours that they fly, then they have mandatory time off until 
their four week work cycle has ended.  Then it repeats again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall we had a number of flight cancellations because the 
union said a number of Air Canada pilots had put in their hours. 
Therefore, Air Canada no longer had any pilots at the end of the 
month.  That is important for airline pilots but it is also 
important for truckers.  Truckers should be able to drive only 
when they are awake and alert.  They should not be driving when 
they are sleepy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another personal anecdote.  One of my colleagues where I 
worked got married.  He was the boss' son.  He happened to have 
the nicest truck in the unit.  When he got married he said to his 
boss, his dad, that he did not need anybody else to drive his 
truck.  He said “Only Ken Epp can drive it because he is the one 
who is fussy”.  I got to drive the boss' son's truck for a whole 
week while he was away on his honeymoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course that meant that the truck I usually drove was driven 
by another person, but I had a wonderful time driving that big 
Mack H-67.  Anyone familiar with the old units knows that there 
are two sticks, three on one and five on the other; it is a 
15-speed.  It is quite a good experience.  Once one gets to know 
the gears, truck driving is actually not a boring job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was driving from Edmonton to Saskatoon on a beautiful moonlit 
night.  At about two o'clock in the morning as I came around a 
corner, off in a field I saw a semi-trailer with its wheels up in 
the air.  Obviously the driver had gone to sleep, had gone off 
the road as he went around the curve and rolled the truck.  Since 
it was the middle of the night and I knew the truck had not been 
there when I was driving toward Edmonton, I stopped because I 
thought I should check to see whether the driver was still there 
and take whatever action was necessary.  I took my flashlight and 
went out there.  I was totally surprised to realize that the 
truck with the wheels up in the air was my truck.  It was the 
truck that one of these other sleepyheads took over while I was 
driving the boss' son's truck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truck driver was not there.  I looked all over the field for 
him, all the way from the highway up to where the truck had 
stopped.  I checked with my flashlight and in the moonlight to 
see whether I could find him.  He fortunately was not hurt and 
got a ride before I got there.  However, I again underline the 
fact that this was a driver who was obviously driving while he 
was not alert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need regulations, but what regulations?  How are we going to 
come to a conclusion on this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I usually drove single.  I had a single unit so I could drive 
for as long as I wanted to or for as short a time as I wanted to. 
In the outfit I worked for the boss said that we needed to be 
sure to sleep when we were sleepy.  He assured that by picking up 
any hotel bills we encountered.  When we were sleepy, we stopped 
and slept and then we carried on with the load.  That was a very 
important principle in this firm I worked for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those days I had my own personal motto, which was “If you 
don't have time to get there safely, what will happen if you 
don't get there at all?”  I used that motto and I often thought 
of it.  If I got tired I would stop and sleep for a while. 
Sometimes if it had been quite a while since I had slept, I would 
stay in a hotel for a while, get some rest and then carry on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it is very important that this is balanced, because as I 
said earlier, truck drivers do not make the money that airline 
pilots do.  They do have to work and most of them get paid by the 
mile or kilometre, some by the hour.  It is mandatory that they 
be given the right, without harassment or without any negative 
ramifications, to stop and sleep when they are tired.  At the 
same time, I am totally opposed to arbitrary rules.  The one size 
fits all rule usually does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If somebody had told me when I was driving that I had driven 12 
hours and had to quit, what would I have done?  Who gets up at 
eight o'clock in the morning and goes to bed at eight o'clock at 
night?  No one.  We are able to survive on eight hours of sleep 
very nicely, which means there are sixteen hours left.  When a 
truck driver is on the road, there is really nothing else that he 
should be doing but his work.  There is no point in walking 
around in a park somewhere and using up the waking hours that 
way.  That is non-productive.  The only thing that must stand is, 
as I said, that every trucking organization must be such that 
there is no penalty for the person who does stop when he or she 
is sleepy in order to ensure public safety.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there were times when we probably drove more hours than 
we should have, yet my rule was that if I was feeling sleepy I 
would stop and sleep either inside the truck or sometimes in the 
shade underneath the truck if it was a nice day.  Somebody would 
wake me, and that time was usually sufficient to get me going 
again and away we would go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me speak about vehicle safety.  Over the last number of 
years there has been quite a bit of publicity about various parts 
of trucks coming off, particularly in Ontario, where wheels have 
actually become dislodged, a very unnecessary and devastating 
thing.  Something should be done by way of regulation regarding 
this, just as private aircraft are required to undergo a total 
inspection and in some cases a motor rebuild after a certain 
number of hours.  Perhaps there should be some sort of regulation 
to require that wheels be taken apart, with x-ray techniques used 
in order to determine whether or not the steel holding the wheels 
onto the truck is beginning to fatigue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most reputable trucking and busing companies would agree to do 
this to keep their vehicles safe, but most times laws are 
designed in order to pull into the plan those who refuse to go 
into it voluntarily.  Some companies have to be forced into it. I 
think that a set of uniform regulations should be enacted and 
enforced all across Canada.  There is no excuse for truckers who 
do not keep their loads and their vehicles intact, thereby 
endangering the lives of other people with whom they share the 
road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of roads brings me to the next topic in my presentation 
today, that is, I think we rely too much on our road system.  Our 
national transportation system has so diminished the use and 
importance of railroads in Canada.  I really regret that.  I am 
thinking particularly of the prairies where I grew up and where 
many rail lines have been abandoned and are now being torn up. 
That puts huge pressure, literally, on all the roadways in the 
country, especially when it comes to hauling grain and potash and 
the other commodities that we trade around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must have a strong railroad system.  I am disappointed in 
the federal governments of the last 25 or 30 years for allowing 
the deterioration of a very valuable railroad service in Canada. 
There should be more room for competition.  Farmers and others 
should have the ability to move their product to market by using 
a very efficient railroad system which is designed to carry heavy 
loads and is certainly less harmful than a lot of trucks plying 
Canada's rural roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these roads are now in deplorable condition.  I believe 
that the federal government has a responsibility to use more of 
the money collected in fuel taxes to support Canada's 
infrastructure.  There is a huge lack in regard to this.  The 
government takes millions of dollars out of the economy in the 
form of fuel taxes and yet the amount of money it puts back into 
the provinces' coffers in order to provide for the building of 
roads is something like three cents on the dollar.  It is 
deplorable and it is not acceptable.  There is no reason why 
Canadians who pay fuel taxes and provide transportation should 
not have those taxes used to provide them with decent roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to say something about our millennium project. 
We had quite a celebration in the year 2000.  The Prime Minister 
and the finance minister announced millennium projects three 
years before this event and had people from all across the 
country send in projects and proposals.  There were all kinds of 
projects such as trees being planted in a pattern to represent 
this or that, and there were many other projects that may have 
value in themselves.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time I promoted a project that I think would have been a 
true millennium project.  It did not get anywhere but I believe 
it should still be done.  It would have been an ideal time to say 
“The millennium is the year when the Canadian government will 
undertake to build a modern, divided highway system right across 
the country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a highway called the Trans-Canada Highway.  I remember 
when it first came in, way back in the 1950s and 1960s.  I 
suppose parts of it were already called Trans-Canada before that, 
but then it was designated Highway No. 1 in every province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you will smile at this, I am sure, but when I was a 
youngster the Trans-Canada Highway, Highway No. 1, where I lived 
was a gravel road.  Of course that was early in our history. When 
I was a youngster, it was very early in Canada's history. 
Subsequent to that, of course, the roads were paved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the House of the former member of parliament 
from southwestern Saskatchewan, Mr. Lee Morrison.  Many times he 
stood up in the House during private members' statements and on 
other occasions and talked about the deplorable conditions of 
Highway No. 1 in the western portion of the province of 
Saskatchewan.  I happen to be very familiar with that road 
because I grew up at Swift Current.  It is from Swift Current 
west that the road is in really bad condition.  It is a narrow, 
single lane road, with vehicles passing each other just feet 
apart.  There are numerous places without adequate visibility 
because of hills and curves. It is a very dangerous road.  Only a 
year or two ago there was a devastating crash there involving two 
buses and a semi-trailer truck.  I think five people were killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was just one of those situations that could be attributed 
at least 80% to the design of the road.  It is inadequate.  It is 
archaic.  It follows the path used when we travelled across the 
country with ox carts, for heaven's sake.  Here we are, following 
that path, calling it the Trans-Canada and having these 
devastating accidents on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is a life worth?  We spend a lot of money on health care 
and other measures.  We are talking about reducing cigarette 
smoking to help prolong people's lives.  I think it is high time 
that we spent money on infrastructure for a true Trans-Canada 
Highway, a two lane, divided road right across the country, built 
to standards of safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again we need to look ahead a little.  In many areas of the 
United States if the Americans had a road the quality of the 
Trans-Canada Highway they would label it an unsafe road and 
advise drivers to stay off it.  I remember driving down there on 
a road that was two lanes divided, with crossing traffic every 
four or five miles.  Huge signs warned people of crossing 
traffic.  We can hardly find a place in Canada where it is more 
than five miles or eight kilometres from exit to the other.  In 
most instances we have crossing traffic.  For example, in 
Edmonton on the major roads there are stoplights, crossing 
traffic and accidents galore.  Every week there are tragedies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am appalled at the indifference that the government shows when 
it comes to actually building safe roads.  Sure, we can have 
rules and regulations affecting truckers and we can have rules 
and regulations that limit the things that bus companies, the 
people transporters, can do, but how about the role of the 
government itself in designing, building and funding safe roads 
to start with?  I believe that so much can be done in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect of the lack of standardization is with respect to 
traffic lights. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT24"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT24"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1300

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some provinces, when people approach a traffic light that is 
red they stop.  In some provinces, when there is a green arrow 
people can make a right turn without stopping.  In other 
provinces, people have to stop first and then make a right turn. 
In some provinces, if people approach a red light without a green 
arrow they must stop and then make a right turn after ensuring it 
is safe to do so.  In other provinces, people who come to a red 
light cannot make a right turn even if it is safe to do so 
because it is against the law.  We need to have standardization 
because truckers, bus drivers and many Canadians travel from 
province to province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another serious gripe with red lights.  We have this 
presumed problem of people running red lights.  That is a simple 
mathematical problem with a very easy solution and yet no one 
seems to be willing to implement it.  I would like to see it 
implemented right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What am I talking about?  When I drive my motorcycle and the 
light turns amber, I can stop every time.  A motorcycle can 
almost stop on a dime.  The thing we need to worry about the most 
is how close the person behind us is because if we stop too 
suddenly the person behind us will end up going through the 
intersection with us sitting on his hood ornament.  We need to be 
careful about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the light turns amber, I can come to a grinding halt with my 
little Mazda.  It is a different story when I am pulling my 
travel trailer with my Suburban.  It then takes a little longer 
to stop.  When I am driving a semi-trailer unit with a couple of 
trailers behind weighing 50 or 60 tonnes, I am talking a whole 
new kettle of fish.  It now takes a long distance for that unit 
to come to a stop.  Surely in our modern day with the technology 
that we have available there should be a way of determining how 
long lights have to be amber before they turn red. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many provinces now, Alberta included, we have politicians who 
think they are going to solve the problem by putting in cameras 
and taking pictures of people who run red lights.  I have done 
the math.  Everyone knows I love math and I like solving math 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to some intersections in Edmonton and Sherwood Park and 
used my stopwatch to see how long the light stayed amber before 
it turned red.  It was mathematically and physically impossible 
to stop at many intersections in the country.  No one could clear 
an intersection from the time the light turns amber until the 
rear of the vehicle clears the intersection unless he or she were 
going 400 miles per hour, and I do not think we would advocate 
that.  Even then we would be in trouble because the point at 
which we would make a decision is farther back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very simple solution and I am proposing it today.  I 
hope it hits the front page of every paper across the country. 
What we need to do is very simple.  Whether I am 100 metres from 
the intersection or 1,000 metres back, at a certain speed I am 
either going to get through the intersection on a green light or 
I am not.  It will turn amber before I get there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the legislators withholding the warning to the point 
where it becomes an emergency stop if someone is going to stop in 
time?  It is unconscionable.  Currently we know how the green 
light goes off and the amber comes on, which tell us it will turn 
red and we should prepare to stop.  If someone is very close and 
cannot stop, then he or she proceeds through.  If that same 
person is back far enough to make a judgment, then he or she will 
stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply do this.  Five hundred metres back from the 
intersection, farther back on highways, I would put up a sign. 
That sign would be round with a line through the middle with 
green on the top and amber on the bottom.  It would be a two 
coloured green and amber semicircle sign.  It would indicate that 
when someone sees the green light up ahead with the amber, in 
other words when both lights are on, it would mean that a person 
would not be able to clear the intersection when travelling the 
speed limit and should prepare to stop.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a semi-trailer driver I can now start gearing down.  I can 
come to a safe stop and there is no danger.  As an ordinary 
vehicle driver I would be going along at the speed limit.  I know 
I will not be able to make the next light because I have just 
been given a warning.  The cost is almost zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In advance of some intersections a flashing light is planted. 
That is very costly as wires have to be run, a big standard has 
to be erected for the light and electronics have to be built in. 
My solution would be very simple.  We would just have both lights 
on, the green and the amber.  If a vehicle is behind such a sign 
it means it has to stop.  If it is ahead of it when that happens, 
the vehicle can safely go through at the speed limit.  I believe 
it would save thousands of lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether you would mind, Mr. Speaker, using your 
influence to make sure that this is on the front page of every 
newspaper across the country.  Let us get this thing rolling and 
let us start doing something tangible to save lives instead of 
thinking it can be done by passing laws which defy the laws of 
science as surely as we cannot pass a law to ban airplane crashes 
by repealing the law of gravity.  We cannot do it, but there are 
things that can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot physically change the amount of time it takes to 
travel from point A to point B.  We cannot physically change the 
length of time required to stop a vehicle safely.  Every 
youngster who takes a driving test knows stopping distances.  We 
know that the average reaction time is three-quarters of a 
second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another three-quarters of a second is used in Alberta as an 
awareness time.  That province says that for normal drivers it 
takes three-quarters of a second from the time they see a reason 
to stop until they actually start the motion to stop and it takes 
on average three-quarters of a second from the time they have 
actually moved their foot from the accelerator to the brake. Then 
there is the physical part of stopping the vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simple physics says that the amount of distance required to stop 
varies as the square of the speed.  If we are going twice as fast 
as another vehicle of equal mass, it will take four times as long 
because of the energy that has to be dissipated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those changes can be made.  Why does the federal government not 
take some leadership?  Why does it not take the idea I have 
proposed to every transportation minister?  Let us get it going 
in the United States as well thereby saving literally hundreds of 
lives at intersections instead of losing them.  It happens over 
and over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another lack of standards has to do with left turns.  I am 
appalled at the number of intersections in the country at which 
we can make a left turn from the second lane.  In other words 
there are two left turning lanes but the left lane is also the 
overtaking or the speed lane.  That is wrong.  If there is an 
intersection where we are permitted to make a left turn from two 
lanes, it should be an absolutely mandatory standard in every 
province that the left lane is not a driving lane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one intersection in Edmonton that I would be ashamed of 
if I were the engineer who signed off on that plan.  There is a 
left turn lane which is out of the way and then there is the next 
lane which has the up arrow and a left turn.  People stop there 
and big trucks pile into them and kill them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The city engineers there had the gall to put up a sign that says 
“Caution: dangerous intersection”.  I say why the dickens did 
they build it.  There is lot of space there.  All they would have 
to do would be to design the road one lane wider and have the 
lanes go through.  They would then have two lanes that turn left 
and we could not do anything but turn left if we were in that 
lane.  It is just an anomaly and unfortunately it is a life 
taking anomaly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on.  I am sure the Liberals would love me to 
because there is so much for them to learn when it comes to a 
safe transportation policy.  I am appalled we are so far behind 
in terms of our thinking and in terms of our application of true 
science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason is that too often we simply allow political 
considerations to enter into these decisions.  We do not use our 
heads and do true math and physics in making our calculations.  I 
urge the government to do what it can to bring the provinces 
together to work co-operatively to save lives on our highways.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to Bill S-3, probably my 
last opportunity before the summer recess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill for the pure and 
simple reason that this is not the time for the government to be 
introducing it to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, this is evidence of a government that is in over its 
head and is trying to mark time.  We all know that the session is 
going to be over earlier than expected.  Probably, then, there 
has been an order passed down to each minister and deputy 
minister to table some bills. Bill S-3 is a striking live example 
of a bill that ought not to have been introduced in the House at 
this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3, an act to amend the Motor Vehicle Transport Act, 1987, 
is described by the government as a highway safety act. Everyone 
in this House, including my colleagues and the parliamentary 
secretary, is making wonderful speeches about how this bill 
should enhance safety on Canada's major highways, and 
particularly the monitoring of highway carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, reading clause 3 of the bill: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>3.(1) The objectives of this Act are to ensure that the National 
Transportation Policy set out in section 5 of the <I>Canada 
Transportation Act</I> is carried out with respect to 
extra-provincial motor carrier undertakings, and, more 
specifically, that 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) the regulatory regime for those 
undertakings is focused on safety performance assessments based 
on the National Safety Code for Motor Carriers; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) the operating standards that apply to those 
undertakings are applied 
consistently across Canada. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is far from being a bill that will guarantee safety on 
major highways across Canada. It targets extraprovincial motor 
carrier undertakings and its purpose is to subject them to a 
consistent national evaluation and monitoring regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be that as it may, the monitoring and implementation of the 
regime come under the jurisdiction of the provinces and 
territories. It is important that Quebecers and Canadians realize 
that the Government of Canada has no means, no monitoring policy, 
no effective policy to guarantee the monitoring of undertakings. 
It is the provinces and territories that are responsible for 
implementing the standards that they themselves set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces and territories have had safety standards for 
decades. Moreover, they agreed to adhere, among others, to 
standard 14, which is part of the national safety code for motor 
carriers. The provinces and territories made it their objective 
to implement this standard. Finally, the proposed bill would have 
the effect of implementing standard 14. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to implement such a standard, we must be able to set 
up, in each province and territory, a system of evaluation and 
compatible assessments across Canada on which, as I said earlier, 
the provinces and territories agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for the system to be effective, there must also be a 
penalty and downgrading process, including the cancellation of 
permits for major offenders, and also an effective monitoring 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where the problem lies because, as we are speaking, the 
territories have still not been able to come to an agreement with 
the federal government to implement this system of evaluation, 
assessment, penalties and monitoring. Implementation costs are a 
major factor.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The implementation of an evaluation system with ratings, 
penalties and monitoring would be very costly for the provinces 
and territories. Right now, not all provinces and territories 
have the financial means and the capacity to implement that 
evaluation system with ratings, penalties and monitoring. 
Discussions among the provinces have been ongoing since 1999, 
when a standing committee was struck by the provinces, the 
territories and the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee is studying the best way to put in place an 
evaluation system with compatible ratings, the necessary 
penalties and the monitoring required to reach the objective. 
There is still no agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why introduce Bill S-3 if, in the field, the recommendations 
contained in the bill cannot be implemented? Once more, here is a 
government that does not care. I do not doubt the sincerity of 
the parliamentary secretary or the Liberal members of the 
committee. However, the bureaucrats were let loose and they 
proposed a bill to try to kill time. Finally, we have too much 
time. Right now, the rumour is that we will adjourn earlier than 
expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public servants were left to introduce the bill, which cannot be 
implemented in the provinces and territories for the simple 
reason that no agreement has yet been reached on how to 
supervise, harmonize the entire assessment and rating system, 
lower ratings, or cancel permits, and for the regime as a whole. 
The government has not reached any agreement with the provinces 
and territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, the officials had the gall to come before us in 
committee and say they had the agreement of all the provinces and 
the industry.  On three occasions, I had to correct the 
government officials.  I told them that Quebec had not given its 
approval when Bill S-3 was introduced for the simple reason that 
Quebec's standards are higher than the Canadian ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a province applied the rating of this standard to its 
industry, it would limit the industry's competition.  Imagine if 
a province or territory decided to sanction its carriers more 
strictly than other provinces or territories.  It would make the 
motor carrier industry less competitive if the industry had to 
meet tighter standards and face stricter sanctions with fines 
attached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would threaten competition among industries in Canada, and 
this is why it is important to have a single standard across 
Canada.  Each of the provinces and territories must also have the 
means to implement this standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the very start, with the lack of cohesion in relations 
between the provinces and the federal government, I said 
whenever I spoke in committee that the bill had been introduced 
too soon. 
The provinces are in agreement with standard 14.  The problem is 
that there is not enough money to harmonize Canada wide in such a 
way that the trucking industry is not worse off in one province 
than in the others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government kept telling us that there had been consensus. 
Again, I had to remind officials that, as far as I was concerned, 
Quebec had not given its approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee, we were able to hear from industry stakeholders, 
because the committee had decided that it would be a good idea to 
invite them to appear before it anyway.  The following is from 
the brief submitted by the Canadian Trucking Alliance, which 
represents 70% of the trucking industry. It sits on the standing 
committee and therefore represents the industry at the table, and 
is very knowledgeable about harmonization problems and the 
provinces' and territories' lack of financial resources to 
enforce the standard: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is our fear that without a significant commitment of 
political will and increased funding on the part of the federal 
government to ensure that the National Safety Code ...is 
consistently applied in all jurisdictions, leadership will be 
lacking and the safety rating standard may prove to be an 
unattainable goal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The representative went on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our view, the time has now come for the federal government to 
expend the political capital and financial resources necessary to 
effectively exercise its constitutional authority over trucking. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, this is a strong appeal from the Canadian Trucking 
Alliance, which represents 70% of the industry. 
It says that there is indeed a problem with respect to 
harmonization and that the federal government has to set a 
Canada-wide standard. However, the government must also provide 
the necessary funding to ensure the implementation and 
enforcement of this standard by the provinces and the 
territories, who are the only ones who have the required 
monitoring equipment and the resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the amendments recommended by the Canadian Trucking 
Alliance, there is nothing in Bill S-3 to include the setting up 
of a standing fund to support enforcement and harmonization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill, even if all the stakeholders, including the 
industry, say that there is a money problem and that it costs a 
lot of money to have the rules enforced from one end of the 
country to the other—since the provinces and the territories 
do not all have the same capacity—in spite of this problem, 
even the industry, the Canadian Trucking Alliance, which 
represents 70 % of the industry, has not even dared to ask the 
federal government to pay its share in the enforcement and 
monitoring of this standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where the problem lies. I come from another environment. 
I spent 18 years in municipal government before coming to this 
House. 
I have great difficulty understanding that stakeholders, people 
as aware as the representatives of the Canadian Trucking 
Alliance—70% of the industry—realizing that the federal 
government collects excise tax on gasoline, the GST on gasoline 
and finally half the taxes on everything that truckers or motor 
carriers pay in most jurisdictions, do not even dare—they are 
shy—ask the federal government for money, and indicate that the 
federal government “should”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in their recommendations and their amendments, believe it 
or not, they asked for this instead, “the minister shall, by 
order, remove the power of delivering certificates from the 
provinces that are unable to ensure follow-up and monitoring”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, instead of asking the federal government to pay its fair 
share, the industry suggested—probably on the recommendation of 
federal government officials—to remove from provinces the power 
of delivering certificates, whereas the federal government does 
not even have a single person able to do so in the whole 
country, for the simple reason that this is a provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, once again, the pressures the industry may face from 
government representatives, particularly at such a crucial 
moment, are due to the fact that, even though work began in 1999 
and all the provinces and the territories are discussing and 
trying to find solutions, the issue of funding for all those 
measures has not yet been resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not enough to just put in place standards with which the 
industry must comply, there must also be a mechanism for 
monitoring this standard.  Monitoring costs big bucks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, I am a representative of Quebec. The province of 
Quebec is not the one that lacks the means to ensure compliance 
with standards at this time.  In some ways, Quebec standards are 
stricter than the national safety code, particularly as far as 
motor coaches are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry in one province must not be penalized because it 
enforces stricter standards and stricter penalties, lays 
comparatively more charges against certain types of industry than 
in other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, if there is to be healthy competition, the principle 
of this bill must be applicable and applied across Canada, 
which is far from the case at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, this is a consensus that must be obtained before 
such a bill is introduced.  That is what should have happened. As 
I have said, the provinces did not give their okay to the 
introduction of this bill; Quebec did not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would just like to state that I believed the 
departmental officials when they told us that all provinces and 
territories were in agreement with Bill S-3, despite the fact 
that I had told them on three different occasions that this was 
not the case for Quebec.  They insisted it was the case for all 
provinces and territories, and for the entire industry. 
Obviously, I will share with the hon. members what Teamsters 
Canada had to say before the committee as well as the content of 
their brief.  They are hardly insignificant, representing as they 
do 80% of unionized truck drivers throughout Canada.  They said, 
in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, it was stated that provincial governments and 
industries were consulted on this and that they agreed on Bill 
S-3. Teamsters Canada does not believe that all the provinces 
agree with this bill. In the eyes of the public, Teamsters is 
synonymous with the trucking industry. We are the pillar of 
highway transportation and we were not consulted on this bill. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult for me to support this bill, especially when I 
hear the statements by government officials. Again I am not 
blaming the parliamentary secretary or the Liberal members who 
sit on the committee. The bureaucracy is the one to blame. It 
probably received a mandate from the very top to try to fill the 
time in the House, because we will be adjourning earlier than 
expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I blame public servants for presenting a bill that cannot be 
implemented and that may create a malaise between the industry 
and the provinces that had not given their approval. This malaise 
could jeopardize the implementation of that standard, which is 
meant to be acceptable to the provinces, the territories and the 
industry. The problem is that this bill is being introduced too 
soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for these reasons that the Bloc Quebecois will oppose Bill 
S-3. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to rise today to speak on behalf of the New Democratic 
Party to third reading of Bill S-3, an act to amend the Motor 
Vehicle Transport Act, 1987 and to make consequential amendments 
to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats will be opposing the bill at this important 
juncture for reasons I will elaborate on shortly.  I will not 
spend 20 minutes giving our concerns.  I do not think it will 
require that long.  However I will lay out our concerns and why 
we oppose the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3 would establish a framework for harmonizing the way 
provinces administer parts of the national safety code for motor 
carriers.  The national safety code pertains to buses and 
transport trucks and is administered at the provincial level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The code was introduced by the Mulroney government in 1987 in 
response to safety concerns due to the deregulation of the 
trucking industry.  However the federal government left the 
provinces to adopt and administer the code themselves.  So far 
none have fully adopted it.  In essence, therefore, the national 
safety code is nothing more than a set of suggestions.  That is a 
major concern for us as New Democrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework established in the bill would allow provinces and 
territories whose safety compliance regimes are compatible with 
the national safety code to give extra provincial bus 
undertakings a safety rating and to issue safety certificates. It 
is a nice idea, but unless all or most of the provinces adopt the 
code it is functionally useless.  That does not appear likely in 
the foreseeable future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the words of the Canadian Trucking Alliance, the safety code 
harmonization framework is putting the cart before the horse. 
Regardless of the administrative framework the federal government 
comes up with, the national safety code will remain toothless 
unless the provinces adopt it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has the constitutional authority to 
impose the national safety code on the provinces but is not doing 
it.  We need federal leadership in this area.  Regrettably we are 
not seeing that from the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats have other issues with regard to the crafting of 
the bill.  Several concerns about Bill S-3 arose in committee but 
were not dealt with.  In their mad rush to pass the bill before 
the House recesses for the summer the Liberals restricted many of 
the witnesses to unreasonably short presentations.  As mentioned 
by the Bloc member, the teamsters were very concerned by the 
process. 
The teamsters, who are central to the trucking industry in 
Canada, expressed concern that the government did not consult 
them while drafting the bill.  However the government maintains 
it held wide consultations in drafting the bill.  There is a real 
contradiction there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several witnesses raised specific concerns about the national 
safety code, notably the hours of service regulations for motor 
carriers.  The Liberal government is changing the regulations to 
allow truck and bus drivers to be on the road 84 hours a week. 
Hon. members should stop and imagine what it would be like to be 
behind the wheel of a truck 84 hours a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I live in a province where truck traffic is already involved in 
many of the accidents on our highways.  I shudder to think that 
the number of accidents could be drastically increased by having 
exhausted drivers behind the wheels of trucks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By endorsing proposals from the Canadian Trucking Alliance that 
would put many truck drivers in the position of having to work an 
84 hour week, week after week, we would be ushering in by far the 
most lax regulations for truck drivers' work hours in the western 
world.  That is not a record we should be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politicians and bureaucrats have apparently been convinced that 
improved trucking industry profitability would be good for the 
economy.  There appears to be little concern about the likely 
downside of the change: more deaths and injuries on the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments and the trucking industry are proposing that truck 
drivers work five consecutive 14 hour days, take one day off and 
then drive another five days.  The result is that drivers could 
be legally required to work 84 hours in a week.  An alternative 
work cycle would let truck drivers drive up to 96 hours every 
second week.  That is insanity by any sense of the word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is greatly disappointed and frustrated by the lack of 
progress on this vitally important bill.  Unless we see real 
commitment to a national safety code that is truly national in 
nature, we cannot support Bill S-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the changing of the hours of service regulations is 
another grave concern to us.  As I have just stated, it could 
lead to untold tragedy with increased accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I regret to say that the New Democrats will be 
opposing Bill S-3. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will say a few brief words on Bill S-3, an act to amend the Motor 
Vehicle Transport Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the third transport bill to go through the House in very 
short order.  The word on the street is that the minister might 
soon be taking off on a diplomatic career.  We get the impression 
he is trying to clear the decks before his successor takes over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3 outlines the federal government's role in 
extra-provincial bus and truck transport.  An updating of the 
same is in order from time to time.  We have no problem with 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3 would allow provinces and territories whose safety 
compliance regimes are compatible with the national safety code 
to give an extra-provincial carrier a safety rating and to issue 
a safety fitness certificate.  Such a certificate would be 
recognized by other Canadian jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3 would also allow a province or territory to apply 
sanctions to extra-provincial carriers for poor safety 
performance.  Such sanctions would include downgrading their 
ratings and revoking their safety certificate.  It is about time 
we had standardization across the country.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3 would allow Canada to enter into arrangements with 
other countries for reciprocal recognition of carrier rating 
standards.  This refers to enabling legislation which outlines 
the framework under which regulations are made for the safe 
operation of commercial vehicles on our nation's highways.  As 
such, we can support the bill.  We have a problem with the 
regulations and standards coming under the bill, not the bill 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last August Mr. David Bradley, head of the Canadian Trucking 
Alliance, the chief industry association, said that the national 
safety code upon which the ratings system would be based was 
neither national nor a code and that not one of the sixteen 
national safety code standards agreed to by the provinces in 1988 
had been officially adopted across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1987 the federal, provincial and territorial governments 
signed a memorandum of understanding to implement the national 
code by 1990.  The most recent status report in 1998 showed that 
no province had by then adopted all fifteen mandatory standards 
and the one voluntary standard.  The standards dealt with hours 
of work, driver training, driver testing, vehicle maintenance, 
roadside inspections, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February of this year the Ontario Trucking Association stated 
that safety rating systems lacked consistency across the country. 
Consistency is important to carriers because safety ratings are a 
matter of public record.  Shippers and insurance companies are 
encouraged to use them in choosing a carrier or setting insurance 
rates.  Consistency is also important to drivers, the majority of 
whom cross borders on their runs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A standard issue which is a source of controversy relates to 
proposed hours of work for drivers.  While changes to hours of 
service standards are not part of the bill per se, the act that 
the bill amends sets out provisions whereby the codes and hours 
of service may be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the bill is enabling legislation.  The 
problem is in the details of regulations that can be made under 
the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the trucking industry and the government appear to be 
singing from one page of the same hymn book, truck driver unions 
and public safety advocates are singing quite a different tune. 
What is being proposed is quite incredible.  It would give Canada 
the least safety minded regulations in the western world. That is 
not something we should be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sleep impaired drivers could be required to work a maximum 84 to 
96 hours a week, forgo two consecutive nights of rest and drive 
without on board recorders, black boxes as we call them, to keep 
track of it all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we listen to what drivers could be expected to do under the 
legislation, we think of old trucking songs that led to an 
understanding of the dangers inherent in being a truck driver. 
One that stands out which everybody knows is <I>Six Days on the 
Road and I'm Going to Make it Home Tonight</I>.  If regulations 
are not tightened up some of our truck drivers will be six days 
on the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transport committee has been asked to study a federal 
government proposal that could see truck drivers on Canada's 
roads having to drive 14 hours at a stretch or up to 16 hours on 
alternate days.  When this boils down to a truck driver's work 
week that can run anywhere from 84 to 96 hours, surely it is not 
in the best interest of either truckers or members of the general 
public with whom they share the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the North American Free Trade Agreement was implemented 
there has been a large increase in north-south traffic.  However 
American truckers are not required to work more than 10 hours per 
shift.  Given the increasing integration of the North American 
economy, I do not see why there should be such a difference 
between American and Canadian hours of service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was proposed in the transport committee that we hold hearings 
across the nation on this important issue.  However the 
government majority on the committee, as usual, voted down the 
proposal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Truckers' hours are a matter of driver and public safety.  The 
government would do well to err on the side of caution on the 
issue.  That is certainly the public's view.  An Angus Reid poll 
found that 84% of Canadians surveyed favoured a maximum 60 hour 
work week for drivers and 78% of Canadians wanted black boxes on 
trucks to monitor what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government gives lip service to the need for consistent 
regulations across the country but stands by while the provinces 
fail to implement the national code.  Mr. Bradley of the Canadian 
Trucking Alliance, quoted earlier, said last August: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has the constitutional authority to 
introduce federal regulations and standards, to show national 
leadership, but it does not appear prepared to wade in— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One final point is that the bill would provide for, and 
Transport Canada is working toward, an agreement with the United 
States and Mexico to give motor carriers seamless regulatory 
treatment across North America.  NAFTA requires nothing less if 
we are to ultimately see the free flow of goods across the 
continent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line, however, is that the federal government has 
done a poor job of leadership when it comes to providing a 
seamless web of transport regulations and standards within the 
country.  How does the government expect to harmonize with the 
United States and Mexican systems if we have not yet harmonized 
ourselves? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3 has laudable goals.  The problem is that such a bill 
would require considerable leadership and detailed groundwork, 
things the federal government has so far failed to take 
seriously.  Leadership on the file would require hard work and 
consistency.  Leadership in a federal democracy is never easy but 
we have a government that prefers a quick and inadequate fix.  It 
is a babe in the woods compared to our neighbours to the south.

Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise this 
afternoon and speak briefly to Bill S-3, the amendments to the 
Motor Vehicle Transport Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party 
noted during his remarks, Bill S-3, despite the speedy process 
with which it has been brought through the House, has some rather 
lofty goals.  I will start by informing the viewing public what 
Bill S-3 hopes to accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summary at the front of the bill states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment modernizes and streamlines the regulation of 
extra-provincial motor carrier (truck and bus) undertakings in 
Canada, building on the reforms introduced in the <I>Motor 
Vehicle Transport Act, 1987</I>.  The objective is a consistent 
national regime for motor carriers focused on carrier safety 
regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key components of the enactment include: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) a national regulatory framework for provincial administration 
of a safety performance-based regime for extra-provincial motor 
carriers, based on the national safety standards developed by the 
governments of Canada and the provinces in consultation with 
industry and embodied in the National Safety Code for Motor 
Carriers; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) provision for national policy direction supporting the 
implementation of that framework; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) provision for international arrangements for mutual 
recognition of carrier safety performance assessment. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague and several speakers prior to me have indicated, 
some rather lofty goals are contained in Bill S-3. However, when 
we look at the history of how the government has dealt with the 
issue and with the bill, we find reason for concern.  Given the 
way Bill S-3 is drafted, we must ask whether it would be able to 
accomplish the rather lofty expectations laid down in it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to raise a concern regarding subclause 7(2) which 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A safety fitness certificate need not be in any particular form. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  How do we get uniformity across the 
country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Exactly.  My colleague asks how we get 
uniformity across the nation if that is the case.  That would be 
my concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill attempts to establish a national safety code which 
would be adhered to from coast to coast, something that is quite 
reasonable.  It is also reasonable to expect that there would 
have to be, as it states in the preamble, consultations not only 
with provincial governments but also with the industry.  We do 
not want the heavy hand of some Ottawa bureaucrat coming down and 
deciding what the code will consist of and enforcing it from 
coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, to have it taken into consideration in the bill that 
the safety fitness certificate need not be in any particular form 
only invites non-uniformity across the country.  Subclause 7(3) 
continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laws of a province respecting the safety of motor carrier 
undertakings apply to an extra-provincial motor carrier 
undertaking to the extent that those laws are not inconsistent 
with this Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, as long as the provinces adopt those parts of 
the national safety code, draft and design their own provincial 
safety fitness certificate and do not contradict the act, that is 
good enough.  I suggest to members and to Canadians that is not 
good enough, given the lofty goals of the legislation itself.  It 
goes on in clause 9 to state that under certain circumstances: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Minister may, by order, withdraw its power to issue such 
certificates. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister does have that power, but it does not clear up any 
criteria or specifications as to what would be encompassed by the 
safety fitness certificate and how the minister would exercise 
that power given the fact it very clearly states they need not be 
in any particular form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly there is a bit of a contradiction in the bill.  As my 
colleague from the New Democratic Party pointed out in her 
intervention, a number of these concerns were raised in 
committee.  However, because the government decided to speed it 
through it did not allow enough time for witnesses to appear or 
for opposition parties and the opposition in industry to appear 
and put forward their concerns.  It is questionable as to why the 
government decided to push the bill through in this manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the whole issue of ministerial exemptions because 
as a number of speakers have indicated it is of some concern. 
Clause 16 deals with exemptions.  I would like to read it so that 
perhaps other members, and certainly the viewing public, can try 
to understand it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister may, after consultation with the provinces that 
would be affected by a proposed exemption, exempt from the 
application of any provision of this Act or the regulations, 
either generally or for a limited period or in respect of a 
limited area, any person, the whole or any part of any 
extra-provincial motor carrier undertaking or any class of those 
undertakings, if in the opinion of the Minister the exemption is 
in the public interest and is not likely to affect motor carrier 
safety. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  He can do what he wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Exactly.  He can basically use his own 
discretion.  I also note there is something that is pretty hard 
to follow.  It sounds like the usual bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo 
that absolutely confounds industry when a piece of legislation is 
designed with clauses like that in it.  The problem, as my 
colleague from Kelowna has indicated, is the final line that the 
minister may allow for an exemption if it is in the public 
interest and is not likely to affect motor carrier safety. 
It does not say anywhere in there what criteria he or she may use 
when making that assessment.  That should be of more than a 
little concern.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Most members of parliament and many Canadians are concerned 
about safety on our roads.  Keith McArthur, a transportation 
reporter with <I>The Globe and Mail</I>, wrote a series of stories 
on fatigue in transportation that included the airline industry 
with pilots and other air crew on the ground, truckers, train 
engineers and other trainmen.  In his story on the trucking 
industry, because that is specifically what Bill S-3 is dealing 
with, he wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999, the most recent year for which statistics are available, 
just 67 people died in aviation accidents, compared with 2,969 on 
Canada's roads and highways. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clearly shows a serious problem on our highways.  It 
continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, there were 360 collisions involving trucks in which 
people lost their lives in Canada.  But police identified fatigue 
as a factor in only two of the accidents. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill was before the committee there was a difficulty in 
assessing when fatigue was a factor in an accident.  It is very 
simple to assess post-accident if alcohol or drugs are suspected. 
A blood test could be taken and either of those factors could be 
discounted or confirmed.  However it is very difficult for a 
police officer at the scene of an accident to rule in fatigue as 
part of the reason an accident actually occurred.  Therein lies 
part of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certainly not opposed to ministerial exemptions for this 
type of legislation.  The proof will be in the pudding and that 
is always the case when we get into a situation allowing 
exemptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out in committee, in my former life in the 
real world outside Ottawa politics I have had experience in 
trucking and working in the oil patch both in northeastern 
British Columbia, northwestern Alberta and into the territories. 
I understand there is a vast difference between driving a heavy 
truck hauling oil field equipment down an ice road in the 
Northwest Territories and driving a heavily laden fifth wheel 
semi-trailer in rush hour traffic in Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a huge difference when we are talking about stress on 
the operator. There is a huge difference in trying to come up 
with regulations that make sense in terms of how the truck is to 
be operated and what restrictions would be placed on the trucking 
company that employs the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult for us to come up with a uniform set of 
regulations that make sense in all corners of the country. 
Therein I find myself in some agreement with the legislation that 
allows the minister some flexibility and some manoeuvring room. 
This makes sense in a country as vast as Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the example raised about hours of operation.  I 
suspect the stress involved for a trucker on the 401 going 
through heavy traffic in cities like Toronto, with bumper to 
bumper traffic in four lanes, would be incredibly more difficult 
to handle on an ongoing basis than operating a truck on a wide 
open stretch of highway in western Canada or an ice road in the 
Arctic where there is virtually no traffic.  The greatest fear if 
one happens to fall asleep is driving off the road and getting 
stuck in a snowbank or perhaps bumping into a caribou or 
something.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a vast difference between what is necessary to ensure 
safety on our highways depending on what part of the country the 
truck or the bus is being operated in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the need for some flexibility, but at the same time I 
am concerned that there is no criteria or specifications set 
down.  Basically  we have allowed the minister to have a wide 
open hand in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just returned from a trip to Portugal with the Minister 
of Transport.  We attended the European conference of 
ministers of transport with over 40 countries in attendance.  One 
of the controversial issues those ministers of transport were 
grappling with when they met for their annual meeting was the 
whole issue of trucking rights and running rights in Europe and 
in the European Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found it incredibly informative and interesting to listen to 
the debate that took place there because in many cases the 
unresolved issues they were dealing with were very similar to the 
issues we deal with in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The physical size of Europe, even with the expansion to include 
more eastern bloc countries in the European Union, is about the 
size of Canada.  The problems they are trying to confront with 
trucks travelling across international borders are very similar 
to some of the problems we are having in getting a truck from 
Montreal to Vancouver and across provincial borders. Some 
interesting debate took place there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were also talking about other many of the same things. They 
were talking about having unrestricted access for a trucking 
company from Holland or Germany to Portugal and what it would 
mean for the local economy.  I have heard the same issues 
regarding trucks being given complete unfettered access from 
eastern to western Canada and what that would do to the local 
economy if it happens too often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard about the need for accurate maintenance of log 
books to ensure that truckers are only operating their trucks for 
the allowable period of time.  The same debate took place in 
Lisbon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be no doubt there is a need for harmonization of our 
national safety code to protect the public on our roads.  I would 
have liked to have taken perhaps a bit more time and spoken about 
the need for infrastructure and dedicated revenue to improve our 
roads.  I could launch into a whole other debate about the need 
to refocus on our railways and our railroads for heavy traffic, 
heavy freight hauling, to get more trucks off the road.  There 
are ways in which we could work for intermodal transportation. We 
have been making some gains in that regard, but a lot more needs 
to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anything, the debate today has clearly shown that the 
national safety code is a myth.  Anybody that would argue it is 
anything else is fooling himself or herself and attempting to 
fool the travelling public.  We need to work a lot more closely 
with the provinces.  The bill sets us on track to do that.  It 
will be interesting to see what we have gained in a few years' 
time: what exemptions, if any, the minister has allowed and why 
they were allowed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In my speech I was talking about the solution to running red 
lights.  I missed a very important point that I wanted to put on 
the record.  I talked about showing an amber light and a green 
light simultaneously to warn people approaching the intersection 
that the light would be red by the time they got there. I forgot 
to include that at some stage the green light would go off and it 
would be amber only, as it is now, so that people would know they 
must stop.  I did not get to that because I was running out of 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very important feature.  It is one of the points I was 
promoting in my speech as something we could do across the 
country to promote safety.

indulging in the sharpest spending increases since the Trudeau

</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister talks about being tax competitive with the

Mr. Speaker, it is the minister who is fearmongering.  Whenever 
reasonable voices of concern are raised about the direction of 
our economy he accuses those voices of fearmongering.  Instead of 
doing that, why does he not bring forth a responsible budget 
which would accelerate tax relief and debt reduction and restore 
absolute confidence to the markets?  Or, is he happy with the 
fact that disposable incomes are 30% less than the United States, 
that we have a 65 cent dollar and that our tax burden is a third 
as high as in the United States?  Is he happy with those facts? 
Does he think those fundamentals are right? 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

disposable incomes are now at a record level.  I am happy about 
the fact that the Canadian economy is creating jobs.  I am happy 
about the fact that it is projected that the Canadian economy 
will have one of the strongest growth rates of any of the 
economies of the world.

goods and services to the United States and Mexico.  That has

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member makes reference to a special committee that the 
deputy minister put together because, and it is no surprise to 
the House, my department has had an increase in requests for

</I></B></P><P align=left>These formulants have been considered non-active ingredients and 
therefore are not listed on the packaging.  Such residues may 
remain and be consumed in food products.  The list includes 
formaldehyde, also used in embalming, and methyl chloride, also 
used as paint stripper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are these toxic compounds not listed on the packaging?  If

<P><A NAME="LINK157"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I share that concern and that is why, when we responded to the 
environment committee's report last year on pesticide regulation, 
we agreed with the recommendation that those formulants should be 
either taken out of the products or listed on the packages. We 
will introduce legislation in due course that will do just that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Lunney (Nanaimo—Alberni, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency of Health 
Canada actively denied knowledge of the facts until confronted 
with the evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be a culture of cover-up in the government, in 
the PMO, in national defence and now in the health ministry. 
Last month the cover-up was mercury in tuna and swordfish.  Now, 
dangerous substances in the residues of pesticides may well be 
consumed in food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What other toxic substances are Canadians consuming that the 
health minister does not think we need to know about? 
<P><A NAME="LINK159"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
games aside, we hope that the parties opposite will support the 
legislation when we bring it before the House.  It will be 
intended to strengthen the regulatory capacity of government to 
make sure that Canadians know what products are being used to 
control pests and to make sure that food products are as safe as 
they can be.

landscapes and public green spaces.  The petitioners point out 
that the Canadian Cancer Association, the lung association and 
others have shown there is a strong link between such pesticides 
and physical ailments such as childhood leukemia and other 
cancers.  It lowers the immune system and damages pituitary and 
thyroid glands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, these petitioners call upon parliament to enact an 
immediate moratorium on the cosmetic use of chemical pesticides 
until such time as their use has been scientifically proven to be 
safe and the long term consequences of their application are 
known.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
following questions will be answered today:  Nos. 46 and 48. 
.[Text] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 46—<B>Mr. Ted White:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to finalized claims as a result of hearings at the 
Immigration and Refugee Board: (<I>a</I>) what is the average approval 
rate resulting from the hearings for the years 1995 to 2000; 
(<I>b</I>) are there any differences between Canada's approval rate 
and those of the United States, Australia, New Zealand and the 
United Kingdom; and (<I>c</I>) if so, why? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 
Lib.):</B> Insofar as Citizenship and Immigration is concerned, the 
following table shows the results of refugee claims finalized by 
the Immigration and Refugee Board from 1995 to 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regards to the question of how Canada's acceptance rate 
compares to that of other countries, it is almost impossible to 
provide meaningful comparisons since refugee determination 
systems vary significantly among refugee receiving countries. For 
example, in some countries, such as the United States and in 
Australia, there is more than one institution that can determine 
refugee status. In other countries, such as France and the United 
Kingdom, more than one type of status may be granted. Finally, 
international comparisons are made difficult by the widely 
varying mix of source countries among the various receiving 
states. That being said, the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees UNHCR, the recognized body on refugee data, produces an 
annual report that provides information on approvals, rejections 
and other status decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Differences in approval rates are the result of many factors. 
For example, in some countries the composition of asylum seekers 
now includes more persons in need of protection than is the case 
in other countries. Interpretation of the Geneva Convention, 
based as well on national jurisprudence, may vary from one country 
to another.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the installation of Rogers and Seacoast 
Communication' towers and transmitters in Colwood, B.C.: (<I>a</I>) 
did Industry Canada comply with their own rules in the granting 
of approvals; (<I>b</I>) if not, has Industry Canada taken corrective 
action and instructed the owners to relocate their towers; and 
(<I>c</I>) did the Minister of Industry consult with the municipality 
of Colwood? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry , Lib.):</B> (a) The antenna towers in question were 
authorized by Industry Canada in accordance with the procedures 
and standards in place for this purpose. Our requirements 
regarding the radio station application process, compliance with 
Health Canada's safety code 6, and municipal land use 
consultation procedures were met prior to the issuance of 
approval by Industry Canada. Letters to the city of Colwood from 
the assistant deputy minister, Spectrum, Information Technologies 
and Telecommunications, as well as our local director have 
explained the department's process and position with  regard to the 
approval of these radio towers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) Not applicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) Industry Canada's procedures require consultation between 
the applicant and the land use authority so that the land use 
authority is aware of significant antenna proposed within its 
boundaries and has an opportunity to make its views known. The 
mandatory notification and consultation with the city of Colwood 
did take place prior to the issuance of these authorizations. In 
this case, no concerns were raised to Industry Canada during this 
consultation process. The local bylaws provided for radio transmission 
towers as a permitted use and building permits were issued by the 
municipality. Industry Canada officials have been in contact with 
the city of Colwood on this matter and continue with ongoing 
communications with the municipality.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MOTOR VEHICLE TRANSPORT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK204">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill S-3, an 
act to amend the Motor Vehicle Transport Act, 1987 and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, be read the third time 
and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was responding of course in comment to the speech given by the 
member for Prince George—Peace River.  I was talking about the 
fact that during my intervention earlier I talked about having a 
dual light system to increase the safety so that vehicles and 
drivers could stop before entering an intersection when the light 
was red and before the momentum of the vehicle made it impossible 
to stop with the normal brake reaction time.  I was glad to put 
that on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proposing that both the amber and the green lights be shown 
at a point indicated by a sign well back from the intersection. 
Then everybody, whether it is a motorcyclist or a truck driver, 
would have enough time to plan to stop at the next light.  Any 
person who was behind the sign would have to stop.  Anybody who 
was ahead of the sign when both lights came on would of course 
know that he could make it safely through.  On the other hand, 
the amber only light would indicate that now it was time to stop 
because the next phase would be the red light, which comes in one 
and a half, or two seconds or whatever it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having done that, the hon. member may want to respond to my 
proposal.  If not, I am thankful for the opportunity to be able 
to complete my speech, because I ran out of time before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Elk 
Island for in effect finishing his speech.  I note that as the 
first speaker for the opposition, he had some 40 minutes to 
speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I followed the circuitous routing of his speech throughout the 
40 minutes with great interest.  He raised a lot of very relevant 
topics, one of which was to enlighten the House to a certain 
extent with his own personal experience as a former truck driver 
quite some years ago.  I think he referred to ox carts and dirt 
trails or something like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate he raised a number of interesting issues, one of 
which was the safety issue of our intersections.  All joking 
aside it is a very serious issue as he noted.  The results of 
that are innumerable accidents, many of them involving death or 
substantial serious injury over the years at our intersections. 
He proposed a very interesting potential way to help alleviate 
some of those accidents, and I certainly support his thinking in 
that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is quite appropriate because the issue that we are 
discussing of course is the need for national safety regulations 
as it pertains to trucking and buses.  I want to use a bit of 
time now to use an example, as he did when he used several 
examples during his intervention, to talk about how ridiculous it 
is to have different regulations from province to province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer I was made aware of an incident in my riding of 
Prince George—Peace River involving a bus of tourists.  Of 
course tourism is a very important industry in British Columbia, 
in particular northern British Columbia.  We always welcome and 
try to extend western and northern hospitality to all tourists 
who make it up to the beautiful riding of Prince George—Peace 
River and the Peace River area of Alberta and British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular instance a bus of tourists from Quebec 
travelled all the way across Canada.  Of course as such the bus 
had to stop at weigh scales as it travelled across the provincial 
boundaries and borders.  Then it arrived in the Peace River 
district of British Columbia. 
When they pulled into the weigh scale at the city of Dawson 
Creek, lo and behold they found out that they were overweight. 
They were fine in Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and 
Alberta.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were to travel up the Alaska Highway to Yukon and Alaska as 
part of their summer trip.  Many of them had planned this for 
probably a year in advance.  They were quite excited about this 
trip up the Alaska Highway, but when they got to mile zero of the 
Alaska Highway the bus was brought to a standstill because the 
regulations concerning the maximum vehicle weight for buses is 
different in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They tried to sort it out.  We can imagine a busload of tourists 
held up and inconvenienced.  They have places they have to be at 
certain times.  Their schedule is planned for meals and for 
overnight stays at hotels on up the route.  There they were 
stopped at a weigh scale in Dawson Creek. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally they had to hire an old school bus, in effect, and 
offload the luggage from their Greyhound style sightseeing bus 
onto the school bus, which carried the luggage behind them and 
followed them to Alaska or at least until they got out of British 
Columbia.  I do not know what happened when they crossed the 
border into the Yukon.  Maybe they loaded all the luggage back 
onto the bus and carried on, but for that 500 miles or so from 
Dawson Creek to the Yukon border they had to have this extra 
vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can imagine what this does for tourism.  I see that my 
colleague from the Liberal Party who represents the Yukon is 
here.  Maybe he could add some words to this debate.  We can 
imagine what that type of inconvenience does for the tourist 
industry in northern British Columbia and on into the Yukon and 
Alaska. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is more than appropriate that where there are genuine safety 
concerns we have uniformity and harmonization of trucking and bus 
regulations and safety rules, with the national safety code 
harmonized across the country.  What I am trying to allude to is 
that there is a need for it in very practical and economic terms, 
certainly in the area of tourism.  That is the real point I am 
trying to make with this story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that I will conclude and see if anyone else would like to 
add something to this debate about the national safety code and 
the need for harmonized trucking and busing regulations across 
our country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to agree with the sentiments that were just expressed about 
the border between Yukon and British Columbia, and not just 
related to the safety code.  For years we have had complaints 
from truckers about regulations in B.C. that make it very 
difficult for Yukon truckers to simply carry a load across the 
border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is part of a proliferation of internal trade 
barriers, which my colleagues across the way have also referred 
to.  I brought to the attention of some of the witnesses in 
committee that I hoped they would try to diminish these internal 
trade barriers which really cut down on commerce in the country 
and specifically in my constituency of Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the comments of my 
colleague from Yukon.  As he indicated, there are ongoing 
problems.  As I indicated earlier as the representative for 
Prince George—Peace River, the Alaska Highway starts in and 
travels hundreds of miles throughout my riding before it enters 
the riding of the hon. member for Yukon and carries on through to 
Alaska.  There are some problems with the different regulations, 
which he alludes to.   I think it is incumbent upon all 
territorial and provincial governments, along with the federal 
government, to resolve this.  The example I used of the one 
busload of tourists from Quebec is simply one specific example.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, north of Fort Nelson and up toward the Yukon there 
are load restrictions in spring, restrictions that really limit 
truckers to a very small portion of what otherwise would be a 
legal load for their trucks.  That raises the cost of produce, 
especially fresh produce that obviously all citizens need for a 
balanced diet, during the winter months especially.  During the 
spring road restrictions, the costs of those products go up 
correspondingly because the trucks can only haul a portion of 
what they could otherwise haul. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it really points to a need for, dare I mention it again, 
greater investment by governments in the infrastructure and the 
road network.  The Alaska Highway is one example of where there 
is a substantial need for investment.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PROCEEDS OF CRIME (MONEY LAUNDERING) ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK209">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that 
Bill S-16, an act to amend the Proceeds of Crime (Money 
Laundering) Act, be read the third time and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, what we are dealing with here is an 
amendment to the anti-money laundering legislation that was 
passed by the House a year ago.  These amendments spring from a 
review of the legislation in great detail by the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to commend hon. senators for the way in which they 
gave the bill a great deal of scrutiny but did not hold up the 
passage.  They said they would come back and revisit it but would 
allow the bill to pass in its original form.  I would like to 
thank them for the scrutiny they have given it and for the way 
that they have expedited the passage, at the same time achieving 
a bill that fulfils the purposes and needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money laundering in Canada is anywhere between $5 billion and 
$17 billion a year.  The bill would fight organized crime and the 
proceeds of crime through a mandatory reporting of suspicious 
transactions and the reporting of large transfers of money across 
borders, which would be carried out by the Financial Transactions 
and Reports Analysis Centre.  The institutions would report to it 
and it will be able to analyze the data.  What I think we have 
achieved, which may be unique in the world, is that we are 
respecting the privacy of individuals and at the same time 
fighting crime. 
That is the balance we have struck and I believe it is a very 
good balance.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank all members of the House for their 
consideration of the bill and for its speedy passage in the same 
manner that they gave speedy passage to the main bill itself one 
year ago. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I know that the Liberals are always delighted when I rise in 
debate as one of the first three speakers who, according to the 
rules, has 40 minutes available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did that in debate on Bill S-3, the transportation bill.  I 
hope that my intervention there will actually result in a ball 
starting to roll that will change the laws of the country.  I am 
hoping for changes to the laws right across the North American 
continent so that there will be uniformity, so that there will be 
understanding on what the rules are and so that in obeying them 
we will save lives.  That is the objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are speaking about money laundering and the role 
government has to play in order to prevent criminal activity on 
the part of members of our society who choose to engage in crime. 
The motivation of criminal activity is almost always that of 
earning money in an illicit fashion, so this money somehow has to 
be brought into the system without it being identifiable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that a lot of people in the country have some concerns 
about the potential for some day having a cashless society. 
Actually I am one of them.  It has one interesting feature if we 
stop to think about it.  If instead of actually having cash in 
our wallets, all of us had computer cards that represented cash, 
it would of course be easy for people to transact business.  It 
would really be equivalent.  Instead of withdrawing four $20 
bills from a bank machine in order to have $80 in cash, I could 
simply put my cash card into the machine and ask the machine to 
transfer $80 from my chequing account or whatever it is to the 
card.  When I wanted to purchase something, instead of tendering 
$12.38 and then getting change I could simply give my card.  The 
machine would subtract that from the balance on the card and I 
would walk away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That could be done anonymously.  It would be great.  However, it 
could also be tracked and that in fact is one of the great 
objections that many Canadians have to that kind of scheme. There 
is genuine concern that if we ever get to that then the term big 
brother is watching would take on real meaning.  It would mean 
that even if we stopped to buy a pop and chocolate bar there 
would be evidence that could be hauled out later.  Most Canadians 
reject that kind of monitoring of our activities, so there are 
some problems with it.  However, it could be legislated that such 
data could be used only in an investigation of criminal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had such a scheme, just look at how difficult it would 
make it for people who engage in crime.  They would somehow, 
either through a bank account or through a cash card, have to 
force other people to put money into their account in one form or 
another.  It would be traceable and therefore it would be a lot 
easier to put a brake on a lot of criminal activity.  I sometimes 
think it would be quite hilarious if someone walked into a bank 
with a gun, pointed it at the teller and demanded that $30,000 be 
transferred to an account.  It would hardly be an anonymous 
transaction.  A person would not get very far before officials 
were able to catch up with him and charge him with the 
appropriate crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what we are talking about today.  We are talking 
about some other means of tracking financial transactions that 
are related to the criminal industry.  I have never heard of a 
criminal who demands payment by cheque when he or she does 
something illegal, because cheques are in fact traceable.  It is 
called a paper trail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 10 years ago when the GST was brought in there was an 
awful lot of illegal activity, because in order to avoid the GST 
people said they would do renovations to houses or fix cars for a 
certain amount provided that they were paid cash and there was no 
paper trail. 
Then there was no GST and they did not have to declare it on 
their income tax.  Basically, it was tax free money which meant 
they could do it for half the price.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that sometimes they charged three-quarters of the 
price, so they basically split the earnings so to speak, but it 
was illegal.  If Revenue Canada, as it was called at that time, 
found out about it, then appropriate actions were taken.  However 
this was the lack of the paper trail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we get a paper trail on criminal activity?  Obviously 
these criminals will avoid the paper trail.  Bill S-16 is 
actually the completion of Bill C-22, which was given assent in 
the previous parliament, if I am not mistaken.  I do not know if 
hon. members will recall, but I believe that was the bill that 
eliminated the $1,000 bill.  It is much more difficult for large 
amounts of money to be transacted if people literally have to 
have truckloads of $20 or at the most $100 bills to do the 
transaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was also the bill that included some of the measures which 
we are talking about today.  As the parliamentary secretary said 
now there are some refinements being made.  I would like to say a 
few things about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, how long can this information be retained?  The bill is 
amending the new organization called the Financial Transactions 
and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, commonly called FINTRAC. 
If financial organizations transact a large amount of money in 
cash they are required to report it.  Those financial 
institutions, like banks or credit unions, will report their 
transactions to FINTRAC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raised a number of questions.  As I said, how long can the 
centre retain this information?  For example, if I went to my 
bank and deposit $50,000 in cash, and maybe $50,000 is not very 
much money to some members but it sure is to me and my friends, 
people might wonder how I got it.  They might wonder if I got it 
through some illicit operation.  However, that would never 
happen.  In case someone else did something like that, the 
financial institution would report the cash deposit.  If I 
reported it, FINTRAC would then have the obligation to look at 
it.  If it was suspicious it would turn it over to the law 
enforcement agencies for investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say that I am investigated and there was nothing wrong. 
The institution would have his information.  How long would the 
centre retain the information it collects?  Bill S-16 deals with 
that.  It says that the information reported to them cannot be 
kept more than five years.  If it is transmitted onward to the 
law enforcement agencies, then the information can be keep for 
eight years but no longer, in which case that information must be 
deleted from all computer files and all paper files must be 
destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When and how will it dispose of that information?  That is also 
in this particular bill, as I have just indicated.  What 
information may the centre disclose to law enforcement 
authorities?  That is another very important question because the 
original bill just said similar information and it was left 
undefined.  Similar to what?  One thing this bill does is to 
insert only one word in one of the clauses. 
It inserts the word identifying information.  In other words, a 
certain amount of information such as name and address can be 
included.  The information which it is entitled to keep and 
transmit must be identifying information in terms of the 
suspicion, or the details of the transaction itself or the 
identification of the individual.  It cannot go on a wild goose 
chase.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 3 of the bill deals with the jurisdiction of the courts. 
There is always a problem with this.  If a government agency has 
the right to do something and I disagree with it, can I appeal? 
That was not clear in the original act.  This clause in the bill 
will clarify this and allow courts to have jurisdiction over any 
disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens if an agent from the centre feels that it is 
information which could lead to a criminal charge?  Does he or 
she give it to the law enforcement agency without any 
accountability?  The fact of the matter is we are dealing with 
people who may be innocent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to do as much as we can to find evidence against those 
kinds of individuals, convict those who are guilty and bring them 
to justice.  At the same time, however, we do know if many people 
are charged with certain activities of which they are not guilty. 
They should be able to defend themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the courts is one thing.  Another is that any 
information which is deemed eligible to be reported, cannot be 
reported without the person first being given the opportunity to 
contact a lawyer.  One may wonder why, if it involves an 
accountant for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time accountants do not have the solicitor-client 
privilege that pertains to the legal profession.  That person 
could refuse to give information and decide to withhold it as 
being client privilege.  The person now would not be required to 
give that information without first having the opportunity to 
contact a lawyer who could look at it, then on behalf of the 
client say it was client-professional privilege, and he could 
take it.  This is a safeguard which should be included in order 
to protect those people who are innocent and, to a degree, 
protect the process so the person who is guilty cannot get off on 
the technicality that his or her rights were abused.  That is a 
very important clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought it would be useful for members of the House and for 
anyone else who happens to be observing the debate today to know 
a little more detail about Bill S-16.  It is a bill which 
strengthens the money laundering legislation in Canada so those 
people who are involved in criminal activity can be correctly 
identified and brought to justice.  I support this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have this opportunity to speak today on the third 
reading of Bill S-16, an act to amend the Proceeds of Crime 
(Money Laundering) Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 29, 2000, Bill C-22, or the Proceeds of Crime (Money 
Laundering) Act received royal assent.  The purpose of this 
statute is to make it easier to prevent money laundering of the 
proceeds of crime by creating a financial transactions and 
reports analysis centre responsible for gathering, managing, 
analyzing and distributing reports of suspicious operations and 
any other pertinent information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the inauguration of a mechanism for the reporting of 
suspicious transactions and major transborder capital transfers, 
as provided for in Bill C-22, was in response to the problems 
raised by the financial action group against money-laundering.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be a good opportunity to point out that the Bloc 
Quebecois had supported this government initiative, out of a 
concern to protect the Quebec population from the calamity 
represented by organized crime.   Moreover, in order to make 
money laundering more inconvenient, the Bloc Quebecois were the 
ones behind the withdrawal of $1,000 bills and the requirement 
for banks and other financial institutions to report any 
suspicious financial transaction involving $10,000 or more in 
cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go further, money laundering may be defined as follows. 
It is the process by which the proceeds of crime are converted 
into assets whose origins are difficult to trace.  Despite all, 
we know that 70% of the money laundered in Canada is drug money. 
The remaining 30% comes from activities as varied as under the 
table gaming, tobacco and alcohol smuggling, fraud, 
counterfeiting and petty computer and telecommunications crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, money is the sinews of war, and the one waged by the 
authorities against organized crime is no exception. 
Internationally, proceeds from crime entering the financial 
market represents hundreds of billions of dollars. 
So, considering that the prime motivator behind organized crime 
is lucre, and here I am speaking of huge sums quickly pocketed, 
the confiscation of such laundered proceeds hurts a lot more 
than the usual sanctions of fines and prison terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legitimate or not, every business aims at making a net profit. 
By way of example, let us look at a business whose activities 
are on the up and up.  Suppose that for some reason or other 
the business is taken to court and for purposes of discussion, 
let us imagine that at the end of the trial it is sentenced to 
pay a fine or to pay damages.  Of course, the business will feel 
it but this comes with the territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same holds true for organized crime. 
A jail sentence or a fine is among the inherent risks associated 
with criminal activities. However, by depriving an organization 
of its most profound motivation, we destroy the directly 
proportional relation that exists between the risks and the 
benefits. So, getting our hands on that organization's assets 
will weaken it from an economical and moral point of view. In 
other words, we must show that, indeed, crime does not pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though it does not at all change the substance of the 
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act, Bill S-16 does address 
some issues raised during the hearings held on Bill C-22 by the 
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce. The 
four changes included in the bill should address the following 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How long will the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis 
Centre of Canada keep the information that it collects? When and 
how will it dispose of the information that it will have 
gathered? What information can the centre transmit to law 
enforcement bodies? Will the federal court have the power to 
order the centre to transmit the file of an individual under the 
Privacy Act and the Access to Information Act?  Finally, who 
is authorized to make a claim of solicitor-client privilege? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ask ourselves if Bill S-16 adequately addresses these 
concerns, and this is what we are going to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we can say that clause 1 responds satisfactorily to the 
first two questions raised before the standing Senate committee. 
This amendment sets out the circumstances justifying the 
maximum retention period of eight years for reports and all 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This retention period shall be enforced when the centre forwards 
information either to law enforcement authorities or to the 
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, the Canadian Security and 
Intelligence Service, the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration, an agency in a foreign state or an international 
organization with a mandate similar to the centre's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the addition of paragraph (<I>e</I>) to section 54 of the 
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act provides that each 
report received and all information received or collected shall 
be destroyed on the expiry of the applicable period. 
This paragraph therefore adds certain necessary clarifications 
regarding the duration of retention and the destruction of 
information. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, with the addition of the term identifying information 
in paragraph 55(7)(<I>e</I>), the purpose of which is to clarify to what 
the information is similar, the second clause of Bill S-16 thus 
responds to the third question.  The purpose of this amendment 
is to clarify that the identifying information in question is 
that found in paragraphs (<I>a</I>) to (<I>d</I>). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our view, this clarification was not needed since paragraph 2(e) 
is interrelated to the previous ones. But since this is a 
catch-all paragraph, I guess someone felt the need to make this 
clarification which does not change anything to the original 
provision. If this amendment can clarify things for some people, 
great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the fourth question, clause 3 of Bill S-16 was 
drafted because initially the federal court was not allowed to 
make an order for disclosure. In fact, such an order could only 
be made pursuant to subsection 60(4) of the Proceeds of Crime (Money 
Laundering) Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment ensures that no provision in this legislation can 
prevent the federal court from ordering the director of the 
centre to disclose information under the Access to Information 
Act and the Privacy Act. It seems that it was always intended for 
the federal court to enjoy this authority, which will now be 
clearly stipulated in clause 3 of Bill S-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this amendment, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) 
Act will now give the federal court some judicial control over 
the disclosure of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the fourth clause, as we mentioned at second reading, it 
certainly would have been possible to word it to make it easier 
to understand. Unfortunately, it was not, and we have to live 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, following the explanations we were provided with at 
the Standing Committee on Finance, we believe that, even if this 
amendment answers our fifth question about who could invoke the 
solicitor-client privilege, it seems that it does not deal with 
the concerns that led to its drafting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the Senate committee, accountants maintained that they 
have very high standards of confidentiality to meet, just like 
any lawyer. 
Consequently, they say that they should also be allowed to claim 
solicitor-client privilege. However, clause 4 of the bill 
responds only partially to this demand. An accountant or any 
other person, other than a lawyer, cannot personally claim 
solicitor-client privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the protection of documents in the possession of a 
person who is not a lawyer depends on the involvement of such a 
legal counsel in the matter under investigation. Therefore, the 
possibility of claiming solicitor-client privilege remains 
restricted to the lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does this work in practical terms? First, the client gives a 
legal mandate to a lawyer. 
I must insist on the fact that the nature of the mandate is 
crucial because a lawyer who would act as business adviser could 
not claim solicitor-client privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fulfilling his or her mandate, the lawyer may work jointly 
with other professionals, such as an accountant for example. 
Having doubts regarding the legality of the activities conducted 
by the client, the authorities decide to investigate. The person 
authorized to conduct the search will not be able to examine the 
documents handed over to the accountant by the lawyer. 
Therefore, it is through the lawyer, the only person who can 
claim solicitor-client privilege, that the documents in the 
possession of the accountant will remain confidential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, it would be fair to think that, in order to 
enjoy absolute protection, money launderers will systematically 
go to a lawyer first, who will hand the documents over to the 
appropriate professionals. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT58"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT58"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1550

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the situation is not as simple as it may appear.  Even if 
the solicitor-client confidentiality required of the lawyer at 
this time provides considerable guarantees of confidentiality, 
this is not an absolute concept but one subject to a number of 
conditions and restrictions, which I will not list in the context 
of today's debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When an individual or organization involved in money laundering 
requires the services of any professional with a view to 
facilitating the perpetration of a crime, regardless of whether 
or not a lawyer was involved, the seized documents cannot be 
protected by solicitor-client privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, this amendment adds nothing new to the present 
situation, in that it merely codifies existing principles which 
have long 
been in place under common law.  The concept of solicitor-client 
privilege therefore remains exclusive to the performance of the 
duties of a lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This notion can, moreover, be extended to other persons when 
their services have been retained by a lawyer, in order to enable 
him or her to meet the obligations of his or her mandate as a 
lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under these circumstances, one might say that the 
solicitor-client privilege is not a right transmittable to a 
third party.  It is instead a real right involving transmitted 
documents which, as the bottom line, are the purview of the 
lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the law will meet the objective of this 
provision, that is to ensure that specialized professionals such 
as lawyers and accountants cannot act as accomplices to the money 
laundering mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have already stated, Bill S-16 ought to respond to five 
very specific questions raised before the Senate committee. 
Despite the fact that accountants do not really enjoy the same 
privileges of client confidentiality as lawyers, we still 
consider that Bill S-16 effectively addresses all these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, as we supported the Proceeds of Crime (Money 
Laundering) Act and as the four clauses the present debate 
addresses are intended simply to clarify the intent of the 
provisions they amend, we will also vote in favour of Bill S-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we wish to point out to this House that we are 
supporting the government today for the same reasons we became 
involved in the introduction of new coercive measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are satisfied these measures will enable the authorities to 
more effectively fight organized crime and therefore to ensure 
the safety of Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it is unfortunate that the people of Quebec must 
once again put their faith in the goodwill of a federal government, 
which, more often than not, does what it likes when it comes to 
resolving problems that, despite their application to Quebec 
society specifically, fall under the jurisdiction of the federal 
government because of the distribution of jurisdictions, which 
gives it exclusive jurisdiction in matters of criminal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore appropriate to mention that this dependency will 
be eliminated with a sovereign Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member on her remarks.  She 
obviously grasps the importance and the relevance of this issue 
at this time in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to concerns raised by the Senate banking committee 
and the important efforts and work it did in that regard, we see 
Bill S-16, an act to amend the Proceeds of Crime Act, coming 
forward to legislate in the areas of solicitor-client privilege, 
the disclosure of information and records retention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should indicate at the outset that I had intended to split my 
time with the hon. member for Kings—Hants.  Subject to his 
arrival I may just carry on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money laundering, as we all know and are very aware, is the 
process by which criminals attempt to conceal profits earned from 
crime so that the money looks as if it came from very legitimate 
sources.  It is literally an attempt to clean dirty cash.  It is 
also an attempt to hide or cover up the illegal means and sources 
from which the money originated.  Typically it involves vices 
such as extortion, prostitution, illegal gambling, drugs and 
other contraband. 
The particular legislation is aimed at attempting to track the 
origins of the money and to get at the source itself. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT59"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT59"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1555
<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation speaks of abilities to trace the origins of 
money because the origins themselves are those which are most 
often concealed and erased.  If the money is successfully covered 
up, it can then be used to buy goods and services the way any 
other type of cash or exchange takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that somewhere between $5 billion and $17 
billion in money from nefarious sources is laundered in Canada 
each year.  I do not mean to put too fine a point on it but that 
sort of vague estimate indicates the size of the black market out 
there.  It is very disturbing.  Exact figures are very difficult 
to come by in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the black market is thriving in Canada.  It is 
straight profit that is hidden from Revenue Canada and from 
government generally.  The money is very often shifted between 
countries, financial institutions and investment brokerages 
without a paper trace that would allow law enforcement to get to 
the source or to get to the origins.  The more complex and 
convoluted the trail, the more difficult to trace, eventually 
prosecute and bring to justice those involved in money 
laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say it is a world problem against which even the 
world's most powerful nations struggle.  For example, Vladimir 
Putin, the Russian president, just last week held a conference on 
money laundering in St. Petersburg.  He outlined efforts to crack 
down on the global illegal industry and the expansion of this 
industry in Russia.  Russia is currently a member of the FATF's 
blacklist of nations because of its money laundering legislation, 
or lack thereof, which does not meet international standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want this to happen in our country.  That is why it is 
encouraging to all that the legislation is before us now.  We 
must ensure our global partners and neighbours, not to mention 
our citizenry, that we are doing everything in our power to 
address and confront this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corruption is a growing problem in Canada and most countries 
recognize this point.  They recognize the fact that it is very 
diverse and takes many forms just like legitimate industries. Any 
effort aimed at curtailing this type of underground economy and 
outsourcing of money from illegal means is where we should be 
focusing our attention.  The magnitude and the reach of this 
problem are staggering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has come under heavy criticism in recent years as being 
an easy place for criminal organizations to launder their money. 
Our biggest ally, the United States, has sent signals which 
clearly indicate that we are leaving our neighbours to the south 
open and more vulnerable to criminal activity respecting money 
laundering because of a failing security system in our country. 
The lack of resources contributes to that.  The lack of 
government support whether it be through funding or innovation 
indicates to members of our law enforcement community that in 
many instances their government is not behind them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The response has been legislation such as Bill S-16, albeit 
late.  Bill C-22 originally imposed new reporting and record 
keeping requirements and created financial transactions in the 
reports analysis centre of Canada to receive and analyse 
information.  Bill C-22 was the predecessor for the legislation 
before us.  It died on the order paper when the pre-emptive and 
very opportunistic election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks would be required by law to adhere to a new reporting 
regime that would be put in place over the next year.  It would 
help reorganize and report dubious transactions.  It would 
present banks with the obligation to act upon information of 
which they might be in possession and report where there is a 
suspicion of organized crime activity.  It is clearly there to 
try to unveil and unmask efforts by organized crime to use 
financial institutions such as our major banks and other 
financial institutions for illegal purposes. 
A failure to report would result in certain sanctions.  Those 
sanctions include fines of up to $2 million and five years 
incarceration.  Therefore, this reporting scheme does have some 
teeth.

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerns have been expressed however about the privacy and the 
disclosure of certain information.  Those were voiced by the 
privacy commissioner, the Canadian Bar Association and other 
groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate banking committee looked at the bill in June of 2000 
and felt that there were numerous flaws and areas where it could 
have been improved.  The government at that time was unwilling to 
entertain amendments to the legislation because it was late in 
June and the House of Commons was going to recess.  We know that 
at this time of year ironically we are facing a similar attitude 
on the part of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Secretary of State for International Financial 
Institutions gave a written undertaking to the committee that 
certain changes would be made in a new bill to be introduced in 
the fall.  Those changes formed the substance of Bill S-30, 
introduced in October of 2000.  This bill was identical to the 
bill we see before us and it went beyond those changes agreed to 
in the letter from the secretary of state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate banking committee reported the bill with the 
observation that the government should have given consideration 
to other amendments that would further ensure that 
solicitor-client privilege was protected by adding the phrase law 
office in any clause where the term dwelling house appeared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the first annual review should be held after three years 
not after five years as was indicated in the original 
legislation. We find far too often that we are becoming very 
slack in our review process that was initially intended to ensure 
that the bill was living up to the breadth, width and intention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third and finally, it would require regulations under the act to 
be tabled before a committee of each House of parliament.  Sadly, 
this bill does not include those further changes that were 
recommended by the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Law Society of Upper Canada has asked for the deference of 
the worst sections of this legislation.  In many legal circles 
around the country court action against the federal government is 
not only being discussed but is being planned.  This has happened 
time and time again.  It is a given that with legislation such as 
this, and Bill C-24 is another bill, the lawyers are already 
writing the briefs, and the games will begin as soon as this law 
comes into being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will focus on the following legal aspects of this 
particular legislation.  Solicitor-client privilege is one, which 
I mentioned previously.  Where as Bill C-22 only dealt with 
instances where there was solicitor-client privilege involving 
legal counsel, Bill S-16 now clarifies that the officials of the 
Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre may not 
examine or copy documents that might be subject to a claim of 
solicitor-client privilege where the document is in the hands of 
someone else until a reasonable opportunity has been made for 
that person to contact legal counsel.  This responds to concerns 
raised by the Certified General Accountants Association of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very much akin to the situation we see with the 
information commissioner in Canada who would like to examine the 
Prime Minister's agenda books.  He would hold that information in 
privacy and counsel and determine its relevance to the 
individuals who have requested disclosure.  It follows a 
longstanding tradition that allows judges to determine relevance 
and admissibility of certain information.  So we support that 
particular initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privacy under Bill S-16 will also allow individuals or the 
privacy commissioner to take the Financial Transactions and 
Reports Analysis Centre to court if they are denied access by the 
centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation has come under some criticism in the banking 
committee because the bill creates onerous and very involved new 
responsibilities.  In fact, Margaret Beare, one of Canada's 
leading experts on organized crime, recently stated that the new 
legislation requiring banks to report suspicious transactions was 
contradictory to some of the banks' principles, mainly that they 
would be making a profit and reacting to customers' wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member.  It was understood that you would split your

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my 
hon. colleague for his intervention.  It does allow me to 
continue just momentarily with my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were concerns with respect to the discrepancies over what 
would constitute a suspicious transaction, which again led to 
concerns that were expressed by Ms. Beare.  There was also 
indication that certain levels of the banking sector had problems 
within their computer system or their system of reporting that 
would also leave them vulnerable by not being able to live up to 
the expectation of reporting.  They would have an inability to 
monitor the type of monetary transactions that may be taking 
place on an ongoing basis, that was they could do so perhaps over 
a sustained period of time.  However, as we all know, these 
transactions often occur in a very short time span. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Beare expressed a concern that lack of follow-up from police 
in some instances posed a considerable obstacle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is often the case with catching criminals, it is the slip-ups 
and lack of sophistication on their part that very often leads to 
the arrest.  However the legislation I would suggest moves in the 
right direction in terms of arming those in the financial sector 
to combat the very sophisticated and often very complicated and 
nefarious means by which those who are trying to launder their 
money will engage.  Otherwise those who play the game very well 
continue to thrive despite our best efforts.  We have to 
obviously strive regardless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that note, I will turn over the floor to my colleague from 
Kings—Hants.  I know that as a member of the finance committee 
he has made significant contributions to this and other bills.  I 
know that all members will be riveted to their seats when the 
hon. member for Kings—Hants assumes the floor. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank my colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough 
for his erudite comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of money laundering is one that no Canadian should 
underestimate.  The fact that the estimates range between a $5 
billion problem to as high as a $20 billion problem speaks 
volumes about the degree to which we really do not have a very 
good handle on the scale of the problem.  What we do realize is 
its impact on facilitating and enabling organized crime in any 
range of applications, whether it is in particular on the side of 
the narcotics trade, is significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also not underestimate the degree to which significant 
resources are needed to fighting money laundering.  In recent 
years we have seen an exponential increase in the range and 
complexity of financial vehicles available to criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about organized crime, we are not talking about 
underfunded agencies.  We are talking about some of the most 
sophisticated, well funded groups in the world with international 
linkages and the economies of scale to attract and to invest in 
the very best technologies.  That is why, whatever we do in terms 
of new agencies and new approaches to money laundering, we have 
to ensure that the funds are committed to our RCMP and our 
enforcement capabilities.  Otherwise all that will occur is the 
government will take baby steps in the right direction but really 
not achieve the goals of reducing the incidents of organized 
crime and money laundering, which should of course be the goal of 
the legislation. 
The government has had a terrible record of underfunding, the 
RCMP for instance.  Clearly while new agencies and new approaches 
might be helpful, if they are underfunded, it will not achieve 
the goals that the government has attached to this legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some concerns relative to issues of privacy and the 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough articulated some of 
those concerns.  It is important as well to ensure that the new 
agency's mandate and efforts are separated assiduously from those 
of the Canada Customs and Revenue Canada Agency.  If the customs 
and revenue agency sees evidence of money laundering, it may be 
appropriate to refer some cases to this new agency to deal with 
money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being the case, what we want to avoid in those cases where 
this agency has not found sufficient evidence of money laundering 
but may find some evidence relative to inappropriate behaviours 
relative to one's taxes, is the agency to result in a souped-up 
Revenue Canada to sink its teeth a little deeper into the ankles 
of Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues of enforcement, and particularly the onus being 
placed on financial institutions, will be one that will be very 
difficult from an enforcement perspective and from a privacy 
perspective.  We have to be awfully careful in this regard that a 
significant level of education occurs at the outset and that our 
financial institutions are prepared on a consistent basis 
throughout various financial institutions and throughout a branch 
of networks to carry out the mandate of this legislation.  I 
suggest to the government that this will be a significant 
challenge and that the government has to be prepared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to be prepared to invest significantly in 
technologically driven approaches to deal with money laundering. 
Again, we are not dealing with amateurs.  These are not 
underfunded agencies and local yokels who are doing a bit of 
criminal activities and do not really have the resources to carry 
on their activities.  The government is fighting some of the best 
funded organizations in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that we need to engage other countries more 
actively than we are right now in a co-operative effort. 
Clearly, money laundering and electronic transfers of money do 
not recognize borders, particularly if one were to consider just 
for a moment the impact of even the Interac system and its impact 
on the ability to launder money, to hide transactions and to 
break really large transactions into a multitude of smaller ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure many of us in the House use online banking sometimes 
and I would suggest all of us probably use our bank cards. 
However, consider in the wrong hands and with nefarious motives 
what extraordinarily powerful tools the Interac system and online 
banking are.  These are the simplest consumer available 
technologies of which we are aware.  We are not even considering 
some of the extraordinarily powerful technologies being used in 
the mysterious world of arbitrage and currency trading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are not very careful to ensure the necessary resources are 
committed to this fight, then we are sending this new agency, our 
RCMP and others into battle with pellet guns which will not be in 
the long term interest of the effort to reduce the incidence of 
money laundering and organized crime.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accountability is of real importance.  There is concern about 
the growing trend toward agencies which the government has pushed 
in recent years.  The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency and the 
new money laundering agencies are not very accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ensure, particularly in areas of privacy, that we do not 
create agencies that are able to run roughshod over the rights of 
Canadians.  At the same time, however, agencies must have the 
resources and ability to do their jobs.  It is a balancing act. I 
hope the government has a good understanding of what it will be 
up against with the new agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must invest properly and make sure the accountability is 
there to protect ordinary, law-abiding Canadians.  However 
resources must also be committed to ensuring Canadians who do not 
take the law seriously, who participate in money laundering and 
globally powerful organized crime networks, are caught and dealt 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of our concerns.  The legislation, like so much 
of the government's legislation, represents a baby step in the 
right direction.  However given the power of organized crime 
globally and the resources available to it, we are taking baby 
steps in the right direction while the forces we battle are 
taking gigantic leaps.  We are not making the progress we should 
be making in this place to ensure that money laundering and 
organized crime are dealt with effectively in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today is a special day in the House.  We are debating 
three bills that were introduced in the Senate.  Bill S-16 is the 
third of the Senate originated bills we are debating today.  It 
is also a special debate in the sense that the government side 
seems not to be participating.  It made a token one or two minute 
speech and said we should get on with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Issues like this should be dealt with by giving considerably 
more attention to detail.  I commend the member who just spoke. 
He was talking, particularly toward the end of his speech, about 
the government taking timid steps in the right direction but 
perhaps not doing enough.  Would he like to enlarge on some of 
his ideas with respect to money laundering and the curtailing of 
criminal activity in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As precisely as possible, what further and stronger measures 
would he propose to prevent Canada from becoming a haven for 
money laundering activities by criminal organizations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for Elk Island, a colleague of mine on the House of Commons 
finance committee, for his intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we should not underestimate the importance of resources. 
We must make an adequate commitment of resources to our law 
enforcement agencies in this regard.  The task at hand has grown 
exponentially more complicated and difficult.  Yet there has been 
no commensurate increase in resources to deal with it.  In a 
general sense the resources must be committed.  They have not 
been to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, in a more specific sense we must work with the very best 
technologies available to deal with the problem.  Clearly these 
are technologically driven problems.  The challenge is to ensure 
we have the tools to effectively deal with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we need greater interaction and engagement with the 
private sector agencies that will ultimately be acting on the 
enforcement side.  There should be engagement with the Canadian 
financial services sector.  Such engagement should take place 
while the measures are being put together and not after the fact. 
It should ensure the sector's commitment is a realistic one, not 
one imposed by a government with little understanding of the 
logistics of enforcement at the grassroots financial services 
sector level.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague opposite for his comments but point out that this is 
the second time I have been up in less than half an hour.  It is 
not true that we are not participating in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank him for raising the good point that three bills have 
started in the Senate.  In a bicameral system every bill must go 
through both houses.  If all bills started in the Senate the 
House of Commons would sit around for a week with nothing to do 
until something was passed, and vice versa if they all started 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for congratulating those who brought 
forward the improvement of splitting bills so that both houses 
could work on them.  If the Senate could remove some of the fine 
details in its extensive committee consultations we would not 
have to worry about them and would have an even better bill when 
we got it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have never heard a more 
eloquent plea from a member on the Liberal side for a seat in the 
Senate.  I suggest he make that plea on an individual basis to 
the Prime Minister.  I wish him luck in his quest for a 
senatorial appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member that a significant amount of valuable 
work is done in the other place on legislation like this one. 
This House, the lower House, benefits from the work of many of 
our senators, particularly at the committee level where there is 
a significant level of expertise and talent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am especially grateful to have the full attention 
of the government House leader.  The Canadian Alliance, as my 
colleague has indicated, will support Bill S-16 which comes to us 
essentially as legislative amendments the Senate has sought to 
Bill S-22.  I echo the concern of my colleague from Elk Island 
about the growing practice under the current government of 
initiating legislation in the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I would also highlight that Senate committees, in 
particular the Senate banking committee in this instance, do good 
work.  Frankly they pay more attention to the details of 
legislation of this nature than do some of our own committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deals with the proceeds of crime, otherwise known as 
money laundering.  I rise to make the point as finance critic for 
the opposition that Canada's laws with respect to proceeds of 
crime are unfortunately not as robust as they ought to be.  Other 
jurisdictions have taken far more significant legislative steps 
to plug loopholes which allow those who benefit from proceeds of 
crime to secrete assets in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also second the remarks of my colleague from Kings—Hants who 
pointed out that although we have a legislative framework to deal 
with the proceeds of crime, we do not provide nearly sufficient 
resources to law enforcement agencies to enforce the laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, the proceeds of crimes division or white collar 
crime division of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is 
constrained by quite finite resources.  This means major 
fraudsters have pretty significant resources at their disposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people benefit from tens, sometimes hundreds of millions 
of dollars of defrauded moneys and assets.  They can afford the 
very best legal advice, lawyers, financial advice and accountants 
to hide their illegally gained assets and launder them so they 
become ostensibly legal funds.  This is because police simply do 
not have sufficient resources to combat the problem on a large 
scale in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, victims of commercial crime increasingly are 
turning to lawyers to pursue civil remedies.  That is a concern. 
I want to raise in the debate the need to consider giving, 
through our laws, greater latitude to victims of fraud to pursue 
civil remedies in court.  In many Canadian jurisdictions it is 
difficult, if not impossible, for victims of fraud to 
collectively pursue so-called class action cases against 
fraudsters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal framework in the United States allows for fairly 
robust civil remedies.  For instance, when a telemarketing scam 
defrauds thousands of American seniors, they can put together a 
class action suit.  They can find and hire skilled lawyers to 
investigate, track laundered assets, seek and in many instances 
obtain judgments against fraudsters, and restore defrauded moneys 
to the people to whom they rightfully belong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many Canadian jurisdictions similar remedies are not 
available.  Individual victims of fraud are not able to 
collectively pool their resources and pursue legal remedies.  In 
Canada police do not have the resources or advanced legal 
expertise to pursue money laundering cases, and affected 
individuals cannot collectively join together to finance the 
expensive investigatory and legal work required to pursue these 
cases.  I raise this as an important point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to join growing international efforts to stamp out money 
laundering.  Literally billions of dollars are laundered in and 
through the Canadian economy every year.  Multiple billions of 
dollars of assets in Canada belong to criminals indirectly and 
are controlled by criminals.  Our police forces do not have the 
resources or expertise to fully trace the laundering process and 
restore justice to victims of fraudulent activity.  Our legal 
framework limits the remedies available to those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise this as a matter of concern.  I invite the government to 
revisit the issue in a broader perspective to find out how we can 
amend laws to be more clearly in compliance with the growing 
international intolerance of money laundering.  I invite the 
government to find out how we can give more powerful civil 
remedies to victims of fraud.  Finally, I invite the government 
to find out how we can better equip the RCMP and other police 
services across the country to plug loopholes, track down 
fraudulent and laundered assets and enforce the law to protect 
the tens of thousands of Canadians who are the unwitting victims 
of fraudulent scams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the government to consider all these things.  However 
we in the Canadian Alliance Party will be supporting the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (for Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada)</B> moved that Bill C-24, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code (organized crime and law enforcement) and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, be read the third time 
and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to speak 
on third reading of this very important bill, Bill C-24.  The 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights has reported the 
bill to us with only a few changes.  The bill deserves to be sent 
to the Senate without delay.  We know that police and prosecutors 
need better tools to fight organized crime and criminal gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is important because fighting organized crime is a key 
part of ensuring safer communities and that is why the government 
tabled the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the actions of organized criminals are felt across 
the country and around the world.  They are at the heart of 
serious social problems like illegal drug use and organized 
prostitution.  Telemarketing, Internet and credit card fraud cost 
victims thousands and sometimes tens of thousands of dollars, and 
stolen cars from Canadian communities end up around the world to 
feed illegal markets.  Sometimes the costs are not obvious but 
the impacts and costs are real and they often can be very 
significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the new definition of a criminal organization in the 
bill targets those who seek “material benefit, including a 
financial benefit”, through crime.  These new provisions would 
allow police and prosecutors to target the professional criminal 
at the heart of so many of the criminal problems that we face. In 
addition, the three new offences in the bill related to the 
criminal organizations would further help us to focus on those 
who lead gangs, those who participate in offences to benefit 
criminal organizations and those who participate in order to 
enhance the criminal organization's ability such as recruiting 
youth or others into gang activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These tools are what the RCMP, other police forces and 
provincial governments have told us that they need to deal with 
the organized crime problem today and in the future.  The 
provisions on intimidation are very important for Canadians and 
for the health of our institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Intimidation of witnesses and jurors and criminal justice 
officials can threaten the integrity of the criminal justice 
process.  Likewise we are all aware that parliamentarians and 
other legislators can be subject to intimidation.  This is 
unacceptable in this democratic society.  The new offence of 
intimidation of a criminal justice system participant would help 
us address this threat and take firm action against those who 
would seek to undermine our institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee did amend the bill to include journalists 
in these provisions. This is very appropriate.  The media are a 
very important part of the democratic process and public debate 
free of intimidation is crucial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to note the importance of the provisions in the 
bill regarding proceeds of crime.  Right now there are a number 
of offences in which illegal profits can be seized by police and 
ordered forfeited by courts, like drug trafficking or murder.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also expands the range of offences to include almost 
all indictable offences.  This would mean that police could take 
away the proceeds of crime from criminals more effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of protection from criminal liability for law 
enforcement officers, the bill would put in place important new 
provisions to provide for limited justification for law 
enforcement officers.  It would allow designated officers, under 
strict conditions, to perform for the purposes of investigations 
acts and omissions that would otherwise be offences.  The supreme 
court has recognized that officers operating in good faith may 
need to have such powers.  It also recognized that it is up to 
parliament to provide for them.  That is exactly what we do in 
Bill C-24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the committee hearings on the bill we heard from police 
and other witnesses on the need for these provisions.  Since the 
supreme court's decision two years ago, many investigations have 
been affected.  It has been felt most strongly in complex 
undercover operations against organized crimes.  A number of the 
operations have had to be suspended, modified or stopped 
entirely, but the effect of the decision has not been limited to 
organized crime investigations.  It also has affected other 
operations such as law enforcement purchases of contraband 
tobacco and alcohol and counterfeit currency in order to gather 
evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Few would dispute that enforcement officers should have the 
power to gather this kind of evidence, but the statutory 
authority must be put in place.  Also, there are serious crimes 
outside the area of organized crime where these powers are 
needed.  Investigations in areas like murder and kidnapping 
sometimes require undercover operations where officers must gain 
the confidence of their targets before making arrests and 
bringing an operation to an end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need for the limited justification for the police has been 
well established, but the debate on how it should be put in place 
has been useful and important.  One of the main issues has 
involved the question of judicial authorization.  It was rightly 
pointed out that certain law enforcement powers, like wiretapping 
and search provisions, require judicial authorization.  However, 
it is not appropriate for this law enforcement justification 
system. That was made clear during the standing committee 
proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike wiretapping and searches, this system does not involve 
precisely defined police actions that can workably be made 
subject to prior judicial authorization.  As well, the broad 
nature of decisions about police operations that a judge would be 
asked to make during the investigations themselves would lead to 
inappropriate judicial involvement in investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important question also raised was whether the limited 
law enforcement justification should be restricted to 
investigations of organized crime.  The effect of the supreme 
court decision has not been limited to organized crime 
investigations.  An appropriate system must recognize this and 
provide for the full scope of activities where the justification 
is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the concern about these powers being used for minor 
operations is understandable.  The concern is addressed in the 
bill.  A fundamental requirement of the bill is that the use of 
the law enforcement justification must satisfy a condition that 
the conduct is “reasonable and proportional” in the 
circumstances.  Enforcement officers would weigh matters like the 
nature of the act or omission that would otherwise be an offence, 
the nature of the investigation and the reasonable availability 
of other means for carrying out of duties.  Failure to respect 
this requirement would be serious.  The justification would no 
longer apply and officers may be subject to criminal liability in 
the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other safeguards in the bill.  First and foremost 
is the role of ministers responsible for policing in designating 
those who are eligible for the law enforcement justification. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As solicitor general, I will be responsible for designating 
members of the RCMP.  This role would provide an important 
measure of control and accountability.  The designations will be 
based on the advice of senior law enforcement officials and 
reviewed with them before they are made.  They may be subject to 
specific conditions.  If designations are misused, they will be 
taken away.  I should also stress that the bill is clear that 
this role would not involve ministers in individual 
investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still more safeguards under the bill include:  the exclusion of 
certain types of conduct such as causing bodily harm, sexual 
offences, or the obstruction of justice; the provision for a 
public annual report; and the requirement to notify persons whose 
property may be lost or seriously damaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, if the enforcement officers step outside the 
condition of the provisions, they would be subject to criminal 
liability in the courts.  Officers would remain subject to 
internal discipline for unprofessional behaviour or other 
misconduct and public complaint mechanisms would continue to 
apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New provisions added by the committee include:  specific 
examples of conditions that ministers might apply; clarification 
of the requirements on the police agents under the system; and 
the requirement for a parliamentary review after three years. 
The government supports these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law enforcement justification under Bill C-24 is not a blank 
cheque for law enforcement officers, far from it.  It is a 
balanced system with strict limits and conditions.  It responds 
to very real and substantial law enforcement needs.  Together 
with the other provisions on criminal organizations, intimidation 
and proceeds of crime, the bill represents a major step forward 
in the public safety agenda.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to do something that does not 
happen very often, at least for me, and that is to praise a 
government bill.  I am actually surprised that Liberals would do 
the right thing on this issue.  I know it was very difficult for 
them given the fact that in committee most of the Liberals had 
trouble supporting the bill.  In fact, in committee the Canadian 
Alliance had to encourage them to do the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see that the Solicitor General of Canada and the 
Minister of Justice have brought the bill forward and have, I 
think, moved in the right direction.  I would like to thank the 
minister for bringing forward this bill as well as the members 
who have worked so hard to get this vital legislation before the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both government and opposition members have taken the proposed 
legislation very seriously during the course of debate in 
committee work and I am relatively satisfied with what has been 
accomplished here to date.  At long last we have legislation that 
gives the police many of the tools they have been asking for and, 
I might add, not simply because the police have been asking for 
it.  I believe that they have been asking for these tools for 
solid public policy reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have known for years now that our law enforcement officials 
are at a severe disadvantage in their efforts to combat organized 
crime.  We know that sophisticated criminal organizations have 
access to virtually unlimited resources, state of the art 
technology and unlimited funds, all derived from their illegal 
activities, while our police forces are barely getting by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the solicitor general indicated that this was not a blank 
cheque for the police, it would have been nice of him to say at 
least that it would have been a bigger cheque in order to fund 
some of these operations.  I do not think the police forces 
expect a blank cheque in terms of either the legislation or the 
funding, but I think an increase in the amount of money available 
to conduct this very worthwhile endeavour is of course necessary. 
Frontline officers feel that they are fighting a battle without 
ammunition.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-24 is in many ways a long overdue response to a number of 
concerns raised over the years by federal, provincial and 
municipal law enforcement officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My praise is not entirely unqualified.  Bill C-24 is a great 
step forward but we must not close the book on this issue.  We 
must continue to ask ourselves as elected representatives what we 
can do to ensure that our law enforcement officials have the 
necessary tools for keeping Canadians safe and secure in an ever 
changing world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recognize that police power must be exercised for the 
common good of the public.  Police power is certainly a very 
important one not simply for itself but for of us to enable 
society to proceed and to develop in an orderly fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I echo the comments of RCMP Commissioner Zaccardelli who said 
that Bill C-24 was a work in progress.  He said that many of the 
amendments in Bill C-24 were absolutely critical, but he hoped 
for more work in this area.  He hoped that we as parliamentarians 
would keep the radar screen alive.  The commissioner is all too 
aware of the ever changing nature of organized crime and that 
these kinds of criminals always seem to be two or three steps 
ahead of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond the very real need to continue our legislative work in 
the area of our justice system I have to say, as I alluded to 
earlier, that I continue to be disappointed with the level of 
funding that the government has provided to fight organized 
crime.  Given the fact that a relatively simple prosecution under 
legislation like this could cost up to $10 million or more, the 
$200 million over five years the minister has announced is really 
a small amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems strange to say that $200 million is a small amount of 
money, but when we look at each individual case and the costs 
involved, it is a staggering amount.  I have had experience in 
the provincial sphere of being responsible for the costs and the 
administration of those types of cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must make the money available for our police.  If we do not, 
it does not matter how good the legislation is or how good our 
intentions are.  If organized crime realizes that frontline 
police officers do not have the necessary funding in place, all 
of this is for naught, and that would be a disappointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During committee testimony on May 10, Toronto city police Chief 
Fantino and Winnipeg police Chief Jack Ewatski both indicated 
that the new funding they were to receive was insufficient. Chief 
Fantino said he felt totally inadequate in his ability to direct 
resources away from the day to day pressing issues he had to 
contend with.  He stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have any direct federal funding to help me dedicate the 
necessary resources to sustain the very labour-intensive, 
difficult work that has to be done in this area to the extent 
that we should. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to wonder about the $100 million we are putting into a 
failed long gun registry.  Everybody has acknowledged that the 
long gun registry has failed.  It is not doing the job and it 
will never do it.  Yet through blind political allegiance to a 
failed idea the Liberal government continues to pump $100 million 
into a registry that has not worked and will not work.  The only 
thing it is doing is destroying the hunting industry and the 
tourism industry in my area.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand it.  If we gave that $100 million to 
frontline police officers and asked them if they could do better 
than the long gun registry, there would not be a police officer 
or even a police chief who paid lip service to the long gun 
registry who would not say, given that choice, that they would 
put it into frontline policing.  Why?  It is because every police 
officer in the country cares about reducing crime and is not 
concerned about a failed political agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Directing resources into very complex investigations often puts 
tremendous pressure on routine policing operations.  Our 
frontline police officers are saying that they feel like beggars 
trying to find the resources to do the things of national 
priority.  Because of the lack of resources our municipal forces 
may not be able to support additional investigations regardless 
of the legislation we pass today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the minister and the solicitor general to take a look at 
areas where we can find existing funding that is not being used 
appropriately.  If we want to find $100 million today, we can 
find it in the failed long gun registry which is making criminals 
of ordinary hunters and farmers and destroying tourism and other 
industries in constituencies such as mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the minister not listen?  Why will the minister not do 
anything?  The answer is simple.  The minister would rather spend 
$100 million a year than face the political embarrassment of 
saying that they have made a mistake and have to find a policy 
that will stop criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a fair amount of public debate on certain aspects 
of the legislation, particularly in the area of the immunity 
provisions for peace officers.  I should like to discuss that 
briefly because it is a very important topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would not give police officers any additional 
rights that they did not enjoy over the last 100 years or so. 
They always assumed that they had a measure of protection when 
conducting investigations where in certain situations they were 
called upon to break the law.  That is a very difficult thing for 
a police officer or anyone to do.  Yet it was a necessary aspect 
of carrying out some very delicate operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police chiefs and crown prosecutors knew about it.  It was 
accepted.  It was done in the vast majority of cases in a 
responsible manner because police officers knew of their 
responsibilities to our citizens.  Crown attorneys and police 
chiefs who supervised police officers understood it was necessary 
but uncomfortable, given the fact that it was a breaking of the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the legislation sets out in statutory form with clear 
criteria the conditions under which this may occur.  This is not 
granting police officers new powers or new steps that they did 
not exercise before.  It simply is a response to the Supreme 
Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those concerned about constitutional issues, if one looks at 
the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada and the legislation 
in place, I do not think the Supreme Court of Canada was asking 
that there be any pre-authorization by judicial figures in this 
matter.  It simply said that police officers do not enjoy an 
immunity in respect of these matters.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we as a society expect police forces to do the necessary 
things on our behalf, we must give them legal sanction to do it. 
I liken it a bit to war because when we are dealing with crime we 
are at war.  In the context of war, our soldiers must do things 
that would not be otherwise acceptable in society.  Our soldiers 
kill on behalf of our country when it is necessary for them to do 
so.  All of us regret the killing and no one believes that 
killing is good.  Yet as a civilized society we understand that 
at times it will occur and we give police officers that 
legislated common law immunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the very same way we are giving our police officers that 
immunity, but that immunity is very clearly defined and closely 
supervised.  It complies in every respect with the concerns of 
the Supreme Court of Canada in its judgment in Campbell and 
Shirose.  Given the nature of undercover operations and general 
policing activities, this immunity is essential in continued 
efforts in our war against crime and organized crime in 
particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite initial misgivings many concerned people, including a 
number of committee members and witnesses, ultimately expressed 
support for these provisions in Bill C-24.  Provincial and 
municipal leaders and law enforcement officials alike have 
recognized that there may be concerns regarding the potential for 
abuse of these powers that could harm innocent third parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in light of the fact that criminal organizations have 
increased in sophistication to such a degree that police cannot 
keep up with them, there is a general consensus that police must 
have the ability to conduct undercover operations and reverse 
sting operations to make a significant impact in this area. Later 
I will talk about innocent third parties because it is an 
important issue that the bill overlooks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After careful consideration of the provisions in Bill C-24 
members of the committee as well as a number of witnesses decided 
that these concessions were necessary to allow police to carry 
out its duties effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation is not always a precise art.  I recognize the 
difficulties the minister had in weighing some of the concerns on 
both sides of the issue.  I am satisfied the minister has been 
reasonably prudent and careful in ensuring appropriate checks and 
balances are provided in the legislation to protect the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time these protections are not so overly restrictive 
that they would impede police investigations.  They would also 
provide police protection from prosecution in very specific and 
carefully delineated circumstances.  I put on record that there 
are only clearly delineated circumstances where this authority 
can be exercised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately by supporting these provisions we have respected the 
decisions made by justice department officials who have reviewed 
the law, who have considered the Supreme Court of Canada decision 
in Campbell and Shirose, who have dealt with police officers on a 
day to day basis over the years, and who have listened to the 
provincial attorneys general across Canada that are on the 
frontline of fighting crime.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, should these provisions require improvement, an 
amendment was passed in committee that would provide yet another 
check.  With this amendment parliament would now conduct a 
mandatory review of the sections in the criminal code dealing 
with these provisions every three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three year time frame is appropriate and prudent.  If any 
concerns arise in the operation of this bill, and I certainly 
hope that is not the case at least in respect of substantive 
concerns, in three years we will be here to review the matter and 
make appropriate corrections.  We should not leave it for the 
next group of members to fix any problems that might arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While many of us recognize that the legislation may not be 
perfect, our support for these provisions stems from the fact 
that the safety and security of Canadians continues to be a 
considerable risk as a result of criminal activity, and citizens 
want protection by our police who they understand must be 
governed by reasonable laws and reasonable conditions.  Generally 
speaking, the bill reflects that reasonableness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also pleased to see that the minister took the suggestion 
from the Canadian Alliance to include provincial leaders in the 
list of justice system participants, thereby extending to them 
additional protection against intimidation from criminal 
organizations.  That protection must be recognized given that 
they, even much more than many of us, are involved in the front 
lines of fighting organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister took this one step further and added municipal 
leaders to the list, and I commend her for that initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank my colleague from the Bloc from 
Berthier—Montcalm who brought forth an amendment to extend this 
protection to journalists as well.  We are all aware of the 
important role that journalists play in our society.  They are 
fundamental to free speech in a democratic society and as a part 
of the exercise of free speech, they are engaged in the fight 
against organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a number of recent cases demonstrate, journalists who serve 
the public interest by reporting on organized crime are very much 
in need of and deserve enhanced protection under our criminal 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to briefly deal with the concern that I raised in 
committee and which, unfortunately, the committee voted against. 
I introduced an amendment that would have ensured the right for 
innocent third parties to sue for damages that were caused by a 
peace officer carrying out his or her duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was disappointed that the amendment was defeated, since it was 
a very worthwhile amendment that deserved our consideration. The 
main thrust of the amendment was that a private, law-abiding 
citizen should not be penalized if his or her property was 
destroyed in the course of a police investigation or action, even 
when the police were acting in the context of the authority of 
this proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the members in committee said that it was a matter for 
provincial rights because they dealt with civil property and 
civil rights under section 92 of the Canada Act, 1867.  That is 
not entirely correct.  What in fact we may be doing is granting 
an immunity from civil process by this section.  I simply wanted 
that amendment, given the priority of criminal law when it comes 
into conflict with the property and civil rights, as a matter of 
clarification so every that judge was assured that this 
legislation would not interfere with property and civil rights 
and that the innocent third parties would still have the right to 
sue where their property was damaged.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we expect our citizens to co-operate in this fight, the least 
we can do is compensate them for any damage that they might 
suffer as a result of police actions.  Although the amendment was 
not supported in committee, it is an important issue to consider 
for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a very important step forward, but I express the 
concern that there is a lack of funding.  I hope the justice 
minister will ask her colleagues to consider allocating to our 
police forces and to frontline police officers, the funding they 
so desperately need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly hope she will be open to consider future amendments 
to the criminal code that will further streamline our justice 
system.  We have made great gains with Bill C-24 but we must not 
become complacent.  We need to continually revisit this issue in 
order to combat organized crime effectively at a national level 
and to offer all Canadians the greatest possible protection from 
this kind of criminal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to stress that this bill is an example where all 
parties in the House can move together.  Yes, we might disagree 
on certain aspects, but I think that the disagreements were 
relatively minor.  What I appreciated about dealing with this 
bill was that I did not feel that there was an underlying 
political agenda to embarrass one political party or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the minister would take the goodwill she has earned and 
the good work she has done on the bill and turn that goodwill and 
that good work to Bill C-15, where I think the most crass Liberal 
politics is at work.  That is very unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members have placed together child protection laws, 
firearms long gun registry laws and treatment of animal laws into 
one bill.  Of course we know what the politics behind it are. 
They want us as opposition members to vote against the bill, then 
they will come into my riding and say that I did not like 
children, or that I did not want the protection for children, or 
that I did not want police officers to have additional protection 
and therefore I voted against the disarming of police officer 
section, or that I did not want to see an increase for penalties 
for home invasion so I voted against the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact government members know what the truth is.  They knew 
that we could not support amendments to the gun registry, which 
is sending $100 million a year literally down the toilet.  That 
and that is why they put it all into one bill.  They knew that 
people in my riding, hard-working farmers and those involved in 
the animal husbandry industry, in food production, in livestock 
and otherwise, had legitimate concerns about the treatment of 
animals laws.  What did they do to avoid discussion?   They put 
it all into one bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I ask my colleagues to vote for the bill, because we want to 
protect children, or we want to create an offence of home 
invasion or at least increase the penalties in that respect, then 
they will go to my constituents and say that I flip-flopped on 
Bill C-68 and now voted for provisions of long gun registry. They 
may say that I do not care about the livestock industry because I 
voted for the treatment of animal sections that may imperil their 
livelihood.

their livelihood in respect of tourism.  Political pride, nothing 
less, prevents the government from standing up and saying it made 
a mistake and can we work together to fix that problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the members opposite to know that on Bill C-15, I am 
prepared to work in the same open way that members of the 
opposition, regardless of party, worked to get Bill C-24 through 
to protect our people.  I would be willing to do that with Bill 
C-15.  Why will Liberals not do it?  Political pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the minister to reconsider her position, look at the 
good she has done here, take that good and put it to use in terms 
of the political mileage she has gained now on this bill and do 
the right thing, which is split Bill C-15.

2001, and which have recently been returned from committee 
studies and are to be concurred in tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point of order concerns an irregularity with the estimates. 
I have an interest in ensuring that parliament retains its power 
over the public purse.  This power has been eroded over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer you to the remarks of Madam Speaker Sauvé on June 12, 
1981, at page 10546 of <I>Hansard</I>, when she said “it matters 
not whether the amount spent is a large sum or simply one 
dollar”.  The issue is whether parliamentary process is properly 
being followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaker Lamoureux properly stated on March 26, 1974, at page 896 
of <I>Hansard</I> that “Parliament cannot legislate by

March 22, 1977: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the government receives from Parliament the authority to act 
through the passage of legislation and receives the money to 
finance such authorized action through the passage by parliament 
of an appropriations act.  A supply item in my opinion ought not, 
therefore, to be used to obtain authority, which is a proper 
subject of legislation. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marleau and Montpetit made note of this on page 735 at note 223. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there is a prima facie case where an estimate this 
year should be ruled out of order.  I am bringing this matter to 
your attention at this time because your predecessors, Speakers 
Jerome and Sauvé, have indicated that such points of order be 
brought up on the next to last allotted day of a supply period. 
This is noted in Marleau and Montpetit, at page 735, note 221. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring to your attention, Mr. Speaker, specifically to National 
Defence, Vote 1, and the creation of Parc Downsview Park Inc. and 
to the report of the auditor general of October 2000, chapter 17, 
pages 18 to 21. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its 1994 budget, the government announced the closure of 
Canadian Forces Base Toronto at Downsview.  In its place, 
Downsview was to be held in perpetuity as a unique urban 
recreational green space for the enjoyment of future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for the project to go ahead, the government has first, 
issued an order in council authorizing Canada Lands Company 
Limited to incorporate a new crown corporation, Parc Downsview 
Park Inc. as a subsidiary of Canada Lands Company Limited, 
pursuant to paragraph 91(1)(a) of the Financial Administration 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it has transferred control and responsibility, as well 
as the benefits from management of the Downsview lands, from 
national defence to Canada Lands Company Limited and subsequently 
to Parc Downsview Park Inc. under a management agreement with 
national defence, while national defence continues to hold title 
to the lands.

Park Inc. pursuant to paragraph 16(1)(a) of the Federal Real 
Property Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I draw your attention to page 17-19, paragraph 
17.58, of the October 2000 report of the auditor general, which 
was tabled in the House on October 17, 2000, wherein the auditor 
general specifically states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentary authority was not sought for any of the above-noted 
activities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The litany of the government's failure to recognize parliament 
continues.  The auditor general said in the same report that “no 
parliamentary approval to spend funds on the Park” was sought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August 1999, the treasury board approved the first transfer 
of land for commercial development and acknowledged that 
Downsview Park would not be in a position to pay anything for the 
land for “decades”.  Normally the government acquires lands to 
meet its needs and to deliver a program, such as national 
defence.  When the land is no longer needed for program purposes 
it is declared surplus and is sold.  The proceeds from the sale 
are returned to the consolidated revenue fund.  Parliament then 
votes on its program priorities and appropriates money from the 
consolidated revenue fund through the estimates process.  This 
process is intended to ensure that spending of public money is 
authorized by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Downsview Park the government has in substance 
transferred assets to another entity and, by developing these 
assets, would have proceeds available to fund new program 
activities without parliamentary approval.  Parliament has not 
been asked to appropriate funds for development of the park and 
for park activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During 1999-2000, national defence spent approximately $4.8 
million for Downsview Park operations and development, which of 
course, we will remember, is under a subsidiary of Canada Lands. 
It expects to spend $4.5 million annually on Downsview Park for 
the next three years.  To date, these expenditures have been 
charged to national defence's Vote 1, which parliament has 
authorized to be used for the department's operating 
expenditures, not for Canada Lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the view of the auditor general, the expenditures related to 
the development of the Downsview Park site, approximately $2 
million of the $4.8 million, are not a valid charge against 
national defence Vote 1.  The Department of National Defence 
should clearly not be funding Downsview Park from its operating 
expenditures.  If the government wants to develop and operate 
Parc Downsview Park, it should introduce legislation accordingly, 
then seek the appropriate funding through the estimates rather 
than through national defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that I am not opposed to spending for 
our hard working men and women in the Canadian forces in the 
Department of National Defence.  In fact, I support increasing 
their funding.  However, we have a case where parliamentary 
approval has not been sought for expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I wish I could ask you to only rule the money in 
Vote 1 for Downsview Park out of order, but I cannot.  I can only 
ask that you rule the vote out of order in its entirety even if 
one dollar has been spent without proper parliamentary approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am asking you to send a message to the government 
that such methods of deception are not acceptable. 
Parliament is supreme and its authority has to be respected.

matter to parliament's attention that we will be voting on the 
main estimates.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, using the criteria 
established by previous Speakers on several occasions, which I 
quoted from earlier, and with the information provided by the 
auditor general, I am asking you to strike the national defence 
Vote 1 from the estimates and the subsequent supply bill, since 
it is clear that millions of dollars are not a valid charge 
against the public purse, the national defence, and are not in 
order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, certainly I had no notice of this coming forward, but I 
am speaking in the context of being a former minister of national 
defence who oversaw the dissolution of the Canadian forces base 
at Downsview and also the minister with geographic responsibility 
for the greater Toronto area, where I and the current minister of 
defence sort of share shepherding responsibilities for Downsview 
Park-Parc Downsview. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the point made by the hon. member is very specious 
in the main.  First, when we closed those bases, in particular 
Downsview, we said that the land would be retained in perpetuity 
for future generations, primarily as a unique, open, recreational 
green space.  The reason we put primarily in there is that other 
ongoing uses would still be permitted, for example, national 
defence still has housing on that site and there is now an 
armoury that has been announced by my colleague the Minister of 
National Defence, as well as other activities.  It was always 
intended for that portion of land to remain in the title of 
national defence so that if, God forbid, we were in an emergency 
situation whereby that land would be required for emergency 
defence operations, it would be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  You didn't say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The Chair is 
listening to a very substantive intervention.  The House heard 
uninterruptedly from the hon. member for St. Albert and I am sure 
the same courtesy will be extended to the Minister of Transport 
and other members who might choose to make an intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Collenette:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not purport to 
have all the references that the hon. member for St. Albert has, 
but as a parliamentarian of longstanding I can state that if a 
financial matter comes before the House in the budget and if it 
is passed, as the 1994 budget was, whether it is a taxation 
measure or whether it is the measure under discussion, that 
legitimizes the particular expenditure.  It legitimizes the 
particular use that was called for in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit that, first, it is entirely appropriate that 
national defence retain ownership of those lands, and second, 
that it is entirely appropriate for the government, in the view 
that those lands are no longer needed in the short term and 
hopefully in the long term, to make an arrangement with another 
government agency, in effect a contract, to manage those 
properties and that revenues be allocated for that purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about inappropriate transferring of assets 
to another entity.  National defence has not transferred any 
assets.  National defence remains in title in the government and 
has entered into contractual arrangements with Canada Lands, and 
a subsidiary of Canada Lands, Parc Downsview Park, is managing 
this on an ongoing basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was always our intention to try to have other sources of 
revenue.  There was a parcel of land that was subdivided, which 
has been now taken up by one of the box stores.  It was an orphan 
piece of land, as we say, in the southern portion of the runway. 
That was severed and the moneys accrued as per the normal 
procedure of divestiture of the federal government, whereby the 
land went to Canada Lands and was put on the open market.  The 
proceeds went back into Canada Lands for use for the ongoing 
maintenance of the park.  All of this is appropriate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that this is another case, with great respect, where the 
former auditor general erred.  I have another case in my current 
department, on Moncton Airport, where the logic he used is not 
supported by the facts and is creating political expectations 
about the arrangement that was made for the transferring of the 
Moncton airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not attacking the former auditor general, but I am saying 
that no one is perfect, including auditors general.  In the case 
of Moncton airport, my officials have been looking at that and 
will continue to look at it as part of the ongoing lease review 
of the 26 NAS airports on which the government has entered into 
contractual arrangements with local communities for 
administration.  In that case and on the issue of Downsview Park 
and the changes of the Canadian forces base there, he was wrong. 
His logic was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say, Mr. Speaker, with great respect, that I would hope 
you do not find yourself entitled to strike any vote out of these 
estimates for reasons that are highly subjective, will not stand 
up procedurally and will not stand up in terms of parliamentary 
precedents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that nothing could be more germane to the mandate of 
the House than the voting of money and the spending of money. 
That is what the 1994 budget has done.  That is what all 
subsequent budgets have done.  Therefore I would hope that the 
hon. member sees the error of his ways and withdraws his point of 
order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have listened carefully to the minister as well as 
the previous speaker, the mover of this point of order.  I must 
say that of the two arguments I certainly think the hon. member 
for St. Albert has put forward a very credible and very serious 
matter which he has brought to the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak in support of this matter.  The member for 
St. Albert has a very strong reputation as the fiscal thistle. He 
has made a number of very timely and well placed barbs and he 
comes by this name by virtue of his at times very prickly 
approach to some of the frivolous government spending he 
encounters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This matter the minister calls subjective somehow, saying that 
because it has already received scrutiny and has gone through the 
House in a previous budget we should just accept it part and 
parcel because the government at some point passed it with its 
majority will in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not how it works nor, I suggest, are his comments about 
the position taken by the auditor general particularly germane to 
this argument.  The auditor general obviously saw a flaw in the 
process which is very similar to that pointed out by the member 
for St. Albert.  He put forward in his report of 2000 a very 
detailed and, I would suggest, very relevant commentary on the 
Downsview Park Incorporated scenario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact a number of issues arise, but this point of order 
focuses on whether this spending should be legitimized through 
this process, that is to say, the process that has been set up, 
and I think it is the contention of the hon. member from St. 
Albert, is outside the bounds of parliamentary spending.  The way 
in which this money has been manoeuvred within the government 
department is wrong.  The government has not taken these 
particular assets through the normal channels, and in this 
instance we are talking about the value attached to a certain 
piece of property that will be used to incorporate and operate in 
perpetuity a park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is precedent, as was pointed out previously, and I would 
refer the Chair to Beauchesne's 6th edition of <I>Parliamentary 
Rules & Forms</I>.  As the very learned trio of Fraser, Dawson and 
Holtby point out at page 258, notation 937: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The test which items must meet to be included in the Estimates is 
whether or not the government is putting forward a spending 
estimate under authority it already possesses, or whether it is 
really seeking new legislative authority to do something.  It 
makes no difference whether an item attempts to spend a large sum 
or simply one dollar.  The government may not, by the use of an 
Appropriation Act obtain authority it does not have under 
existing legislation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This came from <I>Debates</I> of June 12, 1981.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beauchesne's goes on at 938 to cite: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous amendment of legislation by Appropriation Acts 
cannot justify a repeated use of items in the Estimates to amend 
legislation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the notation at 942 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Asking for money in the Estimates before legislation is passed to 
establish programmes “puts the cart before the horse.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what has happened here.  The government does not 
have the authority to act in this manner.  In fact, I am 
referring to the auditor general's report where he cites at page 
17 under citation 17.67: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Downsview Park, the government has, in substance, 
transferred assets to another entity and, by developing those 
assets, intends to fund new program activities.  Parliament was 
not asked to appropriate funds for development of the park and 
for park activities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That clearly falls within the description and the bounds of what 
was cited in Beauchesne's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to bring to the Chair's attention under the <I>House 
of Commons Procedure and Practice</I> rules, edited by Robert 
Marleau, a very distinguished clerk of the House, and Camille 
Montpetit, at page 733.  I will quote the last paragraph on that 
page.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inclusion of one dollar items in the Estimates also gave rise 
to the issue of using Estimates to “legislate” (i.e., Estimates 
going beyond simply appropriating funds and attempting to obtain 
new legislative authority which would otherwise require separate 
enabling legislation through the regular legislative process, 
outside the Supply procedure). 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is happening here.  There is an attempt through 
this process to circumvent or do an end run around the normal 
spending practices of this place.  That is the rub and that is 
what is contained in the conclusion of the auditor general's 
report where he states at 17.73: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our view, the Government of Canada wishes to set up an urban 
park and invest more than $100 million of public funds therein, 
it should have clear and explicit approval from Parliament to do 
so. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ignore the arguments by the member for St. Albert would allow 
the government to do just that.  If one wants to talk about 
specious and evasive language, one only has to read the 
government's response to the auditor general's commentary in this 
regard.  It is very evasive and dismissive in what the auditor 
general had put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would humbly submit that this is an abuse of process that has 
been brought to the Chair's attention at the appropriate time.  I 
would suggest that it is typical of the government's attitude 
toward parliament to subvert the normal practices and procedures 
when it comes to spending and to other issues.  We see time and 
time again the avoidance of the ever shrinking examination of the 
estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the government may want to go home early, I would 
suggest this is an important issue for the Chair to examine.  We 
cannot avoid our responsibility in that regard.  There has to be 
respect for the opinions of the auditor general here.  There is 
precedent that has been pointed out by previous Speakers Jerome 
and Sauvé. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I encourage you, Mr. Speaker, to accept the prima 
facie case that has been presented to you by the learned and hon. 
member for St. Albert. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we could get into an extensive 
debate on whether items can be introduced by way of the estimates 
process.  There has been debate after debate on that issue going 
back to the creation of VIA Rail and so on, but I do not even 
think it is at issue today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have today is an issue involving the asset.  The asset 
is land.  It is real property.  It is real estate.  There is no 
doubt in anyone's mind that in real estate, if someone is the 
owner of the title, that person owns the property.  As the 
Minister of Transport has said very clearly, the asset still 
remains the property of the Minister of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be arrangements toward the administering of that real 
property by another agency, in this case another agency of the 
crown, not one that was created for this purpose but one that 
already exists, namely Canada Lands Company Limited and, of 
course, one of its subsidiaries, Downsview Park Inc., to look 
after this land.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the fact still remains that if we are dealing with a 
physical asset, that is, real estate, it is the ownership that is 
at issue and the ownership remains and is retained by the 
Department of National Defence, and for good reason.  Those good 
reasons have all been explained by the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that when Mr. Speaker prepares his ruling to that 
effect he will want to inquire as to the ownership of the 
property in question, the asset in question, to use the language 
of the auditor general, and Mr. Speaker will conclude, as we did, 
that the asset is still in the hands of the Department of 
National Defence.  As it was not changed it makes the point that 
was raised today moot.  It no longer has any value because the 
asset was not changed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for St. Albert has raised 
a very serious point.  He is claiming that the government has 
attempted to usurp the authority and responsibility of the House 
and its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, this responsibility of the House 
represents a basic principle of our constitution.  The 
fundamental principle, that the crown has no power to tax except 
by grant of parliament, is to be found even in the Magna Carta. 
The bill of rights of 1689 declares: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Levying money for or to the use of the crown by pretence of 
prerogative without grant of Parliament for longer time or in 
another manner than the same is or shall be granted is illegal. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle that parliament approves expenditures for the 
specific purposes for which they were intended began as far back 
as Charles II and was developed under William and Mary.  As a 
result, we are governed today by rules that make it illegal for 
the executive to make expenditures, except those expenditures 
that are approved by parliament in ways approved by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, we have just had a report from the modernization 
committee suggesting that there are deficiencies in the handling 
of estimates by parliament.  It recognized that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The estimates are an important tool in terms of accountability, 
and the financial control of the House of Commons.  Despite 
numerous procedural changes over the years, we have been unable 
to discover a workable solution. There are many reasons for the 
lack of progress in this area, many of which are attributed to 
our political culture. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This disturbing attempt by the government to erode the influence 
of the Commons in this way represents some of that political 
culture.  While we as members could alter the rules to improve 
the way we consider the estimates, only you, Mr. Speaker, can 
protect our financial privileges from the government's attempt to 
slide through illegal spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I ask you, Mr. Speaker, to take this point of order 
very seriously.  We ask that you protect the ancient 
constitutional right of the Commons to insist on legislative 
authority as a precondition to sanction grants of supply. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thought some information out of the auditor general's 
report for October 2000 might be helpful to you in making your 
decision on this.  I would like to quote a couple of sections 
that are relevant to what the member for St. Albert was objecting 
to from section 17, page 19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 17.63 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Downsview Park was capitalized by $2.9 million of surplus funds 
generated by property management activities at Downsview Park 
base up to 31 March 1999.  Leasing revenues for the next four 
years are expected to exceed $20 million. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 17.64 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Half the land (300 acres) will be used for commercial or 
residential development.  The other 300 acres will be developed 
as a park.  Downsview Park expects that commercial and 
residential development will generate more than $145 million over 
the next 15 years for developing and operating the park. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty clear from the report that the government is in the 
business of land development.  I suggest that is not a role the 
government should have.  This is clearly outside the authority of 
government and it is not acting in the best interests as it 
should be.

order.  There have been consultations among House leaders to 
extend the hours this evening to complete consideration of two 
bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to seek consent to propose a motion to the House 
which was negotiated with House leaders, that any divisions

sit to consider if necessary third reading stage of Bill C-24, as 
well as Bill C-6, that divisions be deemed requested thereon and

that when Bill C-6 is disposed of the House shall adjourn until

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
Bill C-24 is an extremely important bill. 
Earlier, the Canadian Alliance member for Provencher began his 
speech in a manner he says is unusual for him, and expressed 
surprise that the Liberals were doing the right thing on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we must forgive the Canadian Alliance member, because he 
has been in the House only since November 2000 and perhaps does 
not have all the background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the Liberal members decided to take action was 
because there was an opposition party here in the House known as 
the Bloc Quebecois, which decided to press the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1994-95, we have been talking about organized crime, in a 
much more structured way since 1997, and we have never given up, 
because we believed, and we still believe, that the whole issue 
of organized crime is a very important one.  We must do what it 
takes to give our law enforcement officers and the legal system 
all the tools necessary to combat organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has raised this frequently and regularly in 
the House, because there was a special problem in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the real question the member for Provencher should perhaps 
have asked is how it is that it is an opposition party which has 
kept this issue alive all these years, while the federal Liberal 
members from Quebec have never said a thing on the topic, even 
though they are supposed to defend the interests of Quebec.  At 
least, that is what they said during the last election campaign.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the years that we have been questioning the 
government, why is it that we never saw members from Quebec, 
Liberal members opposite, rise in this House and tell the 
Solicitor General of Canada and the Minister of Justice the exact 
same thing that the Bloc Quebecois has been saying, which is that 
we need additional tools within the Criminal Code? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals opposite, the federal Liberals from Quebec, do not 
utter a word in this House. They take their cue from English 
Canada, and in particular the Minister of Justice and the 
Solicitor General of Canada, and if these people say yes, then 
they say yes. But if the people from English Canada do not ask 
questions, you can be sure that the Liberals from Quebec will not 
ask any either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And that is not just on the issue of organized crime. The same 
thing goes for several other bills. However, to stay on the 
subject of justice, let me digress here from a moment to talk 
about the Young Offenders Act. Where were the federal Liberal 
members from Quebec? They were crawling on their knees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how they defend Quebec's interests. They get down on 
their knees and they watch what English Canada does, what the 
justice minister who is from Alberta does, to find out if they 
should get up on their feet or not. They watch the Solicitor 
General of Canada, who is from the Maritimes, to see if they 
should say yes or no. That is how they defend Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that is not how the Bloc Quebecois in the opposition 
sees things. 
It is not true, and it is not the way we saw things with regard 
to the Young Offenders Act. We fought hard and we will keep on 
fighting because it is too important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the way we saw things with regard to organized crime 
either. We did not crawl, we did not grovel on our knees before 
English Canada. We took on that issue and we defended it. We even 
sacrificed opposition days to get members opposite, particularly 
federal Liberals from Quebec who never say a word in this House 
to defend Quebec's interests, to understand that they should 
introduce a bill that would include certain tools in the criminal 
code. We made numerous proposals over a period of several years. 
We asked questions and finally, the government gave us Bill 
C-24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I just gave a brief history of this issue, but I will 
remind members that, with the war that was raging between 
criminal biker gangs in Quebec, with the bombs that were going 
off here and there, this was an issue of great concern to 
everybody, something people read about in the newspapers 
practically every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Innocent people died because of that, people who tried to bypass 
the system somewhat to defend their territory, their vested 
interests as well as democracy. It is indeed a matter of 
democracy when one looks at the influence criminal groups can 
have on a justice system such as ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people died. A young boy named Desrochers lost his life in 
a bomb blast. 
There was also the young owner of a bar in Terrebonne who was 
murdered by organized crime. There were bombings. There was the 
case of journalist Michel Auger, who received threats. Then, 
someone shot him on orders from organized crime. Luckily he 
survived. But this is a very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois tried in every possible way to make the 
government opposite listen to reason. That was the case in 1997. 
I clearly remember that the issue of organized crime was 
discussed during the 1997 election campaign. We raised important 
elements in our election platform to make the government 
understand. We fought throughout the 36th parliament to have 
amendments made. 
It was also true during the last election campaign in 
November 2000, when the Bloc Quebecois put the issue of 
organized crime at the forefront.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were committed to making Ottawa take action. We were 
committed to spending the time and the energy to make the 
government opposite do something and we got Bill B-24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members probably remember that I was pleased when Bill C-24 
was introduced, because it included about 80% of what we had 
been asking for. Some clauses were even taken from a memo that I 
had sent to the Minister of Justice at the time. I have before 
me a note on gangsterism dated June 1, 1999, asking to redefine 
a gang as a group composed of three or more people. 
Simplification was called for because the bill was, to our 
minds, too complex despite the minister's protestations to the 
contrary, that everything was fine and it was just me who 
could not understand any of it.  Now it can be seen that I was 
right in saying it was complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has, I see, finally understood something about this 
matter, and has proposed the amendments I had submitted long 
before Bill C-24 was introduced.  I submitted them to her in 
writing as long ago as June 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly we are in agreement with the main thrust of the bill. 
It is what we wanted, but there are some unanswered questions. 
Time will tell, really, as the legislation is applied, whether 
the government has gone too far or not, whether or not it ought 
to have listened to the opposition as far as granting immunity 
to police officers who commit illegal acts is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I do believe we must give police officers carrying out an 
investigation the permission or legal protection for them to 
commit certain offences with complete impunity.  If we want to 
be able to infiltrate certain groups, to gather evidence, to 
fight organized crime on an even footing, then I believe that in 
a free and democratic society such as ours, we have no choice 
but to confer these powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, however, I am not necessarily in agreement with the 
way it will be done.  Bill C-24 gives the final blessing to the 
solicitor general.  I find it dangerous to have both the 
political and the legal mixed up together in this cocktail that 
allows police officers to commit certain acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I moved amendments in committee and I defended them.  I can say 
that if I had had a little more time, I think I would have 
convinced the government representatives of the dangers of having 
the authorization in the hands of the Solicitor General of 
Canada.  Unfortunately, my amendment was defeated by two votes, 
I think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have preferred, even today, to have the authorization 
given by a judge, who gives the police this immunity to enable 
them to commit offences, just as a judge issues a search warrant 
before proceedings or permits wiretapping, for example.  This 
would have ensured total detachment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have faith in the Quebec and Canadian legal system.  I have 
faith in the judges, who are very well trained, perfectly 
competent and very professional. To my knowledge, as far as 
anyone can remember, there has been no major abuse in the legal 
field as compared with what has happened with the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am working in close co-operation with the police.  I know them 
well and I know they are very professional.  I know they do an 
excellent job, and I have a lot of respect for the work they do. 
Yet, in a big family, such as that of the police, we cannot 
know or keep tabs on all the family members.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the way immunity is given in the bill, abuse is possible. 
In any case, the possibility for it is there, and I can see it. I 
find that dangerous.  This is why I moved the amendments that 
were defeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious we will be closely following all the developments 
and especially the implementation of this bill in daily matters 
along with everything connected with police immunity.  I would 
also have preferred that immunity be given only in cases 
involving organized crime. 
The Barreau du Québec, the Canadian Bar Association, other 
prosecutors and specialists in the field, and the Bloc Quebecois 
find it dangerous that this immunity applies to almost all 
spheres of criminal activity, and not just to organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The title of the bill before me is an act to amend the Criminal 
Code (organized crime).  In reality, Bill C-24 applies to much 
more than just organized crime.  I introduced amendments which 
were rejected, but I would have liked its application to be 
limited to organized crime, so as to limit the potential for 
abuse.  Once again, we will be following the implementation of 
this bill and watching how the solicitor general, with his 
authorizations, and the police enforce the legislation on a daily 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police are delighted with these powers, but I remind them 
that they now have an obligation, but not the means, to produce 
results.  There is zero margin for error. They do not have the 
right to abuse their authority and commit illegal acts.  I do not 
know whether they realize this, but there will be enormous 
pressure on them and many people will be watching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also won a point when the bill was being studied in committee, 
of course.  I would point out, in passing, that the federal 
Liberal members from Quebec did not introduce any amendments. 
Once again, they did not have a thing to say in committee, as 
though there were no members of the government from Quebec.  The 
point that I won concerned protection.  In Bill C-24, members of 
the House of Commons were protected.  That is wonderful.  The 
senators in the other place were protected.  Fine.  However, I 
wonder why organized crime would want to infiltrate the Senate. I 
do not know whether anyone can draw me a picture that would help 
but, in any event, the bill protected them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But members of the Quebec national assembly and of any other 
legislative assembly were not protected. Nor were city 
councillors. Yet, we are well aware that, because of zoning, 
anti-bunker and other types of bylaws, organized crime can exert 
a great deal of pressure on these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Journalists were not protected either, even though we had a 
striking example in the case of Michel Auger, from the <I>Journal 
de Montréal</I>, who was the victim of attempted murder by 
organized crime, because he was reporting on their activities, 
because he had a power, the power of the press, which is an 
extremely important democratic power. The bill was totally 
silent on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not federal Liberal members from Quebec who defended these 
people. They did not say anything. It is the Bloc Quebecois 
which moved amendments in committee and these amendments were 
adopted. 
As was pointed out by the Progressive Conservative member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, who was present when the bill was 
reviewed in committee, I managed to get these amendments 
adopted. How? By asking for a roll call vote and telling those 
federal Liberal members from Quebec who were present “If you 
vote against these amendments I will give your names to the 
media. If these amendments are not adopted it will be because of 
you”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how, in the end, the two Liberal members from Quebec 
found the courage to say yes to my amendments. I had to threaten 
them with giving out their names to the newspapers, otherwise 
they were not going to agree to provide protection to 
journalists. This was not very proper on my part, I know, but it 
was the only way to get this amendment adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased by what I saw later on at report stage in the 
House. The minister moved an amendment to strengthen the 
amendment that I had proposed in committee to protect 
journalists, but that the Liberals had initially rejected. Bravo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say that it took a long time to get the people over there 
to understand this.  Who would have defended Quebec if the Bloc 
Quebecois were not here?  Not the Liberal MPs from Quebec, who 
never say a word in this House.  They always just parrot what a 
minister has said.  That is not what we in Quebec need, and the 
people of Quebec know that very well.  A striking 
example of this is evident in Bill C-24, and an even more 
striking one with the Young Offenders Act.  Quebecers need 
Quebecers to defend them, to represent only the people of Quebec 
in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It takes a Bloc Quebecois member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur: </B>The hon. Liberal member across the way 
says that it takes a Bloc Quebecois member; even he has 
understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also another point on which I do not think we have gone 
far enough. 
We will vote in favour of Bill C-24, but I believe we could go a 
little further.  We are going to monitor how it will be applied, 
we will watch how the police forces and the government are going 
to apply this law.  In due course we will review the situation, 
since we consider it one of our priorities, both before it is 
passed and after as well.  The matter of reversal of burden of 
proof is the aspect relating to the proceeds of crime that we 
believe needs to be taken further.  It is still too easy to get 
around this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many cases I could cite.  For instance, when someone 
declares an income of $13,000 for the previous year and is 
driving around in a Jaguar, frequenting the most chic Montreal 
restaurants almost nightly, and lives in a $350,000 house, I 
think there is something fishy going on.  The law needs to be 
strengthened in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should also amend certain federal laws relating 
to taxation.  As Canada has a police force specializing in 
organized crime, there should be special investigators to enter 
organized crime, investigate and build files.  We do not have 
this at the moment, and millions of dollars are slipping through 
our fingers.  We will study that closely and come back to it if 
the government drags its feet once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not wait for the Liberal members from Quebec.  We know 
they never do anything.  We will take the initiative and continue 
to defend the matter as we have done from the start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the question of financing.  I know the member for 
Provencher, a member of the Canadian Alliance, mentioned this in 
his remarks earlier.  He is right, especially since I put the 
question to the minister. I asked her, “Of the $200 million that 
you say you will make available for the implementation of C-24, 
how many millions of dollars will go to Quebec, because the 
provinces will apply it on a daily basis?  The provinces will be 
going after organized crime.  How many millions of dollars will 
be coming to Quebec?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members know what the answer was?  It is perfectly splendid 
“Zero”.  The $200 million is for the federal government, for the 
machinery. for adjustments, for training, for application 
purposes, not for those working on location.  And yet we know 
that a lot of money is needed there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know because we carried out operation Printemps 2001 in 
Quebec.  We conducted the biggest operation against organized 
crime that Canada has seen. 
I no longer know how many gang leaders and members in good 
standing were arrested, and how many warrants were issued.  I 
think there were about 40 in approximately 77 municipalities. So 
it was quite a large-scale operation.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Operation springtime 2001 alone cost the Quebec treasury around 
$15 million, and that does not include all the future court 
costs.  If close to 50% of all those accused end up behind bars, 
several prisons would have to be adapted, because they could not 
all be incarcerated immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we saw what it cost in terms of adapting court 
houses, conducting trials, and so on.  The costs were enormous. 
The federal contribution needs to be rethought, because no 
funding has been planned for Quebec or the other provinces with 
respect to enforcement of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very important.  We know that enforcement is what will 
make the difference.  Even if we have the best laws in all the 
world, if we are unable to enforce them, if we lack the staff or 
law enforcement officers, where will it leave us?  In the 
wonderful Canadian system in which we live, it is the federal 
government which makes certain laws and the provinces which 
enforce them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that there is something wrong. The federal 
government is the lawmaker and it has money coming out of its 
ears, but it decides to make cuts and to look after its own 
interests. Fine. But we have to see about the implementation of 
the act as such, which is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, what the minister is telling us about funding is not 
reassuring. We will have to check and to monitor this very 
closely to ensure that Quebec, among others, gets the necessary 
funds. This will not be the first issue over which we fight. Indeed, 
the Bloc Quebecois has fought a number of battles to ensure that 
the federal government gives us the money that belongs to us, the 
money owed to the province under certain programs and following 
Ottawa's withdrawal from certain programs, including in the area 
of justice. We fought; we went and got money for Quebec, and we 
will continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not wait for Liberal members from Quebec, because they 
never say anything in the House, they are too afraid to get any 
money. But not us Bloc Quebecois members. We will continue to 
protect Quebec's interests and to go and get the taxes that we 
paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that for us the most important issue 
that is still unresolved is that of making it a crime to merely 
be a member of a criminal gang. This is not in the bill, but I 
still believe in such a clause and the government is making a 
mistake by not taking the Bloc Quebecois up on its proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said so in 1997, when the Minister of Justice brought in 
amendments to the criminal code.  We told her—or rather him, 
since the federal Minister of Justice was a man at that 
time—that it was a mistake.  But he did not heed us.  He had 
indeed made a mistake.  Today we still feel that not making mere 
membership a crime is again an error on the government's part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the whole matter of the Canadian constitution. Is it or 
is it not constitutional to make mere membership in a gang an 
offence?  There is agreement on the definition of a gang as being 
a group of individuals who join together to commit crime and to 
live off the proceeds of crime.  Such a definition naturally 
excludes such groups as the Knights of Columbus, the Daughters of 
Isabelle, the Optimist clubs, the Club Richelieu and so on. Does 
this respect the Canadian constitution or not? I believe that it 
does.  I believe we have everything we need in the Canadian 
constitution to create legislation in this area that respects 
jurisdictions, that respects the Canadian constitution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was my opinion before, continues to be today, and likely 
will be tomorrow as well.  For the worst case scenario, that it 
does not respect the Canadian constitution, we have the 
notwithstanding clause in section 33 and it can be used in such a 
case.  It is not true that the constitution is there to protect 
gangs. It does not do so in Bill C-24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be voting in favour of 
Bill C-24 because it offers additional tools.  It may not be all 
we wanted in such a system, but in large part it reflects what we 
were calling for.  We are going to vote in favour of this bill. 
But it will have to be monitored very closely and we will not 
hesitate in the least to revisit the matter.  We will not 
hesitate to invoke the notwithstanding clause if need be. 
In any case, there are reference procedures.  We could have 
checked the legality or illegality of a bill that used the 
definition of organized crime as we understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government opposite knows about that, since it has already 
used the reference procedure.  The Liberals were a little short 
on guts politically.  They did not go that far.  We will follow 
this.  We will check it and closely follow the laws daily 
application.  We will no doubt be back if certain points are not 
well applied, and the criminals still get away with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that criminal groups are well informed in legal terms. 
They are sometimes said to be better equipped legally than the 
crown prosecutors.  They are obviously going to examine this 
bill and find its weak spots, try to get around it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will follow the law's application.  We will work, as we 
always have, with the police and the justice system and, once 
again, try to bring the issue of organized crime before this 
House.  We will try to convince the minister to go further in 
the procedures we raised with Bill C-24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably, one day or other, the government opposite will tell us 
we were right, as we were right in 1997 to complain about the 
bill it tabled.  One day or other, I am sure, the government will say it 
will have to go further, because the bill does not provide what 
Canada and Quebec need to fight organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, we will be there for the people of Quebec.  We will 
rise, unlike the Liberal members from Quebec, who say nothing in 
this House. 
From this side of the House, we will defend the interests of 
Quebec, because we were elected to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I know my learned friend has contributed 
significantly to this debate.  He brought forward a number of 
good ideas both at the committee and here in the House, some of 
which were embraced and are now encompassed in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party generally supports Bill C-24.  We see 
this as a positive initiative.  We see it as an attempt finally 
by the Liberal government to recognize and put into law 
shortcomings that exist for police officers and law enforcement 
generally across Canada as it relates to this ongoing issue of 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previous speakers have alluded to the numerous attempts made to 
amend the legislation, one of which dealt specifically with the 
special designation or authorization that would be granted by 
virtue of the bill.  That designation, as the Chair knows, would 
allow police officers, in some instances, such as in very 
critical and dangerous circumstances, to engage in activities 
that would otherwise be offences under the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would grant a form of immunity to the police in 
cases where they need to prove their affinity and prove 
themselves to members of organized gangs in order to gain their 
trust so that they might infiltrate that organization and embark 
on an important investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party supports that.  We believe it is a 
necessary evil, in some instances, to allow police to do just 
that.  However, it is the unfettered ability to do that with 
which we are somewhat concerned, and that is the origin of that 
jurisdiction, the origin of that granting of authority.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believed very strongly and moved an amendment to the effect 
that it should come from a judicial authority, as opposed to an 
internal police decision.  That is not to cast aspersions in any 
way on the police or to suggest outright that there would be 
abuse.  It is just to recognize that there are normal practices 
currently in place which pertain to warrants and wiretaps, for 
example, that allow those in a position of judicial authority to 
review the circumstances and make a more impartial, a more 
informed and a more impassioned decision as to who should receive 
that designated authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government in its wisdom does not believe this to be the 
case.  Yet I sense a great deal of unease and discomfort on the 
part of many government members who were part of the committee 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has increasingly become the focus of these very notorious 
gangs within our own borders.  We know that organized crime does 
not recognize or respect borders.  Yet this plague or this cancer 
that exists in our country and around the world is spreading. 
Many organizations have branched out and recently, for lack of a 
better word, set up shop in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my home province of Nova Scotia the Hell's Angels are 
becoming very prominent.  They have opened a clubhouse that in 
terms of its outward appearance has store frontage that would 
rival that of Wal-Mart.  It is that blatant.  They have their 
name up in neon lights.  That is very much the attitude and the 
cockiness that exist within many of the criminal gangs in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many concerns have been ongoing for many years about the 
resources and the state of our laws that create the imbalance 
which allows organized crime to thrive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-24 goes some distance to bringing back some form of 
equilibrium, at least in the ability of police forces to combat 
organized crime, to penetrate the very being of organized crime, 
to gather evidence, to go into the field and to hurt organized 
crime in the same way that it is wreaking havoc in our 
communities. To do so they have to use extraordinary methods at 
times.  That is surely what the legislation is intended to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also clearly a response to the Supreme Court of Canada 
decision in Campbell and Shirose.  The decision was interpreted 
as having struck down many of the previous authorizations in 
police for police to occasionally break the law. The decision 
opened up a chasm, a gaping hole  in terms of the police 
understanding of what was or was not permissible in pursuit of 
organized crime.  Bill C-24 is an attempt to restore some of the 
power and discretion that existed for many years in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is following the trace of authorization to permit this type 
of activity which causes members of the Conservative Party and I 
some concern, as well as members of the bar associations in many 
provinces and others concerned that this type of potential 
invasion of civil liberties is a bit stretched by virtue of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the government would be quick to point out, the level of 
accountability in legislation, at least in terms of the tracing 
the line, goes right to the solicitor general.  Quite 
interestingly, in probably his last speech in the House before he 
trundles off to the other place as a reward for his diligence and 
duty on the part of the Prime Minister, he would be the 
figurehead, the top cop, if the bill were to come into being. 
That causes many to shake in their boots but that is currently 
the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general is supposed to be directly accountable. 
Yet the supposedly personal responsibility which rests with the 
solicitor general's office will not be personal at all when there 
is a cabinet shuffle or when he leaves for an appointment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot be personal.  It is ludicrous to suggest otherwise. 
That is the type of fallacy the bill creates.  If there is to be 
real authorization and real accountability in the legislation, 
there must be judicial oversight, a judicial review of who 
receives this type of designation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concern is shared by many, as I have alluded to, but it is 
one that is particularly prevalent in the province of Quebec. The 
Chair would certainly be aware that on Tuesday, September 12, 
2000, Quebec public security minister, Serge Ménard, urged the 
federal government in some instances to use the notwithstanding 
clause to outlaw membership in gangs such as the Hell's Angels 
and Rock Machine that were a plague to the streets of Montreal 
and other cities in Canada.  In so doing it might anticipate the 
fact that the courts may very well strike down as 
unconstitutional some of the provisions of anti-gang legislation 
and legislation such as Bill C-24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we know that in the city of Toronto, under the 
very able and capable leadership of Chief Julian Fantino, the 
police have assigned a full time team to monitor Hell's Angels 
bikers who have brashly set up clubhouses throughout the city as 
they have in Halifax.  Police are most concerned that Hell's 
Angels might be involved in drugs or arms dealing or taking over 
legitimate businesses for money laundering purposes.  We spoke to 
that previously in debate on legislation before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet organized crime does not exist just in the large cities. 
Hon. members would be quick to recognize that their reach goes 
far beyond our major metropolitan areas.  It is found in small 
towns and villages.  Particularly in rural Canada now more and 
more we are seeing the activities of organized crime.  Ports and 
coastal communities are particularly vulnerable to the 
importation of contraband materials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the House have an obligation to recognize that Canada is 
becoming a target of organized crime.  In so doing we are very 
much committed to bringing forward legislation such as this one 
which arms the police with the tools, the support and the 
resources necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resources do not just entail the concrete types of resources one 
might expect such as computers, firearms on occasion, weaponry, 
cars, surveillance equipment, helicopters and planes.  It also 
includes legislative backup, legislative tools that allow police 
forces to optimize their efforts.  They allow police forces to 
see the fruition of their efforts through the courts and 
prosecutorial system and the eventual incarceration of those who 
engage in illegal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a reference made in previous remarks to the horrible 
shooting that took place in Montreal of <I>Journal de Montreal</I> 
reporter Michel Auger who was shot five times in the back.  It 
was a truly cowardice act.  I think evidence emerged recently to 
suggest that it was very much linked to organized crime, 
particularly motorcycle gangs which Mr. Auger had made the 
subject of many of his articles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the bill now encompasses protection of journalists who 
write about, disclose and pull back the veil of secrecy 
surrounding organized crime.  As I said, criminal gangs are 
branching out.  Any effort that curtails their activity is such 
that we should be supportive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said it is rampant and spreading within Canada, it is 
certainly recognized that it is a world problem.  We have seen 
references to Russian mafia.  Certainly Chinese triads have now 
set up in Canada.  We have references to all sorts of 
organizations from the Middle East that have been active within 
our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a clear indication that Canada has to be competitive and 
to look in some instances for information from other sources 
outside our boundaries.  That again has to be a direction in 
which we are prepared to move, because just as in legitimate 
practices within the economy Canada stands to be left behind if 
we do not keep up the pace and recognize that this is something 
now far beyond our control and far beyond the scope of our 
boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a debate in the House on September 18 initiated by the 
Bloc that I would suggest very much pushed the government toward 
bringing forward useful and positive legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice repeatedly gave assurances throughout 
the debate and on other occasions that efforts were being made to 
break the back of organized crime.  Yet she refused to discuss 
using the notwithstanding clause during the course of the debate 
and conceded that the Liberal government could strengthen the 
anti-gang laws first initiated back in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-24 would do a great deal to achieve some sense of 
hobbling organized crime.  It certainly would not break its back 
but it would strengthen the definition that pertains to what 
comprises an organized gang.  It would target various degrees of 
involvement within the organization, make it easier for police 
and crown prosecutors to arrest and jail gangsters and keep them 
in prison for longer periods of time by extending the range of 
sentencing available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would allow law enforcement agents to forfeit the proceeds of 
crime, use the property to do good work and put those resources 
toward necessary areas.  It would also strengthen the rules 
protecting against intimidation of witnesses, jurors and their 
families in an organized crime trial, a big problem when it comes 
to the successful prosecution of these types of offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, it would strengthen protection for federal members of 
parliament and improve protection for law enforcement officers 
from criminal liability when they commit certain illegal acts 
while engaged in undercover operations to infiltrate criminal 
organizations.  This is the immunity clause of which we spoke 
earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recognition of the non-partisan efforts put forth on the 
committee some very useful amendments were passed.  The record 
will reveal that all who have spoken to the bill have done so in 
a fairly positive and straightforward fashion as to what would be 
accomplished when the bill comes into being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also mention of the amendments moved by other parties 
in attempts to improve and expand upon the status of the 
legislation.  Under the bill the Solicitor General of Canada and 
provincial ministers responsible for policing would release an 
annual report accounting for how often law enforcement agents 
engage in acts which are considered illegal under the current 
criminal code.  That would provide some record and some ability 
to trace at least what actions have occurred, when the immunity 
has been used and for what purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some degree of comfort in knowing there will be an 
after the fact examination of the efforts and acts of police in 
attempts to infiltrate organized crime and invoke on occasion the 
immunity which allows them to commit illegal acts like stealing a 
car and using stolen property.  However there are still 
limitations that speak in particular to offences that might 
involve bodily harm, sexual assault, and certainly murder and the 
use of violence.  The limitations are there.  They are real and 
they exist for a reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment the Conservative Party brought forward, which in 
fairness emulated much of the intent and mirrored the substance 
of the Bloc amendment tabled at the committee, would go back to 
this designation.  Suggesting that somehow it would slow the 
process down by having a judge rather than a police officer or 
superior law enforcement officer make the designation simply does 
not wash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no further delay in having judicial authority in the 
first instance than there would be in having police authority to 
grant the immunity.  There would be a much greater sense of ease 
among many if they knew the designation was coming from a 
judicial authority as opposed to an internal, in shop process 
which allows in the extreme one police officer to designate 
another who would in turn designate him again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support this type of legislation and recognize it as 
something that can be improved upon.  Yet the authorization 
itself is something we would like to revisit at some opportunity. 
I expect we will because we know that the instant the bill comes 
into being there will be challenges before the courts.  Who knows 
what the supreme court would do in its wisdom with this type of 
intervention and designation of authority?

have been moved. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA MORTGAGE AND HOUSING CORPORATION 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the question for debate this evening concerns Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation funding being made available for housing 
projects throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised the question was in relation to Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation being involved with multimillion dollar 
projects such as the one at 1 Post Road.  Even though we know the 
extent of the involvement is only in relation to the mortgage 
insurance, it still sends a message to Canada that the government 
and the agencies that come under it are more concerned with 
housing for the rich and the well-to-do than they are for the 
people who really need housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation signs being 
flashed around in front of large multimillion dollar 
developments, it sends a message to the people who need such 
funding that government is not paying attention to them whether 
it be factual or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of days ago we talked about the housing needs in this 
country.  We talked about the need for housing for the homeless 
and the poor people.  We talked about affordable housing.  There 
are so many avenues to provide housing for those who need it if 
government would only sit down and come up with a plan to address 
the major problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly think wrong messages are being sent.  There is talk 
about a plan to address the housing issue but the conception on 
paper and bringing it into reality are two different things.  We 
do not seem to really understand what we are doing and we do not 
seem to have the heart to do the job that needs to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could help the poor and those in need of affordable housing a 
lot more if we would spend some time concentrating on the major 
problem that we have in front of us and, instead of wasting time 
on foolishness, put some of our energies and efforts into 
addressing the real problems that face the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, let me 
assure the member that the government does not subsidize luxury 
condominium developments.  Mortgage insurance is not a subsidy. 
Mortgage insurance protects approved lenders against losses 
resulting from borrowers defaulting on their mortgages.  The 
lender pays the premium that covers the cost of providing 
insurance coverage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canada's national housing agency, Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation provides access to mortgage financing for all 
Canadians regardless of where they live in Canada.  It provides 
mortgage loan insurance on a wide range of housing types across 
Canada, including condominiums, single family housing, affordable 
rental apartments and retirement homes for seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC's mortgage loan insurance enables Canadians to buy a home 
with as little as 5% down payment.  This insurance has provided 
one in three Canadians with an opportunity to own their own home 
and it has also contributed to the availability of rental housing 
and nursing and retirement home beds in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC is the only mortgage insurer in Canada to offer mortgage 
insurance for the construction of new rental housing and the 
purchase of existing units. 
Insurance is also available on loans for construction of 
multi-unit residential buildings, including rental apartments and 
condominiums.  It also helps make affordable rental housing 
available at lower cost financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want everyone to understand that CMHC operates its mortgage 
insurance on a commercial basis at no cost to the Canadian 
taxpayer.  As members can see, CMHC's mortgage loan insurance 
helps to ensure that low cost financing is available for housing 
purchases all across Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this House 
stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 7.10 p.m.)
