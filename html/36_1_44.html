<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>STANDING COMMITTEE ON INDUSTRY—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I am now prepared to rule on 
the question of privilege raised on Tuesday, November 25, 1997 by 
the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member first raised the matter on October 1, 1997, at 
which time she contended that a preliminary draft report of the 
Standing Committee on Industry was divulged in the last 
Parliament.  In the ruling which I delivered on October 9, 1997, 
I indicated that while this was a matter of considerable 
importance, it did not constitute a breach of privilege. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Tuesday, November 25 the hon. member for Winnipeg North 
Centre presented a letter from House of Commons legal counsel to 
officials at the Department of Industry dated August 25, 1997. 
That letter reiterated the principle that pursuant to the law of 
parliamentary privilege, the House of Commons and its committees 
are masters of their own proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also suggested that rules for the handling of 
committee documents might be subject to review by the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the hon. member for providing the Chair 
with a copy of this document and for her continued concern that 
the proprieties of this House and its committees be observed.  I 
would also like to thank the government House leader and the hon. 
member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre for their interventions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I will repeat what I stated in my ruling of October 9. It 
is clear both from the authorities and from earlier Speakers' 
rulings that a breach of privilege in one Parliament may indeed 
be punished by another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have carefully reviewed the documents submitted by the hon. 
member for Winnipeg North Centre as well as the submissions made 
when this issue was first brought before the House. I have also 
examined the procedural arguments with some considerable 
attention. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member made reference to citation 57 of Beauchesne's 
6th edition.  This citation states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has in the past regarded the publication of the 
proceedings or reports of committees sitting in camera to be a 
breach of privilege.  Unless, however, a specific charge is made 
against an individual allegedly responsible, the Speaker has 
refused to find a prima facie case. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentary procedure as set out in this citation and as 
reflected in our practice is quite clear.  Reports adopted by 
committees must be tabled in this House prior to their 
divulgation or publication.  Similarly, what is said and done at 
an in camera meeting must remain confidential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the manner in which committees deal with other 
aspects of their business, I will refer again to my ruling of 
October 9, 1997.  Committees have not only the right but also the 
responsibility to manage their own affairs.  They must be very 
clear about how they expect draft reports and other confidential 
material to be treated.  As well, they must ensure that everyone 
present at such meetings, including departmental officials, is 
aware of their obligation to respect the confidentiality of the 
proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains however that these are matters which fall 
within the responsibilities of each committee.  If irregularities 
occur concerning their proceedings or reports, committees may 
decide to report to the House on these matters.  It is on the 
basis of such a report that the House will then give 
consideration to the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After careful review, I am convinced that no new material 
element is brought forward in the case which the hon. member 
presented during her submission of November 25, 1997. I would 
like to thank the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre and other 
members who contributed to this question.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK52">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (for Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> moved 
that Bill C-2, an act to establish the Canada Pension Plan 
Investment Board and to amend the Canada pension plan and the Old 
Age Security Act and to make consequential amendments to other 
acts, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on 
third reading of Bill C-2, the legislation that will secure the 
Canada pension plan for Canadians now and in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important social policy initiatives ever 
undertaken in this country, the Canada pension plan has been a 
key part of the retirement plans of every Canadians since 1966. 
It has also helped our most vulnerable citizens, the disabled, 
the widowed and the orphaned. That being said, the Canada pension 
plan is now under growing pressure and needs to be changed before 
it is too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that when the CPP was created, there were eight 
working age people in Canada for every retired person.  Today 
there are five.  In 30 years there will only be three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current 5.85% legislated CPP contribution rate was scheduled 
to rise to 10.1% by 2016.  If nothing is done, CPP contribution 
rates will have to increase to over 14% to cover escalating 
costs.  That is a 140% increase for future generations and 
certainly that would be an unacceptable fate for our children and 
our grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not have to be that way if we act today to address the 
problems that we anticipate for tomorrow.  As joint stewards of 
the Canada pension plan, the federal government and the provinces 
agreed last February to restore the financial sustainability of 
the Canada pension plan and in fact to make it fairer and more 
affordable for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 incorporates the changes proposed in that agreement and 
also reflects the views expressed by Canadians during last year's 
cross country public consultations.  Some have said that these 
changes are being rushed but allow me to set the record straight. 
It is the continuing delay that threatens the CPP and in fact it 
is the delay in facing up to the very real challenges confronting 
the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1995 the government tabled the fifteenth actuarial 
report on the Canada pension plan which showed as I just 
mentioned that if changes were not made to the Canada pension 
plan the fund would be exhausted by 2015 and the contribution 
rate would have to jump to over 14%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the federal government and the provinces released a 
paper on the problems facing the Canada pension plan. They held 
consultations with Canadians in every province and territory and 
released a report on those consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1997 we reached a landmark agreement with the 
provinces.  There were then two draft bills released and in fact 
it is beyond me how anyone can say that we are rushing the Canada 
pension plan reforms.  Clearly we have ensured that the problems 
that face the Canada pension plan as we move into the next 
millennium are being addressed and they are being addressed in 
consultation with all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I do know is that Canadians were legitimately concerned 
that their Canada pension plan would not be there for them when 
they retire.  They told the federal and provincial governments to 
act now.  They told us that they want to be able to count on 
their Canada pension plan now and in the future and they want it 
fixed, not privatized and not scrapped. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also told us to do this in a way that does not pass on an 
insupportable cost burden to younger generations and they clearly 
told us to preserve the CPP by strengthening its financing, 
improving its investment practices and moderating the growing 
cost of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want and need the Canada pension plan but they want 
changes as well.  We have listened and I believe that is what in 
fact Bill C-2 is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan's pay as you go financing may have been 
fair and appropriate back in 1966 but not in today's or in 
tomorrow's world.  Building up a larger fund, fuller funding and 
earning a higher rate of return through investment in the market 
is now necessary to help to pay for the rapidly growing costs 
that will occur once baby boomers begin to retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, the Canada pension plan will move from a pay as you 
go financing with a small contingency reserve to fuller funding 
to build a substantially larger reserve.  Fuller funding means 
that the fund will grow substantially for about two years of 
benefits to about four or five years over the next two decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until 2003, CPP contribution rates will increase in steps to 
9.9% of contributory earnings and then remain steady.  This 
steady stated rate is expected to be enough to sustain the Canada 
pension plan with no further increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the consultations on CPP, ordinary Canadians and pension 
experts alike told us to improve the way CPP funds are invested 
and to secure the best possible return for contributors and 
beneficiaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the proposed new investment policy, instead of being 
loaned to provinces at preferential rates as they are now, Canada 
pension plan funds will be prudently invested in a diversified 
portfolio of securities in the best interests of plan members, 
like other pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An independent CPP investment board composed of 12 directors 
from a range of backgrounds will oversee investment policy for 
the fund.  The board will in turn hire qualified investment 
professionals to manage the day to day investment decisions at 
arm's length from governments.  The board will operate under 
broadly the same rules as other private and public sector pension 
funds and that means responding to market conditions, adopting 
investment policies and hiring qualified investment 
professionals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the board will be accountable, accountable to 
plan members, accountable to government and accountable to 
Canadians generally.  I am pleased to report that the experts in 
pension fund management who testified before the finance 
committee agreed that Bill C-2's accountability provisions are 
in fact stringent and leading edge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same experts told us that the key to good investment 
practices and results is good management structures and 
that these provisions are in Bill C-2 and are extremely sound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this bill was before the House finance committee, a number 
of committee members were particularly eager to ensure that the 
accountability provisions of the bill were as stringent as 
possible.  Once again, expert witnesses confirmed that the 
legislation was very rigorous in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, two amendments for which there was support in 
committee were made at report stage to clarify the accountability 
of the board.  The first one clarifies the auditor general's 
access to any information he considers necessary from the 
investment board to audit the consolidated financial statements 
of the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other amendment requires that a special examination of the 
Canada pension plan investment board be conducted at least once 
every six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Bill C-2, stewardship of the Canada pension plan is also 
improved and its public accountability strengthened.  Canadians 
will receive regular statements about their pensions. 
Federal-provincial reviews will take place every three years 
instead of every five years.  Annual reports will be published on 
the fund and tabled in Parliament and regular public meetings 
will be held in each province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through consultations with Canadians, some modest changes to 
benefits will accompany these financing and investment policy 
changes, but let us be clear, some benefits will not change as 
well.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, anyone currently receiving Canada pension plan 
retirement pensions or disability or survivor benefits will not 
have their benefits affected in any way.  All benefits will 
remain fully indexed to inflation, except the one-time death 
benefit.  The ages of retirement will remain unchanged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes that are being proposed are moderate and balanced. 
Indeed their impact on vulnerable Canadians has been minimized 
and no one group has been singled out or forced to shoulder an 
undue burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the public consultations on the CPP, Canadians told their 
governments to go easy on changes to benefits.  Again, we have 
listened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes to the Canada pension plan keep the contribution 
rate from rising to the 14.2% it would have reached had we not 
acted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventy-five per cent of the changes that will ensure the 
sustainability of the CPP are on the financing side and only 25% 
are on the benefit side.  Once again, this reflects what 
Canadians told their governments during the public consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take a few moments to refute some of the myths being 
spread by members of the other side of this House and by some 
special interest groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Critics claim that youth gets a raw deal from these changes. 
Some have actually stated that young Canadians will contribute 
one dollar for every fifty cents they will collect. Let us be 
absolutely clear.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  All 
Canada pension plan contributors, both present and future, will 
receive more from the Canada pension plan than they pay in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people can expect to receive $1.80 for every dollar of 
contributions.  The return can only be higher if governments were 
prepared to renege on the existing commitments to seniors already 
receiving pensions and to working Canadians expecting pensions 
when they retire.  We will not turn our backs on these Canadians. 
We will not renege on these commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some hon. members have also stated that CPP contributions will 
increase by 73% and charge that this is the biggest tax grab in 
history.  CPP contributions are not taxes and Bill C-2 is not a 
tax grab.  CPP contributions are savings toward pensions. They go 
into a separate fund, not into government coffers, and will be 
invested like other pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get the facts straight.  Contributions will increase over 
the next six years to 9.9%.  However, that is also the end of the 
increases.  What the critics never mention when they criticize 
the increase to 9.9% is that the CPP contribution rates are 
already scheduled to reach 10.1% in the year 2016 and without the 
changes that we are proposing, the Canada pension plan would soar 
to 14.2% in the year 2030. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that what the hon. members of the opposition parties prefer, 
a 140% increase?  It is certainly not what the government 
prefers.  It is certainly not what Canadians have said during the 
consultation period.  In fact, it is certainly not what is 
contained in Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other members argue, and the hon. member from the Conservative Party 
continues to argue this, that the higher CPP contributions should 
be offset by EI premium rate reductions.  I know that it takes 
some time to communicate and understand these facts for some hon. 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me again state quite clearly that the EI program and the 
Canada pension plan are totally separate programs serving 
different purposes.  Furthermore, the government has already 
announced EI rate reductions for 1998 that more than offset the 
Canada pension plan increases.  We are committed to bringing down 
the EI rate further just as soon as we can afford to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are groups that contend that not only will these 
changes take $157 billion out of the economy but that each 1% 
increase in payroll taxes will mean the loss of up to 176,000 
jobs. 
Quite clearly the allegations are wrong and I want to take this 
opportunity to ensure that the record states very clearly that 
these allegations are wrong.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that higher CPP contributions are not payroll taxes. 
Canadians have viewed and will continue to view their CPP 
contributions as retirement savings. They can see, as members on 
this side of the House can see, through the transparent rhetoric 
of these special interest groups. The reforms that we are 
proposing will generate important and lasting benefits for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me continue with the myths. Some hon. members continue to 
talk about better returns through privatized pensions. These 
members owe it to Canadians to explain exactly what they would do 
with the CPP's outstanding obligations to Canadians.  There is no 
question that registered retirement savings plans are important 
and that is why they are one of the three pillars in the 
retirement system of Canada.  But they cannot replace public 
pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians told governments during the public consultations that 
they want the security provided by the CPP as a public plan. They 
do not want all their retirement savings dependent on their 
ability to second guess the fluctuations of the stock market. And 
I am sure that members opposite have been watching the 
fluctuations in the stock market lately and I am sure that the 
recent events have reinforced the priority that Canadians give to 
security even though it has not reinforced anything from members 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the costs.  The cost to contributors for the 
Canada pension plan benefits will be 6.1%. Could mandatory RRSPs 
really provide equivalent or better benefits at lower costs than 
the CPP?  The answer is no.  With the new investment policy the 
Canada pension plan fund will earn as good returns as anyone 
investing privately could expect to earn. Furthermore, the CPP 
has the added advantage of having the government stand behind the 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The administrative costs of the CPP and the cost of investing 
the pool of CPP funds will be considerably lower than the cost 
associated with administering millions of individual plans.  We 
had expert after expert come before the committee who continued 
to say and reinforce the point that the administrative costs 
associated with mandatory RRSPs and administering millions of 
individual accounts was far greater than the administrative costs 
of the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the CPP protects families when an income earner 
becomes disabled or dies, and it protects the pensions of parents 
who take time out of the workforce to care for young children. So 
when we add it all up the fact is a reformed CPP will cost less 
than a retirement saving done exclusively through a mandatory 
program of RRSPs, at least one percentage point less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn to the extra cost of paying for the burden of the 
$600 billion unfunded liability.  Members opposite have talked 
about scrapping the CPP and moving to mandatory RRSPs, but they 
have never clearly explained how they would do that.  Let those 
who would scrap the CPP explain to Canadians whether they are 
going to renege on the promises to Canadians who are now retired. 
Let those who are still working and counting on receiving CPP 
when they retire have the security that is provided in Bill C-2, 
ensuring that the public pension plan is there for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mandatory RRSPs do not do that.  Reneging on the Canada pension 
plan liability does not do that.  That is what members opposite 
want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let those who would scrap the CPP explain how they will deal 
with Canada pension plan's $600 billion in outstanding 
obligations.  Are they going to deal with this within the CPP? If 
not, how will they raise the revenues or make spending cuts to 
pay for these obligations?  It is time for them to stop their 
fiction and fantasy.  It is time for them to come clean with 
Canadians and give Canadians the straight goods.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems facing our pension system are not unique to Canada. 
Many countries are making changes so their pension systems will 
also be sustainable.  Some have recommended moving toward 
increased funding of public plans, which is exactly what we are 
doing with Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will make Canada one of the first, if not the 
first, major industrialized countries to ensure sustainability of 
the public pension system in the next century.  It is forward 
looking and above all it is fair.  I urge hon. members to give 
their full support to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generations of Canadians, our children and our grandchildren, 
need our leadership today to protect their interests tomorrow. 
Bill C-2 does that.  It does that after consultations with 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Finance is continuing the 
consultations with experts and other groups that come before the 
committee.  They have overwhelmingly supported Bill C-2 in its 
balanced approach.  Bill C-2 will continue to monitor the Canada 
pension plan.  Bill C-2 will continue to provide Canadians with 
the security they expect and deserve from their Canada pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members not to continue with their rhetoric but to deliver 
the facts to Canadians and ensure the bill passes third reading 
and becomes legislation so that Canadians have the peace of mind 
they deserve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, today we are at third and final reading of Bill C-2, a 
bill to amend the Canada pension plan.  I emphasize the 
importance to Canadians of the legislation.  It will affect 
millions of them throughout their working lives and into 
retirement.  It directly touches over 13 million Canadians today, 
millions more who have yet to enter the workforce, and even 
millions yet unborn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as parliamentarians have a tremendous responsibility when we 
look at such far reaching legislation.  Unfortunately the Liberal 
dictatorship of today has allocated scant hours to debate a bill 
that will affect millions of Canadians and their futures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Retirement security is a key concern of all Canadians.  Yet the 
Liberal government is making it more and more difficult for 
Canadians to have a secure retirement.  Changes to seniors 
programs like the OAS program will put $7 billion to $8 billion 
in the pocket of the government and take it away from retirement 
security for Canadians.  RRSPs are continually being cut back by 
the government.  The level of CPP contributions has been frozen. 
The finance minister is now taxing RRSPs a full two years earlier 
than in the past.  How are Canadians supposed to save for 
retirement with these shenanigans by the Liberals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once a person retires and is able to salvage a little income 
from these Liberal measures then taxes keep rising.  People on 
fixed incomes are hit the hardest by this sort of thing.  We are 
in a very serious situation today in terms of retirement due to 
Liberal measures like the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look closely at the bill to see exactly what it 
delivers to Canadians and what it does not.  I believe Canadians 
care about four things when it comes to measures that affect 
them, their money and their future.  They care about fairness. 
They want a scheme that is fair.  They want value for their 
money.  They want real security.  They want things to be done 
with integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals know how much these words mean to Canadians and 
that is why they use them repeatedly.  The words were used over 
and over in the speech of the parliamentary secretary. 
What is the reality behind this Liberal rhetoric? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT11"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT11"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1050

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First let us talk about fairness.  The Liberals use this word a 
lot when talking about the bill but here is the reality.  Due to 
shockingly disastrous mismanagement by past Liberal and Tory 
governments the Canada pension plan has an incredible $600 
billion unfunded liability.  That is the reality.  That is where 
we are today yet these people are asking us to trust them to do 
the right thing.  For the last 30 years they have put us almost 
$600 billion in the hole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals say there is no problem, that they will lay the 
burden on our kids, make them pay nearly twice as much and give 
them less in benefits.  What could be simpler?  However it does 
not fit with any definition of fairness I have ever heard.  One 
of our members called it legalized mugging.  That about sums it 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The young people of our country have already inherited a $600 
billion national debt.  It has been shoved on their credit card. 
They face increased health and other costs due to the aging 
population.  Is it fair to put the second CPP national debt 
largely on their shoulders?  Most Canadians would agree the 
answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly enough—and this has not escaped Liberal 
notice—this is the same group of Canadians which is least likely 
to be old enough to be politically active.  They are not yet old 
enough to vote in many cases or they have not yet been born. What 
this amounts to is taxation without representation.  Is that 
fair?  Only for a Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Low income Canadians are forced to pay a larger proportion of 
their income into the scheme than those with higher incomes. 
Therefore the burden of the unfunded liability will fall most 
heavily on lower income Canadians.  It is no wonder there is a 
problem with child poverty.  The Liberals make families poor and 
then ask to be elected so they can fight child poverty.  Go 
figure.  Only a Liberal could find fairness in forcing those 
least able to pay, to pay the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new CPP scheme is unfair in at least three major ways.  It 
places the burden of past mismanagement on those already 
disproportionately burdened.  It places the burden of past 
mismanagement on those least able to object.  It places the 
burden of past mismanagement on those least able to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a letter written by grandparents which reads in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we appreciate something has to be done about the shortfall 
looming ahead, we don't think this is the answer.  I have always 
believed that we should have been able to invest our own 
contributions for a much greater return, perhaps as high as 
fourfold estimated by some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am already collecting my CPP payments, and Jeanne will 
be in about two years, between us we have seven children, 16 
grandchildren and one great-grandchild expected next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have great concerns as to the potential impact this Liberal 
tax grab will have on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, this legislation is being pushed through the House 
by the Liberal majority without proper and sufficient democratic 
debate before the Canadian people.  Shame on them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That letter is from Canadian citizens.  Sadly these changes fail 
the test of fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us turn to the question of value.  Canadians have a heritage 
of thrift and of getting value for their money.  They are prudent 
people.  How wisely and well does this plan give us value for 
hard earned dollars contributed?  In a nutshell this Liberal 
scheme extracts massive amounts of dollars from the young and 
then pays a return that is far less than the real value of their 
contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Self-employment is the fastest growing sector in our labour 
market.  A self-employed person entering the labour force today 
and earning the average industrial wage will pay over $3,200 a 
year into the CPP.  These contributions, paid until age 65, will 
total between $1.6 million and $2 million over a working 
lifetime.  Let us split the difference and say that it is $1.8 
million.  That assumes an inflation rate averaging about 3.5% and 
a very modest real return on investment of between 3% and 4%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Assuming that this person will then draw the full CPP for 20 
years, he or she would collect in total just over $900,000. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT12"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT12"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1055

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us review that.  It cost $1.8 million and the return was 
$900,000.  A good deal for whom, the contributor?  No.  For the 
government trying to cover its tracks?  Yes, and that is the 
whole point of the scheme.  It is little more than legalized 
theft from today's young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief actuary for the CPP and others have looked at the 
investment return to contributors in another way.  They have 
calculated the rate of return per year on the value of the 
contributions.  The chief actuary, in his 16th report in 
September, showed that the return to the youngest contributors to 
the plan would be 1.8%.  Can anyone imagine this?  That is about 
one-half of the real rate of return offered by Canada savings 
bonds and about one-third of the real rate of return one could 
expect from long term, high quality corporate bonds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite would have us believe this is a fair deal, that 
this investment represents good value for young Canadians.  A 
graph shows that the value of these contributions for young 
Canadians goes beyond the break even line in about 2011, a few 
years from now.  Yet the Liberals would have us believe that this 
is good value for our money.  I do not think so and I do not 
think our young people think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite need to get it through their heads that this is 
not value for money and it will not take Canadians very long to 
figure that out.  The impact of the bill must also strike 
Canadians as mean spirited and unfair in another way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is regulation that leads to disguised or hidden tax 
increases. Nickels and dimes to start with but eventually 
totalling millions and then billions.  A leading social policy 
analyst calls it taxation by stealth.  The CPP bill is a good 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals inserted a sentence of 14 words which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For each year after 1997 the amount of a year's basic exemption 
is $3,500. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This $3,500 exemption used to be tied to inflation and it would 
rise as inflation rose.  No more.  It will be $3,500 period. 
Instantly we have a small payroll tax increase on small 
businesses and workers in Canada without media or public 
recognition, let alone any debate on the increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Freezing the year's basic exemption at $3,500 means that each 
year the value of this deduction decreases by the amount of 
inflation.  Perhaps it is only 2% or 3% a year, but over time the 
value of the deduction is seriously eroded.  As a consequence, 
the amount of earnings subject to CPP increases slightly each 
year.  Everyone, workers and employers, pay extra dollars each 
year in addition to the premium increases for the same pension 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The burden is heaviest on those with the lowest incomes because 
the exempted amount accounts for less and less in real value 
every year.  They steadily pay more of an already small income 
and this hits them harder than if the exemption protected a 
larger percentage of their total earnings.  They need that 
protection which is why the exemption was put there in the first 
place.  The Liberals are allowing it to be stealthfully eroded 
away.  No wonder families are getting poorer all the time.  No 
wonder there is growing concern about child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so repugnant is that the same Liberals who loudly 
protest that child poverty is their highest priority are creating 
the very poverty they claim to be so concerned about.  They say 
they will cure child poverty.  It is like hiring a mugger to get 
out of debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another interesting letter states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are two young, hard working people struggling to make ends 
meet.  One of us works two eight-hour jobs full time just so we 
can catch up to our bills and maybe get an apartment before 
December.  We are living in a truck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not irresponsible.  We just got suddenly relocated and 
brought a lot of responsibilities with us, but it is hard to 
catch up for those of us who are counting every penny.  This 
would kill us.  If we end up giving more money to the government 
it will inevitably destroy us.  Besides, we would rather manage 
our money in our own way and in our own name than dump it into 
some mysterious fund that may not exist when we retire. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what young Canadians are saying.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is value in this plan, it is certainly not going to 
workers and businesses which pay most of the freight.  If this 
scheme is clearly unfair and does not provide good value for 
money investment, does it at least have the virtue of providing 
security?  Will the dollars being extracted from us be worth it 
in the end because they will go toward the good cause of 
guaranteeing every Canadian an $8,700 a year pension after they 
retire? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the fact that some investors will get a low return be 
justified because government management pools the risk and no one 
has to worry about not getting the $8,700 a year?  It will be 
there for sure.  No worries, count on it.  Is that the situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the future security of this Liberal CPP scheme 
rests on the assumptions that the young will willingly continue 
to pay into the plan when they know that less than half the real 
value of their substantial investment will be returned to them 
personally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we honestly believe our children and grandchildren will, let 
alone should, make a large investment out of their earnings and 
accept a small return so that the rest can be used to pay for 
promises made to those who came before them, promises not backed 
up by the money to make good on them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The security of our expected CPP benefit rests largely on our 
belief that younger generations will willingly shoulder the 
lion's share of what amounts to a second national debt once they 
are old enough to take political power.  I suggest we think long 
and hard about the likelihood of that happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future security of this Liberal CPP scheme rests on the 
reliability of the assumptions that led to its construction. The 
government assumes that 9.9% in contribution rates over the next 
century will deliver the promised benefits. How reliable are 
those assumptions?  Are they any more reliable than the 
assumption in 1967 that contribution rates would never have to 
rise above 5.5%?  That is what we were told at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, in less than a generation, our contribution rate has soared to 
nearly twice that and the benefits we were promised then have 
already been cut back.  Benefits are being cut in this bill 
by Liberals who, in the same breath, are trying to maintain that 
promises of government are reliable while they are demonstrating 
that they clearly are not.  This very bill is exhibit A of the 
fact that the CPP is not a sure thing.  It reneges on the 
promises that were made to us when we started working and paying 
30 years ago.  Now we are suddenly told we will get less.  Who 
can honestly believe this will be the last time the Liberals will 
say oops, we cannot give you quite as much as we said we would? 
Just like they said oops, we cannot get rid of the GST like we 
said we would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is the CPP is not a pension plan.  It is a political 
promise backed up by only government's ability to tax from 
citizens the funds needed to pay for the promises. Political 
promises change with changes in power.  They change with changing 
reality.  They change with circumstances and with shifts in voter 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one disputes that political promises are not something to go 
to the bank with and they are certainly not something to retire 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a letter from a family that says this:  “We are a young 
family who are struggling to make it from month to month.  Losing 
more of our earnings through an increase in CPP is only going to 
make it more difficult for us to meet our financial 
responsibilities which include repaying student loans and raising 
two preschool children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“We have worked very hard to ensure that we are responsible for 
our decisions by paying our student loans off at a faster rate 
and raising our children the best we can.  Things like owning our 
own home, contributing to an education fund for our children or 
taking family vacations once seemed to be attainable, but they 
are fast becoming more a dream than a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Young Canadians like myself are angry that we are being told 
to pay for our government's poor financial planning, especially 
when we have no hope of receiving anything from the CPP in our 
senior years. Governing one of the greatest countries in the 
world does not excuse nor give licence to making faulty decisions 
that adversely affect our country's citizens.  Our politicians 
may not notice the increased CPP deduction on their paycheque, 
but my family certain will”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how real Canadians feel about how secure this plan is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the future security of the Liberal CPP scheme rests 
on the assumption that the new billions of dollars that the 
Liberals are going to extract from Canadians with this bill will 
be managed to earn the best possible rate of return.  Once again, 
the Liberals have set up in this bill a huge fund which will 
extract billions of dollars of our CPP contributions into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is going to manage all this loot?  It is going to be 12 hand 
picked Liberal appointees.   Once again the Liberals try to fool 
us by saying all the right words.  It will be arm's length.  It 
will be transparent.  There will be prudent management.  But the 
reality makes their feel good rhetoric ring hollow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the Liberals voted down every amendment 
brought forward by the opposition parties that would really make 
the fund management even moderately arm's length from political 
interference.  One of the measures turned down would have the 
minister taking advice from an advisory committee on who would 
sit on it. That was turned down.  The auditor is going to be 
appointed from year to year. There was an amendment to make that 
appointment for a longer period of time. That was turned down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an amendment that the chairperson be elected by the 
majority of the members of the board. That was turned down.  It 
will be the minister's hand picked appointee.  I could go on and 
on. There were so many amendments brought forward that the 
Liberal majority just went thumbs down on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, only significant pressure even made the Liberals 
acknowledge that Canadians' own auditor general should have 
unrestricted access to fund information.  Of course regular 
Canadians are out of luck.  The fund's operations are not even 
subject to access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet this fund will soon have a massive proportion of Canada's 
total equity pool.  The implications are staggering for its 
impact on the total economic structure of our country.  But we 
have 12 hand picked Liberal appointees who will wield enormous 
influence in our economy.  The government says it will be happy 
if the fund earns a real rate of return of 3.8%.  The potential 
for unfair and unintended uses of such economic clout are 
staggering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact even before the bill passes other parties in this House 
are already arguing that the fund should be open to be used for 
political objectives.  We can imagine how such pressures will 
mount once the fund actually contains all those lovely billions 
of dollars. Our retirement dollars will draw political and social 
engineers like a loadstone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are by nature not risk takers.  They prefer stability 
and security.  I am sure members opposite are wanting to hear 
what I have to say and so I would appreciate it if they would 
keep their remarks for later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians by nature are not risk takers.  They prefer stability 
and security.  Yet what the Liberals are giving us in their new 
CPP scheme is risk and more risk.  There is a risk that our 
children will refuse to bear so much cost for so little benefit. 
There is the risk that government assumptions and projections 
will, as usual, prove to be unreliable after only a few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, after only two months the projected amount in the fund 
had to be revised downward by $41 billion.  That is just how 
badly the assumptions are off already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the risk that political considerations will compromise 
the returns needed to pay the promised pensions.  There is the 
risk that further future political decisions will change what the 
plan last promised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no security for Canadians in this scheme.  Canadians 
recognize that.  Here is a letter from a Canadian that says: “I 
am completely opposed to increases in CPP contributions, 
especially in consideration of the low level of faith I have in 
our past, present and future governments to manage and return the 
increased revenue properly. The monthly CPP `contribution' my 
family makes exceeds the cost of my son's education.  Quite 
frankly, I would rather invest my earned income in his future 
since it is a virtual guarantee my country will not”.  That is 
how real Canadians feel.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this plan deliver integrity?  Is it based on honesty?  Is 
it sound and well considered?  The Liberals promised to restore 
integrity to government.  Does this bill with the single most 
profound implications for the retirement security of retired, 
working and future generations of Canadians meet the test of 
integrity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, how can we say a piece of legislation delivers integrity 
when it is so cavalier about the interests of the young and the 
politically powerless?  Is that not exploitation of the 
defenceless?  Will Liberals be able to look their children and 
grandchildren in the eye 10 or 20 years from now and say we did 
what was right and good for you, we acted in your best interests? 
How will they defend forcing young workers to pay more for less? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, not all Liberals can be blind to the fact that the time 
bomb is still ticking.  The cracks are being papered over for a 
few more years but the long term funding crisis has not been 
solved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the integrity there?  The Liberals have not been honest 
on the issue of transparency and accountability.  For all their 
nice words, they voted down measure after measure that would have 
made it so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This plan incorporates the Liberal policy of taxation by 
stealth.  Threshold exemption levels desperately needed by poor 
working families to meet their children's needs year by year are 
less protected as inflation creeps up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Year by year the average industrial wage rises, capturing more 
CPP taxes from businesses and workers.  These effective increases 
will never be debated or discussed and this bill says that future 
additional premium increases—it already acknowledges there will 
have to be some over 9.9%—can simply be mandated with no further 
legislation or debate.  King John never had it so good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Canadian from Edmonton writes: “I am one of thousands of 
single mothers who are desperately trying to be self-sufficient 
and support myself and my daughter on my own without the aid of 
welfare or other government agencies.  I am frustrated beyond 
words that the government wants to take more of my hard earned 
money away from the mouth of my child when I have come to the 
realization that by the time I reach the age to collect, there 
will be nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“I hope the government is ready to reap the consequences that 
this will cause.  I just may find it more beneficial and in my 
best interests to quit working and collect welfare because it may 
be the only way I can make money”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important debate and one that will be reopened every 
two or three years as required by legislation and as those 
exploited by this scheme gain political awareness and power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important therefore to put a couple more points on the 
record.  The government never considered other options or 
arrangements to complement or replace the CPP.  It set out in its 
consultations to sustain the CPP in essentially the same form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It asked Canadians to a series of limited consultations, a few 
general questions concerning contribution rates, changes to 
benefits and the investment of CPP funds.  It did not ask 
questions that would invite consideration of other alternatives 
such as a defined contribution, individually owned and privately 
managed accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It did not study or explore developments in the many countries 
in the world that have experienced the same difficulty we are in 
the pay as you go schemes and have moved to mandatory privately 
managed accounts.  Examples are Australia, Great Britain, New 
Zealand, Chile, Mexico, Hungary and some 15 others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not want to consider other options.  It did 
not want the standing committee to invite experts from outside 
Canada to testify about other options.  Notably, the committee 
refused to invite the world expert on pension reform, Dr. Jose 
Pinera, born in Chile and educated at Harvard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee developed some theory about human rights abuses 
despite much evidence in support of Dr. Pinera and his worldwide 
reputation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, and this is Liberal hypocrisy for you, only 
four blocks away, a senior official from the department of 
finance in Chile and a good friend of Dr. Pinera was delivering a 
seminar on pensions.  This gentleman along with two experts from 
Mexico was speaking on “Pension systems in crisis:  What can we 
learn from Latin America?”  Of course the Liberal committee did 
not want to learn anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to our pension reform, our international 
development research centre that sponsored that seminar is more 
creative and more open to new ideas and shows more common sense 
than does our finance department or the government members of the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is just be open.  If the government is unwilling to go 
beyond the Canadian border for advice, just say so, but do not 
smear the reputation of an international scholar to hide its 
intent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hypocrisy becomes even more flagrant and exposed when within 
a month our Prime Minister is rolling out the red carpet and 
wining and dining the Chinese president who is internationally 
labelled as responsible for massive human rights abuses in his 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not considered any other means of financing 
the CPP debt other than dumping the burden on the backs of young 
Canadians. The government must realize that a portion of this 
unfunded liability should be spread across all members of 
society.  Take a few billion of the fiscal dividend for the next 
40 or 50 years and see what could be done to lighten the burden 
on the young, the low income worker and small businesses.  But 
no, the Liberals have big plans for the fiscal dividend. They 
want to buy some votes with it. They do not really care about 
using it for good purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister has been challenged about the flaws in his 
thinking and in the plan, he reacts with feigned outrage and 
extravagant fabrications.  He sets up straw men and then beats 
away to the cheers of his backbench cronies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He claims for example that income taxes would rise 25% should he 
provide support to the CPP unfunded liability. What balderdash. 
Net personal income taxes this year are likely to approach $70 
billion and 25% of that is $17.5 billion.  But the CPP premiums 
this year are already bringing in $14 billion. This is an example 
of one of the finance minister's fabrications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government has a duty to Canadians to look at saving and 
changing the CPP in more rational and secure ways to deliver 
better value for Canadians.  It needs to give real security to 
Canadians.  It needs to encourage thrift rather than penalize it. 
It needs to expand opportunities for Canadians especially those 
of modest means to save, rather than taxing away every spare 
nickel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to ensure that public pensions move toward 
being a real funded asset, safe from political changes or 
mismanagement. It needs to make sure that there is a real safety 
net for needy seniors when personal resources are absent.  It 
needs to give tax relief and safety from its continual tax 
increases which erode the fixed income of people who are retired. 
It needs to be committed to smaller, more efficient government 
that spends and taxes less. Instead the Liberals fight to see who 
can spend the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There needs to be liability for unfunded benefits right across 
society, not mostly loaded on the backs of our young.  The 
government needs to lighten the burden on the business sector and 
on job producers so that people can earn incomes and can save for 
their retirement.  It needs to give real value and allow younger 
Canadians to opt out of a bad plan into mandatory pension 
investment accounts that would deliver a fully funded 
individually owned pension with better investment returns and 
higher more secure benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other countries are doing this but not in Canada. We have to be 
stuck with some vague political promise from the government 
because only it can manage our money for us.  What nonsense. We 
need management of a fund which is much less vulnerable to 
political interference. We just cannot put future generations in 
the position of having to pay a lot for a little or further 
eroding the retirement security of older Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We urge government members to make courageous spending and 
allocation choices now instead of fighting over some of their pet 
programs.  Make choices now with the money we have to clean up 
this mess, rather than just transferring it onto our children. 
The government needs to take every reasonable step to make this 
fund management fully accountable and untainted by political 
interference. It needs to stop the tactic of attributing monster 
scenarios to the opposition and work constructively, all of us 
together, in the best interests of Canadians with measures we can 
all have confidence in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A talk show host who is well respected in Alberta, Dave 
Rutherford of QR-77 in Calgary, asked Canadians to let him and 
the opposition in this country know what they thought about these 
changes to the CPP.  Four thousand faxes were sent in over a 
period of a few weeks. I would like to have the consent of the 
House to table these so that all members can look through them 
and see what real Canadians feel about the measures that are 
being proposed today.

my colleagues.  I hope that members from all parties will take 
the opportunity to look at these heartfelt writings of Canadians 
who will be affected both now and in the future by what we are 
debating today.  Just look at what the people we represent really 
think about what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, and I know we all love that word when politicians 
are speaking.  If we truly believed, not just we in the Reform 
Party but many members of this House, that these proposals we are 
debating today were fair, were economically sound, that they made 
the best use of Canadians' valuable earnings, that they delivered 
real security to Canadians for retirement and were in the long 
term best interests of Canadians, we would be happy to support 
them.  We would be happy and relieved that something right was 
being done. However after careful study, after listening to 
expert witnesses on this, we cannot honestly conclude this to be 
the case and because of that we will not support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We urge the government to adopt constructive alternatives which 
not only Reform but many other countries have proposed.  On 
behalf of our children we appeal to the government to abandon 
this flawed and unfair legislation.  There is a better way that 
would provide more personal choice and better security on 
retirement. Canadians deserve no less.

<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise at third reading of Bill C-2 to 
establish the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to remember that this bill fits into 
the retirement income system available to Quebeckers and Canadians, 
a system with three components, the Canada pension plan, the public 
pension plans—old age security and the guaranteed income 
supplement—and the tax incentives for private savings, commonly 
known as RRSPs. 
Thus, the policy at the present time focuses on three elements: 
private pension plans, public pension plans, and supplements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan has been much debated here, and this 
was legislation tabled after consultation with all the provinces. 
As we know, Quebec has its own pension plan, the equivalent of the 
Canada pension plan. The consultations held both in Quebec and in 
the rest of Canada led to eight provinces agreeing with the general 
recommendations.  The two opposing provinces disagreed with a 
specific aspect, not the reform as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important, however, to assess this bill in relation to 
the second component, old age security and the guaranteed income 
supplement.  The federal government announced that there would be 
an in-depth reform of this sector. It will be replaced by the 
seniors benefit.  We have already known for two years what the 
federal government's initial parameters are for this, but extensive 
consultations will have to be held over the next few months on what 
the seniors benefit will be like, since it represents a fundamental 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, the decision has been made to do away with certain 
aspects, such as the principle of universality.  It is being 
replaced by a principle under which people yet to retire, those who 
are 55 years old now, but also those aged 45 or 20, will see their 
entire retirement preparation profile changed by the seniors 
benefit.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the legislation on the Canada pension plan does not 
deal with the issue of benefits to seniors, but everyone preparing 
for their retirement must look at it in terms of the Canada pension 
plan or its Quebec equivalent, the Quebec pension plan, and of the 
issue of old age pensions and the third pillar, which is the whole 
issue of private retirement plans, such as RRSPs or supplemental 
pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These things must be taken into account and, regarding this 
third pillar, the RRSPs, you will remember that the Bloc Quebecois 
proposed replacing the RRSP deduction with a tax credit of $268 for 
everyone. 
We think this is the only fair and equitable way to encourage all 
taxpayers to save for their retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should note that the bill before us today is of interest 
not just to those who are already retired.  We must remember that 
the Canada pension plan was created in the 1960s in an attempt to 
ensure Canadians could count on an adequate retirement income.  We 
have noted a number of shortcomings in the legislation over the 
years.  The aim of the bill we are considering today is to correct 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main shortcoming of the fund was that it failed to grow 
sufficiently.  There is a deficit, and we are faced with a choice. 
Either we increase contributions substantially or we have to reduce 
services.  So we will try to find a reasonable compromise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very revealing that, finally, the solution was found in 
Quebec. When Quebec created the Régie des rentes du Québec, the Caisse 
de dépôt et placement was created at the same time. This is a powerful 
investment fund that allowed Quebeckers to obtain a greater yield on 
their money than with the old Canada pension plan because, with that 
plan, nothing had been done to ensure maximum return on investments. 
Nothing was done to ensure maximum revenues and the result was that the 
fund was never self-sufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that in an area where Quebec was given 
adequate flexibility during the Pearson years, when two different plans 
were able to exist side by side, it is Quebec that was more successful. 
So much so that when federal government officials began developing the 
bill we have before us today, they came to Quebec, they met Quebec 
officials, and what is found in this bill under the investment component 
is based mostly on the model developed by the Caisse de dépôt et 
placement du Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a difference—Canadians will be able to judge in due time 
its importance—and it is that in the case of the investment board, the 
only criterion to maximize return on investment is market profitability, 
whereas in Quebec, with the Caisse de dépôt et placement, the 
responsibility to contribute to the economic development of Quebec was 
included in its mandate. 
It should be noted that when this fund was created, funnelling of 
savings by Quebeckers had not begun, and they did not have the economic 
development capacity enjoyed by the English speaking provinces, and I 
would say also by the English speaking establishment in Canada. There 
was a lot of capital in a great number of companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of the sixties, English Canada had almost complete 
ownership of the capital. So Quebec, with the Caisse de dépôt et 
placement, developed this investment capacity so that it could compete 
and so that people would stop saying that it knew nothing about 
business. Then, during the following 25 or 30 years, we showed that we 
were also capable of looking after these things. We have an institution 
that we can be proud of, especially in view of the fact that the federal 
government has decided with its bill to copy it almost completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first important area to remedy is the plan's profitability, and 
it should be possible to partly succeed in this with the investment 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must understand also that when the minister iintroduced his bill 
in the House on September 25 last, he had two other major issues to deal 
with: the increase in capitalization that I mentioned, the increase in 
the rate of return in the plan, and tightening the requirements for 
certain benefits, especially disability benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general stated in his report that there was some 
permissiveness in the application of the Canada pension plan because of 
the way the current legislation is framed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT19"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT19"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1130

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this is not the case with the Quebec pension plan. Our 
province was used as an example because, over the past 30 years, it has 
passed social laws that allow us to deal with disability cases through 
means other than the Canada pension plan or the Quebec pension plan. 
Thanks to these other means, Quebec did not have to twist the 
legislation the way the federal government did to dip into the CPP fund 
to pay for disability claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, these are the objectives of the bill. Consultations were held. 
Eight provinces approved the proposed changes. British Columbia and 
Saskatchewan are the only ones that did not support all the proposed 
changes. 
The end result is pretty good, given the situation that had to be dealt 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did we have to question certain aspects of the plan? For one 
thing, at the rate things were going, the fund would have been empty by 
the year 2015, at which time the rate would have had to jump from 6% to 
14% for the Canada pension plan, and from 6% to 13% for the Quebec 
Pension Plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I explained earlier, the Quebec government has its own plan. 
Some people have contributed to both plans, over the years. The Canada 
pension plan concerns primarily Canadians living in the nine provinces 
other than Quebec. 
Still, 12,000 Quebeckers are affected, and it is with them in mind that 
we carefully reviewed each clause of the bill, to make sure that it puts 
them in the best possible position, given the current context. A little 
less than 1% of Quebec's population is affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers affected by this legislation are those who live in 
Quebec, but who worked all their lives in another province and who only 
contributed to the Canada pension plan. An example of this would be a 
Hull resident who worked in Ottawa throughout his or her active life. 
Therefore, the bill is of particular interest to Quebeckers who live in 
the national capital region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other Quebeckers affected are members of the Canadian armed forces 
and the RCMP who live in Quebec but must contribute to the Canada 
pension plan. 
Having contributed only to the CPP, those are the benefits they 
receive, even though they live in Quebec.  This is the second 
category of Quebeckers affected by the CPP.  And the third category 
consists of those receiving CPP benefits who have moved to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So 12,000 people is not a large percentage, but this issue 
looms very large for each of them as they get ready to retire. 
That is why this bill warranted considerable attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reform was intended to ensure the viability of the plan 
for generations to come, because intergenerational equity has to be 
introduced. 
If we did not have to take the action we are now taking, if we had 
not decided to raise the premium rate as we are now doing, the 
youngest generations would have been forced to pay an even larger 
share to fund the plan, to the benefit of baby boomers who will 
have retired and who have contributed less to the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the legislation were not changed, there would be an 
imbalance in the contributions made by the various generations. 
And it is clear that those who are now 20, 25 or 30 years old, with 
all the fairly widespread unemployment problems we are seeing, 
already have their plate full just trying to start a family, get 
settled, and launch their career properly.  The job situation is 
much more difficult now than it was 15 or 20 years ago.  That is 
obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked for 20 years in Quebec's public sector.  When my 
generation came on the job market, there were jobs.  Today, young 
people beginning in the job market have to struggle.  We live in a 
society where individual entrepreneurship is highly valued.  It is 
not easy, and we should not further burden young people with having 
to fund the plan for those who date from the system's golden era, 
the baby boomer period.  A number of members of Parliament fall 
into this category, in fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should point out, however, that as the bill now stands this 
has been taken into account and there will be intergenerational 
equity.  It is included. 
That does not mean it will not be painful, that there is not a very 
significant increase in the contribution rate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has, moreover, accepted a measure proposed to 
it by the Bloc Quebecois on the first day in committee, namely to 
reduce employment insurance contributions to at least the 
equivalent of the Canada pension plan increase.  It has done this 
for 1998, effective January 1, 1998, in response to our 
representations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can recall the committee work. It was the committee's first 
meeting.  When I arrived, all the party leaders were there, as well 
as the two ministers responsible, Mr. Martin and Mr. Pettigrew. 
When the time for questions came, the Reform Party's questions were 
far more about why the whole thing could not be privatized and why 
there could not be a plan similar to what Chile has.  I think it 
was demonstrated, in examining the entire bill, that it would be a 
fundamental mistake to go that route, within the Quebec system, the 
Canadian system, given our social values. It would create a major 
imbalance in society and would not respect the entire tradition we 
have built up.  In particular, it would mean creating a system 
which would bring terrific pressure to bear on investment 
mechanisms and would not, in our opinion, be viable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our turn to intervene came, I asked whether the 
government would be prepared to decrease these contributions. 
We did not get any immediate response in committee, but an 
announcement was made later in response to a question I asked in 
the House of the Minister of Human Resource Development.  They have 
indeed decided to decrease employment insurance premiums by 20 
cents per $100 of income, effective January 1, 1998, in line with 
part of what we were asking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we were asking with respect to the investment board bill 
was to ensure that there is no increase in January 1998 in the 
deductions from people's paycheques.  The minister has neglected to 
tell us that the bill contains a little bit of retroactivity for 
employers back to January 1, 1997.  That will not be covered by the 
minister's decision.  We would have preferred it to be covered in 
its entirety, but at least part of the measure is there in a 
satisfactory manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not stop or weaken our demand that employment 
insurance premiums be significantly reduced, because—as the 
chief employment insurance actuary revealed last week—the 
employment insurance plan could level off and have enough surplus 
to permit premiums of $2 per $100 of insurable income.  The figure 
will be $2.78 as of January 1, 1998.  There is 70 cents to play 
with once the entire plan is balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois are saying there ought to be a way to 
do two interesting things with the 70 cents.  We could 
significantly reduce employment insurance premiums and return the 
money to the pockets of employers and employees.  A significant 
part of the money could be invested to correct the imbalances in 
the unemployment insurance reform. 
People in our regions—seasonal workers, young people, women 
joining the labour market—have had to deal with a lot in the 
past year that is unacceptable to our society with the fight 
against the deficit having been won with contributions by employers 
and employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should make more effort, and I hope there is 
some sensitivity there, especially since December is the month the 
Minister of Human Resources Development will be receiving the 
report of the employment insurance commission to assess what 
changes need to be made.  I hope that the government will be 
sensitive to these situations and will correct them.  In any case, 
the political message was delivered very clearly in the June 2 
elections. 
Many of the members from the maritimes were good MPs, but they were 
defeated because the government did not respond to the 
recriminations made during consultations on the employment 
insurance reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, back to the Canada pension plan investment board bill. 
We have to increase contributions to ensure the survival of the 
plan and and we have to create the investment board so that we can 
ensure sufficient funding.  That will create a fantastic investment 
fund in terms of dollars, and the government set itself an initial 
foreign investment limit of 20%. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This limit may be reasonable for the time being, particularly if it 
is the same as for RRSPs and other similar plans. I think that when the 
government is allowed, through the investment board, to exceed the 20% 
limit for foreign investment, the same will have to be done for other 
plans. We cannot allow the government to exceed this limit, but not 
private plans. This would create an unacceptable imbalance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill includes a series of measures to ensure the plan's 
sustainability. It also seeks to ensure fairness for the various 
generations of contributors, while maintaining a contribution rate 
compatible with economic growth. 
This is why I believe it is acceptable to increase contributions to the 
plan. However, employers and employees must get some break regarding 
payroll taxes. I explained this earlier, and I hope the government will 
take action accordingly in other areas of activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make some comparisons between the Canada pension 
plan and the Quebec pension plan. The increase in the contribution rate 
will be the same for both plans, reaching 9.9% by the year 2003, and 
then levelling off. Indeed, Quebec will impose the same increase. We did 
not really have any choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A review of the plan will be conducted on a regular basis. This is 
interesting. Reviews will be conducted more often. We realize now how 
previous federal governments turned a blind eye on the situation. A 
solution had to be found and, more importantly, applied. 
Had reviews been done on a more regular basis in the past, that is in 
the last 25 or 30 years, the situation would not be as catastrophic as 
it is, and it would not be necessary to increase contribution rates so 
drastically. The basic exemption will remain the same, at its current 
level. This also true for the Quebec pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the disability issue. As I explained at the beginning 
of my speech, Quebec has some experience when it comes to using other 
means of financial assistance for those who, unfortunately, are 
disabled. These other forms of help include, for example, health 
insurance or other types of assistance in the case of an automobile 
accident. This avoids putting undue pressure on the Quebec pension plan. 
It is not so in the case of the Canada pension plan, since no such 
alternatives exist in the nine other Canadian provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When disabled, people need an income. All they did was try to find 
a form of income that was available. The pressure was too great, because 
these people do need an income. However, this caused an imbalance in the 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is similar to the situation with TAGS, the Atlantic groundfish 
strategy. The federal government implemented a program intended to 
promote regional economic diversification but it ended up being used as 
a safety net program. Everyone agrees that there is a need to ensure 
that people have something to live on and can eat three meals a day. But 
that was not the purpose of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Canada pension plan, it was not designed to make up for 
the shortcomings in other disability plans, but nothing was being done 
on that front. 
In the other provinces, there was not the same kind of sensitivity and 
the Canada pension plan picked up the slack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of the overall social vision in Canada. The 
minister responsible for the Canadian social union is always going on 
about this. I have nothing against the nine other Canadian provinces 
wanting a basically standardized social program system across Canada. 
That is their choice. 
But the choices made by Quebec over the past 35 years—examples such 
as the Quebec pension plan and the Caisse de dépôt et placement were 
mentioned and we might add the separate loans and bursaries program we 
have for students, all these examples—clearly show that, in areas 
where it has full power, the Government of Quebec is closer to the 
people and able to implement programs that meet the needs of the public, 
whereas the Government of Canada was not able to achieve the same level 
of sophistication. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians may want their government to be involved in these areas, 
but all we want is to have the right to opt out, the right to perform as 
well, in other social areas, as we did with the Régime de rentes du 
Québec, and in the way we ensure a return on this money. Basically, what 
we are saying again is “Give us a chance, trust us, in other words, show 
us the same attitude as was shown under Mr. Pearson”. In this way, at 
least, we will have the options required to act and we will be able to 
take original initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is no such attitude, and this is another reason why 
Quebeckers can no longer tolerate the straightjacket that the Canadian 
federal system is for them, because we are different at the social 
level. We see things differently. We want things to be administered 
differently, and we especially want our social programs to reflect our 
social values, so that our people can have a decent standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give an example. It is true that, in the past, 
there have been interesting systems developed in Canada. The CCF and the 
NDP developed programs that were even adopted by the Liberals. 
But we see the prevailing social trends in Canada. We see, for example, 
that the Reform Party wanted to privatize the whole system, to do away 
with the values of equality and to implement a system based strictly on 
individual profitability where everyone would be responsible for 
providing for his or her own retirement, when we all know that in our 
society, people do not all have the same opportunities. People do not 
all start off with the same opportunities for training and education. 
They do not all start off with the same opportunities for employment, 
and, in the final analysis, we have sort of a responsibility as a 
government to ensure that wealth is shared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new trends on values in English Canada, that is in the nine 
other provinces, seem very dangerous to us. 
If there have to be Canada-wide standards in social areas, imagine if, 
in a few years, we were unfortunately still part of Canada and, 
moreover, the Reform Party was in power, you can rest assured that 
Quebeckers would no longer feel at all welcome in Canada. We do not want 
to go through that and we have the solution. But in the meantime, we 
want to ensure that the system that we presently have will offer the 
best possible conditions for the people concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the act to establish the investment board in order to modernize 
the Canada pension plan based on the lessons learned in the past is 
basically a good bill and the Bloc supports the general objective of 
this reform, which is to ensure the sustainability of a public pension 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has gone through several stages. There have been 
consultations at all levels, and, today, we are at the final stage for 
its passage. 
I hope that it will not meet with problems in the Senate. Although the 
senators can perhaps provide a different outlook on these issues, they 
are not in exactly the same financial circumstances as the majority of 
Quebeckers and Canadians. There are senators who can live both in Mexico 
and in Canada at the same time. It is rather singular. It is a very 
revealing example of how politics are in Canada. I am strongly against 
such a situation. So let us hope that this bill will not meet with any 
major hurdles in the Senate and that it can be passed, because we have 
to act now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new system has to be operational in January 1998, and by then 
we have to have taken steps to ensure that in 2010, 2015, 2020, we will 
not be faced with a system that is no longer sustainable. This bill 
provides for the proper control mechanisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was much debate on who should be auditing the system. It was 
decided that the board would have an external auditor to ensure its 
efficiency, but there were a number of amendments to require that 
certain situations be reported to the House. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT23"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT23"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1150

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have to watch very closely what happens, because the 
objectives of the board's directors are purely financial. 
Amendments that would have enabled people from the unions, for 
example, to make a social contribution were rejected.  They will 
have to do it some other way.  The role of watchdog will have to be 
established some other way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if it is not in the legislation as a specific mandate, I 
think Parliament will, at regular intervals, have to ensure that 
the plan meets its objectives by ensuring that private audits or 
special, as well as audits by the auditor general, are done at the 
request of the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, finally, we are making commitments for future 
generations of Canadians, for the next 20, 30, 40 and 50 years.  In 
assessing the bill, I wondered whether, if my children were covered 
by the Canada pension plan today, I would want them to live in this 
environment in the future.  Would I want them to contribute the 
same way to the plan and would I want them to have the same type of 
benefits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that they have done the best they could with a 
situation that had deteriorated over a number of years, and we can 
tell our young people there is at least an intergenerational 
balance in it.  We have tried to make their contribution lower than 
it would have been if we had waited for the catastrophe to worsen. 
We can, I think, reassure our seniors, the people who are already 
in the plan, that they can keep the previous one.  So there is some 
protection on that side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, and this will be my concluding point, we will have to 
give the same attention and show particular sensitivity to what is 
coming with the senior benefit.  In this connection, the government 
does not seem to have done its homework as well as for the 
investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As things stand now, only those aged 59 or over will be able 
to choose between the two plans replacing old age security. 
This means that people aged 52, 53, 54 or 55, who have planned 
their entire careers and their retirements according to known 
standards and rules, will see their entire futures turned topsy 
turvey.  I think that some thought will have to be given to 
allowing opting for the seniors benefit at a much younger age.  We 
might consider something around age 50 to ensure that people have 
the opportunity to plan their choices for later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also have to be accepted that consultation will need 
to be very open, and not just involve today's seniors.  They are 
protected.  The ones who already have old age pensions will be 
keeping the same program.  But the ones who have to be asked are 
the 50 and 40 years olds, and the young people, in order to see 
which plan they want for themselves and for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government to focus the same attention on old age 
pension reform as they have on the Canada pension plan and to have 
more empathy for the situation these people are experiencing 
because during 1997-98 we, as lawmakers here in Parliament, are 
going to define the frame of reference for social programs for all 
those who will retire in the next 10, 15 or 25 years, and I believe 
we cannot afford to make a mistake. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, with 
your permission, I would like to split my time with the 
illustrious member for Palliser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning we have the third reading on the debate on the 
Canada pension plan.  This is a chance to wind up, to sum up what 
has been happening in the last while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan is a plan that we as a party have 
supported since its inception in 1966.  We believe it was a great 
piece of social legislation that has had a profound impact on 
reducing the poverty of seniors in this country. 
Any way that you look at the statistics from 1966 to 1995, you 
will notice that the number of seniors living in poverty has 
dropped rather radically.  That is the only segment where the 
poverty statistics have changed in the last 30 years to any 
significant degree. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT24"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT24"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1155

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at child poverty, for example, there has not been an 
improvement.  Conditions on Indian reserves have shown no 
improvement and in the inner cities there are the same problems. 
However, there has been a vast improvement in the living 
conditions and the incidence of poverty among seniors in this 
country. That is why we are so concerned about protecting and 
enhancing the Canada pension plan in future years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pay as you go scheme.  In other words, people who are 
working today contribute to the fund so that people who are 
retired can draw a pension in recognition of the work they did in 
the past and the contributions they made.  I believe this is a 
good plan, a good way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in this country and in the people of this country and 
I believe that we could have the strongest economy of any country 
in the world.  If that was the case we could have a very strong 
and healthy Canada pension plan which would be funded for years 
and generations to come.  When I look at this and the economy of 
this country, I am optimistic that we can and will do better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern and the concern of our party about the changes to the 
Canada pension plan is that it has become more regressive.  It 
should be more progressive and based more on the ability of 
people to pay and receive benefits in accordance with their 
needs. However, with these amendments it has been made more 
regressive. I will get to that in a minute or two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summarizing the debate of the last couple of months, the 
second concern I have is the position of the Reform Party.  It 
wants to abolish the Canada pension plan, get rid of this plan, 
tear it apart, privatize it and bring in super RRSPs.  But 
members of the Reform Party cannot answer the fundamental 
questions of how that could be done and what we would do with a 
$600 billion unfunded liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is going to be a very important issue as they try to push 
this right wing, neo-conservative agenda of theirs to privatize, 
abolish, get rid of the Canada pension plan and set up a private 
scheme which would be good for the wealthy, the bankers and their 
friends who have money.  That is a big issue, one we are going to 
face when this thing is reviewed again in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform members are talking about tax grabs and all the 
negative things about the Canada pension plan.  That does not 
reflect what the Canadian people want.  They want a strong, 
public plan like the Canada pension plan, but a more progressive 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is $600 billion in the hole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  The Reform Party wants the Chilean 
example, the right wing, neo-conservative, Neanderthal examples, 
just as they want people to opt out of the Canadian Wheat Board 
and destroy it.  Well, that does not reflect what the people in 
their constituencies are saying or what the Canadian people want. 
The Canadian people want a strong, strong public plan, but a more 
progressive one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, we do have some problems with the plan. First, we 
believe that the contributions are going up too quickly and too 
steeply, 73% over the next six years.  The economy of this 
country is not as strong as it should be. If we had a stronger 
economy and more people working and higher wages in this country, 
there would not be the need to raise the premiums so fast.  That 
is why it is so important to concentrate on a job strategy, 
putting more money into research and development, more money into 
education and training and putting more people to work and 
looking at a better wage policy so that people will have a decent 
wage and a decent standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that was the case, the increase in the Canada pension plan 
would not to be a steep as it is going to be under this bill. 
There will be a 73% increase in six years.  In terms of our 
pocketbooks, it means that someone who is earning $35,800 a year 
or more will see an increase of $450 per year in premiums.  For 
the self-employed it will be doubled because they will have to 
pay both the employee and the employer's premium which for a 
person in that income range would be a $900 per year increase for 
a self-employed person making $35,800 a year or more. 
Those are some of the real problems we have with the plan. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT25"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT25"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1200

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has taken a very pessimistic scenario in terms of 
income growth in the future.  It has taken a very pessimistic 
scenario in terms of unemployment and employment growth in the 
future.  It has based its projections on an actuary report that 
gives numbers which increase the premiums by 73% over six year. 
We maintain that we have more optimism in the future of Canada 
and in the economy.  The increase does not have to be that steep 
or that regressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this is happening the government is cutting back on 
benefits by about 10%.  My main concern is that a cutback in the 
benefits of about 10% will hit those who can afford it the least, 
low income people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A preponderance of those people are women, survivors and people 
obtaining the death benefit.  All those things will be cut back 
and made more difficult to obtain.  That is a real shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP governments of B.C. and Saskatchewan are not supporting 
the initiative of the government as supported by the other 
provinces because of the cutback to low income people and because 
disability pensions will be more difficult to obtain and when 
obtained will be cutback.  That is a shame.  It is something that 
does not have to occur if we have a stronger economy and a more 
progressive way of paying into the Canada pension plan by raising 
that ceiling of $35,800 per year as a maximum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of my concerns.  We should have a more 
progressive arrangement in terms of contributions and the 
reception of benefits from the Canada pension plan.  If we do 
that there would be massive support right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the progressive way.  That is what witnesses said before 
the committee.  They did not want to privatize the plan.  They 
did not want to get into super RRSPs.  They did not want to go 
totally into the marketplace.  They wanted a more progressive 
public pension plan.  That is the argument we will make as we go 
into the next review in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a partial privatization of the plan through the 
eventual accumulation of a fund of over $100 million and a 
private investment board.  This will be pretty good for stock 
brokers, brokerage houses and banks because the fees for the fund 
will be about $500 million.  That is being greeted with a great 
deal of glee by them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned that the mandate of the pension board is only 
to maximize returns.  It is important to maximize returns but 
like the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Quebec, the Quebec 
pension plan, there should also be a balance of maximizing 
returns, maximizing employment and maximizing income benefits so 
we have investment in accordance with public policy objectives as 
well. That is not part of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also concerned that all these changes were made before 
the government tabled the seniors benefits.  It is difficult to 
consider one pension plan when we do not know when the other shoe 
will fall or what it will be when it does fall.  The seniors 
benefit will end the universality of old age pensions.  It is 
important to consider that in conjunction with the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last comment is on the whole issue of democracy.  I agree 
with the member of the Reform Party who said there were many 
amendments at committee stage.  They were supported by all four 
opposition parties.  Yet the government did not accept any of the 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a rather sad commentary on the parliamentary system when 
the four opposition parties represent 62% of the Canadian people 
and the government represents 38% of the Canadian people but 
would not accept even two or three credible opposition amendments 
supported by all four political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next review is in the year 2000.  We want a more progressive 
Canada pension plan.  We want to maintain a public pension plan 
that is more progressive, with the talk now about how we make the 
economy stronger, how we put more people to work, and how we 
provide more decent wages so people can contribute to the plan 
and make sure it is a healthy plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wave a flag of warning.  We must not privatize the Canada 
pension plan and get into the scheme of super RRSPs.  They would 
be good for the wealthy and the privileged, the people the Reform 
Party speaks for.  It is no wonder that party speaks for them. 
Its tax critic said in the House a while ago that Conrad Black 
and millionaires were paying too much in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the way to go.  The way to go is to have a public 
plan that is strong and healthy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I listened carefully to the hon. member's statements.  I 
certainly agree that the alternatives proposed by the Reform 
Party were poorly thought out and ill conceived when the needs 
and wishes of Canadians were taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to one of the hon. member's last statements about 
process, democracy and amendments that were proposed, many by the 
member himself.  He brought one report stage motion before the 
House insisting that the schedule of rates proposed under Bill 
C-2 be eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of that would be to keep the rate structure the same 
as it is under the current Canada pension plan system. 
Effectively it appears that the member decided to abandon 
Canadian youth and the pensioners of the future and to make them 
pay more rather than support a schedule which smoothes out the 
burden of funding the Canada pension plan for all workers without 
touching today's seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member explain to Canadians why he wants today's youth 
to pay more? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly do not.  That 
is why I said we needed a stronger economy.  If the Liberals had 
kept their basic promises in the red book of jobs, jobs, jobs, 
building a strong economy, putting Canadians to work, bringing 
down the unemployment rate and increasing salaries, the rates 
would not need to be as high as the government is proposing in 
Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a trick in terms of a pay as you go plan, a plan which 
means that workers of today pay into the fund to pay pensions to 
the workers of yesterday.  That is what the plan is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as unemployment is sitting at 9%, 9.5% or 10% year after 
year after year, fewer people are contributing to the plan and 
fewer people are contributing a good sum to the plan.  That is 
the main way of getting the rates down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also moved an amendment to lift the ceiling of $35,800 that 
is there today.  The reason is twofold.  The first reason is that 
someone making $35,800 a year pays the maximum amount into the 
plan.  A lot of people are making that kind of salary.  Senators 
and MPs make more than that but we subject to that cap.  We pay 
as much into that plan as somebody making $35,800, or someone 
making $200,000 or $300,000 pays the same amount into the Canada 
pension plan as someone making $35,800.  That is unfair and 
should be changed.  We are flagging that for the next review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance agreed that some of these matters would 
be looked at.  I say to the member opposite that we should make 
this more progressive, along the lines we have been talking about 
in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also talked about democracy.  The Canadian Union of Public 
Employees was not allowed to make a presentation to the 
committee.  It represents 500,000 workers.  The Council of 
Canadians, by the way, circulated a petition and got back over 
500,000 petitions which I personally brought to the office of the 
Minister of Finance.  Its was not allowed to make a presentation 
to the committee.  That might have been the largest petition in 
the history of Canada.  There were 11 mail bags full. The member 
from Calgary was very impressive carrying 4,000 faxes.   That was 
very positive, but 500,000 petitions is extremely progressive. 
Yet the council was not allowed to make a presentation before the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to the question the member asked about democracy.  It 
is real democracy when committees start hearing from groups that 
represent Canadians in such large numbers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
pick up where the member for Qu'Appelle left off in his earlier 
remarks.  I congratulate him at the same time for the work he has 
done on this important piece of legislation. 
The hon. member for Qu'Appelle said there should have been an 
overall look at pensions.  Rather than that the government has 
endeavoured to do it with a piecemeal approach.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government took the attitude that the sky was falling and 
that we had to move immediately.  Our caucus would have preferred 
to have looked at the entire pension plan, including the old age 
security plan, the guaranteed income supplement and the Canada 
pension plan.  Apparently those other reviews are being held over 
for another day.  As a result this is a piecemeal approach which 
greatly concerns us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day the Canada pension plan will be less than 
what it was before.  We are very concerned that when the 
government gets around to introducing the seniors benefit it will 
have a negative effect on the pension plan of seniors and their 
overall level of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 has failed people in just about every way imaginable. 
The government has failed to look at the plans overall.  It has 
failed to allow the chief actuary to look at the projections of 
incomes and outflows and determine what he or she thinks will be 
the future of the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member of Qu'Appelle said, the government failed to 
expand the earning base.  The cutoff is $35,800.  It does not 
matter whether one earns $100,000, $200,000 or perhaps a couple 
of million dollars a year.  If one pays taxes in Canada the 
maximum cutoff on CPP is $35,800.  It is clearly an unfair 
program contrasted with that of the United States where the 
cutoff works out, in Canadian dollars, to be about $88,000.  It 
is clear what we are trying to get at.  There would be a 
different level of fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is apparently saying that he will be prepared to 
look at the issue when it is reviewed in two or three years.  We 
will certainly try to hold him to that commitment but one wonders 
why we could not have looked at it in this round of pension 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 is failing the people of Canada with the 10% cut to 
which my colleague referred earlier.  Another area that could 
have been easily fixed is the dropout years for women who 
remained home a short number of years ago to raise their 
children.  We see less and less of that today, but in the not so 
distant past families were able to survive on one income.  That 
is not the way it is done any more.  Many women took time out 
from the workforce to raise their families and then returned to 
work.  These reforms, to use the polite term, will impact on 
those folks significantly and most unfairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An anomaly was pointed out to me by a lawyer in the Moose Jaw 
area concerned about couples who separated or divorced prior to 
1978.  As I was advised, after 1978 pensions were split equitably 
between the male and the female of a dissolved marriage but 
before then there was no retroactivity.  Women who are reaching 
their retirement years are suddenly learning to their shock and 
chagrin that the money they thought they were entitled to is in 
fact not there.  This is another area that could have been fixed 
during the CPP review but such was not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Living conditions have improved significantly for seniors in the 
not too distant past for many different reasons. 
We certainly welcome that and want to see those living conditions 
continue to improve.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Child poverty groups which are concerned about the elimination 
of that unfortunate social condition have noted that seniors' 
conditions have benefited in the past.  I think that this bill 
will show quite quickly that these benefits are not going to 
continue for very long.  It is an unfortunate program and it will 
not enhance the living conditions of our seniors who deserve a 
lot better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude my remarks by remembering the work done on 
social programs by the father of the current Minister of Finance. 
Paul Martin Sr. worked with folks like the late Stanley Knowles, 
Tommy Douglas and others to improve the retirement benefits so 
that our seniors who had worked hard all their lives for this 
country could retire with a degree of comfort, security and 
dignity.  I believe that he would be appalled at what is being 
brought forth by the current Liberal government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member made reference 
to actually doing nothing with the plan and hoping that greater 
economic growth would take care of the challenges which the 
Canada pension plan faces.  I would submit that is what past 
governments have done.  For the first time we have a government 
which is responding to what Canadians have said they want through 
consultations. Canadians want changes to be made to the plan to 
ensure its sustainability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going further, the chief actuary has actually made the 
calculation that with the inclusion of 150,000 more Canadians 
being employed, the effect would be to reduce the steady state 
rate from 9.9% to 9.856%.  Effectively the increase in the growth 
in the economy is still not sufficient to achieve the 
sustainability of the plan.  That is why the changes were made, 
to ensure that the plan will be there for Canadians in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member referred to the U.S. plan and how effective it is. Is 
the NDP member saying that he wants to increase the age of 
retirement which is the case in the United States of America? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We require a made in Canada solution.  We have done that by 
going to Canadians and ensuring that Canadians had an opportunity 
to be heard on the Canada pension plan.  The suggestions made by 
Canadians in consultations are reflected in Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we mirror the U.S. plan, as the hon. member has stated in 
his comments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Palliser did not state what is being alleged by the parliamentary 
secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To deal with his points, he suggests that I favour the American 
plan.  What I was trying to get at, and I thought I had 
indicated, was that the American plan has a higher threshold than 
the Canadian plan.  Under the American plan the cutoff rate would 
be in the neighbourhood of $88,000 Canadian as opposed to 
$35,800. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To suggest that I want a higher age of retirement, the answer is 
no.  But do I want a fairer system in this country?  Absolutely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That takes me back to the first point which was made by the 
parliamentary secretary, which was that we are not suggesting any 
increases.  That is obviously incorrect.  We want to have a 
broader based amount of earnings going into the plan.  If we had 
a cutoff rate higher than $35,800 we would have more money in the 
plan and it would provide a better return for people at the lower 
end.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to take part in the debate on a bill which will have an impact 
not only in the coming months or years, but for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to stress how important it is for each party sitting 
in the House to propose clear and understandable alternatives to 
Canadians. This is a good example of an issue concerning which it is not 
enough to oppose for the sake of opposing, to merely say “I am opposed 
to this or that provision”. The impact of this legislation on the lives 
of Canadians is such that we must clearly say where we stand regarding 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NDP members have expressed views which, I think, are rather clear. 
I do not agree with a number of their ideas, but I give them credit for 
being clear. The same goes for the Liberal government. Today, I will 
talk about our own choices and those of all the parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to thank two members of this House for making an 
exceptional contribution to this debate. They did so with great rigour 
and honesty. The first one is the hon. member for Markham, our finance 
and Treasury Board critic, whom I sincerely thank for his contribution. 
The second one is the hon. member for Madawaska—Restigouche, our human 
resources development critic, who also did an exceptional job regarding 
this issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this piece of legislation came before the House, we 
consented in good faith that it go to second reading and to 
committee so that in committee we could have a real debate about 
the impact of this legislation.  We did it assuming that the 
government would be listening.  Assuming.  We were wrong. Very 
wrong. The government did not listen.  It did not listen, it did 
not pay attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to point out to Canadians that this Liberal 
government is ramming this through Parliament now.  It is the 
steamroller approach.  There is a reason for this.  It has to do 
with the fact that it is trying to get this done before Canadians 
actually find out what hit them and what has happened to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the parliamentary secretary smiling and smirking on the 
other side of the House.  What the government is going to say is, 
“We concocted a deal with the provinces.  We have to make this 
happen now”.  I can hear it now.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked to provincial governments and provincial 
governments have told us very clearly that there is a lot of time 
to get this through and there are a number of disagreements that 
they have with the federal government on this.   But no, this has 
to be done now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this House of Commons, and the election only happened six 
months ago, this government has imposed closure on this bill 
twice.  So much for democracy.  So much for openness.  So much 
for accountability. Let me speak briefly on why that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canadians this is an $11 billion bite out of our economy. In 
six years this government is literally going to go out and suck 
$11 billion out of the Canadian economy through nothing less than 
added payroll taxes by increasing premiums 73%.  It is already 
sucking $12 billion to $13 billion out of our economy through 
payroll taxes and employment insurance premiums that it need not 
do for the purpose of bringing down the deficit. Why is the 
government doing it?  It must be because we have 9.1% 
unemployment and it is not high enough.  The government wants it 
to actually go higher.  This is the choice it has made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the government is trying to ram it through. This is 
why this debate is happening at this point in time as opposed to 
having the debate we should have had so that Canadians would be 
allowed to know what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned a little earlier about the importance of every 
political party putting forward their position.  I cannot allow 
this debate to happen without talking frankly and honestly to 
Canadians about the failure of the Reform Party to deal with this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would think that the Reform Party as the official opposition 
would have the obligation not only to oppose but to present a 
view. What we have instead is the $600 billion hole.  The Reform 
Party said that it would like to have some sort of recognition 
bond. 
However, there are $600 billion worth of liabilities now taken in 
the CPP.  The Reform Party's position is that we should just 
scrap it, forget it and forget those Canadians who are old and 
sick and although they gave money into the system let us just cut 
them off. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a pretty good example of ideology gone haywire.  It is 
similar to the position the Reform Party took on Kyoto, the 
climate change debate, where there is apparently no science.  We 
soon expect the Reform Party to announce to us that cigarette 
smoke is good for our health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that spirit, the Reform's position on the CPP is one that has 
weakened the debate because we would have expected the official 
opposition to play its role and offer a position.  I think the 
Liberals would agree with us on that failure.  I see them nodding 
on the other side.  I think the NDP and the Bloc would agree as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a few problems with this legislation.  We agree that the 
CPP should be made sustainable.  We need to help Canadians and 
ensure that this fund is put on a very solid footing.  In order 
to allow this to happen, yes, we agree that regrettably there has 
to be an increase in premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then take a very different position from that of the 
government in that this increase in premiums cannot be allowed to 
happen without offsetting this increase with tax reductions, in 
particular with reductions in other payroll taxes such as 
employment insurance premiums. By the way, so that we are clear 
on where the government stands on this, this was exactly the 
position taken by the Government of Ontario in regard to changes 
to the CPP.  This is exactly the position it took. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What did your government do under 
Mulroney? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  This is exactly the position we 
took. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You guys failed the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not intend to try 
to talk over the members of the Reform Party and listen to the 
sounds from the other side.  I do not know whether they intend to 
just stand there and heckle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You want to see courtesy?  What about 
during the election when someone called our leader a bigot on 
four occasions?  That was courtesy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Hon. members, if we 
cannot comport ourselves here, how can we possibly be expected to 
lead the rest of the country.  Let us leave this kind of thing to 
some other venue.  Let us leave this kind of debate for another 
time and another place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I think it 
has to be clear that physical threats in this place are not going 
to silence any of its members and certainly not me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Sherbrooke is a practised, very capable, very confident and very 
experienced parliamentarian and will certainly keep the remarks 
to the point and to the debate at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the first point of 
divergence we have with this legislation the government is 
putting forward is that there should be offsetting tax reductions 
to avoid $11 billion being literally sucked out of our economy 
for the purpose of sustaining this fund, when in fact there 
should be a reduction in payroll taxes to allow jobs to be 
created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me add a very important element which we need to keep in 
mind in regard to these payroll taxes. 
These are the most damaging taxes with regard to employment, in 
particular for the most vulnerable in our society:  women, 
lower-income Canadians and young Canadians.  They are the ones 
who are the most affected when we increase payroll taxes in our 
economy, whether it is through CPP or whether it is through EI. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another change that we would like to see happening, that we 
propose, is the change in the yearly basic exemption.  The 
government is freezing that exemption at $3,500 and again by 
doing that is targeting the most vulnerable people in our 
society.  Who are the people that this freeze affects the most? 
Part-time workers, students, women, low-income earners. These are 
the people who will be the most affected by this freeze. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted to be constructive in committee.  The member for 
Markham tried and we certainly felt as a political party, 
contrary to others, that we should propose some amendments, make 
some suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that respect we proposed a revision of this exemption 10 
years after the legislation would have been enacted.  Did the 
government listen to this suggestion?  The answer is “no”. 
There is a very constructive change that could have allowed 
low-income Canadians a break rather than being left out in the 
cold by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other change I mentioned was with regard to payroll taxes. I 
want to speak specifically to the suggestion that we made through 
an amendment.  We suggested to the government that it could 
offset in the next three years the increase in CPP premiums with 
reductions in EI premiums.  It could have included that in the 
legislation to guarantee Canadians that they would not be hurt by 
these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Markham, our critic, made that suggestion.  He 
did it in good faith.  Yet, the government turned it down.  At 
the same time, what do we learn from the chief actuary of the 
employment insurance fund of Canada?  The fund could very well 
sustain itself with a premium level of $2 instead of $2.70.  The 
government is actually using the employment insurance fund again 
to reduce its deficit, to try to balance its books.  On whose 
backs is it doing it?  On the backs of the unemployed at a time 
when we have unemployment above 9%.  Again, this was rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We presented another amendment that would have forced the 
government to return to Parliament, to the House of Commons, if 
premiums went to 10.25%.  They are now scheduled to go to 9.9%. 
Did it listen to that?  Is debate something that it wants?  No. 
The answer again was “no”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another change that our party proposed to try to add to this 
legislation was to get rid of the foreign investment rule. Canada 
in the global equity market represents about 3% of that market. 
Yet, the Government of Canada, the Liberal government still 
thinks it knows best and it imposes a foreign investment rule of 
20%.  More money keeps pouring into the equity markets. Whose 
money is this, by the way?  It is the Canadian taxpayers' money. 
They should be allowed to get the best benefit from that 
investment.  They should be allowed to have access to the best 
investors so that this money can grow so that their retirement 
money can actually benefit them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To tell you how embarrassed the government is, I even see 
Liberal members on the other side nodding.  They want to nod. 
They are embarrassed by this, and they should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  They are nodding off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  The member from Hamilton recognizes 
that they are sleeping again.  I concur with his view.  They are 
nodding off.  Nodding off actually explains why they stick to 
this rule on foreign investment for no good reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think of what is going to happen in a very short period of time. 
This fund will have close to a hundred billion dollars in it to 
be invested in Canada's marketplace.  How are we to expect a 
return on this investment if the investors are not allowed to 
invest where they can get the most on that return? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the changes we propose.  There are also very 
important changes with regard to accountability and transparency. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards transparency, there are some very important issues. 
These issues are not new, since the Caisse de dépôt et placement du 
Québec has had to deal with them for quite a while. Year after year, the 
Quebec auditor general complains about not being allowed to audit the 
accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B>  So it is not the perfect example. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1235

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B> One might have expected that the government, 
which wanted to borrow a good idea from Quebec by taking the structures 
of the Caisse de dépôt et placement as a model, would also have paid 
attention to the Quebec auditor general, who is complaining about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, instead they seem to have got it backward. They told themselves 
“Hey, in Quebec, it looks like the Caisse de dépôt et placement was able 
to hide behind that screen. Let us follow that lead and hide behind the 
same screen”. While the normal thing to do would have been to designate 
the auditor general as the auditor of the new board of directors 
responsible for investing funds, they did not do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fairness to the government, I must say that it opened a door by 
providing that the auditor general may conduct an audit. Granted, it has 
come some way on this issue, but the responsibility should have been 
assigned directly to the auditor general so that he could look after the 
financial auditing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes for the Access to Information Act. Whenever we raise 
this issue, we are told “But there are investment decisions to 
make.” 
Let us be clear. The Access to Information Act itself provides for 
exceptions that would easily allow the board to protect itself against 
the disclosure of sensitive information while making the operation of 
the fund transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a secondary issue. I submit to the House that, to 
enhance credibility, to ensure that those in charge of administering the 
fund enjoy credibility with the Canadian public, it is important, very 
important indeed to make this fund transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My conclusion is somewhat bleak. Personally, I wish the government 
had listened more carefully to what we had to say. We clearly stated our 
positions during the election campaign. It is in black and white in our 
election platform. I can even tell you on what page: pages 19 through to 
22, for those who are interested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it provide for? To increase rates, yes, but to reduce 
taxes and employment insurance premiums accordingly so that income tax 
does not increase. Second, to create an investment fund at arm's length 
from the government similar to those found elsewhere. 
Take for instance the Ontario teachers' pension fund, which is a model 
to follow and from which a few ideas could be borrowed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the things that we suggested in our platform, as I said, 
can be read on pages 19, 20, 21 and 22.  It is there in black and 
white, numbers included, everything from A to Z on our position. 
To increase premiums, offset them with tax reductions for 
employment insurance and tax reductions.  Create an independent 
board for investment, independent in the true sense.  Make it 
transparent.  Most of all, do not create a new $11 billion tax 
grab from Canadians that is going to kill jobs in our economy 
because this government has lost sight of the fact that 9.1% of 
Canadians are unemployed, a large number of whom are young 
Canadians suffering in this labour market.  It is about time that 
we also give them a break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I see that there are 
a number of questions and comments.  I would ask hon. members to 
keep their questions and responses short. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very carefully to the member for Sherbrooke.  I was 
puzzled because he was a member of the cabinet under the Mulroney 
government and he has the audacity to stand in the House and talk 
about EI premium reductions.  I am confused because sometimes he 
refers to them as premiums and sometimes as taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him what decrease they made during their 
mandate when he was a cabinet minister, contrary to when this 
government took office in 1993 and reduced the EI premiums to the 
tune of $1.4 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks about unemployment today being at 9.1% when under the 
Conservative administration it was almost 11.5%.  However, we 
have created over a million jobs.  He also talks about making the 
system sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He calls the EI contributions taxes, but I call them premiums. 
However, they kept raising the premiums because there was no 
reserve to fall back on in difficult times when there was high 
unemployment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about offsetting them with payroll deductions.  He 
talked about them in terms of deductions, in terms of payroll 
taxes.  He talks about sustainability.  We are looking toward an 
era of sustainability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about an independent investment fund.  That has 
already been put in place.  I do not know where the member has 
been.  I know he is in the House today.  He is often in the 
House.  We have already brought forward an independent investment 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am more confused when he talks about an $11 billion tax bite. 
That is just not true.  I say to the member, through you, Mr. 
Speaker, that is being intellectually dishonest because this is 
money put aside for pensions for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not surprised 
that the member for Scarborough Centre would be confused.  He 
should be.  I want to use his own words.  He says he is confused. 
How else could he be confused? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the member for Mount Royal, they ran in 1993 on a red book 
that said that they were opposed to free trade and now we 
implemented free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Against the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  This is the same member for 
Scarborough Centre if I understand correctly, like the member for 
Mount Royal, who said they were opposed to the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  —gonna resign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  The member is shaking his head.  Is 
he for or against the GST?  Of course, his prime minister said 
they had created the GST, right? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member confused?  Yes, he should be confused.  Is he 
thoroughly confused?  Yes, he is thoroughly confused, and I can 
see why.  This is the same group of parliamentarians who fought 
tooth and nail any idea of deficit and debt reduction and now 
this has become the new mantra. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we say in French, if there is one thing that we can say about 
this Liberal government—and my colleague, the hon. member for 
Chicoutimi, is well aware of this—it is that they have been very 
consistent in acting on our ideas, not their own but our ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is confused. Let me enlighten him. He said we 
increased employment insurance premiums— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member for Scarborough Centre said we increased 
employment insurance premiums, what he forgets to add is that we 
did it also in a period of recession when there was a need for 
money in the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference with this government is that it is creating 
unnecessarily a $12 billion to $13 billion surplus for the 
purpose of paying down the deficit for which this fund was never 
created. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can 
hardly contain my enthusiasm to go after the hon. leader of the 
Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no confusion on the part of this hon. member because I 
sat on that side of the House from 1988 to 1993 in opposition 
when this hon. member of the Conservative Party sat on this side 
of the House, first as secretary of state for fitness and amateur 
sport and then he moved on—I will not say how.  I do not want to 
get into that today—to become the minister of the environment. 
That was six months later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That member sat at a cabinet table, a Conservative cabinet table 
with his good friend, Brian, at the helm.  That hon. member 
watched as EI premiums went up to $3.20 on their way to $3.30. 
This hon. member has the unmitigated gall to stand in his place 
and start accusing this government when that member was in in the 
best of times, from 1984 to 1993.  He sat in this House when the 
economy was booming, when people were working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had the opportunity to do something about the deficit, about 
the debt, about EI, about CPP and he did nothing, not a damn 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I would ask all hon. 
members to address their comments, even their vociferous comments 
to each other, through the Chair and we will try to get through 
the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think there 
is any amount of huffing and puffing coming from the hon. member 
that will change the tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying a little earlier, if there is some confusion in 
his mind on where they stood, there rightfully should be some. 
This is the same member who in 1993 guaranteed Canadians health 
care.  He stood in his place and voted for a 35%— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  He denounced NAFTA and the FTA and 
then he went on to implement that.

Canada today than since this member was elected as a member of 
the government in 1993.  That is his record.  At one point I hope 
he will grow up and face his responsibilities and stop blaming 
others and stop saying— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the debate on the Investment Board, it 
should be remembered that we are faced with this issue because of the 
inaction of previous governments. I would like the leader of the 
Conservative Party to explain briefly to us why today, in 1997, we are 
considering such a bill, when we knew 10 or 15 years ago that there were 
major problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1984 to 1993, there was a Conservative government. During 
those years, the Conservatives' approach was to maximize economic 
development, or at least to implement measures to do so. Consider, for 
example, the idea of an investment board. 
Why did the Conservative Party not come up with this idea in 1985, 1986, 
1987, say at the end of the first mandate, having had time to become 
acquainted with the issues? Today, we are faced with a situation where 
future generations will pay for 15 years of inaction. We are doing our 
utmost to avoid being unfair to the younger generations, but there will 
nevertheless be an intergenerational equity problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the reason for this is that action was not 
taken quickly enough in the past, with the Canada pension plan, to 
create a body that would ensure that there is enough money in the fund 
to provide for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank the 
hon. member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques 
for his question, which is a good question, an honest question. In fact, 
I asked myself the same question, I talked about it with colleagues, and 
this is what I can tell him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, amending the Canada pension plan legislation requires 
the approval of a number of provincial governments. You are no doubt 
aware that this, fortunately, cannot be done unilaterally by the federal 
government. It requires the agreement of two-thirds of the provinces 
representing at least two-thirds of the Canadian population, which 
explains why the federal government has limited scope for action in 
making such amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We discussed such changes with the provincial governments as openly 
as we could. 
I must admit to the member today that we did not succeed in convincing 
them of the need we saw to bring about a number of changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, and I want to add this so that it is clear to him and also 
because the other members will be interested to know this, they were 
determined to stop going around in circles. How could they break this 
logjam? Since they could not arrive at an agreement, they included in 
the last series of statutory amendments a clause providing for an 
automatic increase in contributions, so that the provincial governments 
were faced with an alternative that was even less attractive than a 
potential agreement. And then there was a change of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am telling my colleague for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques is that, if 
there is an agreement today, it will be due in large part to the 
fact that, as we expected a deadlock, we included in the bill a 
provision for a mechanism that was going to force the parties— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I am sorry, but the hon. 
member has run out of time. Resuming debate. The hon. member for 
Mississauga South. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak on Bill C-2 to establish the Canada pension 
plan investment board and to make other amendments to the Canada 
Pension Plan Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to get some principles down very quickly for 
members so that we can put the bill in its context.  Members will 
know that the Canada pension plan came in 1966 in response to a 
very serious need to address our retirees in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan came in in 1966 and seniors who were retiring, who had 
come through two wars as well as the depressions of the thirties 
and the forties, were faced with real poverty. 
It was important that Canadians made the decision that it was 
time for us to have a universal pension plan that could help 
Canadians enjoy the dignity of their retirement.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current seniors who first came into the plan did not 
contribute very much to the Canada pension plan but they started 
to receive benefits a year later.  Full benefits were received by 
pensioners as early as 1970.  That raises the issue of who is 
paying for those benefits.  The important issue was that we had 
to provide retirement benefits for our seniors.  Therefore the 
plan was established on a pay as you go basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means today's workers are paying premiums into a plan.  The 
accumulated premiums are then used to fund and to pay benefits to 
today's seniors.  Members will know that today's seniors paid no 
more than $10,000 in total into the Canada pension plan.  Yet the 
annual benefits today from the plan are some $8,800 per year.  It 
is a very generous plan.  It is so generous that the chief 
actuary indicated in his report that we can no longer sustain 
that level of benefits with the current premium structure. This 
is not a mistake.  It is simply a function of the changes that 
were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should be aware that important changes were made.  When 
the plan was first introduced it was a clear pension plan.  Since 
that time there have been some very significant and important 
changes for the benefit of all Canadians.  The survivor's benefit 
was introduced.  It is a very important income component for 
retirees who have lost a spouse.  It targets the needs of single 
women in retirement.  It is a very important factor in dealing 
with seniors, in particular with women who live a little longer 
according to the mortality tables, that we care for them. That is 
why gender analysis was necessary in the preparation of this and 
other legislation, to ensure that we are caring for our seniors 
and those in most need, in this case senior women in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disability element of the Canada pension plan was brought in 
to ensure that Canadians who were unable to work because of 
disabilities would not fall through the cracks, that they would 
have benefits that were just as rich as the retirement benefit. 
This would make sure they had the assistance they need in their 
time of need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Canada pension plan was conceived,  it was contemplated 
that the premium rates in the original Canada pension plan would 
be in the range of about 5.5%.  Today the rate is 5.85%.  When 
the disability and survivor benefits were introduced no changes 
were made to increase the premiums.  The benefits received by 
Canadian beneficiaries rose substantially whereas the premiums 
did not track those increased benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also take into account the aging of our society.  When 
the plan started there were eight workers for every one retiree. 
Today there are five workers for every one retiree.  With the 
baby boom generation moving through the system it is projected 
that we will have three workers for every retiree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to confirm with the Chair that I am splitting my time 
with the Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources 
Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 is unique in the sense that it is not a bill that has 
come forward as a result of a party platform or some initiative 
of the government.  Its uniqueness lies in what resulted from the 
mandatory consultations with the provinces and the territories, 
which are jointly responsible for the Canada pension plan system, 
and in what resulted from the exhaustive cross-Canada 
consultations with Canadians and groups representing every vested 
interest group across the country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain principles were laid down to guide the enactment of Bill 
C-2.  One of the most important has to do with the principle of 
intergenerational equity.  One of the most important elements has 
to do with whether today's seniors who are receiving a 
substantial benefit, much more substantial than future seniors 
would ever receive, should be responsible for dealing with any 
portion of the accrued benefits sitting with the Canada pension 
plan today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want Canadians and all members to know that with consultations 
with Canadians and the consensus of the provinces the decision 
was taken that Bill C-2 should not impact today's beneficiaries 
under the CPP plan.  That means that today's pensioners as a 
result of Bill C-2 will not be impacted by the changes being 
contemplated by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that today's Canadians receiving disability or survivor 
benefits, regardless of age, will not be impacted by the changes 
contemplated by Bill C-2. That is a very important principle and 
it is a very important message so that we do not alarm current 
seniors as to whether there is any impact on their retirement 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision made in consultation with Canadians and with the 
approval of two-thirds of the provinces representing two-thirds 
of the population of the country was that the planned increase to 
10.1% in the year 2010 which would keep the Canada pension plan 
sustainable was not a sufficient approach to dealing with the 
realities of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision was taken that rather than waiting until the year 
2010 to increase the premiums, the increases should start in 
1998.  Today's rate is 5.85%.  In consultations with Canadians 
they wanted the Canada pension plan to remain, they wanted it to 
be there for their retirement, that we should start making those 
increases in the premiums today, not in the year 2010. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take those increases today and introduce them gradually 
over the next six years up to 9.9%, that would mean that we would 
be spreading the burden more equitably across the generations, 
excluding today's seniors. That is fair.  It is equitable and it 
is the right thing to do.  I think that is our job, to do the 
right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 9.9% is very important to understand.  It is called a steady 
state rate.  It is the premiums rate that has to be charged on 
insurable earnings that will ensure that the plan is sustainable, 
indexed, secure and available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is not just a pension plan.  I believe the Canada pension 
plan is misnamed.  It should be the Canada pension and insurance 
plan because we do have survivor benefits, we do have death 
benefits, we do have other insurance components.  The 9.9% is 
made up of four elements: 4.3% is the cost associated with 
providing pensions; 1.7% is the cost associated with the 
insurance benefits, the survivor, disability and death 
benefits; .1% is for the administration of the plan; 3.8% is the 
collective sharing of the accrued benefits all remaining and 
future workers will pay to ensure that current seniors continue 
to receive their benefits and that this plan remains on a sustainable basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day during prayers the Speaker reads out a line that we 
hope that we will be here to make good legislation and wise 
decisions.  In my view Bill C-2 meets those criteria. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the member who just spoke was privileged, as I was, to 
be in committee to listen to the evidence and the experts so that 
we could evaluate and judge this legislation well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we heard from the chief actuary of the fund 
and from others is there are of course no guarantees at all that 
the contribution rate of 9.9% will not continue to rise. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would ask the member what he says to Canadians who are 
very concerned about this escalating and almost sure to continue 
escalating mandatory contribution which many Canadians find to be 
a real hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read some letters today in my speech.  I wish I could have 
read more.  I received 4,000 of them, but I had to pick and 
choose.  Those letters contained heartfelt pleas from young, 
struggling, single parents, parents of young children as well as 
a young couple who are living in their truck.  They all said that 
they cannot afford these continued costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the hon. member say to these Canadians?  Can we afford 
to continue to pay more and more for less and less? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief actuary and other witnesses confirmed that although 
people are making very substantial contributions to the CPP, they 
will only receive a 1.8% return on their investment over their 
lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are struggling.  They are being mandated to pay a very 
substantial amount of money every year into this plan and they 
will receive far less than the value of their contributions.  How 
does the member justify this to Canadians?  How can he look 
Canadians in the eye and say “Pay this.  You are not going to 
get much back, but we are going to make you pay it anyway”? What 
does he have to say to Canadians who are struggling? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is the heart of the 
reason why I feel that the Reform Party has not done a service to 
the House by suggesting such nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains that under the prescribed rates in Bill C-2, 
Canadians will not receive less than they put in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has failed to mention that the 1.8% return to which 
she has referred is the real rate of return.  It is the return 
which one would get after allowing for inflation.  She knows very 
well that the inflation assumption in Bill C-2 and in the 
actuary's report was 3.5%.  That means that Canadians will 
receive a return of over 5%.  In fact, it will be 5.3%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said it correctly.  A worker who 
starts today and pays through their lifetime at the prescribed 
rates will receive $1.80 for every $1 put in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other fact which the member failed to recognize is that 
under the Income Tax Act, Canada pension plan premiums paid are 
eligible for a non-refundable income tax credit.  In Canada, on 
average, that means there is a 26% reduction in taxes payable as 
a result of having paid Canada pension plan premiums.  That means 
that each and every one of her calculations are in error because 
she has failed to recognize the real calculations in income tax 
returns.  She has misled Canadians.  She has put on the table 
fearmongering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I flatly reject the premise of the Reform Party that moving to 
an RRSP system would be better because it totally ignores two 
things.  Number one, it ignores the current accrued benefits 
which today's workers receive.  Number two, it ignores the fact 
that the pensioners have insurance benefits as well.  She gives 
no credit whatsoever to survivor benefits, to the death benefit, 
to disability benefits or to children's benefits.  That is the 
reason they can put these terrible numbers on the floor in an 
effort to scare Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should have nothing to do with the Reform Party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak in support of Bill C-2.  It is one of the most 
important social policy initiatives of the last several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since a Liberal government established the Canada pension plan a 
generation ago, it has become a cornerstone of our retirement 
income system. 
The CPP has contributed greatly to seniors' dignity and 
independence and has helped us drastically reduce poverty among 
seniors.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP is also symbolic of the kind of society we as Canadians 
have built, a society where we encourage individual effort but 
strive to use our national wealth to ensure a basic standard of 
living for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before us today represents values, not just the 
values of the Liberal government which introduced the bill, but 
more important, the values that Canadians from coast to coast to 
coast embrace.  It is about protecting today's seniors.  It is 
about ensuring that we in the baby boom generation pay our fair 
share toward the Canada pension plan.  It is about handing down a 
viable public pension system to our children and grandchildren.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the member is quite right.  I used those words and I withdraw 
those words, uncategorically.  I should have said “she is 
mistaken.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault:</B>  Madam Speaker, now that we have that 
cleared up, as I was saying, the Canada pension plan is about 
protecting today's seniors and about ensuring that we in the baby 
boom generation pay our fair share toward the Canada pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about handing down a viable public pension system to our 
children and grandchildren.  It is about a society that believes 
we have an obligation to use our national wealth to look after 
one another and ensure the dignity of each and every citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be part of a government that shares those values 
and I am proud to support this incredibly important piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Canada pension plan has been a major success story, we 
recognize that changes are necessary in order to keep up with the 
changing world. We are well aware of the challenges facing the 
Canada pension plan.  I think it is obvious to Canadians, but let 
me reiterate what they are; an aging society and the prospect of 
telling our children to pay almost three times as much as we do 
for the same benefits.  Obviously, the demographic problems have 
been there for a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just heard the leader of the fifth party speak of what a 
nasty government the Liberal government is for bringing forward 
these changes. Well, the reason we are bringing these changes is 
because the Conservative government in previous Parliaments, and 
one that I sat in 1988 to 1993, knew of the issues and the 
problems we were facing and yet nothing was done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the House and as a government, we decided that it 
was time to engage and consult with Canadians, and that is 
exactly what we have done.  The message that Canadians gave us 
was loud and clear.  Canadians told us to preserve the Canada 
pension plan as a public and universal retirement income plan.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They told us to leave the standard retirement age at 65.  They 
told us to preserve disability benefits.  They told us not to 
penalize people who leave the workforce for a time to care for 
their families or to upgrade their education.  They told us to 
make better investment decisions and increase the return on the 
CPP fund.  They also told us to protect people already in the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to stand here today and tell my constituents that we 
have delivered.  The legislation before us today meets the 
priorities expressed by Canadians and the agreement on the Canada 
pension plan means that the public pension plan will be preserved 
for future generations.  It means that seniors will continue to 
benefit from a secure and guaranteed source of income.  It also 
means that as a baby boomer, I am not telling my young children 
to pay more and more to support me in my retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the emphasis that we wanted to make in the House today 
and this is the emphasis that was placed in the negotiations and 
discussions that we had with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the people at home are aware that these 
changes that are being made to the Canada pension plan are not 
being made by the Government of Canada alone.  It is in fact an 
agreement with all of the provinces.  In order to achieve a major 
agreement of this kind, the Canada pension plan requires the 
agreement of at least seven provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to be able to stand here and talk about the Canada 
pension plan changes today, we were able to obtain the agreement 
of eight provinces as well as one territory.  As members know 
about federal-provincial relations, that in itself shows the 
tremendous support that Canadians have for their public pension 
plan and the tremendous support that all levels of government of 
various political stripes place on preserving the Canada pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, most representatives of the people believe in 
and are committed to the Canada pension plan. I realize that some 
of my colleagues across the floor are ignoring their constituents 
on this, but I will come back to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond the historic achievement of reaching an agreement between 
us and so many levels of government, what have we accomplished? 
We have ensured stable and secure funding for the CPP.  Yes, 
contributions will rise to 9.9%.  However, that is a lot better 
than the 14% that we would have to pay to make this pension plan 
and the rate stable over the long period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased contributions will allow us to build a large reserve 
fund and instead of lending it to the provinces at a bargain 
basement rate, a professional and independent management board 
will invest the funds in order to maximize returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to return a little bit to what the opposition is saying 
in the House.  It is important to note, if I can, that the Tories 
did nothing.  In fact, if they would have done something between 
1984 and 1993, we would not be standing here having to talk about 
it.  As a matter of fact, I sat on one of those committees 
between 1988 and 1993 where we reviewed what the Canada pension 
plan needed to have done to it and the Tories basically decided 
to do nothing because they were afraid of the political 
consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now go to the Reform Party.  The Reform Party calls our CPP 
proposal a tax grab.  What it does not tell Canadians is that its 
scheme would cost individuals even more.  What it does not tell 
Canadians is that its scheme would eliminate disability benefits 
and that it would penalize people who temporarily leave the 
workplace to care for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition does not tell us that its system would leave each 
and every Canadian completely at the mercy of the stock market. 
One bad year at the age of 64 and all of a sudden your savings 
are all gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most shameful of all of the opposition's rhetoric on this is 
that it has not told us how it would cover the cost of benefits 
of current seniors as well as the outstanding liabilities for 
contributions people have already made.  That is the problem we 
have with the opposition.  If the opposition wants to criticize 
that is perfectly legitimate.  That is what oppositions are 
intended to do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is not to suggest that what we are offering 
Canadians is a lot worse than what they are suggesting when in 
fact we know the opposite is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This change and improvement in the Canada pension plan in making 
the contribution rates stable for years to come is going to be 
one of the most defining moments in this government's mandate. It 
is also going to be one of the most defining moments for young 
Canadians.  As a young parent myself, I think it is important for 
us to realize, if we look at the billions of dollars that we are 
going to be saving young people in the long run by fast tracking 
the premium increases now, we are doing the future generations a 
big favour by what we are doing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize again in closing that we on this side of the 
House take this very seriously and we are very pleased to see 
that this issue is finally behind us and we can carry on with 
other improvements to the values that we so cherish. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member opposite as usual from the government 
side scaremongering about proposals to have more of an RRSP style 
of a plan for Canada pension.  He scaremongers without 
justification because there are many countries throughout the 
world, as we have told the government over and over again and 
which it knows very well, that have already fully or partially 
introduced this type of system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the member saw a program on television last Friday 
night, <I>20/20</I> on ABC.  There was an entire segment dedicated 
to the Chilean experience which is now close to 20 years old. 
What the program did first was interview all the scaremongers in 
North America, the unions, the liberals who are opposed to this 
program.  They say you will lose all your savings.  The world has 
ended.  Because it is not government, it will not work.  Then the 
program went down to Chile and interviewed people on the streets 
and in the centres for the pension plans.  Every person said what 
a significant change it was and how good that had been for the 
pension plans of Chile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that plan now almost 20 years old, the benefits to 
pensioners have been phenomenal.  To scaremonger by saying that 
people are going to lose their investment is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows very well that the government can set in place 
regulations about what sort of investments can be made, the 
security of those investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member whether he saw the program 
<I>W5</I> on Friday night and, if not, whether he will commit to 
get a copy to at least see the other side of the story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question is whether he attended the conference that 
was held right here in Ottawa by finance department officials 
where Chilean representatives were there to tell how well their 
program works.  Did he attend that conference or see the program 
on television? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am quite aware of 
the Chilean experience.  I want to relate to the House and to 
people at home a bit about the Chilean experience.  The member 
opposite keeps using it.  He should do his party a favour and 
stop doing that because if Canadians knew the Chilean experience, 
they would be amazed that the Reform Party cannot find a better 
solution or a better example than that.  Let me give some facts 
about the Chilean experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chile privatized its public pension some time ago, about 20 
years ago.  The original plan was in complete disarray.  There 
were over 30 plans in place when it went to its super RRSP kind 
of system.  There was little similarity between ours and Chile's. 
That is why I am confused as to why the member would even want 
to use it as an example because we cannot compare the two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>High inflation was seriously eroding the value of the benefits. 
Only a few groups with political and economic power received 
generous benefits.  By contrast, the CPP is portable and nearly 
universal.  Everyone receives a fair pension.  It includes 
disability and survivor benefits and is fully indexed.  There is 
a big difference between ours and Chile's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following is the really interesting part.  When the new 
pension regime came in in Chile, Chile passed a government decree 
making all employers raise their wages by 18% to soften the 
impact of higher contributions.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why this member continues to suggest that this is 
a good example of why Canada should go to Chile's example. 
Please, on behalf of the Reform Party and a few members in my 
riding who would like the member to represent them properly, find 
a better example.  He is hurting his chances of ever getting 
elected by using a silly argument like that when we know Canada 
pension plans and universal pension plans are much better.  I 
hate to see Reform drop to zero in my riding because we would 
like to keep it alive just a bit. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the hon. member has obviously not taken the time 
to look into the rescue plan that the Chilean government put into 
place when its public pension system was on the brink of 
disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the hon. member from the government criticizes a program 
that is working very well today, is self-sustaining and is 
returning a good investment income to all the Chileans who are 
retiring,  I would strongly suggest that he read it and 
understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault:</B> Madam Speaker, the Reform Party does 
not tell Canadians that on top of the 10% contribution rate that 
Chileans pay, they must pay another 3% points for administration 
fees and other benefits.  Reformers also do not tell Canadians 
that a private pension system such as Chile's has a much higher 
cost than public pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investment costs will be much lower under CPP, one-tenth of one 
per cent compared to two per cent for RRSPs.  That is the real 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other one that really concerns me the most about this is 
that they do not tell present day seniors in Canada, if they were 
to wrap up our pension plan how they would deal with the millions 
of people who are already on pensions.  I think we have a right 
to know that before they go any further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, Chile is the worst example could use.  There is not 
one solid G-7 country that would even consider this plan, never 
mind Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have to rise and rebut some of the things my friend across the 
way has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would point out that in Chile at least people have a 
choice.  When they had a choice 90% chose the privatized plan. 
They are enlightened enough in Chile, because they are a 
democracy, to offer people a choice.  When they had a choice 90% 
got out of the corrupt public system and went into a private 
system because it provides better returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We argue that people should have a choice.  We believe that 
people ultimately know a lot better than a big bureaucratic 
government how to invest their own money.  We believe in choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also point out that in Chile when people did start to invest 
in this plan, this private plan, it did wonderful things for 
their economy.  In the years after they started to do that their 
economy grew at something like an annual rate of 7% a year. There 
was this huge flow of new capital going into the market that 
allowed their economy expand to the point where they had too much 
money in the economy and had to open up their pension fund to 
investors from around the world.  Would that not be a nice 
problem to have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to my hon. friend, who was misleading people by 
suggesting that other G-7 countries would not look at this plan, 
that the U.S. is seriously looking at this type of plan.  I point 
out that the U.K. has already gone to that plan.  In fact, it is 
going to go further in that direction according to Labour Prime 
Minister Tony Blair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not scare people.  Let us not allow the member across the 
way to scare people.  I do not think that will go over very well 
with the people in his riding.  In fact, after the pitiful speech 
he just gave we will see the Reform members in that riding 
increase.  That is why all those young people, as revealed in a 
poll yesterday, are coming over to the Reform Party.  They do not 
have any faith in a government that has run up a debt of $600 
billion, not only in public debt, but $600 billion liability in 
the Canada pension plan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my friend in a rhetorical way what has that done for young 
people?  What has that done for people who are just starting out? 
This plan really has not worked all that well, I would argue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have seen in the last 30 years are successive Liberal 
and Tory governments coming in, deceiving people, telling them 
that there is not a problem, that everybody is going to be better 
off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened?  Of course, we have seen premiums not creep 
up— 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on 
a point of order.  I do not mind a bit of rhetoric here and there 
but I do not think it is politically acceptable or parliamentary 
language to say that members on this side are being deceitful. 
That is not parliamentary language, nor is it acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never used that kind of language, nor do I think it is 
acceptable for the member to do that.  I would appreciate if he 
would withdraw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, if I said that the hon. 
member was deceitful, I apologize and I withdraw.  If I said it 
about his government and about the Tory government before, I 
absolutely do not withdraw.  In fact, I will say it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think successive governments over the years were very 
deceitful, because they knew full well that eventually this plan 
would go broke.  The people who are paying the price for that 
today are all the young people who are just coming into the 
system and who are going to end up getting a 1.8% return on all 
the money they put into that system for 35 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is according to the actuary.  My friend is saying that it 
is not true.  The federal government's own actuary says it is a 
1.8% return for those people coming into the system now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not even take into account the foregone returns that 
they would get if they had that money to put into their own 
plans.  In other words, they will get a negative return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the least of it.  All the young people in the hon. 
gentleman's riding across the way who he must think probably 
support his government are going to end up feeling a double 
whammy because we have a situation where this government will 
raise CPP premiums by 73%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does that affect young people?  According to the finance 
department itself, we have a paper from Joe Italiano in the 
finance department saying higher payroll taxes are going to kill 
tens of thousands of jobs.  That is what the Liberal government 
is going to do for young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is going to kill jobs on the one hand so that young people 
who have the most trouble getting jobs never do get a decent 
paying job to begin with and then they are going to feel the full 
weight of the government's CPP hike, 73%, for the entire time 
they are in the workforce.  Ultimately they will get a measly 
$8,800 pension at the end of it all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that the government likes to talk about the three 
pillars of retirement income, CPP, old age security and RRSPs. 
How has it done in those three areas? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that CPP is a complete disaster thanks to the management 
or the lack of management by the Liberal government and the 
Tories before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the way they dealt with seniors incomes under old 
age security is to propose a plan that will claw back up to 80% 
of seniors incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend just spoke here a minute ago about how the Chileans 
were doing such a bad job because of the way they were going to 
impose higher taxes and all that kind of thing on the population 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about his own government?  An 80% clawback, how is that 
fair?  What about RRSPs?  How have the Liberals done there?  They 
have done very poorly as a matter of fact.  They have frozen and 
rolled back the contribution levels that can be contributed to 
RRSPs to save for retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, they are penalizing people through the new 
seniors benefit for saving.  On the other hand, they are rolling 
back contributions for RRSPs.  They rolled back the age of 
contribution to RRSPs from 71 to 69.  It has been made more 
difficult for everybody who wants to save for their own 
retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes that there is a fourth pillar in the 
retirement system.  We believe that tax relief should be the 
fourth pillar.  We have argued and presented a plan in the last 
election campaign to provide the average family of four with 
$2,000 of tax relief by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the government done?  Let us relate the story of the 
government's record on taxation. The Liberals along with the 
Conservatives have given us the highest personal income taxes in 
the G-7 as a percentage of our economy.  It is 54% higher than 
the G-7 average. 
That is unbelievable to me.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members wonder why we have families living in 
poverty.  It is a big mystery to them.  Maybe the government 
should look at its tax record.  Maybe it should take into account 
that since it came to power in 1993 we have seen the total 
revenues in this country go up by about $25 billion, somewhere in 
that range. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much of that has come back to Canadians?  Precious little 
because as a matter of fact we have seen interest on the debt 
continue to climb.   We now see it at $45 billion a year, $7 
billion more than when the Liberals came in, which is exactly the 
amount they have cut out of the health and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has a terrible record on taxation.  It is why we 
have not seen disposable incomes rise since the 1980s, not at 
all.  They have not gone up one bit.  In fact since 1984 they 
have gone down 6%.  That is the record of the Liberal and Tory 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were a Liberal member I do not think I would be boasting 
about CPP or OAS, the seniors benefit, or the RRSPs, or their tax 
record.  I think on every score the Liberals have let Canadians 
down. They have hurt young people.  The government has deceived 
all these people who are operating under the impression that 
somehow the government will be there for them when they retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me simply sum up by saying we think it is time the 
government dropped the scales from its eyes for a moment and 
stopped to consider that other countries around the world have 
had some success, more than a little success, with the type of 
plan we are talking about. Look at the U.K.  Look at Australia. 
Look at the United States which is seriously considering this 
type of proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend across the way can focus on Chile only. He thinks he 
can make fun of a plan just because it comes from a developing 
country.  We say that the Liberal government is not the only one 
with a good idea.  We think that he speaks in arrogance that 
befits the Liberals and the Tories before them. But we say there 
are other ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We chastise the government because when it was considering what 
to do with CPP it did not look at any other plans.  This was 
revealed to us when we brought officials before the finance 
committee not long ago.  We found out that when they considered 
going around the country with the provinces they did not look at 
any other plans.  Their only option was to see what they could do 
to fix the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say it is time to start looking around.  In fact one thing we 
found out when we talked to the officials is that when they 
consulted people across the country, their consultations amounted 
to meeting with 290 people.  Two hundred and ninety people for a 
country of 30 million people, not over this generation but over 
several generations.  They are proposing to make their decision, 
to raise CPP premiums by 73% on consultations with 290 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who comprised those 290 people? I think 40 of them were 
individuals. All the rest were people who represented vested 
interests. Among the people who appeared I noted looking at the 
interveners list there was a group from the NDP youth, obviously 
an unbiased group.  We saw all of the trade unions represented 
and we know where they were coming from. We saw the interest of 
big business.  But we did not see ordinary Canadians at these 
hearings. We know where this government is coming from.  The fix 
was in right from the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should look around and decide for a second that 
perhaps it does not have the only good ideas.  In fact I think 
its record speaks for itself.  It does not have any good ideas. 
It should perhaps consider for a moment that around the world 
other people do have good ideas. Let me just say briefly how we 
think the government should be going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think it should consider a mandatory RRSP plan.  Give people 
a choice.  Let them choose the Liberal 9.9% plan or let them opt 
in to a mandatory RRSP.  We think many young people would 
appreciate the chance not to be hamstrung and handcuffed by a 
government when they begin their work career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe we should target the seniors benefit to low 
income people and have a much more gradual clawback than what the 
government is proposing, which is 80% in some cases. That is 
absolutely ridiculous.  We believe that RRSPs should be enhanced. 
We believe that people should be allowed to put more money into 
RRSPs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for tax relief in this country.  Canadians have 
spoken on this issue.  I sit on the finance committee, as do 
members opposite.  They know that people want debt reduction 
first and tax relief second.  Let us give them some tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my friends opposite to consider what we have said. 
Consider what Canadians are saying across the country and wake up 
and deliver the tax relief and debt reductions which Canadians 
are asking for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I very 
much enjoyed the member's speech because it verified what I have 
been saying in the House all along. The Reform's program is 
pretty general.  It does not get into specifics.  I want to ask 
the member one specific question to see if he can answer it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform Party removed the Canada pension plan and replaced 
it with a super RRSP, I want to know what the member proposes to 
do with the $600 billion liability that exists today.  What does 
he intend to do with the disability benefits which would not be 
there under a super RRSP?  What will he do with the death 
benefit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a social component to the Canada pension plan which is 
different from what my friend is advocating.  He is advocating an 
RRSP system which would be based on income replacement but would 
have no social component in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to answer those two questions.  So far all he 
has given us is the Chile example.  I do not want to talk about 
the Chile example because quite frankly it is not a good one.  It 
is not our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was referring to countries which have a public pension plan. 
Not one of those countries has gone from a public pension plan to 
a private pension plan.  When the two plans are put together side 
by side, it is obvious that the public pension plan is better for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says that we are increasing the clawback by 80%, but 
that will only affect one out of ten people.  Nine out of ten 
people will benefit from the seniors benefit.  One in ten will 
see a reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know who the people are who the member is looking at. 
They must be those in the $100,000 to $200,000 range.  They 
certainly are not the people in the $15,000 to $25,000 range. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is probably a little 
late to say it but I should mention that I am splitting my time 
with the hon. member for Surrey Central. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that the World Bank in 1994 told us that pay 
as you go systems have a predictable three stage life cycle. The 
systems begin in young countries where the proportion of retired 
people is small.  They go through the windfall stage where people 
who are just getting into the system get far more out of it than 
they put in.  There is the expanding coverage stage where the 
population is aging and the founding generation receives even 
higher benefits and more groups are covered.  Then there is the 
final stage, which is the stage we are in in this country, which 
is where the system starts to collapse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why there are 20 countries in the world which have 
already gone to a mandatory private savings plan.  Chile is one 
of them.  The U.S. is moving in that direction.  The U.K. is now 
doing it.  Australia is now doing it.  Switzerland, Finland, 
Greece and Japan all have variations on the theme.  Let us not 
let the hon. member opposite suggest there are no other countries 
going to this plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asked me about the liability.  We know that the 
government's plan is to raise CPP premiums by 73%. That is the 
one option which Canadians have.  We say that one of the better 
options is to get a better rate of return.  It is so simple that 
it has eluded our friends across the way.  They think that by 
giving the money to the provinces at below market rates of 
interest that somehow we have done seniors a great favour. 
Obviously we have not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government plan until now has earned 2.5%.  That is 
ridiculous. 
We say it is time to start investing that money in the stock 
market and allow people to get the returns they can.  Over the 
last 30 years I think the real rate of return is pretty close to 
6%.  If people get better rates of return, rather obviously the 
premiums do not have to be as high and the liability actually 
begins to come down. That is the answer to my friend.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to old age security, I would also point out that 
when the member talks about the one in ten, which I think is a 
little hyperbole, he should really point out that it is not low 
income people who end up $120 better off under the government's 
plan.  The ultimate result of the plan is that it is able to save 
$6 billion in payouts to seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who get it right in the neck are the middle income 
earners.  High income people will not feel any pain because they 
already have the money clawed back anyway.  It is middle income 
seniors who will be taking it in the neck by the government's 
plan.  Out of fairness, that should be pointed out. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
during the member's speech he referred to the consultation 
process which as all members and all Canadians know was very 
exhaustive over a two year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member looked at the report which stated that there were 270 
interventions before the travelling panel which was chaired by 
former member of Parliament David Walker.  The member referred to 
this as 270 persons having appeared before the panel.  In fact, 
the interveners included organizations such as the Canadian 
Labour Congress, the Canadian Association of Retired Persons, the 
Canadian Association of Pension Consultants, et cetera. These are 
not individuals. The member is not only mistaken, he is mistaken 
in the extreme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member has to do with the very serious issue 
of disability benefits for Canadians which are provided under the 
current Canada pension plan system and will be continued under 
Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member's party is sticking to its position that the 
Canada pension plan should be scrapped, abolished, thrown out, 
does he have any words for Canadians who receive disability 
benefits today as to how his program will satisfy the need for 
disability pensions for Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>   Madam Speaker, at the risk of 
repeating myself, I really believe that my colleagues across the 
way are doing their level best to scare Canadians. There is no 
reason in the world why we cannot have a separate disability 
program.  No one says it has to be linked to the old Canada 
pension plan. Why can there not be a separate plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my friend knows, people came forward from the pension 
industry and said that we can have a separate disability plan. 
They pointed out that we should be doing that because there is 
great confusion now among people who think that the money that 
goes to the Canada pension plan goes just for their pensions. 
Obviously that is not true. So why not separate it out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I would make is that under the current regime, the 
government plan pays out a whopping $465 in survivors benefits to 
people who are widowed.  Under a mandatory RRSP the whole amount 
of the annuity would be paid to a surviving spouse.  If the 
pension which was coming in was $30,000 that is how much the 
spouse would get.  Under the government's plan they get a CPP 
pension of $8,800 and the survivor gets $465 a month. I do not 
think this plan serves widows very well in this country.  In 
fact, I think it is an abomination.

I would like to remind the member for Medicine Hat that he does 
not represent people across the country. The last time I looked 
we did not have any Reform Party members of Parliament here from 
Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a part of the country that has one of the highest 
rates of unemployment. People are having difficulty feeding their 
children. 
There are no prospects for future employment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the member propose that these Atlantic Canadians can 
invest in RRSPs when they are not able to feed their children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, the short answer is the 
money they currently pay into the CPP would go into the mandatory 
RRSP.  It would be the same way it works now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to my hon. colleague that if premiums go up by 73% 
there will never be any jobs in Atlantic Canada.  I am surprised 
the NDP supported a plan that kills jobs for Atlantic Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise to speak to an issue about which I heard a lot of 
nonsense this morning from members on the opposite side, 
particularly from the member from Chile.  I found that rather 
interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Very funny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I do not care if the member thinks it 
is funny.  Is it not interesting that the Reform Party has to get 
its policies by watching ABC television reporting on the Chilean 
experience?  We want a made in Canada solution.  We do not need 
to go to the states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I am teasing the bears and they are 
apparently getting a little agitated.  Since they stopped 
listening to Newt Gingrich they have had to go farther afield to 
get their marching orders.  Where the policies come from is 
really quite telling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be splitting my time with Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Veterans Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers talk about the fact that there has been no 
consultation.  The tactics that are used are interesting.  My 
colleague from Mississauga South pointed out that a former 
speaker of the Reform Party said that only 270 people were 
consulted.  The fact of the matter is the committee travelled 
across the country and received 270 deputations or presentations 
literally representing millions of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know that, but it is convenient to describe the Canadian 
Labour Congress as a person rather than to say that it is a group 
representing millions of people who have a lot at stake.  It is a 
neat little way to twist the facts around to get out a message 
that is very misleading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did consult.  As for ramming Bill C-2 through this place, as 
members opposite know we have consulted across the country.  It 
has been debated in committee.  Members opposite have spoken 
about it.  It has been debated at second reading.  It has been 
debated in committee of the whole and at third reading.  I 
suppose the Chilean experience would simply see polarization of 
parliamentary democracy.  We do not operate that way and members 
opposite know that we have to deal with reform to the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Don't use that word disrespectfully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Don't talk about disrespectful.  We 
almost had one of the Reform Party fellows going into fisticuffs, 
climbing over a chair this morning.  That is the mentality we see 
on that side of the House.  They should be ashamed of themselves 
and embarrassed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians watch television and see the kind of behaviour we saw 
here this morning.  A member actually had to be restrained 
physically from climbing over chairs to attack another member of 
Parliament.  That is the mentality.  That was the Reform Party. 
Canadians are fed up with that kind of nonsense. 
Canadians want leadership.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several years ago another very important pension fund members 
opposite might be familiar with, the teachers' pension fund of 
the province of Ontario, was in some difficulty for very similar 
types of problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contributions had been too low from both the teachers and 
the employer, the Government of Ontario.  The investment 
procedures used by that pension fund were inadequate and unfair. 
Many of the roads, bridges, schools and other parts of the 
infrastructure in our province were paid for from that pension 
fund at interest rates as low as 3%  when market interest rates 
were in the double digit area.  It was a fund from which to 
borrow cheaply to build public infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result we wound up with a pension fund the actuarial people 
said was in serious trouble.  The Liberal government in office at 
the time decided we had to bite the bullet.  We increased the 
contributions of teachers and we matched that with an increase to 
the employer, the Ontario government.  We set up an independent 
body for investments and today the teachers' fund is one of the 
strongest financial vehicles in the entire country, perhaps in 
North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The teachers were not happy when we did that.  They 
demonstrated.  They came to Queen's Park.  They were very 
unhappy.  Today the fund owns the Toronto Maple Leafs, although 
there are days when I am not sure it would want to.  The fund has 
substantial investments such as investments in newspapers. 
Teachers have a financially strong pension fund because the 
government of the day had the courage to make those changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give that example because it relates.  The CPP must change 
from being simply a pay as you go fund, which in a sense is 
exactly what the super RRSP fund would be.  If one has the money 
to invest and has a job then under the Reform plan one would be 
able to invest in an RRSP.  A lot of Canadians simply do not fall 
into that category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not rocket science.  If we split them out and tell 
people they will be given the option of opting out of the plan, 
obviously the financial integrity of the CPP will be jeopardized. 
We are not prepared to do that.  Canadians have investment 
options for their retirement.  They have options to invest in 
RRSPs.  We believe there should be a publicly funded, solid, 
government backed Canadian pension plan for all Canadians and for 
future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we do?  We either increase the contributions, reduce the 
benefits or change the procedures.  Frankly we are doing all of 
that in an effort to put the CPP in a sustainable format.  Yes, 
there will be an increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I do not expect the member to 
understand.  I am really not talking to him.  I am talking to the 
Speaker and to the Canadian people.  They understand that some 
people might benefit from the simple black and white solution 
that everybody gets to invest in an RRSP fund for their 
retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think my colleague was right on.  We are talking about who 
will benefit from a wide open RRSP fund and the elimination of 
the CPP.  Is it the average working Canadian?  Is it the working 
poor?  Is it families and young people who need some leadership 
and some strong financial backing from government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it will be big business.  The oil barons out west may 
benefit from it, and God bless them. That is why we have a system 
for everyone to invest in their own retirement savings plan. 
There are rules that guide the investment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Royal Bank's profit up to today?  It is $1.6 
billion.  That is absolutely unbelievable.  Why is that?  It is 
probably in large measure because of the amount of money 
Canadians have been putting into RRSPs and the banks.  Whether it 
is through RoyFund, investment procedures or whatever, the banks 
are benefiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers simply care more about the banks, the oil companies 
and rich Canadians than taking care of all Canadians in a 
universally funded system that will accrue to the benefit of our 
children and in spite of their rhetoric will accrue to the 
benefit of their children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, we have just had a classic example of greenhouse gas. 
The member made absolutely weird comments.  He does not seem to 
understand a very simple principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle is that people in the workforce today are having 
CPP premiums extracted from their paycheques.  That extraction 
will increase by 73%.  Under the Reform super RRSP or a plan like 
it, they would continue to have premiums extracted but not at the 
73% increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member misrepresents the Reform position.  It is really a 
scandal that he just does not understand.  We cannot get blood 
from a stone.  We cannot give the opportunity for super RRSPs to 
people who are not working, who are not deriving an income, but 
those same people are not paying CPP premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Oh, that is going to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Do you have it all figured out now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Now he understands.  That is wonderful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign the Liberal candidate accused me of 
scaring seniors at a seniors' home in Revelstoke.  He said 
“Before the election the member went into the seniors' home in 
Revelstoke.  He took in a so-called expert who was explaining the 
new seniors benefits program to them.  He scared them so much 
that they would not talk to me, the Liberal”.  Guess what?  The 
so-called expert I took in was an official from HRD who explained 
the Liberal policy to the seniors.  That is what made them 
scared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that the CPP is just the first shoe.  The second 
shoe is the seniors benefits program the government has not told 
Canadians about.  These people hide behind the cloak of we are 
going to protect you.  They are dropping both shoes on the heads 
of seniors and people who will become seniors.  At the same time, 
just for good measure, they are doing an intergenerational 
transfer of wealth from 25 year old people who will never see 
their CPP premiums again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the member learned anything here?  Has he learned that only 
people who work pay CPP premiums and only people who work would 
pay super RRSP premiums?  Does he understand that simple concept? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have learned quite a 
bit, actually.  The member mentioned in his opening remarks that 
this was an example of greenhouse gas.  This is proof that if we 
were to collect all the flatulence from the cattle industry and 
from what I just heard across the way, we could probably reduce 
greenhouse gases dramatically beyond our wildest dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nonsense.  Can we imagine?  I just heard that people who are 
not working do not pay CPP premiums, therefore they will be okay 
if we go to a wide open RRSP plan for their retirement.  That is 
what I heard.  I would ask the member to check <I>Hansard</I> 
because that is what he said and he does not know what he is 
talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that the Reform Party's simplistic 
solution to long term sustainable pension funds is to throw them 
wide open so that the banks can make more money by playing with 
Canadians' money.

strong current for almost 200 metres before reaching the victim. 
Somehow, she made it back through the waves to shore with the man.

be presented with the Medal of Bravery by the Governor General of 
Canada.

crushing debt load and high tax load.  The response from the 
government was pathetic.  In essence it said that it did not have 
to answer for high debt and high taxes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

the first time the debt decreased by a couple of billion dollars. 
The next budget will tell us by exactly how much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a policy that is clear.  I note that Reform's 
program does not talk about debt reduction; it talks about tax 
reduction.  We have a balanced approach.  We know that we will 
reduce the debt and taxes—

</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Liberal governments personal income taxes have risen to 
the highest levels in the G-7.  Under the government the debt has 
risen in total to close to $600 billion and Canada's youth are 
stuck with the tab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's poll it was significant that it was Canadians under 
30 years of age who were most insistent that the government 
address the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government considering more spending when young 
Canadians are demanding that it address the balance sheet first? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we realize that there are problems in society, like 
child poverty, which are the responsibility of the government. 
The government realizes that there are some people in some parts 
of Canada who need help from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why in the same poll Canadians said they believed those 
on this side of the House are best able to manage the economy of 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

debt and taxes are opposites.  What Canadians are telling the 
government is that these things go hand in hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government taxes the poor more heavily than either the 
Americans or the British, so broad based tax relief helps the 
poor, including poor children.

Liberal government that increased the corporate surtax, that 
increased the large corporation tax and imposed a temporary 
surtax which has raised well over $200 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With great regret, I feel this must be formally brought to the 
attention of the Chair.  It is not the first time that the member 
has engaged in this kind of activity.  On February 4, 1997 the 
member for Okanagan—Shuswap created a spectacle in this Chamber 
when he used threatening gestures and profane language to another 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, it clearly constitutes disorderly conduct, but it 
also constitutes contempt of the entire House. Threats against 
members and intimidation are well-known breaches of privilege and 
they have been found to be in contempt by the House.  It is 
conduct which is clearly meant to interfere with the rights of 
members to speak freely and within the rules of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Okanagan—Shuswap, not only does he owe the House 
an apology, but it is time that the House was given the 
opportunity to judge his continued misconduct.  It is not a 
matter which should be dealt with solely by you, Sir.  The House 
as well should be permitted to judge the matter in the light of 
parliamentary law on contempt for the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should you find, Your Honour, that a prima facie case of 
privilege is clear, I would be prepared to move a motion 
referring the member's conduct to the standing committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Let us hear what the House leader for the 
opposition has to say. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am not sure whether this is a point of privilege.  I suppose a 
member of this House if he is particularly offended by something 
should look at what happens if the member himself introduces some 
bad language in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think to try to get some media attention for the leader of the 
Conservatives and for himself is inappropriate in this House in 
this manner by making such accusations on our member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member in question is here in the 
House now.  His name has been mentioned.  Perhaps he could 
clarify the situation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was not in my chair at the time this took place. There 
were some words exchanged.  I left the seat over there to come 
over here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot raise a point of order until I sit in my proper seat. 
Is that not the rule of the House?  So I came across here to 
raise a point of order on what was being said because the 
language that was being used was not acceptable in this House. 
This is when it all happened, Mr. Speaker. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, from what I have heard 
now I am not sure whether we have a point of privilege.  Surely 
there was some disorder in the House.  I spoke very briefly with 
my colleague who was in the Chair at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always regrettable when anything like this happens in the 
House.  We are getting close to the end of the session. Sometimes 
in the heat of debate words are exchanged.  I plead with you that 
this type of conduct among our members is not acceptable for us 
here in the House of Commons.  I would hope that all hon. members 
would take this to heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage that this type of thing not happen again in 
the House of Commons, and surely not happen at any time in the 
midst of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues, what I will undertake to do is I will look at the 
blues and I will look at what was on the tape. 
If it is necessary, I will come back to the House.  But please 
take my admonition to heart for all of you that this type of 
thing should never occur again in the House. This point is 
closed.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a question of privilege generally relating to Standing 
Order 94. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I received at my office a notice with respect to a 
private members' draw that will be held tomorrow, December 5.  A 
draw was held on November 25 at which time I believe six bills 
and three motions were drawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members are aware, the normal way of doing this in the House 
is to allow the private members items on the order of precedence 
to decrease to 15 at which time a draw is held.  A draw was held 
a week ago and the committee is within the 10-day time period as 
specified by the standing orders to determine which bills and 
motions will be votable and which bills and motions will not be 
votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to an inquiry I made to the Private Members' 
Business Office this morning, I was advised that there was an 
irregularity with respect to motions and for that reason it was 
having another draw.  My point is that if there was an 
irregularity with respect to motions, then perhaps the correct 
measure would fall with respect to the draw of motions.  I am not 
certain what that irregularity is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are presently four votable bills listed on the Order 
Paper.  The committee is seized with the consideration of six 
others at the moment.  A decision for that must be made by 
midnight next Monday.  By adding three more bills to the order, 
those people who will be drawn tomorrow with bills, if one of the 
six is selected from the draw of November 25, it will preclude 
those who will be drawn tomorrow, December 5, from ever having a 
votable bill.  Alternatively, it will change the odds for those 
who had a bill drawn on November 25 in terms of going from one to 
six to one to nine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having had a bill drawn on November 25 I would like to know if 
the odds have changed for me. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleague, I do not know that you 
have a question of privilege but you surely have a point of 
grievance. I will look into that and I will get back to the House 
before noon tomorrow. I will let the House know what my findings 
are at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a point of order from the hon. member for

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK236">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-2, an 
act to establish the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and to 
amend the Canada Pension Plan and the Old Age Security Act and to 
make consequential amendments to other acts, be read the third 
time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to offer 
my comments on Bill C-2 as we take part in this very colourful 
and hotly debated third reading today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my remarks I want to emphasize how we are earning the 
confidence of Canadians in the Canada pension plan that will be 
there for them. I want to talk about how this bill is a 
comprehensive package that will maintain the security of our 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it should be made clear to all of us that the Canada 
pension plan is a defining feature of the quality of life in 
Canada.  In the three decades since the plan was introduced by 
the Liberal government of the day, the Canada pension plan has 
become firmly established as a the cornerstone of our social 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just some monument to enlightened thinking in our 
past.  It is a key part of the planning for tomorrow's retirement 
for virtually all Canadians outside of Quebec and with its Quebec 
counterpart provides a very uniform portable protection from 
coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few years, however, concerns have been expressed 
about the viability of the Canada pension plan.  A leading 
magazine, <I>Maclean's</I>, put this in sharp perspective a few 
months ago. It polled Canadians and found that two-thirds of our 
fellow citizens were not confident that the Canada pension plan 
would be around when they needed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians heard statements like the one made by the Canada 
pension plan's chief actuary and they were concerned.  I believe 
we all know that he projected that at current ratios of 
contributions to benefits paid, the Canada pension plan would be 
exhausted by the year 2015.  Their concerns were rooted in more 
than finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Expert analysis showed us that the rules of the plan had to be 
updated to reflect the realities of today's world as well as 
tomorrow's.  The facts were clear, the need for action obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has acted to preserve the Canada pension plan 
for all Canadians.  The changes to the plan that are before this 
House in Bill C-2 are not the product of tinkering in Ottawa. 
They are the result of a long and wide-ranging process of public 
consultation that began during our last term in office.  They 
represent a complete and balanced package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process of consultation was jointly conducted with our 
counterparts in the provincial and territorial governments and 
professionals in Canada's actuarial and insurance professions. 
The consultations reached out to the representatives of social 
planning organizations, seniors, youth and persons with 
disabilities as well as interested private individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, these consultations involved a large number of 
Canadians who had views and concerns about building a stronger 
Canada pension plan.  One of the clearest messages that Canada's 
governments heard during the consultations was that Canadians 
want and need the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To hear some people talk, you would swear that the Canada 
pension plan was an anachronism, a throwback to the sixties. 
Those people should get out of their ivory towers and listen to 
Canadians.  People on the streets of this country would tell them 
something quite different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians told us in no uncertain terms to preserve the Canada 
pension plan, change it if necessary, but preserve it.  We heard 
them.  We listened and the result is this Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is more than an effort to address today's valid 
concerns.  It launches a plan for the future.  Bill C-2 
recognizes how different our economy and our society have become 
since the year when the plan began.  It makes the changes 
necessary to sustain the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three-quarters of those changes are on the financing side of the 
ledger. 
They respond to the gap between the contribution rates and the 
benefit payouts.  In fact, I am sure that members recall that the 
chief actuary in the Canada pension plan projected that 
contribution rates would have to increase to 14.2% of income 
covered by the plan by the year 2030, that is unless changes were 
made.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government and our provincial partners agreed that 14.2% of 
income was too high.  We knew that it would be more than 
Canadians would be willing to pay.  Therefore, we went to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We looked at what experts and at what ordinary citizens alike 
told us as we set out to rebalance the relationship between the 
Canada pension plan income and expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One key part of the response is addressed in Bill C-2 through 
the proposals that would increase contribution rates over a 
seven-year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this way, contributions will increase each year and reach 
9.9% of covered income by the year 2003.  Then, we will hold the 
contributions at this rate indefinitely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some hon. members have been quick to leap to their feet with 
shouts of tax grab.  The reality is quite different, and I want 
to set them straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada pension plan contributions are not a tax.  They are 
contributions toward pensions.  They are an investment by 
Canadians in their own future.  That is hardly a tax.  It is 
planning prudently for tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me add more information on this point.  Canada pension plan 
contributions will not go into the government's general revenues. 
Canada pension plan contributions will not go to anything other 
than the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make another point to show how hollow tax grab claims 
are.  Are contributions to company plans taxes?  Of course not. 
In fact, both the Canada pension plan premiums and company 
pension plan contributions reduce the taxes we pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple fact is this.  Both are investments in the future and 
I think it is important that Canadians understand that.  Bill C-2 
is very, very clear.  These contributions will not get mixed into 
some government coffers.  They will become part of a separate 
investment fund.  An independent body will manage and will invest 
this money on behalf of a plan and its contributors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those investments will go into a diversified securities 
portfolio and should earn higher rates of return than the status 
quo.  That improved investment performance should help us lower 
the long term contribution rate by providing more income to help 
pay the benefits for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition parties in this House have consistently avoided 
providing a comprehensive alternative.  Each is unable to say how 
they would meet our obligations to people receiving benefits 
today, those who expect to do so soon and those who have many 
years to go in their working lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government and our counterparts in the eight provincial 
capitals have a plan.  It is called Bill C-2 and it is right on 
the agenda.  Bill C-2 is about ensuring a sustainable, affordable 
and fairer Canada pension plan.  It is about giving peace of mind 
to Canadians who are getting pensions now and for those who are 
looking ahead to receiving pensions in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is about ensuring fairness between the generations in 
our country so that our children and grandchildren do not have to 
pay as high as 14% of their earnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I hear the comments about this or that aspect of Bill C-2, I 
find nothing that shakes my conviction that this is a sound piece 
of legislation. It is balanced.  It is fair.  It is the right 
direction for us to go.  It represents the complete package that 
Canadians told us they want. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the comments of the member.  I think the member well 
appreciates the importance of a secure, guaranteed, indexed plan 
for Canadians to help our seniors to enjoy in dignity their 
retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member his opinion about the Reform 
Party's suggestion that we should abandon the CPP and move to 
some sort of RRSP scheme in which individual Canadians would have 
to manage their own pension affairs in lieu of having the 
benefits of the current plan and whether or not the member feels 
that that kind of plan would provide the same kind of protection 
and security for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
his question. 
Everybody has their own opinion on what would do for a pension 
plan.  Let us look at the realities of this.  The reality is that 
this Canada pension plan was brought into being because of the 
fact that a lot of people cannot or do not contribute to their 
own pension plan.  A lot of them cannot for various reasons and 
it is not their fault. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT66"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT66"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1525

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, back in the 1960s this plan was devised to take care 
of those people at the end of their working time when the company 
did not provide a pension, or maybe they were self-employed and 
there was no pension plan available and they had nothing but the 
old age security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a terrible situation for people to be in.  I have seen 
that happen to people on the street where I lived.  To make 
matters worse, when the person who received the old age security 
passed away, the spouse was left with nothing.  This is why this 
type of plan is necessary.  I believe it is necessary and 
obviously the majority of Canadians believe this type of plan is 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a large segment of society that for one reason or 
another do not contribute to RRSPs.  That is a fact. There are 
RRSPs and they will be there in the future.  I think they are a 
tremendous thing for people who have the ability to contribute to 
them.  However, I also believe that there has to be some kind of 
social safety net that we are always talking about.  This is a 
social safety net.  This is a big part of it and Canadians want 
it.  I believe it is very necessary, along with RRSPs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member just mentioned how important it is to have a social 
safety net and completely ignores the fact that this so-called 
social safety net has an unfunded liability of something like 
$600 billion.  It will be in total collapse if we do not deal 
with the problem right away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember in the previous Parliament to this one, at the 
beginning when the Reform was asking questions about the CPP and 
pointing out that it was in danger of collapse, the finance 
minister and members on that side constantly said “There is no 
problem.  It's a wonderful program.” It was one of these Liberal 
gifts to mankind.  Now, in this Parliament I heard the finance 
minister just weeks ago in question period say that everyone 
knows that the CPP is in trouble and needs to be fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am pleased to see the Liberals realizing that there is a 
problem after denying in the last Parliament that there was a 
problem, I would like the member to explain to me how he can 
promote this as a good program, a good social safety net when it 
has an unfunded liability of close to $600 billion and everybody 
admits that it is in hopeless disarray. There is evidence that 
similar programs around the world have gone under and have had to 
be replaced with contributory programs like RRSP style programs. 
Why does he keep defending something that is indefensible? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 
colleague across the way for his questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member referred to what the finance minister said. 
However, I for one, along with everybody in Canada knew that over 
the last number of years that the plan was having problems.  We 
stabilized the problem with Bill C-2 in consultation with 
Canadians who told us clearly, without any question, that they 
wanted this Canada pension plan and that they wanted it brought 
into line so that they, their children and grandchildren would 
have pension benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can use all kinds of ways to skirt around this.  The fact of 
the matter remains that Canadians believe in this Canada pension 
plan.  Yes, it has to be managed in such a way that there will be 
money there for people in the future.  I am convinced that we are 
doing this today with Bill C-2.  I am not only convinced, but the 
people of Canada are convinced because they have demanded that we 
do this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to inform you first off and thus let our 
competent clerks know that I will be sharing my time with the 
member for Laval East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 to reform the Canada pension plan now before the 
House has arrived four years late.  It is however vital for 
Quebeckers contributing to the CPP. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT67"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT67"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1530

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Few Quebeckers are actually affected by this plan; fewer that 
one half of one per cent of the residents of Quebec receive CPP 
benefits.  The statistics may not perhaps be accurate, but we are 
talking about some 12,000 Quebeckers.  However, they and the people 
of Canada have not all had the opportunity to set up a private 
pension plan, and we must ensure they have an income when they 
decide to retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said the bill is four years late.  When the Liberals took 
over the government in 1993, they knew then that the plan was in 
trouble. 
Instead of assuming its responsibilities, the government focused on 
improving the retirement fund, but did not change the rules for 
disability benefits or contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the current Liberal government assumed its 
responsibilities, the increase in contributions would be minimal, 
and the ordinary worker would not be penalized in the contributions 
he makes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though our party agrees with the bill, and we are in 
favour of the current reform, I still have some remarks, which, 
should the government take them into consideration, would 
significantly improve benefits and provide a much more comfortable 
retirement to recipients, the people we represent, the people who 
sent us here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at death benefits. Low income workers are often 
not protected by life insurance. Still, their families have a right, 
just like any other Quebecker or Canadian, to plan a decent funeral. The 
proposed reform provides for death benefits equivalent to six times the 
actual retirement benefits, up to a maximum of $2,500. The plan that we 
have in Quebec is much more generous, since the maximum allowed is 
$3,350. Yet, the premiums paid are the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now come to the issue of disability benefits. The federal 
government is experiencing a lot of problems with the disability benefit 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September, the Auditor General of Canada, Denis Desautels, 
blamed the government for the unjustified escalation of the costs 
relating to disability benefits. He said the increase was the result of 
regulations that are too lax as regards disability benefits. 
Disability benefits should be paid only to people who cannot perform any 
remunerative work and for whom there is absolutely no possibility of 
being cured, given current medical knowledge. If the federal government 
adopted such a position, it would make the auditor general happy and the 
plan would be in better shape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My purpose is not to penalize workers when they get sick. However, 
there are other social programs in Canada, and also private insurance 
programs, that cover disability. The purpose of a pension plan is to 
allow a contributor to retire or get financial support if he or she is 
incapable of performing any type of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now look at premiums. 
The current contribution rate is 5.85%. The bill proposes to raise the 
rate to 6% in 1997, which will then reach a maximum of 9.9% by the year 
2003, and remain at that level until the year 2010. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out at the beginning, if the government had taken its 
responsibilities in 1993, the increase would not be so drastic and the 
plan would be in better shape. However, under the circumstances, we have 
no choice but to increase contributions, if we want to reduce the 
intergenerational unfairness by making baby boomers who, on average, 
will work for another 20 years or so, pay contributions that are more in 
line with the benefits they will get when they retire.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a warning for the government about the public pension plan. 
Millions of provincial government employees have agreed to receive 
reduced benefits from their private pension plan when they turn 65 and 
start receiving CPP or CPQ benefits. They agreed to such a cut because, 
at age 65, old age security was expected to make up for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is a snag: the current Minister of Finance plans to 
change the rules of the game by turning the existing old age security 
into a seniors' benefit by the year 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that this remark concerns neither the existing nor the 
proposed Canada pension plan. 
But when dealing with the issue of retirement, we must make sure that 
the various plans are consistent. Count on me to remind the government 
of this fact when the time comes to calculate old age security based on 
family income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth point I would like to address concerns the auditor of 
the board. All these contributions collected and invested will have to 
be kept safe. The auditor should be appointed for five years and only be 
removed for just cause. In addition, the minister should cause a special 
examination to be carried out in respect of the operations of the board 
or any of its subsidiaries every six years. It would also be important 
that the governor in council be able to make regulations respecting the 
investments the board or its subsidiaries may make by ensuring that the 
end result is the maximum return for the pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, the bill currently before us is a good bill for the 
citizens of Canada and Quebec. 
However, some amendments are absolutely essential and I hope that the 
amendments proposed by my party, the Bloc Quebecois, will be accepted 
when the bill is reviewed clause by clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Bloc Quebecois wants is simply that there be better 
distributive justice, that there be concern for the underprivileged, for 
the people who have fears, for the elderly who are alone in their 
kitchens and worry that the fund might not always be there for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Bloc Quebecois wants is more fairness. We want to ensure 
that the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes and that there will not 
be two social classes in Canada. The rich are getting richer and driving 
bigger cars, while the poor are getting poorer. 
We should ask ourselves whether there would be enough money available to 
improve Canada's social programs if the 62,000 profitable companies that 
paid no taxes had paid their fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One after the other, our big banks are announcing record profits. 
This is outrageous. If banks paid their fair share in taxes on their 
profits and stopped crushing poor workers by pulling the plug when they 
can no longer pay their mortgage or by repossessing their cars when they 
cannot make their payments, perhaps there would be better distributive 
justice and we would be able to avoid the contribution rate increases we 
are seeing today in Canada's social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So this is what our party is calling for and I hope that our 
amendments will be seriously considered by this government if it really 
has a heart and soul.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a comment and a question for the member.  The member 
mentioned a few items, all of which have to do with the issue of 
what has been called intergenerational equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members will know that under the current system pensioners 
today receive approximately $7 for every $1 they put in.  This 
occurs because pensioners presently receiving pensions did not 
have full working careers.  The plan came into effect in 1966. 
Benefits started to be paid in 1967.  In fact full benefits 
started to be paid by 1970. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will also know that if one worked from 1966 to 1996, 
made the maximum amount and paid the maximum premiums each and 
every year, the accumulative premiums that any pensioner would 
have put in would accumulate to about $10,200, even though the 
annual payout was $8,800.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly this is the reason the chief actuary found that we could 
no longer continue to pay the low premium rates that we are 
paying and still have those kinds of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raised an interesting point.  Canadians said that 
they wanted to insulate today's seniors to make sure their 
benefits were not affected.  Under Bill C-2 Canadian seniors, 
pensioners and those receiving disability benefits should be 
assured that their benefits will not be impacted by the changes 
in Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I have for the member concerns the aspect of how to 
make it fairer for those who have already worked some part of 
their career and perhaps are approaching retirement as opposed to 
those who are younger.  The member knows that currently the rates 
are planned to go up to 10.1% in the year 2010.  Bill C-2 is 
introducing a higher rate earlier so that we smooth the benefit 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member disagree with advancing the schedule of rates to 
begin in 1998, or is he in fact saying that somehow today's 
seniors should have to pay more for the benefits they currently 
enjoy?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not sure whether the hon. member has understood what 
I said.  First of all, our party has announced that it agrees with 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party will be proposing improvements to the bill, through 
our critic, the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques.  What we 
do hold against this government, to which the hon. member who has 
just asked the question belongs, since he is a Liberal MP with 
several mandates under his belt—to go back to the catechism we 
had to learn when we were a little younger, in which there were 
different kinds of sins—is a sin, not of commission, but of 
omission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has done nothing.  It has been lax ever since 1993.  As 
soon as the Liberals came to power in 1993, when they became aware 
of the state this plan was in, they ought to have acted, got 
something accomplished.  Why, now that we are nearly in 1998, has 
nothing been done since 1993? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that if the hon. member had a second chance to speak, 
he would say “Yes, but nothing was done during the two mandates of 
the Conservative government”.  That is true, yes, nothing was done 
in 1984, and in 1988, but that just confirms what the Bloc 
Quebecois has always said “Liberal or Conservative, it is six of 
one and half a dozen of the other. They are all alike”.

He mentioned the fact that the death benefit under the Quebec 
pension plan was higher than that in the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard of a problem recently.  When human resources were 
handling a death benefit out of Regina, from the time of death 
until the payment was made used to be six weeks.  Last October, 
before the move, the average time for those constituents to 
obtain the death benefit settlement was five months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the minister's plan does it take five months for someone 
to get a death benefit settlement?

pleased that my Reform colleague, who sits with me on the transport 
committee, has given me a promotion.  I have moved up to being a 
minister in the Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be delighted to be a minister in the government of a 
sovereign Quebec, but having decided to stay here for a time, I 
would like to tell him that I am not in a position to confirm or 
deny his five months figure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that some Liberal colleagues will want to 
respond that the Quebec pension plan is the envy of all Canadians. 
It is an effective plan that has proven itself.  I hope that in 
Quebec we do not just do wrong things.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-2, 
which we have been considering for several days, proposes a reform 
of the Canada pension plan and the establishment of the Canada 
Pension Plan Investment Board, and it is not a moment too soon, as 
my colleague from Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes had become essential in order to ensure the long 
term financial viability of the Canada pension plan.  The 
amendments are justified by demographic and intergenerational 
equity concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the next 35 years, the percentage of people over 65 years 
of age will almost double, reaching 23% in 2030.  When the plan was 
set up, there were eight contributors for every retiree. 
Unless something is done, by 2030, the ratio will be three workers 
for every retiree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, this bill serves to increase the 
capitalization of the plan, improve investments and reduce 
administrative costs.  The government needs the approval of two- 
thirds of the provinces representing two-thirds of the population 
in order to effect these changes.  Consultations have given the 
federal government the support of eight provinces and enabled it to 
get on with reforming its pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, Quebec is not affected by this reform, because, 
since 1965, it has administered its own pension plan, the Quebec 
pension plan. 
But it gave its support for the amendments proposed by the federal 
government.  In fact, the Government of Quebec is also undertaking 
a series of improvements to its pension plan, through Bill 149, in 
order to ensure intergenerational equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP is funded by means of obligatory contributions from 
employees, employers and the self-employed.  All Canadian workers 
between the ages of 18 and 70 will be affected by this important 
and necessary effort since, last year, 10 million people paid into 
the plan.  Last year as well, close to 3.5 million Canadians drew 
CPP benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the situation is different because, as I mentioned 
earlier, the Caisse de dépôt et placement administers our plan. 
There are 12,882 Quebeckers receiving pension benefits from the 
federal government, however, and the Bloc Quebecois feels that 
these benefits should be adequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people fall into three groups:  the first consists of 
members of the Canadian Armed Forces and the RCMP living in Quebec; 
the second of individuals now living in Quebec and already drawing 
CPP; and, finally, individuals living in Quebec who have worked all 
their life in another province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, the plan is undercapitalized.  To put it more 
simply, the plan is underfunded and will run out of money by 2015. 
If the federal government had not done something, the fund would 
have become depleted and coming generations would have paid a heavy 
price. 
It is not too late to take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will ensure that there is a reserve of five years' 
worth of benefits, instead of two, meaning that the fund, which now 
stands at $39 billion, would have to reach $135 billion by 2007. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel like saying that the federal government is showing good 
sense in the bill we are looking at, even if it comes a bit late, 
as I have said.  That has not always been the case in the past, for 
example with the employment insurance fund.  Under the pretext of 
wanting to be prepared for the eventuality of dramatic rises in 
unemployment, and therefore in the number of claims for benefits, 
the federal government instituted employment insurance, with a fund 
which will reach $13 billion by the end of 1997, and $19 billion by 
1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government has given workers and employers a 
little break with employment insurance premiums, the employment 
insurance fund surplus is still indecent and, as we all know, is 
being used only for the government's accounting purposes. But that 
is another problem, and another debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to increase the funding or capitalization of the 
plan, the bill creates a Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, a 
sort of Canadian version of the Caisse de dépôt.  The mandate of 
this new institution differs somewhat from that of the Caisse de 
dépôt et placement. Its mandate will be to earn the best possible 
rates of return.  As for the Quebec fund, it also has an economic 
mandate we must not forget, namely to invest the money in the 
pension fund wisely and to use it as a tool of economic 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be mentioned that, at the present time, the CPP policy 
takes the form of assets placed by the provinces in non-negotiable 
bonds.  Those provinces so wishing may borrow this money at the 
rate of federal government bonds.  As we can see, this is not a 
very good way to make the money of future Canadian pensioners grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say a few words about Quebec's Caisse de dépôt 
et placement in the hope that the new Canada Pension Plan 
Investment Board might one day take a page from its book.  The 
Caisse de dépôt et placement manages the savings of all Quebeckers, 
but it should be emphasized that its mandate includes the important 
requirement that it serve as an economic lever, something not found 
in the CPP's mandate.  This measure has allowed Quebec to develop 
and become competitive over the past 32 years. 
For example, the Caisse put up $16 billion to fund the James Bay 
project, thus helping create tens of thousands of jobs for 
Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the terms of its economic mandate, the Caisse de dépôt 
et placement must meet the financial needs of businesses as 
effectively as possible, invest profitably, provide support for the 
growth of Quebec businesses abroad, promote exports, and maximize 
use of the international network of financial and industrial 
partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers are proud of their Caisse de dépôt et placement. 
They are leaders in the field and have supported hundreds of 
projects that contribute to the economic development of Quebec and 
the creation of jobs.  The Caisse de dépôt et placement is also the 
largest fund manager in Canada and ranks among the top 100 in North 
America, investing in North American, European and Asian markets. 
It also has the largest real estate portfolio in Canada's 
commercial, residential and office sectors.  This flagship of 
Quebec's innovation now has close to $62.4 billion in assets and 
has generated investment income of over $47 billion since it was 
first created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a decision by the people of Quebec that gave the Caisse 
de dépôt et placement its mandate.  In creating the investment 
board, the federal government has preferred to stick to improving 
the plan's performance and protecting Canadians against premium 
increases. 
That is its decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we mentioned, the major changes introduced by this bill are 
vital if the plan is to be viable, affordable and equitable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be remembered that the plan will be subject to a review

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> You only have a few seconds left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien:</B> I will therefore conclude, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Canada pension plan is one of the essential 
elements of the Canadian social safety net. It is therefore important to 
protect this public pension plan for the people who have worked all 
their lives and to provide for their retirement. The sustainability of 
the plan is also essential for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons and despite the numerous improvements that should 
be made to this bill, the Bloc Quebecois will support it.

<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member on her comments.  She shows good 
knowledge of the bill and its intent.  The support of her party 
is very much appreciated.  It is the right thing to do for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She referred to investment.  The member will know that an 
important element of Bill C-2 is that it creates what is called 
the Canada pension plan investment board.  Under the current plan 
the two years of funding held in reserve has been invested in 
provincial bonds and earning nominal rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investment under the CPP investment board will be made in a 
broader balanced investment portfolio, managed by investment 
professionals who are fully accountable.  The member will also 
know that the auditor general will continue to be the auditor of 
the Canada pension plan.  We will have full access to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased the member raised the issue.  It is an important 
element to the extent the investment portfolio earns the best 
possible return without being disruptive in the marketplace. It 
means that overall rates which have to be charged as premiums 
will be cast at their lowest possible amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member concerns the investment activity of 
the Caisse de dépôt.  There is no question that the Caisse de 
dépôt has been a very successful investment fund and has invested 
in a number of regional economic and job creating initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member suggesting, just to make it absolutely clear, that 
the five year funding of the Canada pension plan investment fund 
should somehow be used for other purposes such as regional 
economic development, which is what the NDP has been proposing, 
or is she suggesting that in Quebec, in concert with other 
things, there is a better place to do regional economic 
development rather than with the public pension fund? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, 
the member for Mississauga-South, for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad that the member has emphasized like I did in my speech 
the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec and recognized that this fund 
has produced important economic spinoffs for Quebec, especially in the 
area of job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also clearly outlined the procedures that the board would have 
to follow for making investments under this bill. And he said that the 
investment fund would be managed by professionals whose mandate will be 
to produce the best possible return while ensuring the lowest possible 
rate of contribution. This is a process that we fully support. Except 
that I feel that this bill does not go far enough.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And as I pointed out in my speech, the accumulated funds in the 
plan should provide the opportunity to go further by allowing major 
investments in regional economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, and I think the Bloc Quebecois has reiterated this 
many times when it spoke, we believe that having professionals manage 
the investment board is a good thing in itself and indeed is an 
excellent step; it is important we ensure that this fund is managed 
professionally. 
Except that, when considering the types of investments that the board 
could make, what the Bloc Quebecois pointed out about Bill C-2 is that 
it does not go far enough to promote economic development and job 
creation. This is how I interpreted the member's question and I hope 
that I answered it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are speaking of a renewed Canada pension plan.  I 
consider it an honour to have the opportunity to address the 
House on this very important piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A renewed Canada pension plan is one of the pillars in a 
national pension plan and it is has been a priority of this 
government from the beginning.  Now, as announced in the Speech 
from the Throne, the government has introduced legislation to 
implement the proposed changes to the Canada pension plan to 
ensure Canada's pension plan is sustainable into the 21st century 
and for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out to the House that the Canada pension 
plan concerns Canadians of all ages and in all walks of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National consultations that preceded these proposed changes 
showed that the Canada pension plan concerns not only seniors but 
Canada's youth.  This government is a government that listens to 
youth. That is why the government called on young people to take 
part in the consultations that preceded the development of these 
proposals.  Beyond that, they were invited to specific 
consultation sessions held here in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have made their views very clear.  Our young people want to 
be able to count on the Canada pension plan to help them not only 
plan for their retirement but also to help support them after 
retirement.  They made it clear that they want to fix the Canada 
pension plan, not eliminate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become clear that the current plan needs fixing.  In its 
current condition it is not viable.  Changes are needed to ensure 
that the Canada pension plan can meet the income security needs 
of Canadians now and in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief actuary has forecast that with the current ratio of 
contributions to benefits paid with this current rate, the Canada 
pension plan's fund will be exhausted by the year 2015. Changes 
must be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, he has projected that to sustain the plan, 
contributions  would have to increase from the current 5.8% of 
eligible earnings to 14.2% by the year 2030 if no changes are 
made.  This is a burden too large to place on the shoulders of 
the next generation of income earners.  Canada's young people are 
facing challenges of career development and meaningful 
employment. They do not need the additional taxation or to have 
to support in addition the Canada pension plan. They are planning 
for their retirement and they have to have contribution rates 
that they can afford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes to the Canada pension plan avoid the burden 
of a plan that drains the resources of our young people to 
sustain the retirement income of those who have already retired. 
Contributions must increase, of course, and have been scheduled 
to rise to 10.1% by the year 2016. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, to ensure that the costs of sustaining the plan are 
shared fairly across all age groups, a strategy has been devised 
to increase the contribution rates to 9.9% by the year 2003 and 
then to retain that rate indefinitely.  This is in sharp contrast 
to the long term rate of 14.2% forecasted by the chief actuary. 
This requirement is necessary if this plan is to be sustained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with the present Canada pension plan, employers and employees 
will continue to contribute equally.  Contributions will go into 
an investment fund building on a larger fund which will be 
prudently invested and will allow stable benefits in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fund will be managed at arm's length from the government and 
managed to ensure a maximum rate of return consistent with the 
security of the contributor's investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through freezing the year's basic exemption, reforming future 
benefits paid and providing new investment and management 
methods, the proposed contribution rates add up to a sustainable 
plan for the future and the future of our young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Persons begin contributing to the Canada pension plan when they 
reach the age of 18 as long as their earnings are above the 
year's basic exemption.  Freezing the year's basic exemption at 
its current level of $3,500 means that now more low income 
earners will be able to contribute to the Canada pension plan, 
increasing their eligibility for future benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another tough choice was to sustain an affordable and equitable 
plan.  We had to curtail the growth of paid benefit expenditures. 
Once again, following the concerns Canadians had expressed during 
consultation, the proposed changes ensure fair treatment across 
all age groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new benefit provisions will not affect current benefit 
recipients, nor will the changes affect disability or survivor 
benefits of anyone who is currently receiving them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of the changes will be shared among future retirees, 
future survivors and future recipients of disability benefits.  A 
new formula is proposed for calculating average yearly earnings 
for pensionable purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Average earnings for pension purposes will be updated based on 
the average of five years of the year's maximum pensionable 
earnings instead of three.  There are also some limited proposed 
changes to Canada pension plan provisions such as disability and 
survivor benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to two points that I would like to emphasize 
which I think are often forgotten when discussing the Canada 
pension plan.  Providing disability and survivor benefits, the 
Canada pension plan is more than just a retirement pension 
scheme.  It may also be seen as a partial insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Canada pension plan provides survivor benefits to 
widowed spouses and disability benefits to contributors with 
severe and prolonged disability.  Furthermore, the plan provides 
child benefits to the dependent children of deceased or disabled 
contributors.  These facts should be kept in mind when 
considering changes or, more to the point, when contemplating 
replacing the plan, which has been suggested by some critics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second related point to the Canada pension plan is that it was 
not designed and should never be considered to be the sole or 
primary source of retirement income.  Its original goal was and 
continues to be to provide 25% of earnings up to the average wage 
of Canadians.  This principle also extends to the survivor and 
disability benefits under the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By all means, Canadians and particularly young Canadians should 
be encouraged to invest as much as they can in alternative 
retirement income plans such as registered retirement savings 
plans and to consider extra insurance for death or disability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan was introduced because it was 
demonstrated that Canadians, particularly those at the lower end 
of the earning scale, cannot save for their retirement and 
therefore run the risk of spending their senior years in poverty. 
For many it has become that they cannot afford to make 
investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan pools both resources and risks.  Since 
the plan includes virtually all Canadian income earners under its 
umbrella, the pool is much larger than any private plan.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the government's measures to renew and 
revitalize the Canada pension plan are based on the expressed 
wishes of the people of Canada, in partnership with most of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The renewed plan will be fairer, more affordable and 
sustainable.  The new Canada pension plan will provide a 
reliable, secure basis for retirement planning for Canadians of 
all walks of life well into the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, some 
members of Parliament, almost exclusively Reform members, gave up 
any entitlement to a member of Parliament pension during the last 
Parliament.  Most other members, mostly Liberals, NDP and the 
leader of the fifth party, retained their pensions.  They will 
get out as much as six dollars for every dollar they contribute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know how the member who just spoke can justify 
and support this Liberal boondoggle of a CPP where members 
contributing today, new members, young people, will get out less 
than they put in.  How can she continue to support a member of 
Parliament pension plan in which she could get out as much as six 
dollars for every dollar put in, paid for by those same 
taxpayers who are going to get out less than they contributed 
because of the failure of the Liberal CPP? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
from the member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Canada pension plan came into existence there were 
eight workers for every recipient.  Currently there are five 
workers for every recipient and in the future, with the 
demographic aging of the population, that number will decrease to 
three workers for every recipient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is acting in a very even handed, far reaching, 
responsible manner in revising the pension plan.  We hear over 
and over again from young people that they do not expect it to be 
there for them.  We have made the necessary revisions which will 
allow young people to have a pension plan that they will be able 
to count on when they reach the age of retirement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member spoke very well in support of the new 
Canada pension plan.  However, I polled young people and the 
results of that poll showed that young people are entirely in 
opposition to her way of thinking.  I asked them to take their 
contribution, put it together with the employer's contribution, 
take the money to a credit union, bank or investment office, tell 
them how long the money is going to be invested and compare that 
to the CPP.  I did not get one reply saying they would like to 
contribute to the Canada pension plan.  They would rather go into 
a different plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know where the Liberals are coming from.  Of all the 
replies I got, I did not get one single response saying they 
wanted to join the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to answer 
that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to hear that the hon. member surveyed his 
constituents.  I believe that a fellow Reform member brought 
forward a letter which was full of a lot of hardship and concern 
from a young mother of two children who had a husband who was 
working six days a week.  I suggest those are exactly the kinds 
of Canadians who will need to rely on the Canada pension plan 
because they do not have the money to invest in an RRSP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This plan is more than just a retirement plan.  A very large 
component, one which Canadians have said they value and want 
protected, is made up of disability and survivor benefits.  This 
government has ensured that those benefits will continue to be 
there for people who need them in the future.

presentation that she gave.  I wish the members of the Reform

the common people.  If the Reform Party offered only the super

people who may be left behind by a deceased husband and father, 
the women and children.

one of the greatest benefits of the CPP for the women of Canada.

the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women are often the main caregivers of children and aging family

rear their children they are exactly the people who will need a 
Canada pension plan because they have interrupted employment so 
they do not have the benefit of private pension plans nor the 
disposable income.  They are exactly the group that we are 
looking at to benefit from this.

<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for the opportunity to speak today on on this bill 
before us and in particular on those elements that affect 
Canadians with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan is one of the most important elements in 
the social fabric of this country.  Most of us will use it at 
some point in our lives, when we retire or become disabled by 
serious illness or accident or if we lose a spouse or parent who 
was a contributor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently Canadians have come to rely on the security that 
the Canada pension plan provides.  It has proved worthy of our 
trust over the years.  However, even the best of plans must 
change with the times.  The Canada pension plan is no exception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years a number of social, economic and demographic 
trends have developed a threat to the continuity and viability of 
the plan.  To address this challenge we held public consultations 
on the Canada pension plan to discover what role Canadians wanted 
the plan to take and what action they felt was needed. The chief 
actuary also provided input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We began a series of in depth meetings and negotiations with our 
provincial and territorial government partners.  At the end of 
this process, we and our partners put together a blueprint for 
renewal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resulting bill before us represents a balanced package of 
measures aimed at ensuring the sustainability and fairness of the 
Canada pension plan.  It adjusts contribution rates and benefits. 
It improves the way in which funds are invested.  Once 
implemented, this bill will ensure the future of the plan and 
keep contribution rate increases as low as possible. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, this cannot be done solely by adjusting contribution 
rates and investment strategies.  We had to address the benefit 
side of the equation as well, but as we did this, we rejected 
calls by some for deep cuts in survivor or disability benefits. 
Instead, we tried to minimize benefit changes and to make them 
fair across all groups and all generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To do this we have tried to spread the responsibility for change 
across all benefit categories while keeping the fundamental 
characteristics unchanged.  We recognize that today's senior 
citizens have already made their financial planning decisions for 
their retirement and could not be expected to respond to changes 
in the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the new measures will not affect the benefits 
current seniors are receiving.  That same principle applies to 
the so-called “near seniors”, individuals between the ages of 
60 and 64 who have chosen to take early retirement.  Their 
existing pensions will also be protected.  If they are receiving 
benefits now, the amount will be unaffected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members will see, some small benefit adjustments have to be 
made which will affect future pensioners, including some changes 
to the Canada pension plan disability program.  These proposed 
changes respond in part to concerns raised by the auditor general 
who said that disability administration costs need to be brought 
under control.  Again, I want to clarify that the new measures 
will not affect current Canada pension plan disability benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this bill, workers will be expected to demonstrate a 
slightly stronger attachment to the workforce to be eligible for 
disability benefits.  Currently, individuals can work for as 
little as a few months over the course of two years to receive a 
Canada pension plan disability benefit.  Under the proposed 
amendments, workers must have made contributions in four of the 
previous six years.  Even so, the new coverage rules are still 
more generous than the original rules of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before 1987 workers had to contribute in five of the previous 10 
years and at least one-third of the years from their 18th 
birthday to be eligible for disability benefits.  There are also 
changes to the requirement benefit formula for disabled 
beneficiaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pensionable earnings will be updated based on the average wage 
at the time of disablement rather than adjusted for wage levels 
when the recipient turns 65.  Like retirement and survivor 
benefits, Canada pension plan disability pensions will be fully 
price indexed from the time they are put in play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is helping Canadians with disabilities 
to participate more fully in the economic and social life of this 
country with an investment of some $280 million per year in tax 
measures, employment and vocational support, as well as support 
to organizations and for people with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also assure the House that we are committed to responding 
positively to the recommendations of the Scott task force.  We 
have already acted on some of these recommendations and will act 
on others in the near future.  However, I also want to emphasize 
that the Canada pension plan should not be confused with programs 
specific to the needs of people with disabilities.  The Canada 
pension plan disability benefit was designed as a wage loss 
insurance for workers.  It was never intended to provide benefits 
to all persons with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes contained in this bill will ensure that benefits go 
to those for whom the program was originally intended.  They will 
enable us to continue to provide disability benefits in a fair, 
consistent and responsible manner.  They reaffirm the Government 
of Canada's concern for people with disabilities, while 
maintaining benefits at sustainable levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians from all regions and walks of life have told us they 
expect us to act decisively to preserve the Canada pension plan. 
They have told us that they want us to make it sustainable, but 
they want to do so in a fair and consistent manner. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Significant elements of the CPP remain unchanged.  First, 
benefits have not been changed in the case of all those currently 
receiving CPP pensions, disability benefits, survivor benefits or 
combined benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, all CPP benefits, with the exception of the death 
benefit, which is paid only once, remain fully indexed to 
inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the age of early, normal or late retirement remains 
unchanged. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill responds to this call for action from Canadians.  Once 
implemented, it will ensure that the Canada pension plan will be 
able to serve Canadians as well in the future as it does today. 
It will do so in a way that is fair to all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, I intend to vote for this bill and urge other 
members to do likewise. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
indicate to this House in my comment that I think it is so 
unfortunate that what we do is we emphasize messaging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are saying over and over again “We want to 
preserve the Canada pension plan because it is so wonderful.  If 
we don't, all these poor people are going to suffer”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the brutal fact.  No one who has a low income or no 
income or who is poor is paying into Canada pension.  Therefore, 
they are not eligible for benefits.  That is a fact.  The 
government keeps passing it on as if that is not true.  It keeps 
trying to connect this.  The fact is that anyone who has an 
income, who has a job and has deductions for the Canada pension 
plan would have that same amount of money available for RRSPs or 
other investments which he or she could choose, get a much better 
rate and end up with more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government is saying it is protecting the poor, what 
it is in fact doing is taking from particularly the middle income 
and the lower income people who are paying into the Canada 
pension plan, and it is giving them a tremendously poor return on 
their investment.  It is somehow trying to message and image that 
as being the great heroes, the Liberal Party, saving the country 
from all these woes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like a response to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was recently interested in listening to a group which 
represents poor people in this country.  They genuinely supported 
what the government was doing with respect to the Canada pension 
plan.  They reiterated something I had forgotten.  That was that 
this is a great pillar of our society and our economy.  It 
represents social justice in this great nation of ours, rather 
than going off on a half-baked, hare-brained scheme like super 
RRSPs which no one understands, and I think only the rich would 
be involved with, which is what the Reform would have us do 
without knowing where that is going.  It seems important that we 
stand firm and stand solid with the scheme that CPP is and 
represents to all Canadians something which poor Canadians, 
middle-income Canadians and all Canadians want and need and will 
benefit from as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is very important and is worthy of note. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, a question for the hon. member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize, as most Canadians do, that up until this point the 
investment of the government with the clients' funds has a 
deplorable record.  What guarantee can this government give that 
the new CPP investment board is going to have one thing in mind 
and one thing only, to maximize every dollar put into the plan to 
the benefit of the clientele?  What guarantee can the member give 
me of that?. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
the question.  It is an important one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that when the various provincial and territorial 
leaders signed on to this very important change, they too were 
concerned with the kind of question which the member is asking. 
What they said and said unanimously was that we would be 
proceeding in a fair and equitable manner.  The same rules that 
apply to the public CPP would be similar to what the private 
people have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember that the same kind of common sense approach 
would be taken in both private and public.  The board that has 
been put in place would make sure that that is done in a fair, 
consistent and equitable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for Canadians to know that that kind of process 
will be taking place by men and women who know what they are 
doing, by men and women who have the best interests of Canadians 
at heart, by men and women who will progress and proceed in a 
manner consistent with the great values of this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a rare opportunity to be able to speak to a bill 
of major consequence.  In my last opportunity to speak in the 
Chamber on Bill C-2 respecting changes to the Canada pension plan 
I begin by expressing a great deal of regret and disappointment. 
One can only be left with the conclusion that the government is 
profoundly undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had some experience in the political arena before I came to 
the Chamber.  It came as a real shock and surprise to learn that 
the government was willing to bypass the democratic process, to 
bring in closure on debate after only seven hours at second 
reading and to deny many of us in the Chamber the opportunity to 
speak on behalf of constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizens everywhere in Canada want to have their voices heard. 
They believe in the democratic process. They believe members were 
elected to speak in their behalf and to bring their concerns to 
the Chamber.  Now they are left feeling more cynical and more 
sceptical about the democratic process because the government 
could not even allow a reasonable amount of time for proper 
debate on a major topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us on this side of the Chamber did not have a chance to 
speak at all.  Certainly we did not engage in the kind of debate 
we expected to happen, given the seriousness of the issue. 
Equally disturbing has been the government's treatment of the 
committee process and of the thoughtful amendments proposed at 
report stage.  The government ploughed straight ahead from day 
one with no intention of consulting with other Canadians or 
members of Parliament, of listening to the views of organizations 
that have developed some expertise in this area, or of taking 
seriously any thoughtful amendments on the whole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are at third reading with hardly any debate, no serious 
treatment of our amendments, and the government wants us to 
rubber stamp its bill.  It wants to get the bill through before 
anybody wakes up and realizes the devastating impact it will have 
on Canadians.  It is appalling on the basis of the democratic 
process alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concerns are raised in the Chamber by very serious 
substantive inclusions in the bill.  In my last opportunity to 
speak on the bill I remind the House of the work of Stanley 
Knowles for years and years and years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Move on to this century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  A member across the way 
suggested that we get into this century.  Is the member 
suggesting that the work of Stanley Knowles in helping to shape 
and create a universal pension plan is not significant, is not 
worthy of note or is not there to guide us in the future?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Stanley Knowles worked from 1942 on trying to make changes to 
ensure we had an adequate income retirement system.  He started 
back when the old age pension act allowed Canadians $20 a month 
and was means tested.  He stood up to fight that meagre, mean 
program and made some difference.  He kept fighting until 1963 
when the Canada pension plan was first introduced.  He fought to 
see that benefits were indexed.  He kept his fight going until 
1967 when we were able to see come to fruition some semblance of 
a guaranteed income supplement program.  He kept fighting through 
to 1975 to try to change the spousal allowance which only 
guaranteed women between the ages of 60 and 65 years, if they 
were single or widowed, some measure of security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After that long struggle I would like to quote what Stanley 
Knowles said:

they learned about this piece of legislation.

would have voted on this issue, it is fair to say that he would 
have respected the government's position in keeping the

well enough that I think I can say that.  While he might not have 
voted with us, he would have respected the government for what it 
has done.

a petition with 500,000 signatures, was not able to appear. Many

opportunity to go to the expense and the time to get here.

late on this bill although it has been an indecently short debate 
that has occurred on this important legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to read into the record some excerpts from a 
report by Eric Norman, the president of the Council of Canadians 
with Disabilities, and Harry Beatty, the director of policy and 
research for ARCH:  A Legal Resource Centre for Persons with 
Disabilities. At the same time I would like to comment on some of 
the more chilling aspects of this report. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disability component of the Canada pension plan has been 
targeted for billions of dollars in cutbacks in the recent 
legislative amendments announced by the finance minister and by 
the Minister of Human Resources Development. The impact of these 
changes on Canadians with disabilities has been consistently 
understated or totally ignored by both politicians and the media. 
To a great many disadvantaged and vulnerable individuals however 
the new rules will be devastating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixteenth CPP actuarial report prepared by federal chief 
actuary Bernard Dussault projects a total cumulative reduction in 
CPP spending on disability pensions by the year 2005 of over $1 
billion— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to repeat that, $1 billion. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—while the cutback in retirement pensions and other benefits for 
the same period is less than $.5 billion. Since the disability 
program is only about one-fifth of the total CPP, this means that 
it is being cut much more than any other component of the CPP. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it astounding that what we are doing is cutting the 
benefits of the most vulnerable members of our society. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The depth of this reduction in CPP disability has been carefully 
hidden from the public by the federal government and the eight 
provincial governments which support the cutbacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those already receiving CPP disability pensions will not have 
them taken away or reduced. The persons who will be adversely 
affected by the “reforms” are now working, often blissfully 
unaware of the career-ending disability which will affect them in 
future.  The government has adopted the same strategy for persons 
with disabilities as for seniors:  “grandfather” those now 
eligible, to blunt criticism, and apply the cuts to those whose 
needs will arise in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister has recently indicated a willingness to 
rethink the seniors benefit—he should look again at the 
disability proposals as well.  It is unjust to do otherwise.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The new CPP plan, scheduled to come into effect on January 1, 
1998, has the support not only of the federal government but of 
eight provincial governments.  Only B.C. and Saskatchewan are 
opposed.  Under the amending formula, which requires CPP 
amendments to be supported by two-thirds of the provinces 
representing two-thirds of Canada's population, there is 
sufficient provincial support to have the changes apply across 
Canada—.  Quebec participates fully under the amending formula, 
although it has its own Quebec pension plan.  The PQ government 
is co-operating with the federal government in making the 
disability program cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of 1998, the new rules will require CPP disability pension 
applicants to have earned more than a specified amount in four of 
the last six years prior to being determined to be disabled. 
Current rules require contributions in either two of the last 
three years or five of the last 10 years.  Who will be excluded 
from eligibility?  Young people in the first three years of 
employment will not qualify. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if a young person who is 21 and has an accident in 
the first year of his job and he is not covered by workers 
compensation or he has no private pension plan, which very few 
people do, that young person will in fact go straight on welfare 
for the rest of his life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another example perhaps a young person with a disability such 
as Down's syndrome lives with his family and has modest means 
with no other pension plan.  That person may have no labour force 
attachment—that very strange phrase we use today meaning a job. 
And the chances as we know are very limited that people with 
disabilities have jobs unless there is enormous support available 
for them to get those jobs to begin with.  We also know that 
those supports are disappearing at a great rate.  The future for 
that person without labour force attachment will be either 
institutionalization or welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a cruel irony that this government spends so much time 
talking about youth when in fact what it is doing is setting them 
up for a very bitter harvest in the future.  That is what we are 
doing now for our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others who will be affected very negatively by these changes 
will be those with recent attachments to the workforce who have 
for reasons beyond their control such as unemployment or 
caregiving responsibilities somehow been unable to be eligible. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of particular concern to us are those who have tried to keep 
working despite the onset of a disability—multiple sclerosis, or 
psychiatric disability, cancer, amongst many others. They will be 
“rewarded” for their determined efforts in many cases by 
complete disentitlement to a CPP disability pension, which in 
turn will greatly reduce their eventual retirement pensions. To 
top it all off—pensions will now start to rise above the 
minimum contribution level, so someone with low earnings may have 
to pay CPP contributions to the government in a year, only to be 
told later that the contributions do not help in qualifying for a 
disability pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those currently receiving CPP disability will not be affected. 
Those who apply before the end of 1997 will also have their cases 
determined under the present rules, so if you believe you may 
qualify, you should apply as soon as possible. But thousands who 
become disabled in the future will be disentitled, especially as 
they reach their fifties and sixties, where the likelihood of 
disability is much greater.

there.  Those who do qualify for CPP pensions will have their 
eventual retirement pensions lowered by the new rules.  Widows 
and widowers who are themselves disabled will have their combined 
survivor disability benefits reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse still, the federal government states it will continue its 
administrative changes to the CPP disability program which it 
describes as “improvements”.  What Human Resources Development 
Canada has really achieved through its administrative 
“improvements” has been a restricted approach to determining 
who is disabled, which has disentitled thousands of Canadians 
unfairly.  Older workers in particular, in their fifties and 
sixties, are being found “capable of working” despite 
significant health problems leading to physical and mental 
limitations.  The “jobs” they are supposedly able to do may 
exist in a bureaucrat's CPP manual but they do not exist in 
Canadian communities in 1997. CPP continues as well to penalize 
those who attempt training, education, rehabilitation programs or 
a part time or time limited return to work by finding them 
“employable” as well, in spite of a supposed policy which says 
this should not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You do not get rich on CPP disability.  Monthly disability 
pensions in 1997 range from a minimum of $330 to a maximum of 
$883.  Payments are taxable so they are reduced in value for 
those with higher incomes.  But for many who have a limited 
attachment to the workforce—

<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—because of unemployment, caregiving, home making or the onset of 
disability, the CPP pension benefit is desperately needed.  It 
may be the only benefit a disabled person qualifies for, for 
example, if his or her spouse is working or if there is a modest 
income from savings. It is unfair to take the CPP disability 
pension away from those who need it the most.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Completely unnoticed in the debate is the cost impact of 
reductions in the CPP disability program on other disability 
income programs, including provincial social assistance, workers

is cut—

I guess the NDP is the only party in this House that really feels 
there is no problem with the Canada pension plan.  It ignores the 
fact that changes were required to the Canada pension plan.  The 
NDP thinks that just sitting back and hoping things will get 
better will deal with the challenges the plan is faced with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the NDP members continue to talk about the disability side 
of the benefit, they need to understand that as a reflection of 
what Canadians have said, 75% of the changes to CPP are on the 
financing side and 25% are on the benefit side.  We went easy on 
the benefits and that is a reflection of what Canadians said 
throughout the consultation period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a year and a half of consultations.  Members from the 
CFL, United Steelworkers, CUPE, CAW, Canadian Labour Congress,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, $1 billion by the year 2005 
is not going easy on benefits. Although the CPP disability 
program has its weaknesses, nevertheless it has been an important 
cornerstone in Canada's safety net for those who have become 
disabled.  The CPP disability cuts will save a few pennies from 
everyone's paycheques but thousands who become disabled will 
suffer the consequences.

want to congratulate the member on her sincerity in terms of the 
plight of the disabled in Canada.  There are many people in 
Canada who are in circumstances that do not allow them to 
participate in the Canada pension plan.  I know that the member 
is very sensitive to the plight of the stay at home mom who 
spends a great part of the income earning years managing the 
family home and caring for preschool children and who does not 
get any benefits. I am sure that the member would agree that 
consideration should be given to dealing with the issue of unpaid 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member a question. She is probably aware 
that the history of the disability benefit in the Canada pension 
plan is such that the number of claimants has been substantially 
larger than was ever anticipated and that the duration of 
disability benefits has been over a much longer protracted 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member would concede that notwithstanding the 
need for disability benefits, the important issue is the pension 
benefits.  The provinces and the federal government agreed in 
consultations that we should not do anything that would impinge 
on the security of the pension.  Would she agree that it is 
important to secure the pension benefits first and deal with the 
disabilities with the best efforts possible? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I have to go back to the 
astounding figure of $1 billion being taken out of disability 
payments by the year 2005.  I have to go back to the fact that we 
are looking at young people who in the future will grow older and 
who will possibly become disabled.  We have to make sure there is 
enough money available to allow them a decent quality of life in 
the future.  That is the bottom line.  We find the money wherever 
we can, but find it. That is all there is to it.

letting the members of the New Democratic Party know that a 
couple of years ago I hosted a reception on Parliament Hill to 
help launch the Stanley Knowles chair at St. Paul's College at

important and we all owe a debt to those Canadians for their 
forward thinking in making the issue a reality in Canada which 
has greatly improved the lives of seniors.

has done just that.  The changes contained in this bill represent 
one more element in the larger policy agenda that the government 
has pursued since its first day in office, an agenda aimed at 
ensuring the well-being now and in future of our young people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, we introduced EI reform.  In addition to being 
fairer and more effective it has allowed many part time workers 
to be eligible for benefits for the first time. We also 
introduced the youth employment strategy to give young Canadians 
the training and work experience they need to make the transition 
from school to work a little easier.  We recently announced our 
intention to introduce a national child benefit to fight child 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today represents one more element in this 
strategy.  It is a balanced package of measures that will 
establish a new investment strategy and adjust contribution rates 
and benefits so the Canada pension plan can continue to serve 
Canadians well in the future as it does today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who complain because rates will increase 
slightly and benefits will decrease slightly.  Yes, this is true. 
However, it is also true that the chief actuary has projected 
that if the status quo were maintained, premiums would have to go 
to over 14% in order to preserve the Canada pension plan. This 
situation would threaten future prospects of young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because this Liberal government has looked ahead to the 
future and is taking action now that premiums will increase 
incrementally over the next five years to a ceiling of 9.9%. This 
increase will be shared by employers and employees equally. This 
is substantially lower than the 14% increase we would have if we 
sat on our duffs and did nothing, as the previous Conservative 
government did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These modest increases teamed with small adjustments to benefits 
and improved management of the plan's assets will sustain the 
plan for future generations of Canadians. The proposed changes in 
this legislation reflect the ideas expressed during Canada 
pension plan public consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consulted with my constituents on the future of the Canada 
pension plan in the winter of 1994-95.  Sixty-three per cent of 
the respondents said they supported an increased rate of 
contribution. Almost 70% were opposed to privatization, which is 
what the Reform Party is proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have listened to our constituents.  The proposed changes also 
reflect negotiations with our provincial and territorial partners 
and the recent work of the House of Commons committee that 
studied the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ensuring an affordable, sustainable and credible plan also means 
looking at the benefit side of the Canada pension plan. However, 
during consultations Canadians told us to go easy on changes to 
benefits.  Eighty per cent of my constituents were against the 
elimination of survivor and death benefits.  Seventy-five per 
cent were opposed to increasing the benefit age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have listened to them.  The proposed changes are moderate and 
they will be shared among all groups and be fair across 
generations so that no one is unduly burdened.  Moreover, current 
retirees who are not able to adjust their retirement plans will 
not have their current benefits affected by the changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those changes that will affect future retirees are modest.  For 
instance, there is a new formula for adjusting previous earnings 
and calculating retirement pensions.  This change will only 
affect benefits payable to future retirees.  For example, 
retirement pensions will be based on the year's maximum 
pensionable earnings of the last five years instead of the last 
three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes resulting from Bill C-2 in terms of benefits will be 
small.  For example, the maximum monthly pension based on this 
year's figures would be $724 instead of the current $736.  The 
eligibility criteria for disability pensions will be updated. 
Future applicants will have to have contributed to the plan in 
four of the last six years.  This is a reasonable requirement 
given that Canada pension plan disability is not designed to be a 
lifetime income replacement.  Currently, recipients must have 
contributed in two of the last three years or five of the last 
ten years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also changes to the retirement benefit formula for 
disabled beneficiaries.  Like retirement and survivor benefits, 
Canada pension plan disability pensions will be fully indexed 
from the time they are put in play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the public consultations Canadians, including persons 
with disabilities, told us that people should have to work longer 
to qualify for disability benefits.  So this bill requires a 
stronger workforce attachment.  It also brings disability 
pensioner benefits in line with other Canada pension plan 
benefits.  Effective administration measures have already been 
taken to strengthen the administration of the disability program. 
As a result the disability caseload has been substantially 
reduced.  There are new guidelines for determining disability. We 
are doing more follow-up work to ensure continuing eligibility 
and we are using new technology to manage cases. 
We have launched a pilot project to enhance rehabilitation 
efforts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another change affecting the future benefits payable involves 
combined benefits.  Some beneficiaries can currently stack 
disability and survivor benefits, or survival and retirement 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current rules combining disability plus survivor 
benefits, beneficiaries can receive up to $185 more per month 
than other disability beneficiaries.  Under this bill the 
combined total would not exceed the maximum disability pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the rules for calculating combined survivor retirement 
benefits will change.  These changes would bring the rules closer 
to those which existed before 1987 when the rules governing 
stacking provisions were relaxed.  Like other benefit changes, 
these reforms do not affect people already receiving benefits 
under these provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would also adjust the death benefit.  Currently the 
benefit equals six months of the contributor's retirement benefit 
or 10% of the year's maximum pensionable earnings, which is 
$3,580 in 1997.  The formula would reduce the ceiling to $2,500 
and freeze it at that level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About one half of Canadian workers already have similar coverage 
through private sector insurance.  It is important to remember 
that the death benefit was never intended to cover 100% of the 
cost.  It was designed to be combined with other financial 
planning efforts to meet individual needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes in this bill will ensure fairness and sustainability 
of the Canada pension plan.  That is what Canadians have asked us 
to do, fix the CPP where it needs to fixed so that it will always 
be there, Canada's legacy to our future generations.  The plan 
will ensure our seniors are always taken care of.  That is the KW 
way, that is the Liberal way and that is the Canadian way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Administration of the plan will be improved, funds will be 
invested and managed professionally and the plan will be able to 
serve our children and grandchildren when they need it.  For this 
reason I urge all members to support this legislation before us 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also pay tribute to the Minister of Finance who is continuing 
the legacy of his father by bringing the financial affairs of 
this country in order so we are able to have social programs like 
the Canada pension plan.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
wondering if the member for Kitchener—Waterloo would be able to 
give me some comfort at this point with some of my concerns about 
a young person.  A young person who has just entered the 
workforce gets injured on the job.  They have not been working 
for three years, maybe for three months, and does not have a 
wealthy family. Their family is not labour force attached and has 
no facilities whatsoever. What is the future of that person at 
that point in their ability to make their way through the world? 
Does he have some real comfort that he can give me now given the 
new changes in the plan that is being instituted? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. 
colleague for her question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, injuries on the job are covered by compensation programs 
at the provincial level.  The disability benefit was not meant to 
be there for everybody.  It was meant to be there for people who 
have had a reasonable attachment to the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case the member refers to it would have to be a case of 
going with the compensation program at the provincial level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It being 5.15 p.m., 
pursuant to order made on Monday, December 1, 1997, it is my duty 
to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every question 
necessary to dispose of the third reading stage of the bill now 
before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the House ready for the question?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK277">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
enact legislation mandating toy manufacturers to label toys 
containing phthalates in order to allow parents to make an 
informed decision when buying products for their children. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I would like to rise today on an issue that 
is of great importance at this time of the year, children's toys. 
While we are discussing this issue, thousands of parents are in shopping 
centres buying toys for their children, but some of these toys can be 
dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion I am moving today proposes that all toys containing 
phthalates be labelled so that parents can make an informed decision 
when buying products for their children. Phthalates are chemical agents 
that soften plastics. They are used in many items, including plastic 
covers for containers, cellophane tissue and children's toys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this motion, I ask the government to take action in the case 
of plastic toys, because studies have shown that this material can cause 
cancer, damage the liver, and cause infertility. These studies also show 
that children are more vulnerable to these toxic effects, especially 
during the growing years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is of even greater concern to me is the fact that these 
phthalates can be found in pacifiers, in teething rings and in a variety 
of other toys. Imagine, our children are biting into toys that release 
chemical agents that can cause cancer. Soft plastic toys containing 
phthalates are like a sponge. When a child bites into a teething ring, 
these phthalates are released into his digestive system, in the same way 
that water is released when a sponge is squeezed. Once in the system, 
these phthalates apparently alter the normal development of the 
reproductive organs, for example, and they could cause health problems 
like cancer, infertility and damage to the liver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So here are these parents in shopping centres probably buying 
without knowing it toys that can harm their children. That is why 
labelling is required to allow parents to make informed decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was Greenpeace that brought the issue of phthalates to the 
attention of Canadians. 
Greenpeace did research on toys bought here in Canada to determine the 
percentage of toys containing phthalates. This research revealed that 
phthalates made up a rather important part of the product, and often 
accounted for 10 to 40% of the weight of a toy. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After Greenpeace released its findings, Health Canada conducted its 
own study, which confirmed Greenpeace's findings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If our children put in their mouths toys with a 40% toxic content, 
it is imperative that we take immediate action to protect them. In 
September, Health Canada started studying the effects of ingesting 
phthalates contained in toys. This study is still at the preliminary 
stages but, so far, no action has been taken by the government to 
increase the visibility of this very serious concern. The department's 
attitude seems to be: let us wait for the results of our study; too bad 
if children get sick in the meantime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You may recall the time we learned about the serious health hazard 
posed by the mini-blinds that everyone had in their windows. Only after 
several cases of poisoning were reported in the United States did the 
government act. Putting the lives of our children at risk because 
science cannot answer all our questions quickly enough is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Denmark, tests conducted on rats showed that phthalates cause 
cancer, liver damage and infertility. These new findings prompted some 
store chains in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Argentina, Spain, 
Belgium and Italy to take a large number of phthalate containing toys 
off the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These stores were responding to a request from the government of 
their country for the voluntary withdrawal of phthalate containing toys. 
These stores incurred losses as a result, but they felt that protecting 
the health of children was more important than making profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Netherlands, Austria and Denmark have put in motion the 
necessary process to regulate the use of phthalates not only in toys but 
also in other plastic products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this week, Denmark's environment minister asked the 
Environmental Protection Agency to develop a proposal to ban all 
phthalate containing toys for small children. This is what he had to say 
about phthalates. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to phthalates in toys for smaller children, I have 
already had the Environmental Protection Agency prepare proposals 
for a ban.  Ever since the problem with phthalates has shown up, 
the industry has made enormous effort in trying to dismiss all 
problems instead of developing more health and environmental 
friendly material.  It is time to act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, that was what Danish environment minister Svend Auken said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Belgian minister of public health also encouraged toy 
distributors in his country to take some toys off the market. 
He had this to say to the Belgian federation of distributors: 
“Given the results of analyses in certain countries of the European 
Union, which indicate that toys and other common objects made of 
plastic style PVC intended for chewing by young children release 
significant quantities of phthalates that could represent a health 
hazard, I appeal to the sense of responsibility of the Belgian 
federation of distributors and ask you to intervene with members of 
your federation and have them take voluntary action against the 
marketing of such products”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Belgian minister continued: “I would also stress that you 
do urgently whatever is necessary to withdraw these plastic style 
PVC products containing phthalates from sale and thus maintain 
consumer confidence in the safety of these toys”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just quoted the remarks of two European ministers.  If 
they considered it necessary to act on the matter of phthalates, 
should Canada not do the same?  If these countries, in the light of 
new information, thought it necessary to withdraw plastic toys from 
the market, we should obtain the information parents need to know 
what they are buying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a matter of protecting our children and of consumer 
rights.  In Canada today, parents concerned by what children put in 
their mouths cannot know that the toys contain phthalates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The labels of toys containing phthalates provide the 
information parents need to make a considered decision. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, Canadian parents have to guess.  That is not 
acceptable.  It is also a public information issue.  I talk with 
parents all over the country, and they are alarmed at not being 
able to get this information.  They tell me that their priority is 
their children's health and that they are entitled to access to 
information as vital as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I did a test with our press colleagues.  I gave 
them a series of plastic toys and asked them which ones contained 
phthalates.  Of course, nobody could tell me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with phthalates is that they cannot detect it.  We 
have to test for it in the lab or have the manufacturer's list of 
materials that went into the toy. 
This is why we need labels, in order to know which toys might be 
dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, Health Canada is starting to do testing 
on certain toys, but any parent knows that there are a number of 
toys made out of soft plastic.  Before Health Canada can test all 
those toys, we might well be in the next millenium.  Action must be 
taken now to protect our children's health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, Health Canada has not yet determined what 
concentration of phthalates is considered dangerous.  Even if the 
toy testing is done, then, they do not have the tools to determine 
what is acceptable and what is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know how much time it takes to get standards approved. 
In this case, as well, Canada is seeking to get an international 
standard set, which means that once our position has been 
determined, we will have to get it accepted by the European 
countries, the United States, Australia and New Zealand, as well as 
by our colleagues in this undertaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect what Health Canada is doing, but I believe that, if 
our European counterparts have acted in a definitive manner on 
this, the least we can do is to label these toys.  Too often in 
this House we hear of cases where the government has not acted fast 
enough to deal with a situation, out of lack of information or 
neglect.  This week we received the Krever report, which 
underscores the shortcomings in government action on tainted blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In ten years, do we want to realize that we did not act fast 
enough on phthalates?  I want to be very clear here, a ban on the 
use of phthalates is not what I want. 
I understand that science has its merits and must be allowed to play its 
role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am only asking that toys be labelled. This way, 
Health Canada could take whatever steps are necessary and the public 
could make informed decisions. In the meantime, I ask toy manufacturers 
to do what the Danish environment minister asked. Many other substances 
can be used to make plastic soft. Why risk it? Why not just use other 
plasticisers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often overlook the financial factor in health issues. By taking 
preventative steps now, we will not need to use an already overburdened 
health system later. We are talking about diseases for which treatment 
is expensive. Cancer, infertility and liver damage are expensive to 
treat. Prevention always pays off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And, of course, there is the human cost. How can you not act when 
there are small children who are growing and who, 20, 30 or 40 years 
from now, could develop cancer or be unable to have children of their 
own because they chewed on soft plastic toys when they were toddlers. 
Why take such a risk? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a sensible country where the well-being of its 
citizens dominates.  When other countries take firm action on 
a health issue such as this one, should we not act as soon as 
possible to ensure that Canadians are protected?  Of late this 
government has been more preoccupied with the bottom line than 
the best interests of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am asking is not much, a label on toys to ensure that 
Canadian parents can make an informed decision.  Why would we be 
afraid of an informed public?  The human cost of ingesting 
phthalates is enormous.  We are talking about kids with 
vulnerable bodies who are shaping themselves.

shirt or pants are too small.  Imagine that while their little 
organs are developing our children are taking a chemical which 
will alter the normal development process.  This means that their 
little hearts and their little brains do not develop normally. 
That is the bottom line.  That is what we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Put in those terms, putting a label on the toys does not seem 
like much, does it? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stressed the risks associated with phtalates. I listed the 
immediate steps various countries took to take toys off the shelves in 
stores. I am not asking that we reinvent the wheel. I just want 
Canadians to have all the information they need to make the right 
decision. Everyone benefits from toy labelling. Let us act now to 
protect our children's health. I am asking my hon. colleagues to make 
this their Christmas present to all Canadian children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK278"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton—Lawrence, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the House 
is being asked today to support a motion requiring toy manufacturers to 
label toys containing phthalates. It is claimed that such a measure 
would enable parents to make an informed decision when they buy toys for 
their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the motion clearly seeks to protect children against 
potentially dangerous phthalates, it is not the best solution to the 
problem. Why? Because merely indicating on a label that a toy contains 
phthalates does not tell parents anything about the potential risk and 
is therefore of little help in making an informed decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The label can only be of some use if it specifies the type of 
phthalate, its concentration in the toy, and the concentrations which 
could potentially be harmful to a child. Moreover, if a particular toy 
was found to contain potentially dangerous phthalates, even in high 
enough concentrations to be harmful to children, it would not be 
necessary to issue a warning on the label, since that toy would simply 
not be sold. Indeed, the government would already have taken steps to 
have such a product taken off the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second problem concerning the motion is the legislation. Should 
the motion be adopted, the Hazardous Products (Toys) Regulations under 
the Hazardous Products Act would have to be amended to make it 
compulsory to indicate the presence of phthalates in toys made with PVC 
plastic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this would be an unnecessary measure. As it now stands, the 
Hazardous Products Act already gives the government effective and 
powerful instruments to deal with potential threats to children's 
health. The act formally prohibits certain toxic solvents and 
substances. If it was found that some toys contain unacceptable levels 
of potentially harmful substances, the government would take appropriate 
measures to have these toys taken off the market.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like, if I may, to draw attention to an apparent 
oversight in this motion.  The mere presence of phthalates in a 
given product does not necessarily constitute a health hazard. 
Health Canada officials are now looking at studies in order to 
determine whether the phthalates in question are in fact hazardous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like to draw attention to the third problem 
with this motion, which is that the labelling it proposes for the 
products in question would not constitute a reliable or effective 
method in the event of an actual hazard. 
Labelling cannot take the place of energetic and decisive action, 
should such action ever be necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I wish to stress that the Hazardous Products Act, 
together with Health Canada's ongoing monitoring, analysis and 
evaluation activities, provides the government with all the tools 
it needs to deal with any potential health hazard caused by the 
presence of phthalates in plastic PVC products. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the motion, the hon. member asserts that the government 
should enact legislation mandating toy manufacturers to label 
toys containing phthalates in order to allow parents to make an 
informed decision when buying products for their children.  The 
motion is well intentioned, but the fact is that there is no 
conclusive evidence linking all, and I stress the word all, 
phthalates in toys to health risks for children.  In fact there 
has never been a reported case of a child experiencing ill 
effects from phthalates in this country or anywhere else. For 
this reason, it is difficult for us to support the motion at this 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean however that the government is taking the 
matter lightly.  Quite the contrary.  As I indicated a moment 
ago, officials within the department are currently investigating 
the potential health risks of phthalates in polyvinyl chloride or 
PVC plastic toys.  In other words, we are being proactive rather 
than reactive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My minister, the minister responsible for the health and 
well-being of Canadian children, has already assured this House, 
and I repeat that assurance, that if at any time clear evidence 
of health risks from phthalates are established, appropriate 
action will be taken to protect the health of children and I dare 
say with alacrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada's investigation of potential health risks from 
phthalates includes ongoing information exchange with the 
department's counterparts in the United States and in Europe, 
with industry, advocacy groups and health associations, as well 
as a comprehensive literature assessment on the potential 
toxicity of phthalates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of this investigation, Health Canada officials are 
undertaking a scientific risk assessment on phthalates in various 
PVC plastic products.  This risk assessment involves two key 
elements:  an evaluation to determine the presence of potentially 
toxic substances, and testing to see if these substances can in 
fact be absorbed by children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that Health Canada's sound research combined with 
ongoing dialogue and consultation with government, industry and 
NGOs, stakeholders and players will result in a clear assessment 
of this issue, an assessment I am confident that will form a 
solid, well-informed basis for any possible future action on this 
matter by the Government of Canada. This approach focuses on 
solid evidence-based risk assessment as a means of understanding 
and acting on complex health issues, particularly as they relate 
to children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Permit me to suggest that the thorough and comprehensive nature 
of our response to this potential health threat is also a 
reflection of the government's ongoing commitment to ensuring the 
health and safety of all of Canada's children.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the circumstances while it is well intentioned, the motion 
goes beyond what is already in place.  In fact it becomes 
unnecessary.  We have all the mechanisms already in place.  They 
are already being utilized and they are being employed in a 
proactive and aggressive fashion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK279"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak on Motion No. M-85 which has been brought 
forward by the hon. member Acadie—Bathurst. I must say to the 
hon. member I support the motion before us. In doing so I must 
add that I have a number of questions and some concerns which we 
will investigate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is truly unfortunate in the way in which we do things in 
the House of Commons is that my concerns and questions will not 
be answered because the format for debate of a private member's 
motion does not allow for a question and answer session. In view 
of this I am hopeful that the sponsor of the motion might address 
in his closing remarks some of the questions that I raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, I am curious as to whether or not any regulatory 
impact studies will be done in order to give manufacturers an 
idea of how they will be expected to comply. It is clear the 
effort to label toys with phthalates will rest with the 
manufacturers.  In this regard it would also be nice if they 
could have some idea of the costs that would be associated with 
doing this.  This is not to say that the labelling costs should 
in any way shape or form be placed ahead of consumer safety, 
especially where the safety of children is concerned, far from 
it. However in fairness to an industry which will be expected to 
comply with any new regulations some idea of costs must be given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other consideration has to do with the study performed by 
Greenpeace.  I wonder if there have been any other studies done. 
Have toy manufacturers in Europe responded only to this study? 
Have they directly responded at all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not calling into question Greenpeace's objectivity or 
scientific analysis, but its disdain for corporations of all 
kinds is no secret.  Indeed we only have to look at the way in 
which in Europe it has misrepresented the British Columbia 
forestry practices to understand what I am saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event I and my Reform colleagues are in favour of what 
the member is proposing regardless of whether the issue is one of 
safety, particularly that of children, or manufacturing 
compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard I am particularly impressed that the motion 
places the responsibility of whether or not to purchase a toy 
containing phthalates with the consumer.  This is a good thing as 
we should not underestimate the ability of consumers to decide 
what is in their or in this case their children's interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All too often in this House we see members put forward 
legislation which seeks to ban or to remove or otherwise restrict 
a product based on tentative findings.  This applies to members 
on both sides of the House so I hope that my friends in the 
government will not feel like I am singling them out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of these questions or concerns imply that phthalates are 
not toxic.  We know that they are.  But even Greenpeace will 
concede that the leaching of phthalates from a toy into a child 
is not an absolute certainty.  However, in cases like this I 
think we must always err on the side of caution especially 
because it involves the safety of our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard I agree with the principal intent of this motion 
which is to inform consumers of a potential hazard. 
I note that the effort in Europe has gone beyond alerting 
consumers to the presence of phthalates in toys to one of 
actually removing them from shelves. With this in mind, perhaps 
the hon. member from the NDP could comment on whether this extra 
step was indeed warranted or whether it was an over-reaction to a 
situation.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it was not an over-reaction by European governments, then I 
commend the hon. member for not blindly following their lead in 
this matter.  If removal was necessary, then are we not placing 
Canadian consumers at some form of risk?  Again, the comments of 
the hon. member for the NDP would be useful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, I would like to know if Canadian manufacturers are aware 
of the problems that are associated with phthalates.  If they 
are, what is their position on the matter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important because they should be given a chance to 
voluntarily sort this thing out for themselves.  This is a more 
effective route, instead of being ambushed by regulations which 
they would be forced to comply with on short notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to again commend the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst for 
his foresight in this matter.  Indeed, given the time of the year 
which we are now celebrating, highlighting this concern for 
parents who will be buying toys of all kinds is a very worthwhile 
endeavour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I appreciate having had this opportunity to speak on 
this matter to the House today.  I look forward to seeing the 
motion passed by the House and I trust that the hon. member 
sponsoring the motion will consider some of what I have said here 
today. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK280"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak today on the motion by the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion M-85 reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
enact legislation mandating toy manufacturers to label toys 
containing phthalates in order to allow parents to make an 
informed decision when buying products for their children. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People need to know what phthalates are.  For the good of the 
public, I will point out that they are chemical agents containing 
concentrations of lead and cadmium. 
They are used in certain products made of polyvinyl chloride and 
vinyl, what we call PVCs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These chemicals, the phthalates, have the property of making 
plastics softer, which is necessary for manufacturing such baby 
items as toys, pacifiers and teething rings.  They are also used in 
manufacturing various plastic toys. Of all the chemicals used in 
plastics manufacturing, phthalates are the most common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with these chemicals is that they do not bind with 
the PVCs.  They remain in a freely mobile phase and are leachable, 
which means that they are released in washing or percolation. 
Contact and pressure, whether by biting into the object or playing 
with it, can accelerate the leaching process of these items, for 
example, the pacifiers that babies put in their mouths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As they soften plastics, they are ideal for all sorts of 
plastic covers, cellophane and children's toys such as teething 
rings and soothers, as I mentioned earlier.  Given that children of 
a certain age tend to put everything in their mouth, the knowledge 
that a toy contains phthalates is not reassuring.  Worse yet is the 
fact that phthalates are used in the manufacture of toys intended 
to go into children's mouths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prolonged exposure to phthalates can cause all sorts of 
problems.  However the presence of a toxic substance in a toy is 
not the only problem.  The greatest concern is that certain toxic 
substances, as I have said, may be released from the toys the 
children put in their mouth.  These substances, including 
phthalates, are ingested and go directly into the system, causing 
irreversible harm to a child playing normally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been shown that repeated exposure to phthalates can 
cause such health problems as liver and kidney damage, certain 
forms of cancer and may even cause infertility. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1835"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since children are in constant development, they are particularly 
sensitive to exposure to phthalates, as are older people and those whose 
immune system is deficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September, Greenpeace, the well-known environmental group, 
released a scientific study that identified large concentrations of 
toxic products in several commonly used objects easily accessible to 
children. Indeed, tests have shown that certain products contain 
phthalates in various proportions, anywhere from 10% to 40%, with no 
indication of that fact on the label. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, as the authors of the study pointed out, phthalates bought for 
laboratory work are accompanied by warnings such as “harmful if inhaled, 
if in contact with water or if swallowed”, “possible risk of 
irreversible effects” and “may cause cancer”. However, once phthalates 
are incorporated into toys, even in proportions of up to 40%, there is 
no mention of or warning about these harmful products. This is quite a 
paradox. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following these findings, Health Canada conducted a series of tests 
on 19 selected products, to see if certain chemical agents used to make 
toys could actually be absorbed by children and endanger their health. 
Strangely enough, although the findings showed significant levels of 
toxic substances in most of the products tested, including two 
containing liberal amounts which can be ingested by a child, Health 
Canada concluded that there were no serious risks associated with the 
presence of toxic substances and, therefore, that no special action was 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environmental groups like Greenpeace fiercely criticized Health 
Canada's attitude, accusing it of having conducted biased tests 
jeopardizing the health of children. Among other criticism, Health 
Canada is condemned for not having conducted heat and light exposure 
tests on the products, when several of them were designed to be used 
outdoors. The fact that, on the basis of a risk analysis on two 
products, it was concluded that, while they containing an excessive 
level of toxic chemicals, there was no need to take the toys off the 
market was also decried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not the only country where there are concerns about 
dangerous substances contained in toys and their potential effects on 
health. In Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and Argentina, several tests 
were conducted, as a result of which several products containing 
phtalates were take off the market. In Denmark and the Netherlands, they 
went as far as banning the use of phtalates in all plastic products, 
including toys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So why Motion M-85?  If a number of studies, including the one 
done by Health Canada, show that the presence of toxic products can 
represent a health hazard, if it is known that they can separate 
from the product and be ingested directly by a child, when we know 
that many other countries have also done similar research and 
arrived at similar conclusions, and when we know that many of these 
countries have already taken preventive action by withdrawing 
certain products or putting an outright ban on the use of 
phthalates in plastics, we might well wonder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Health Canada has recognized the presence of chemical 
agents in vinyl products but, for the department, that did not 
represent a significant health hazard.  Even so, why refuse to 
indicate this on these products?  I think it is important that 
parents know what they are buying and that they be aware of the 
presence of chemical products that are potentially hazardous to the 
health of their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is a question of protecting our children, of 
protecting consumers. In my view, when we have just come through 
the tainted blood scandal, I think it is always better to be safe 
than sorry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of labelling as 
proposed in Motion M-85.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to speak a few moments on this very proactive piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the NDP member from Acadie—Bathurst for bringing in a 
piece of legislation which is very proactive and tries to protect 
the most innocent in our communities, young infants that may be 
susceptible to disease when they are exposed to some of these 
chemicals.  So I say I commend the member for bringing it in.  If 
nothing else today, we are discussing and informing certain 
parents of new children, babies and infants, that there may be a 
health threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my workers and his wife have a new baby.  I am sure 
anybody would want to know of any possible health threats to 
their new child.  I am glad the member brought it to my attention 
and I am glad we are discussing it in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little surprised at the government's approach.  I cannot 
believe that the government would not be proactive as well and 
want to give this advice to anyone who may be at risk.  We are 
not asking for any new huge piece of legislation.  We are not 
asking the government to cause the manufacturers to invest huge 
amounts of money to change machinery and that type of thing.  We 
are simply asking for legislation that would force companies to 
put on their packaging that something contains a chemical that 
may be dangerous to a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government approach reminds me almost with what we did on 
the smoking ban.  We could never convince the tobacco companies 
or convince governments that smoking was hazardous to people's 
health.  Eventually when there were enough conclusive studies 
done, we used to put on the packages that smoking might cause 
cancer and other illnesses. We have long passed that stage now. 
We say yes, it does cause cancer.  It is proven that if you use 
cigarettes as directed, they will most certainly kill you.  It is 
a known fact and now it is accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the government not want to support labelling these 
toys so that maybe somewhere down the road some family does not 
have to go through a tragedy simply because we did not have all 
the studies on time.? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I say, I commend the member and I am a little bit surprised 
at the government's approach to this.  Much has been said about 
the studies that have been done throughout Europe, so I will not 
bother to repeat it.  Albeit they may not be conclusive, but 
there certainly is an element of risk.  There is an element that 
these things can cause problems, otherwise they would not have 
banned these chemicals in certain parts of Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in Canada I understand under our Canadian Environmental 
Health Protection Act that phthalates are still registered as a 
toxic or carcinogenic substance.  If in one part of Canadian law 
we have it registered because it is toxic and carcinogenic, why 
can we then not make sure that manufacturers put it on children's 
toys so it can be seen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are my comments.  There is no need to repeat what has been 
said.  I think it is an excellent piece of legislation.  Anything 
that we can do which is not going to cost taxpayers a lot of 
money or not going to cause any great deal to the manufacturers 
and will give some added protection to parents of newborn 
children I strongly support.   We in the Conservative caucus will 
very strongly support this proactive legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK282"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was impressed with 
the debate here today.  I appreciate the words of the hon. member 
who introduced this bill.  His heart is on the side of child 
protection which is something where we all are on the same side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate raises more questions than it answers.  It raises the 
question of the research that was conducted which would lead the 
hon. member to introduce this bill and what were the methods 
used.  Phthalates themselves may very well be toxic in a 
particular form but where is the evidence to show that phthalates 
migrate out of plastics and are ingested.? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually the word that is used in all these debates is the word 
“may”.  It does not say it does it.  It says it may do it. 
That is a weasel word because it is just as easy to say it may 
not.  Therefore some of the more serious questions that are 
raised about the research must be answered before such a

</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate that the hon. member is talking about labelling 
toys to say they contain phthalates, but what does it mean if 
such a label goes on to a toy?  If an organization can stir up 
enough emotional response to say that phthalates are a terrible 
thing to be in toys, then parents may respond.  But as a 
government we have a responsibility to make absolutely certain of 
the evidence before a decision is made. It would be absolutely 
irresponsible to simply accept a particular claim from a study 
that was done by an organization whose credibility is in question 
in the first place. I refer to Greenpeace and the misleading 
activities it has taken part in with regard to the forest 
industry in Canada. I suggest to my hon. friend that the 
credibility of Greenpeace today is zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I suggest to him that we should depend on the Ministry 
of Health in Canada to continue to conduct studies which have 
already begun.  If Health Canada can find conclusive evidence of 
any kind we can be sure this government will act and act very 
quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no question of the hon. member's intent.  We all believe 
in the protection of children.  From a government's perspective 
it would be irresponsible to actively campaign to ban something 
before the difficulty with it has been truly established.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
a member of the New Democratic Party and as a mother I am very 
proud to stand and second this motion brought before the House 
today by my hon. colleague from Acadie—Bathurst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion simply asks that the government introduce 
legislation to require manufacturers to indicate on the label 
when a toy contains phthalates so parents can make informed 
decisions when buying playthings for their youngsters.  It asks 
for labelling because recent studies have shown that phthalates, 
which are invisible chemical agents commonly put into plastics to 
make them flexible, have been found to cause cancer, infertility 
and liver damage, and are particularly damaging to children. 
Examples include teething rings, soothers and plastic toys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The studies have recently prompted chain stores in at least 
seven countries, all with large and highly developed modern 
economies like Canada, to remove toys polluted by phthalates from 
store shelves.  The Netherlands and Denmark have banned outright 
the use of phthalates in plastics.  The Austrian government has 
banned phthalates in toys. In what is a clearly growing 
international momentum on this issue, the Government of Denmark 
just this week approached the European Commission for a 
continent-wide ban on phthalates in products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in Canada millions of children are undoubtedly playing 
with these chemicals right now and their well intentioned parents 
will bring even more into the home this holiday season and put 
them under the Christmas tree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An official from Health Canada told my office that as of this 
week the department is standing behind all studies that show toys 
with phthalates are safe.  Health Canada is not joining the 
growing international movement against these toxins.  Health 
Canada has not asked for labels to identify these dangerous toys. 
Health Canada has only said that it will begin what may be a 
lengthy process of its own testing which has the very real 
possibility of being inconclusive.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to ask why this minister will not err on the side of the 
safety of our children.  Has the Minister of Health not learned 
anything from Justice Krever and the ways in which early danger 
signs were sadly ignored in that shameful episode?  The same 
thing that happened with blood products appears to be happening 
with plastic toys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's department says that these deadly toys are safe 
and will stay on the market and nothing will be done to raise 
public awareness about the problem. The government's position 
appears to be that it is okay to poison children for Christmas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The action by Denmark creates an interesting dilemma for the 
minister.  Denmark is a nation whose people are considered 
thoughtful and prudent.  They have added much to the evolution of 
modern civilization.  The Danish and other governments have 
decided that these nasty products, sold for profit, specifically 
to children, have not met the community standard of health and 
safety and, indeed, morality and will be banned outright. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protecting the public good is done elsewhere, yet when New 
Democrats suggest the same business and the government react as 
if the sky is falling and the mountains are tumbling into the 
sea.  It is like we were taking away the cookie jar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Danes and the others are banning these toys and other 
phthalate ridden products because they know that businesses will 
not pack up and leave the country and take along every last job 
when the government makes a common sense decision in the interest 
of public health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Holding such a threat over the head of a nation is nothing short 
of economic terrorism, yet this government thinks that regulation 
is a dirty word, a word the Minister of Health is afraid to say. 
Thankfully the Danish and other governments will ensure that 
corporations make their profits in a way which enhances the 
public good, and if killer toys have to come off the market, then 
so be it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this party applaud Denmark's integrity.  This government 
is always talking about international trade.  Perhaps we could 
import some Danish integrity to this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out to the minister that these types of 
common sense health policies currently in place in other 
countries like Denmark are commonly referred to by Canadians as 
having backbone and principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party knows that there are ways of regulating 
rogue business without causing economic chaos.  It is an accepted 
part of national life in most countries, and yet this government 
has abandoned its responsibility in this area.  The government 
should be aggressively protecting the public good and especially 
the public health of our children with stronger health and 
consumer regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians used to rely on something called consumer and 
corporate affairs.  The corporate affairs part has changed its 
name to the Government of Canada, while we can find the consumer 
part in a matchbox in the basement of Industry Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of polluted toys are being bought this Christmas season 
by unsuspecting Canadian parents and the official policy of the 
Minister of Health appears to be toxic toys for girls and boys 
and a very scary Christmas for all, or perhaps toxic toys <I>r</I> 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is lost in toyland, like his cabinet colleagues. 
They only seem interested in hearing the prime minister announce 
his best before date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand how on earth the people in this government 
can spoon feed poison to our children, my eight year old daughter 
included.  The studies are there.  I urge the minister to act 
quickly in the interest of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we need labels is that phthalates are not a danger a 
parent can see coming.  It is not like a car in the street, a 
vicious dog or a sharp object.  Phthalates are not something a 
parent can recognize.  They are unseen, hidden inside toys that 
children are often desperate to get their hands on or put in 
their mouths, and yet the government refuses to even warn parents 
of the dangers, preferring to please itself by putting these 
deadly chemicals into Canadian babies through things like 
soothers.  It is absolutely shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We at least need labels so parents can make an informed decision 
to protect their children while the machinery of government 
grinds through its own testing process.  Not even Health Canada 
can tell us how long that will take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for a government such as this, sitting as it is 
in the hip pocket of big business, to realize that the word is 
going to get out about phthalates, whether CEOs and comfy 
bureaucrats at Health Canada like it or not.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When that happens, and it is happening right now, all toy 
manufacturers, including those who refused to use phthalates, 
will suffer an exodus from toy stores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not acting on my colleague's motion will cause economic harm, 
confusion and fear among parents.  The Minister of Health can 
take the blame for that one too when the CEOs call him on the 
carpet for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can Canadians continue to have faith in these products that 
are improperly studied before allowing them into our homes? 
Perhaps that is why earlier this year it fell upon two workers at 
an Ikea store to notice that the eyes on 11 models of stuffed 
toys posed a danger to children. Somehow these 11 toys were 
approved for sale by the manufacturers and Health Canada but were 
pulled off the shelves by the large retail chain itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should not be the responsibility of store clerks to protect 
the nation from dangerous products.  It is the responsibility of 
Health Canada and the Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on this government to properly fund departments 
responsible for public health and safety.  Perhaps if this 
funding had not been cut, we would not be here today imploring 
the government to take notice of what is happening over this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic costs associated with health problems from these 
polluted toys are obvious.  By taking preventive measures we can 
save some Canadian children from liver disease and cancer. For 
all these reasons, the safety of our children, the health of the 
economy, it is important for the government to recognize this 
problem and accept my hon. colleague's suggestion and place 
labels on toys polluted by phthalates as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot think of a better Christmas gift for my child and all 
Canadian children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK284"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have only been in the House four years, but in that 
time I have never heard the use of such extreme language and such 
unfair language as I have just heard from the member who spoke 
previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We abuse our privilege as parliamentarians when we make 
exaggerated statements that we cannot make outside the House 
without being sued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This talk of killer toys, polluted toys, when she knows full 
well that she has the protection of the Chamber to use that 
language, I do not think is something that is very admirable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, this whole thing springs from a Greenpeace report which 
says that there is a possibility of danger with phthalates, which 
are actually ethylhexylphthalate, a chemical softener used in 
polyvinyl chlorides, plastics, and in baby's soothers and that 
type of product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Greenpeace raised a legitimate concern when it pointed out that 
there may be some possibility that this type of material existing 
in these toys could be leeched out when the child sucks on the 
toy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Greenpeace report goes into no detail whatsoever 
about the alleged toxic qualities of these phthalates.  If the 
member opposite had taken the time to look up the various reports 
that have been done by Environment Canada and Health Canada, she 
would have discovered that there is little evidence found by the 
government that phthalates are a serious problem in the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very easy to condemn a product when it gets headlines. But 
we have to take a responsible attitude to this problem. There is 
no evidence that these phthalates have any effect except over a 
very long term.  Greenpeace has not supplied the evidence of its 
laboratory studies and the member opposite is obviously is not 
prepared to supply the evidence either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I have to interrupt the hon. member's 
remarks because the time provided for the consideration of 
Private Members' Business is now expired.  But he will have eight

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>PRIVACY 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK287"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on November 18 I posed a question regarding the actions taken by 
the Toronto-Dominion Bank.  On October 31 at the stroke of 
midnight, Halloween night, the computers at the Toronto-Dominion 
Bank whirled and downloaded every piece of personal information 
it has on each and every customer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This information went to the Toronto-Dominion mortgage 
corporation, securities corporation and insurance corporations 
and it went free of charge.  The only way a TD customer could 
avoid their own information from being sent was if, and only if, 
first they read the eight-page brochure that was sent by the TD 
to all of its customers in June of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, they would have to understand just what was being 
proposed in this brochure and the implications of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, they would have to phone or write to their 
Toronto-Dominion Bank and tell them, no, they did not want these 
separate corporations to have this information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what is called negative option marketing; that is, 
placing the onus on the consumer to read, understand and respond 
to a demand that favours only the Toronto-Dominion Bank.  This is 
a bold faced attempt by the Toronto-Dominion Bank to take 
advantage of its customers.  It is also a gross invasion of 
privacy because there is no consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder or surprise that Canadians have no faith, in 
fact despise the banks and bankers of this country when they 
actively and purposely take advantage of the little people, the 
average consumer, the average TD Bank customer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the parliamentary secretary is going to say that the 
Canadian Banking Association has a privacy code approved by the 
Canadian Standards Association.  However, I would suggest that we 
are not talking about wrenches or screwdrivers and how good they 
are.  We are talking about the details of a person's personal 
financial life, what they own and what they owe.  This is a 
privacy code—and we have to remember this—made by the banks for 
the banks and enforceable only by the banks. The only entity it 
helps is the Toronto-Dominion Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this mean?  It means that consumers of the 
Toronto-Dominion Bank can at least expect more and more annoying 
junk mail.  It means more and more annoying phone calls at lunch 
and dinner for the telemarketer trying to sell TD insurance or 
some other TD product over the phone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what it really means—and the parliamentary secretary 
does not want to mention this—is that when someone goes into the 
TD Bank for a loan, that bank or loans manager is going to take 
out a hammer and that hammer is going to be something like this: 
the Toronto-Dominion Bank will approve the loan if—and this is a 
big if—you, the customer, will move your registered retirement 
savings plan or your car insurance or your home mortgage.  There 
are endless possibilities here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what is called tied selling and it is based on an 
intimate knowledge of the customer across a very broad segment of 
their personal financial details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that Canadians need more protection from big 
banks.  Big banks do not need more power.  The Canadian Standards 
Association cannot protect Canadians from the banks.  Only the 
government can and the government should be passing legislation 
to prohibit this gross invasion of privacy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK288"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, privacy is certainly a major 
concern to Canadian consumers of financial services and rightly 
so.  Consumers do not want confidential and personal information 
given to outsiders or used for the purposes other than which it 
was given or authorized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government certainly appreciates these concerns and is 
planning to build on actions already undertaken by financial 
institutions.  I emphasize that the government is planning to 
build on these actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year changes were introduced to the financial 
institution legislation that strengthens privacy protection for 
consumers of financial services.  Regulations are under 
discussion that will require all federally regulated financial 
institutions to establish procedures governing the collection, 
retention, use and disclosure of customer information, to 
implement complaints handling procedures, to inform customers of 
these procedures and to report annually on privacy related 
complaints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks and property casualty insurers have already adopted 
codes of conduct on privacy that are modelled on and consistent 
with the privacy code established by the Canadian Standards 
Association.  The banks' code was audited by Price Waterhouse and 
the Insurance Bureau of Canada's code was examined by the Quality 
Management Institute to ensure that the codes were in compliance 
with the CSA model. 
The CSA financial institution codes allow organizations to obtain 
customer consent to use their shared personal information in a 
number of ways.

their corporate group, with the exception of information released 
for legal, income tax and credit reporting purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will continue to monitor the privacy practices of 
financial institutions, both to ensure their effectiveness and to 
assess whether more needs to be done to ensure the protection of 
customer information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force on the future of financial services sector may 
also be examining privacy issues in its work.  We certainly look

<P><A NAME="LINK290"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the returns of Atlantic salmon are at historically very 
low levels.  This is why, for conservation reasons, anglers have 
been practising only catch and release on the Saint John River in 
New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the minister on November 17 asked why the DFO 
closed the Saint John River to catch and release fishing and then 
proceeded to kill fish and give them to the local native 
aboriginal communities for ceremonial purposes when these 
communities never asked for those fish, they were not surplus and 
were not required for science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's answer displayed a profound lack of knowledge of 
the spawning behaviour of Atlantic salmon.  He stated that male 
fish were double the number of female fish, and therefore it was 
important to reduce the imbalance by killing male fish as well as 
to protect genetic stocks of salmon by making sure that the 
numbers of hatchery fish are reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the head of DFO science appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Fisheries in November, he also justified the killing 
of these fish based on the female ratio.  This is bogus and DFO 
has no supporting evidence for these actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, DFO has managed to politicize fish science.  First, 
for the record, the fish stock from the hatchery are all of Saint 
John River origin and there is a competent breeding program to 
prevent in-breeding.  Thus, there should be no reason to kill 
fish to protect genetic stocks of salmon, contrary to what the 
minister stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, a biased male to female ratio is not something 
inherently wrong which requires correction by killing off the 
offending males.  So far, no one has found a nightclub where 
eligible Atlantic salmon meet to pair up prior to joining in 
their journey to the spawning grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Salmon are schooling fish and behave more normally when they are 
in groups.  When returns to rivers are low, such as this year, 
the number of fish available to form schools is low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These fish may alter their behaviour and become hesitant to move 
upstream to spawning areas because they do not have companions. 
Killing off any fish, male or female, when numbers are so low is 
unjustified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hatchery on the Saint John River was built to compensate for 
fish losses caused by the construction of the Mactaquac dam. 
However, even with these hatchery contributions, the river is not 
meeting its egg conservation thresholds.  Every fish counts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scientific rationale for killing these fish makes no sense. 
The explanations by the minister and by DFO have not abated the 
concerns of the Saint John River anglers nor of the local 
population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Locally, DFO appears to be embarrassed.  The department and the 
minister both stated that part or all of the rationale was to 
harvest these 40 fish to fulfil native requests.  We believe this 
is an attempt to cover all bases by DFO and certainly does not 
explain why there are some fish still in a DFO freezer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statutory authority for this action is dubious at best and, 
in my opinion, exceeds the authority of DFO.  It is important 
that the department have the support of the community at large to 
conserve and protect habitat and Atlantic salmon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statements and actions by DFO defy logic and have turned off 
the people normally most involved in stewardship of the river. 
The community wants reassurance that these actions will not be 
repeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister assure the community and the fish that this 
action will not occur again?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think it is time 
to clear up some facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The salmon fishery on the Saint John River was closed earlier 
this year in August because conservation requirements were not 
going to be met.  DFO had to ensure that the maximum possible 
number of female salmon were present in the river to spawn.  The 
closure affected all salmon fisheries including the aboriginal 
fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The requirement for the most successful spawning is one male per 
female.  The ratio of males to females present in the river, as 
the hon. member admitted, was in the order of two males to every 
female.  With this number of males salmon surplus to spawning 
requirements in the Saint John River a decision was made to take 
40 hatchery grilse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Removing the salmon from the fish collection facility was the 
safest way to do that particular test.  Other methods would have 
resulted in a higher risk of mortality and could have had an 
impact on the number of females left to spawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also point out that they were hatchery males and 
therefore less important for spawning purposes than male wild 
salmon.  There is nothing bogus about this decision.  In fact 
conservation and science were paramount in that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts of the matter are that DFO has the authority to 
undertake these types of activities under written permissions and 
licences granted in the Fisheries Act and the fishery general 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These permissions and licences permit the specified activities 
to proceed in spite of closures.  In removing the surplus grilse, 
DFO first gathered specific scientific information from each 
fish.  Following such scientific scrutiny they were then provided 
to the first nations, which I am told had expressed an interest 
in receiving them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surplus grilse in the Saint John River were allocated to first 
nations in their 1997 communal fisheries licences.  However, as a 
result of the early closure, the first nations were unable to 
reach their allocations for food, social and ceremonial purposes. 
Some first nations did not receive a single fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These fish were justifiably provided to first nations as a 
partial means to address the food fish shortfall without 
jeopardizing conservation objectives.

Confederation in 1949.  Again only 8% correctly named the Queen 
as Canada's head of state; 57% believed the prime minister filled 
the role.

Charter of Rights and Freedom as part of the constitution that 
protects the civil rights of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should play a role in ensuring that 
history and civics are taught in schools across Canada and should 
develop national standards in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I join with those who are calling for a federal-provincial 
council of ministers of education to develop a new approach to 
civic education.  Like many Canadians I believe that not enough 
history and civics are being taught in our schools.  I believe, 
as do many Canadians, that we as a national government need to 
develop Canada-wide standards in these very important areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be interested in hearing the secretary of state outline 
whether or not she shares these concerns.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the statistics and the results 
of that survey are a great concern to all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage is convinced that the key to a 
strong Canadian identity is a sound knowledge of Canada. 
The role of the federal government and in particular that of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage is to provide support to enable 
all Canadians to learn about each other, about our diversity, 
about our heritage, history, symbols, traditions and shared 
values, so that we can all participate fully in and appreciate 
the society and country we have built together.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that formal education is a provincial 
responsibility, but the federal government can provide innovative 
high quality learning materials on Canada that are complementary 
to school curricula. The Canadian studies program of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage has been supporting the 
development of Canadian learning materials about Canada's rich 
and diverse history since 1984. The department's successful 
“With Flying Colours” educational kit is a model of what we can 
do in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In much the same way, the federal government highlights Canadian 
history through our museums, our galleries, our parks and our 
historic sites.  So that young Canadians can learn to understand 
and participate in our society, we also support youth exchanges 
that give Canadian youth the opportunity to develop long term 
citizenship skills. Multiculturalism programs highlight not only 
our history but the diversity of our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through key partnerships for instance with the Charles R. 
Bronfman Foundation which produced our heritage minutes on CBC, 
the department has shown a flexible and effective approach to 
supporting the teaching of history outside the classroom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that this is not enough.  We are working with the 
Council of Ministers of Education and provincial governments to 
have a concrete proposal that will benefit all Canadian students.
