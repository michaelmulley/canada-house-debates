	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-351, an act to provide for the expiry of 
gun control legislation that is not proven effective within five years 
of coming into force.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to introduce my 
firearms law sunset act today. My bill is seconded by the hon. 
member for Beaver River and co-sponsored by a number of 
members of Parliament. I thank my colleagues for their support.
<P>
	If the bill is passed by Parliament it would provide a five-year 
sunset provision on all gun control legislation unless the auditor 
general has reported that the gun  control law has been a successful 
and cost effective measure which has increased public safety and 
reduced violent crime involving the use of firearms.
<P>
	The auditor general's report would have to be considered by a 
12-member committee comprised of six MPs and six experts on 
firearms law. The committee report would also have to be 
presented to and concurred in by the House of Commons or a 
sunset provision would take effect immediately.
<P>
	To argue against this type of sunset provision people would have 
to argue that they support gun control even if it does not work and 
no matter how much the gun control costs.
<P>
	No one is arguing that gun control is unnecessary, only that the 
police time and resources should be spent on measures that get the 
best bang for the buck. That is exactly what the bill does.

<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is 
an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its 
value to our society. They also state that the Income Tax Act 
discriminates against families that make the choice to provide care 
in the home to preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill 
or the aged.

initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that 
decide to provide care in the home for preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill and the aged.

<P>
	The petitioners are concerned not only about health risks to the 
dairy cows, but also the serious risks to humans, including breast

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CORRECTIONSANDCONDITIONALRELEASEACT">CORRECTIONS AND CONDITIONAL RELEASE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from September 27, 1995, consideration of 
the motion that Bill C-45, an act to amend the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act, the Criminal Code, the Criminal Records 
Act, the Prisons and Reformatories Act and the Transfer of 
Offenders Act, be read a third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome this 
opportunity today to speak to Bill C-45 and related initiatives. It 
has been said many times in this House that our penal justice 
system lacks the means required to control high-risk offenders, 
including sex offenders.
<P>
	The public has become increasingly fearful and intolerant of 
crimes committed by these offenders, especially when the victims 
are children. This is a very legitimate concern which Bill C-45 
should help to alleviate by providing better protection for the most 
vulnerable members of our society. In many cases, sexual offences 
not only harm a person physically but also cause psychological 
damage that unfortunately may leave lasting scars.
<P>
	If we want to improve public safety, we must act quickly and use 
the most effective means at our disposal. That is why we have 
opted for a comprehensive approach consisting of legislation and 
other measures that will help us deal with the problem on all fronts. 
As you know, Bill C-45 contains major amendments to the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act that will increase public 
safety.
<P>
	The principal changes include amending the provisions on the 
detention of sex offenders who attack children. To provide better 
protection for our young people, Bill C-45 gives the word ``child'' 
the broadest possible legal sense, in other words, any individual 
under 18 years of age. Thanks to the proposed amendments, it will 
no longer be necessary to prove that serious harm was or will be 
caused to the child by a sexual offence.
<P>
	This change was necessary because in many cases, the impact of 
sexual abuse is not easy to detect in a child. The problem is further 
compounded by the fact that child abusers often tell their victims 
that the sex acts they are forced to commit are acceptable and not to 
be discussed with others. Research has also shown that the harm 
suffered by a child who is a victim of sexual abuse may not become 
apparent until years later.
<P>
	For all these reasons, it is difficult and almost impossible to find 
out whether there was serious harm. Bill C-45 will fill this gap by 
giving the National Parole Board the authority to keep in custody 
any offender it deems likely to commit a sexual offence involving a 
child before the expiration of his sentence.
<P>
	I would like to point out that we have before us a piece of 
legislation that is intelligent and sound and based on the latest 
scientific research. It was well received by many of the witnesses 
who appeared before the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs during its study of the bill. I may refer more specifically to 
the clinicians representing the Canadian Psychological 
Association. They found the bill perfectly reasonable in clinical 
terms, because, as they said, people sexually drawn to children, 
known clinically as pedophiles, have a much higher risk of 
recividism than those suffering from some other form of deviant 
sexual behaviour.
<P>
	At times, treatment appears to have no effect on pedophiles. 
Accordingly, since the bill concerns offenders representing the 
greatest threat to the security and welfare of children, we believe it 
should go a long way to calming Canadians' concerns.
<P>
	Before I talk about other legislative changes, I would like to 
return to the comments by the solicitor general on the point 
amending the provisions on detention. The fact that the change 
applies only to young victims does not mean that sexual offences 
against adults are of less concern to us.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14960"> 14960 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	All sexual crimes are serious, and the vulnerability of the victim, 
whoever that may be, is a vital consideration in each decision on 
parole or detention.
<P>
	We must give ourselves the means to accurately assess the risk 
involved in a sexual offence, whoever the victim may be. In recent 
years, some people have wondered whether we can really assess the 
damage victims suffer when there has been no bodily harm. This is 
particularly important in the case of victims of sexual crimes.
<P>
	As many of you know, the definition of serious harm in the 
present legislation covers both physical injury and psychological 
damage. As psychological damage is not apparent most times, it is 
often difficult to detect. In an effort to overcome this difficulty, the 
Department of the Solicitor General formulated guidelines on this 
last fall.
<P>
	Accordingly, the people responsible for identifying cases of 
potential detention and commissioners responsible for deciding on 
them are better equipped to assess the psychological wrong a 
victim has suffered. They can therefore better recognize offenders 
who are more likely to cause serious harm in the future.
<P>
	The department developed these guidelines according to the 
most recent research available on the psychological effects of 
crime for victims and on clinical diagnostic criteria. This major 
undertaking results from the department's commitment to clarify 
the concept of serious harm and to better protect the public against 
high risk offenders. Whether they are violent criminals or sexual 
offenders.
<P>
	The bill contains other changes along these lines, as I mentioned 
earlier. Some of them have to do with Schedules I and II of the act, 
which list the offences for which an offender can be referred for 
detention.
<P>
	These lists will now include several violent crimes against 
persons and serious drug offences such as conspiring to commit 
serious drug offences, impaired driving, criminal negligence 
causing death or bodily harm, criminal harassment, and breaking 
and entering when the planned offence is listed in Schedule I.
<P>
	The addition of this last crime means that an offender who 
breaks and enters a home with intent to commit a serious offence 
such as a sexual assault will no longer be eligible for the speedy 
review procedure and will automatically be subject to review for 
detention.
<P>
	In addition, a number of sexual offences that have been repealed 
will be included in Schedule I so that any offender serving a 
sentence for one of these offences will be covered. The purpose of 
these amendments is to correct any shortcoming in the detention 
provisions that may compromise public safety.
<P>
	Another important set of amendments provide for the house 
arrest of some high risk offenders who do not meet detention 
criteria. These amendments had been  demanded by the members 
of Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, the former 
Standing Committee on Justice and Solicitor General, the Ontario 
commission responsible for investigating the Stephenson case, and 
the Canadian Police Association.
<P>
	In response to their recommendations, the government recently 
made legislative amendments to Bill C-45, which were approved 
by the Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs last March.
<P>
	These amendments will enable the National Parole Board to 
require that offenders who must be released because they do not 
meet detention criteria but who need additional community support 
live in a community based residential facility.
<P>
	This will allow the board to better monitor and manage these 
offenders and the risk they present, in order to strengthen the 
released offenders monitoring system and facilitate their 
reintegration into society.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	While the legislative or policy changes I mentioned represent a 
sound reform, we must bear in mind that these changes alone 
cannot ensure greater public protection. We must not settle for 
longer prison terms for offenders. Most sexual offenders are 
sentenced to a definite term of imprisonment and, sooner or later, 
they are back in community.
<P>
	To properly deal with the problem of sexual offenders, 
sustainable solutions must be developed. In this regard, many of 
the witnesses who testified at the justice committee hearings on 
Bill C-45 were of the opinion that the best way to protect society 
against sexual offenders in the long term was through formal 
phased release programs combined with treatment and support.
<P>
	This has prompted the government to undertake a number of 
initiatives with regard to programs, including enhancing treatment 
programs for this category of offenders.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I will briefly comment on what we know to date about treating 
sex offenders. Research evidence shows sex offenders are not all 
the same. Their offences are influenced by a host of motivating and 
situational factors which vary from one individual to the next. 
Consequently, there is no single cause for sexual abuse and no 
single approach to treatment. However, there is general agreement 
among clinical practitioners that for many offenders the risk of 
reoffending can be reduced through continuity of treatment 
programs and relapse prevention.
<P>
	In keeping with this view, a key component of our public safety 
strategy focuses on the expansion and enhancement of treatment 
programs for sex offenders. Research and pilot projects in support 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14961"> 14961 </A></B>
<P>
of rehabilitation and safe reintegration of sex offenders are an 
integral part of this endeavour.
<P>
	To ensure the federal correctional system uses the most effective 
management and treatment methods for sex offenders, Correctional 
Service Canada created a national committee earlier this year. This 
committee has developed standards to deal with the important issue 
regarding the assessment and treatment of sex offenders. The 
committee is undertaking consultations with provincial mental 
health and correctional agencies with a view to developing a 
national consensus on these and other issues of mutual concern.
<P>
	To facilitate this effort I had the pleasure of opening the first 
conference on the national sex offender strategy in Toronto last 
March. This conference brought together sex offender experts from 
across Canada as well as from other countries to share their 
knowledge, refine our assessment and treatment methods, and find 
innovative ways of restoring public confidence in corrections and 
criminal justice. This is an important milestone, and I am confident 
good progress in this area will continue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are also active on the local front to help community 
organizations protect children against sexual abuse. Over the years, 
the RCMP has played a major role in this respect with its Canadian 
Police Information Center, or CPIC, a data base made available to 
police across Canada. This center provides computerized 
information on the criminal records of individuals who have been 
fingerprinted. Thus, local police can now check, on behalf of 
community organizations, the background of those who want to do 
volunteer work or work for pay involving children. It is one of 
many ways of helping to prevent direct contact between child 
molesters or sexual offenders and children in our communities.
<P>
	Last November, the government announced that the CPIC had 
been upgraded so that checks run through this national data base 
can be even more efficient.
<P>
	As a result, the CPIC now provides information on restraining 
orders issued in cases of family violence, orders prohibiting 
holding positions of trust around children and peace bond orders 
issued to child sex offenders. It also provides more detailed 
information on the criminal background of offenders, including a 
list of all sexual offences, whether summary or indictable, 
committed against children.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	These improvements will provide a better profile of those people 
who could be a threat to the safety and well-being of our children. 
However, are these improvements sufficient? Some victim 
advocates have said that better information will be of little use if 
community organizations do not know it exists, or if they  do not 
systematically check the track record of applicants with the local 
police force.
<P>
	In response to that legitimate concern, the solicitor general, 
justice and health departments are working to set up a national 
awareness program, in co-operation with the Canadian Association 
of Volunteer Bureaux and Centres. Starting this fall, and for the 
next few years, public information and education documents will 
be prepared, and training sessions will be provided to police 
officers as well as to volunteer and sports organizations in more 
than 200 communities across the country, in an effort to ensure 
better screening of volunteers and staff.
<P>
	As for high risk offenders who remain a danger to society at the 
end of their prison term, we are pursuing our efforts to find an 
adequate solution to the problem. We work in close co-operation 
with our provincial and territorial counterparts, and quick progress 
is being made. Every province and territory has agreed to make the 
best possible use of the Criminal Code provisions which relate to 
dangerous offenders.
<P>
	These provisions authorize judges to impose an indeterminate 
jail term to offenders who, in their opinion, remain a danger to 
society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The solicitor general also announced last March a national 
flagging system to identify at an early date those offenders who 
may later be considered for a dangerous offender application. 
Should any offender who is flagged be prosecuted in the future, all 
relevant background information held by other jurisdictions will be 
available to assist prosecutors in deciding whether to bring in an 
applicant.
<P>
	The solicitor general and the justice minister in conjunction with 
their federal, provincial and territorial counterparts have agreed to 
an examination of legislative changes with regard to creating a new 
category of long term offender. This could lead to special 
preventative measures for a broader range of violent offenders, 
especially sexual predators such as pedophiles, including up to 10 
years of supervision following the usual penitentiary sentence.
<P>
	The ministers have agreed that other criminal justice options will 
be explored for offenders who are at the end of their sentences and 
who are still believed to be too dangerous to be released into the 
community. In this regard the solicitor general and the justice 
minister convened a meeting of leading constitutional lawyers and 
other experts this past spring to review the limits and possibilities 
related to the detention of offenders beyond the end of their 
sentence. This will allow for a full examination of possible 
strategies under the criminal law which might be viable to achieve 
greater public safety.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14962"> 14962 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	All these measures seek to increase protection of the public 
against high risk offenders and to restore the confidence of 
Canadians in our criminal justice system. They are based on a 
progressive policy dealing with practical issues related to 
therapeutic programs for offenders, and with the development of 
the most effective program strategies to treat sexual and other high 
risk offenders.
<P>
	Our criminal justice system must be balanced, so that we can 
truly make our country a place where Canadians and their children 
can live without fear of being victims of violence or sexual abuse.
<P>
	I believe that Bill C-45, along with related initiatives and the 
work that will continue to be done in the months to come, clearly 
shows that the government intends to do its utmost to make our 
communities safer. I am sure that members from both sides of this 
House will help us achieve that goal through this bill.
<P>
<B>(1035 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
dearly love to stand here today and say I will support Bill C-45 but 
if I did I know exactly what would happen. If our party did that I 
know exactly what would happen. People across the way would 
turn around and say: ``If the Reform Party supports it, I guess we 
have gone far enough. We have done our job''.
<P>
	Therefore we will not support this. We will continue to hound 
government members over issues of criminal justice to let them 
know they have not gone far enough and that the public right to 
protection is much greater than the rights of criminals. We will 
continue to pound that message home. The member for Wild Rose, 
the member for Crowfoot, the member for Calgary Northeast, the 
member for Yorkton-Melville will be on the government like a 
pack of hounds until we get some real tough justice in this country.
<P>
	One of the concerns I have about Bill C-45 is that it is extremely 
narrow. It does not go nearly far enough in addressing the concerns 
of other people. We had a big to do in the House not very long ago 
when an hon. member was accused of mimicking another hon. 
member. There were screams and yells of sexism in the House. 
People were running around saying: ``You people are bad. You are 
sexist''. That was a bunch of baloney.
<P>
	The real measure of how prepared people are to stand up for 
women is in their actions, not in their words. We are not seeing the 
action in this legislation that really defends women to the degree 
they should be defended. Why in this legislation do we not have 
measures to hand down the same types of penalties that are being 
proposed here and even tougher penalties when women are 
sexually assaulted?
<P>
	Why can women not enjoy the same protection in the law? To me 
that makes sense and that is why we cannot support this legislation. 
I know if we supported this people over there would say: ``Good, 
we have them on side. We do not have to do any more''. My 
goodness, all it takes is a stroke of the pen. All they have to do is 
spend a couple of more minutes writing that type of amendment. 
Then we would have protection for women as well. Why not go the 
full way? Why not do it all?
<P>
	Another concern I have with this legislation is that it does not 
address the huge problem of young offenders who are sexual 
predators. I will read a letter in a moment from a constituent of 
mine who talks about this problem. Before I do I remind hon. 
members across the way about an incident that happened not too 
many years ago on the west coast.
<P>
	A sexual predator, a young offender, and his family moved into a 
new community. Because he was a young offender no one knew 
about his past. Not even the police knew about his past. The people 
next door definitely did not know about his past when they invited 
him to come over and babysit. I think everyone can imagine what 
happened. That young man subsequently raped and murdered the 
little girl next door and nobody was the wiser to his past because 
the Young Offenders Act protected him. That is insane and 
ridiculous. There is no reason in the world why this government 
cannot address those types of problems.
<P>
	Yesterday in the House our leader asked the justice minister what 
he will do to ensure that when there was a conflict between the 
rights of criminals and the rights of victims the scales of justice 
were tilted to the side of the victims. He gave us a lot of rhetoric.
<P>
	We would like to see some action. It is too late for that little girl 
in British Columbia but it does not have to be too late for the rest of 
the country. All it requires is a stroke of the pen, a little initiative. 
Why is the government holding back? What is the possible motive 
for not addressing this issue?
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	To me it can only be a misguided sense of responsibility or 
charity to the criminals. Yes, these people sometimes come from 
bad backgrounds and bad environments. I feel bad about that. I am 
sorry they turn out to be criminals in many cases and sexual 
predators in some cases.
<P>
	At the end of the day, as sorry as I am for that, the responsibility 
of government, the justice system and the House is to ensure that 
the rights of the public are raised above the rights of the criminals. 
There is no excuse for not dealing with that in this legislation. It 
should be in there.
<P>
	We have to keep plugging away until we get some changes not 
only to bills like Bill C-45 but also to the Young Offenders Act. It 
has to happen.
<P>

<P>
	I will read a letter from a constituent of mine whom I talked 
to on the phone a few days ago:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am writing to you because of something that happened to my family this 
past summer. In late July of this year I had my nephew come and stay with us. He 
is 13 years old and I had no reason to believe my worst nightmares would come 
true. During the four days of his stay he sexually abused my oldest sons, ages 
four and five. My two year old son does not talk yet, so if there was any abuse 
perpetrated against him I will never know.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I reported the crime to the local RCMP and to social services in the 
community where he comes from. It was during a talk with another family 
member that I was informed of the sexual abuse committed against her children, 
one girl and one boy, by my nephew some seven months prior.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It has been a long summer for my family, not only in dealing with the 
devastation of having our young children become victims of a sexual crime at 
such a young age, not that any age is acceptable, but in waiting for justice to be 
served. By justice I specifically mean waiting for the police and the courts to 
hold the 13-year old criminal accountable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This past Monday, September 19, I found out that according to the Criminal 
Code, Michael, my nephew, is immune from prosecution, not because he did not 
commit a crime but because he is 13. The first sexual crime was not reported to 
police. The family of the children and the family of the abuser and social 
services decided it was an act of an immature boy experimenting with his 
developing sexuality. It was because of this cover-up that I was unable to protect 
my children. Therefore my children became the young, innocent victims of his 
second attack that we are aware of.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am disgusted and helplessly frustrated with the whole situation. The RCMP 
officer was quick to assure me that they would get him the next time. Am I 
supposed to feel proud to be part of a society that surrounds young criminals in a 
blanket of protection while ignoring the pleas of the whole families that are 
victimized? By not holding these young criminals accountable based on their 
age, are we not inviting them to victimize again and again, stealing innocence, 
forever changing lives?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is so much more I want to say but more importantly now I know I must 
take action. I believe if I do not take some action to see the laws changed to 
protect the young potential victims, then I have not done my job as a parent. If 
the police and courts cannot help my children get justice, then I must go above 
them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Monte, I cry at night because of what this 13-year old did to my children and 
it torments me to know he will never be punished for this crime. It is just 
unacceptable at any age to abuse our young future in any way. If we do accept it 
we have failed them and ourselves. I write this letter in faith that you will be my 
voice, Monte. Somehow it does not seem enough, words on paper, but it is a 
start.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This letter says more eloquently than anybody in the House 
could ever say just how devastating and unnecessary these crimes 
are. That is what is so frustrating.
<P>
	I do not really understand why the police did not intervene. They 
say the boy was 13. My understanding is he should be culpable 
when he is that age. I certainly put a phone call in to the police to 
talk to them about that.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	However, the whole point is that if this young man were accused, 
brought to justice and convicted, it would not necessarily mean he 
could not do it again, because the public would never know what he 
had done. That is crazy. What are we doing here? Why are we 
allowing this to happen? It is ridiculous.
<P>
	I look around here and I see people who are of high intelligence 
and mature individuals who must understand exactly what this does 
to people. Why are we not doing something about it? Why is the 
government not moving legislation today to fix this? I do not 
understand it. The people at home do not understand it. If it were 
just a case of not understanding that would be one thing, but it is 
the terrible damage it does that is so frustrating.
<P>
	My friends over here have pounded away at the government, 
asking it to bring in some changes that address these types of 
things, and it has not. It has not addressed them. It would be so 
easy. We frittered around with tiny little pieces of legislation over 
the last few days when we could have been dealing with things of 
real consequence, things that would really help people.
<P>
	Maybe I was idealistic when I took on this job, but I thought we 
could bring some of these obvious problems to light and perhaps 
something would happen, perhaps there would be changes. It has 
not happened. It does not happen, and that drives me and everyone 
here crazy. I know it drives members across the way crazy. There 
are people who sit on the back benches who ask why we cannot 
change this. I do not know the answer to that. I guess the only 
people who know the answer to that are the people who reside in 
cabinet, where all the decisions are made.
<P>
	I encourage them to open up their ears and realize that by not 
acting to bring down some fundamental changes in the justice 
system they are allowing people to get hurt. If they are not 
consciously and not maliciously doing it, they are unconsciously 
doing it. However, the effect is the same.
<P>
	I encourage government members to start thinking about some 
of these victims out there, to start supporting some of the 
amendments like my friend from Wild Rose brought forward the 
other day, which would compensate victims, and to start opening 
their eyes to what is happening out there in the real world. When 
that day comes there will be 52 Reformers standing up and giving 
the government 100 per cent support.
<P>
	As I said at the beginning of my speech, I would love to support 
this bill but I know what would happen if we did. This government 
would take that as an excuse to quit. Therefore, it is with reluctance 
that I say it is a step in the right direction but it does not go nearly 
far enough. We will not give the government an excuse to quit. 
Over the next several months my friends will be on the heels of the 
government every day.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to enter into this discussion.
<P>
	The member from the Reform Party said the actions of the 
government drive every member of the Reform Party crazy. He 
inferred that the same is applicable to this side of the House. Let 
me agree with the first part of his statement and very strongly 
disagree with the second part.
<P>
	The member, in his convoluted statement, said he supports what 
we are doing but that it does not go far enough as far as he is 
concerned, so he and his party will vote against this bill. I have sat 
in the House for the past two years and I have never ceased to be 
amazed as to how simplistic the Reform Party's attitude has been to 
this whole issue. It seems to me that during many of their 
interjections and their discussions they are promoting a very 
simplistic justice system, very simplistic solutions to a very 
complex problem.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	They are forever talking about victims and victims' rights. I am 
amazed that a party that purports to be for law and order would not 
support the victim groups that want stronger gun control and 
support the government's legislation. Maybe the member can tell 
me how and why he does not support gun control as asked for by 
victims groups as well as the police in the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I assure the hon. member from across 
the way that he does not speak for all his backbenchers. I have 
talked to many of them and I know where they stand on the issues.
<P>
	With respect to the whole issue of victims' rights, many 
members of our caucus have been in regular contact with victims 
groups, have been supporting them, have been proposing 
legislation through private members' bills that would help them. 
We moved a motion in the House the other day which the 
government did not support. That motion would have provided 
some kind of compensation to victims. I want to make it very clear 
that we come down four square on the side of victims.
<P>
	On the issue of gun control, I think it is an improper 
characterization to say that all victims groups to a person believe 
that gun control will somehow staunch crime in the country. That is 
obviously wrong. I also point out, as my friend from 
Yorkton-Melville has claimed in the House, that many police, I 
would argue the great majority of rank and file policemen, do not 
support gun control as it has been proposed in the House.
<P>
	If there is anything simplistic in the House it is the comments of 
the hon. member across the way. I argue there is not a person in the 
country who has watched this channel for any amount of time who 
would ever doubt for a moment the sincerity of members on this 
side of the House when it comes to standing up for victims and 
hounding the government to bring about some changes  which, to 
the government's credit, it is starting to bring about in some of this 
legislation.
<P>
	We will continue to nip at the heels of the government until we 
start to see some real substantial changes in all areas of criminal 
justice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member has made reference to a particular case 
and read a letter. I take it the hon. member is well aware that laws 
are made by the federal government but the enforcement of these 
laws is strictly in the hands of the provincial governments. Barking 
in the Chamber is the wrong place. Comments have to be made to 
the provincial attorneys general to make sure matters are taken care 
of.
<P>
	The John Howard Society has put out statistics showing that a 
substantial number of young people are convicted of offences, and 
31 per cent of the young offenders are incarcerated but only 
approximately 20 per cent of adults are incarcerated. 
Proportionally there are more young offenders being incarcerated 
than adults. Yet we can see the Reform Party is clamouring for 
stronger sentences. As well, it appears that more young offenders 
are being charged but the crime rate of young offenders is not going 
up.
<P>
	With the position the Reform Party is taking, is it indicating 
there should be more incarceration facilities built in this country 
for young offenders and perhaps resort to a system similar to what 
is developing in California?
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has addressed 
several issues. He mentioned this was more of a provincial matter 
when he referred to the letter I read from. I am sorry the member 
missed the point I was making. If that young man had been 
convicted, and since federal laws say his name cannot be released, 
then he could go on to do this again and again and we would not be 
protected from him because we would not know his identity. To me 
that is a federal matter. Anybody who knows anything about the 
law should know that it is this way. I am surprised that as a lawyer 
the hon. member did not realize that.
<P>
	With respect to the stronger sentences, I remind the hon. member 
that it was his government that felt stronger sentences were 
necessary in Bill C-41. I remind the hon. member that in this very 
legislation there are stronger sentences being proposed. Now he is 
arguing against them. That is a little ironic. I encourage the hon. 
member to read the legislation.
<P>
	With respect to the fall in the crime rate among young offenders, 
there is a demographic issue that needs to be addressed here. It is 
not at all clear. If we go back a generation and look at the rise in 
violent crime between the sixties and today, it has gone up fourfold, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14965"> 14965 </A></B>
<P>
I believe.  Let us not spew out statistics without all of the 
background that goes with them.
<P>
	The hon. member should take the time to sit down and read this 
legislation. If he does he will not be so quick to jump up and start 
criticizing the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the House about a critically 
important public safety issue and to outline some of the measures 
the Government of Canada has initiated in response to our 
commitment in the red book to ensure safe homes and safe streets.
<P>
	All of us are painfully aware that the issues related to the 
management and treatment of sex offenders in federal correctional 
institutions are very much of public concern. Media attention and 
public outrage over violent crimes committed by sex offenders on 
conditional release have heightened fears about public safety.
<P>
	During the summer I had extensive consultations with my 
constituents in Richmond. I went to the bus stops and the shopping 
malls to speak with my constituents. Sure enough, the number one 
concern of my constituents was with crime issues. Last year I did 
the same thing, I reached out to the constituencies, and their 
concern was with the debt and deficit. I suppose this year, because 
of the works of our government, the debt and deficit are under 
control. Now their concentration is on crime issues.
<P>
	It is imperative that the Government of Canada take action to 
restore the public's confidence concerning the management and 
treatment of this group of offenders. I am confident the provisions 
contained in Bill C-45 as well as a number of criminal justice rights 
initiatives taken by the government would go a long way to 
restoring the public's confidence in Canada's criminal justice and 
correctional system.
<P>
	The issue of high risk sex offenders is a complex problem, which 
has many facets. It would be unrealistic to expect a simple solution. 
The problem requires a comprehensive approach involving all 
jurisdictions and agencies, both governmental and 
non-governmental, in criminal justice and corrections. The 
Canadian government recognizes this and has taken leadership to 
gain the support of all parties concerned toward achieving a mutual 
solution.
<P>
	At the federal and provincial levels there has been much 
discussion about this issue among ministers responsible for justice 
and corrections and a number of actions have already been 
announced. Among these was the announcement by the solicitor 
general last March of the establishment of a national flagging 
system using the Canadian Police Information Centre to help 
crown attorneys better identify high risk violent offenders at the 
time of prosecution. This system, along with the project now under 
way called the crown file research project, will assist prosecutors 
with decisions regarding prosecutions  and charging strategies, 
including whether to bring a dangerous offender application 
against an individual. If a person is ruled by the courts to be a 
dangerous offender, an indefinite sentence of incarceration can be 
imposed.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	Both these actions were recommended by the federal, provincial 
and territorial task force on high risk violent offenders which 
released its report earlier this year. The government is also 
addressing other important recommendations outlined in the 
report. For example, legislative changes are being examined which 
would make it easier for crown attorneys to make use of the 
existing dangerous offender provisions in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The provisions would be strengthened by making an indefinite 
sentence of incarceration the only sentencing option for those 
found by the court to be dangerous offenders, providing for new 
expanded presentence risk assessments in place of the current 
requirement for the evidence of two psychiatrists and the creation 
of a new category of long term offender, which would give the 
courts a new sentencing option for this group. This would require 
the long term supervision of the offender for up to 10 years 
following the end of the penitentiary term.
<P>
	In addition to the work of the task force, the amendments to the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act contained in Bill C-45 
include other important changes which would tighten the 
legislation to ensure greater public protection. Principal among 
these are changes to detention provisions as they relate to sex 
offenders who victimize children. The amendments will eliminate 
the current serious harm criterion for this group of offenders.
<P>
	Research has shown that the harm caused to children by sex 
offenders may not manifest itself until later in life. Therefore, 
because it is so difficult to draw a direct relationship between the 
offence and the consequent harm done, sex offenders often fall 
through the cracks when it comes to deciding whether they should 
be detained until the expiry of their sentence. The changes in Bill 
C-45 will close that gap by removing the requirement to determine 
whether serious harm occurred in sex offences involving children.
<P>
	In the area of federal corrections much has been done to make 
the system more responsive to the demands for increased attention 
to public safety. Correctional Service Canada has experienced 
rapid and unprecedented growth in the number of sex offenders in 
its custody. The rate has been quite disproportionate compared to 
the overall increase in the federal inmate population.
<P>
	In the past 10 years the number of sex offenders in federal 
penitentiaries has grown at a faster rate than any other group. From 
December 1990 to December 1994 the number of sex offenders 
under the jurisdiction of Correctional Service Canada increased by 
almost 50 per cent, while the total population increased by 10 per 
cent.  In 1984 they represented little more than 7 per cent of the 
total federal inmate population. Today, however, nearly one-quarter 
of the incarcerated population and 17 per cent of the supervised 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14966"> 14966 </A></B>
<P>
population are sex offenders. As of January 1995 there were an 
estimated 4,900 with sexual related offences in their sentences.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	This increase is the net result of a number of factors. Ten years 
ago about 14,000 reports on sex offences came to the attention of 
police each year. Today police receive more than 30,000 such 
reports annually. The police have become better trained in 
investigative procedures determining the profiles of sex offenders 
and in their sensitivity to victims.
<P>
	As well, attitudes have changed. Victims are much more willing 
to come forward. We have seen cases being prosecuted that 
occurred almost 30 years ago. There have been legislative changes 
resulting in new offences that were not investigated or prosecuted 
10, 20 or 30 years ago.
<P>
	Our society has seen decreased tolerance. The length of 
sentences being imposed by the courts has also increased. In 1991 
the average length of sentence for sex offenders was 4.2 years. 
Today it is well over five years on average.
<P>
	The trend therefore is that more sex offenders are entering the 
federal correctional system. They are staying longer and many are 
quite likely to be detained until the expiry of their sentence.
<P>
	Of the 555 offenders detained today, 60 per cent are sex 
offenders. Correctional Service Canada, therefore, has had to 
respond to this dramatic increase by quickly expanding its 
treatment capacity from less than 100 offenders 10 years ago to 
more than 1,800 today.
<P>
	This year it will increase to over 2,200. The correctional service 
has also increased the amount of money devoted to this area of 
treatment during the past five years. Expenditures in the coming 
years will increase by another $1.3 million in addition to last year's 
estimated $11 million.
<P>
	Recognizing that treatment does not stop at the front gate of a 
prison, the correctional service has also expanded its capacity for 
follow-up treatment and relaxed prevention in the community for 
offenders under conditional release.
<P>
	Seven hundred of the eighteen hundred treatment placements 
currently available are being provided in the community. To its 
credit the correctional service with the help of many experts has 
developed and implemented among the best programs and risk 
assessment tools of any other correctional jurisdiction in the world.
<P>
	In late March the correctional service sponsored a national 
conference on sex offender treatment in Toronto. More than 400 
experts and practitioners from  across Canada, as well as the United 
States, Belgium, New Zealand and Norway, met to share 
knowledge and expertise in this important area.
<P>
	To ensure that the service maintains its high standard of 
performance, a national strategy on sex offenders has been 
developed which is being shared with provincial mental health and 
correctional agencies to achieve a national consensus on standards 
for the assessment and treatment of sex offenders.
<P>
	It must be said, however, that experts and practitioners the world 
over do not claim there is a cure for sex offenders. There is no 
single cause for this form of deviant behaviour and there is no 
single approach to treatment.
<P>
	Instead there is a need for a continuum of treatment from 
intensive to intermediate to low intensity and a strong emphasis on 
managing risk through relaxed prevention. The latter involves 
teaching these inmates to recognize the factors that led to the 
commission of their crimes as well as avoidance and coping 
techniques for dealing with high risk situations. Even though the 
treatment programs and assessment tools are acknowledged to be 
among the best in the world, the state of knowledge unfortunately 
is not 100 per cent perfect, and it is unlikely it will ever be.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	Sex offenders are not a homogeneous group. The nature of their 
offences vary. Their treatment needs vary. Their security levels 
vary. Not all sex offenders pose the same risk to the community 
when they are released. The majority of them will be released 
eventually whether under some form of conditional release or on 
expiration of their sentences.
<P>
	The correctional service has conducted a number of follow-up 
research studies to acquire a better understanding of the rates of 
reoffending for treated and untreated sex offenders. It is too early to 
draw any firm conclusions, but by and large sex offenders who 
have participated in treatment programs have a greater probability 
of success than those who are untreated.
<P>
	A three-year follow-up of nearly 1,200 sex offenders released 
from prison between 1985 and 1987 revealed that 6 per cent were 
readmitted for another sex offence. Almost 14 per cent were 
returned to prison for a variety of non-sexual offences and 11 per 
cent were readmitted for some form of technical violation of 
release conditions.
<P>
	We know full well that statistics are of little comfort to the 
families of victims of these offenders in the aftermath of a tragedy. 
However I assure members of the House, indeed all Canadians, that 
tragic incidents also have a profound impact on correctional staff. 
It strengthens its resolve to improve the assessment procedures and 
the quality of treatment programs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14967"> 14967 </A></B>
<P>
	Real progress is being made to ensure greater protection for 
Canadians, especially from violent sex offenders who pose a high 
risk to women and children. The government has taken a very 
balanced approach and will continue to launch new initiatives in 
coming months to demonstrate its commitment to doing 
everything it can to make our homes and our communities safer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
quick question for the hon. member. Earlier we heard the 
parliamentary secretary to the solicitor general speak. I heard some 
of the same things a few minutes ago about treatment for our 
criminals that is going to be delivered, what we are going to do.
<P>
	We are forever spending lots of money on treatment of these 
types of individuals. The victims need treatment as well for the 
trauma they go through, but we do not spend a nickel on treatment 
for victims. Nor do we provide them with any psychological help 
or any number of things. We do not do anything in that regard.
<P>
	Now we are to spend more money because our treatment 
programs are to be better than they have ever been. The prisons will 
tell us that they have a tough time delivering treatment programs 
now, and they have had a tough time doing it over the last 10 years. 
All of a sudden we have a piece of legislation that is to make it 
happen and it is to be really good.
<P>
	I have two questions. Why not spend some time helping victims 
in the same regard? If this is to be done in the prisons, where in the 
devil are you to get the money?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I ask all hon. members to put their 
questions through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chan:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not true the government has not 
done anything for victims. Legislation is in place or in process 
dealing with restitution for victims of crime and helping them in 
different areas. It is incorrect for him to make that kind of 
statement. Treatment is so important in the prevention of crime. 
Sex offenders vary in the degree of their sickness and they need 
different types of treatment. A blanket coverage of just putting 
them all in jail forever or not give them conditional release, so they 
could be treated before they are released into the public is pure 
irresponsibility.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what a 
wonderful thing I just heard, all the great things that are being done 
for victims across the country. That is just not true.
<P>
	All we need to do is visit any victim, as I did yesterday, the 
family of Louis Ambas in Scarborough. Tell me one thing that has 
been done by the government for the family of that individual, the 
orphans and the widow. Nothing has been done.
<P>
	I get tired of the same old rhetoric about the wonderful things 
being done for victims. Wonderful things are being done for the 
criminals. Their rights are looked after so much. Boy, are we going 
to treat them and help those poor guys and ladies. We are going to 
really do our best to make sure they are well looked after.
<P>
	I will say it again, nothing is being done for victims, nothing. If I 
knew how to say it in French, I would make sure I said it once 
more.
<P>
	For the last two years the government has brought forward 
legislation such as Bills C-37, C-41, C-68 and now C-45. All this 
legislation reminds me of an old motto of my mother, and probably 
your mother too, Mr. Speaker: ``Put a little spoonful of sugar with 
the medicine and it will go down''. That is what the government 
has done with every one of these pieces of legislation. It has 
sprinkled in a little sugar in Bill C-37, very little mind you, but 
some would say that is not a bad idea. After looking at the whole 
bill there are so many rotten things in it that we just cannot support 
it.
<P>
	Bill C-41 is a really good example. There are some things in it 
that are not bad. Then we get petitions tabled here, letters from all 
across Canada about Bill C-41 saying: ``Do not include sexual 
orientation in section 18.2. If the government includes that section, 
don't vote for it''.
<P>
	I know these people across the way table many of those 
petitions. I know that many of those people across the way have 
tried to amend that section. Some of them really made a big effort. 
Some of them voted against the bill and got punished because they 
did what Canadians wanted. Is that not a shame? I think you know 
what I am talking about in that regard, Mr. Speaker. What a shame.
<P>
	However, we are the bad guys. We did not support Bill C-41 
because of all the fine things it is going to do. We tried to amend 
them. Members from the Liberal Party tried to amend the bill and 
make it better. It did not happen. If they voted against it, look out.
<P>
	Along comes Bill C-68. That sucker is that thick, about 167 to 
180 pages. The government sprinkled some sugar on about 17 
pages that addressed the criminal. The rest of the bill addressed the 
duck hunters, deer hunters, rabbit shooters, gopher shooters, target 
shooters, gun collectors; the legal, the law-abiding citizens, the 
taxpayers, the hard working people that pay those wonderful 
pensions Liberal members all took, with the exception of a few 
who I am glad did not. That is what that bill attacks. Seventeen 
pages of the bill have a little sugar and we are supposed to support 
it because of those 17 pages. Why can we not pull those out and 
give us an opportunity to do that?
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	The government really makes it tough when it creates legislation 
like that. Is it a game being played in the justice system? If we took 
Bill C-37 and piled it on top of  Bill C-41 and piled Bill C-68 on 
there and piled Bill C-45 on that we would have a stack quite high. 
They took millions of dollars to create. They are written in a bunch 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14968"> 14968 </A></B>
<P>
of gobbledegook that a guy like me who has 16 years of education 
does not have the vaguest idea of what one-tenth of it means. 
Therefore, we rely on the help we can get. We get researchers to 
help us out. We even go to the justice committee and ask some of 
our colleagues from the other party who are really good at doing 
that. I really appreciate their efforts. They are able to tear into that 
legislation. I really appreciate when some of the members of the 
Liberal Party come forward with amendments that will make the 
legislation better. Add more sugar in there, I like that. Let us do 
that.
<P>
	However, if a Liberal member is effective on a committee like 
that and dares to vote against the front line on any issue that he or 
she might disagree with, then he or she is out of that committee. 
They are bad boys or bad girls because they did not vote with the 
government. Democracy? Democracy in a pig's eye.
<P>
	That is what makes it so hard. That is why when we look at some 
parts of Bill C-45 we say: ``Darn, that is a good idea. I would really 
like to support that''. However, the government makes it 
impossible with all of the other gobbledegook that is put in there.
<P>
	I listened to the justice minister, who challenged me to join with 
him in helping to make the country safer. However when I stand 
here and move a motion that asks why we want to limit dangerous 
sexual offenders to only those who offend children, why not 
everyone, what happens? Who can argue with the fact that we 
should not keep dangerous child sexual offenders in jail? Who can 
argue against that? I cannot. However, should it make any 
difference that the one they are keeping in has offended 13, 14, 15 
or 16-year olds and the one they are not going to keep in has 
offended against 19, 20 and 21-year olds, grown woman or 85-year 
olds? That is what does not make any sense.
<P>
	Therefore, we stand and move a motion. I defy anyone to tell me 
there is a big difference between raping a 17-year old and raping an 
18 or 19-year old. Tell me there is a big difference. We moved a 
motion to amend that. Did we get support? No, not one bit. The 
little boys on the front line probably passed the word that the 
backbenchers were not allowed to vote for it. When their strings are 
pulled the puppets jump up and the arms vote the way they are told 
because they do not want any more punishment. If they get any 
more punishment they lose the ear of the government. I have news 
for them, the government is going to lose the ear of the public. It is 
sick and tired of it.
<P>
	There was a rally last night in Scarborough of nearly 500 people. 
They are fed up to here. Simplistic is a guy who jumps up like a 
puppet and does not vote for his constituents. Simplistic is when 
you do not think for yourself, stand on your own feet and represent  
Canadians. Instead, you represent the front row, that is simplistic. 
What an easy way to earn $64,000 a year. It is real easy.
<P>
	Let us look at Bill C-45, the bill dealing with dangerous 
offenders. What about the parole boards? We have a serious 
problem in this country. We are going broke. However, we are 
going to put in more things to help these criminals. We are going to 
give them more treatments. We are going to keep the parole boards 
active. The parole boards cost quite a bit of dollars.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	I hear over and over again from the people who work closest 
with the criminals that it really should be handled at their level. 
Maybe now would be the time to consider there not even be a 
parole board, that releases should be determined by the case 
workers, the guards, the psychologists and the people who work in 
the prisons closest to the inmates. Why not consider that?
<P>
	Wait a minute. If we got rid of the parole board, guess what? A 
whole lot of positions would disappear. Some people would not be 
appointed to it so they could stick their snouts in the trough. We 
cannot have that. It is the traditional way. We have been doing it for 
30 years. Let us not do anything different.
<P>
	I asked the government to make it mandatory that bad decisions 
by parole boards be totally reviewed. In Bill C-45 it may be done. 
We wanted it to be mandatory. It makes sense. The ordinary Joe on 
the street anywhere would say: ``Sure, why not?'' What is wrong 
with a little accountability?
<P>
	I do not think there is a person in this place who did not come 
from some job somewhere where they had to be accountable in that 
job. Why should it be any less now in government or in an 
appointed position? That is all we were asking for. The answer was 
no. The Liberals would not vote for it.
<P>
	I asked for mandatory restitution. There is a clause in Bill C-45 
that says 30 per cent of the wages earned in prison are to be paid 
back to the government to pay room and board. Nobody can argue 
with that. It is not a bad idea. I realize that is not a great amount of 
money but even a little bit helps. I simply wanted a motion that 
said: ``How about taking that 30 per cent and giving it to the 
victims, to the widows, helping them out?'' After all, the 
government is looking after the victims. No. No. That could not be 
considered. I really do not understand.
<P>
	Then all of a sudden I do understand. There are probably quite a 
few people on the backbench who would like to support it but the 
boys in the front row pull the strings and up jump the puppets and 
away we go again.
<P>
	When I look at the legislation that has been written, that stack, I 
wonder why it cannot be in a little better language, something that 
an ordinary guy could sit down, read and maybe understand what 
we are doing. Or does  it have to be produced that way so we can 
keep all those ants running around the justice building over there, 
all those senior bureaucrats making a lot more money than we are, 
so they can continue to put this stuff together and make sure not to 
get to the meat of the problem. Just make sure to sprinkle a little 
sugar throughout the whole thing so that we would look like fools if
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14969"> 14969 </A></B>
<P>
we did not support it. That way we can keep those fellows 
employed all the time.
<P>
	It is wonderful. Just wonderful. A bunch of bureaucrats running 
around, do nothing bureaucrats creating a bunch of stuff the 
ordinary Canadian, including the member across, cannot 
understand. It cannot be read nor understood. I am just trying to 
make sense out of it.
<P>
	Instead of spending millions of dollars putting stuff like that 
together, how about taking that money and putting some guards 
down at Port Erie where the trucks drive through. Customs cannot 
even stop them because they do not have enough help.
<P>
	The attorney general for Ontario says that trucks are coming 
through driven by criminals. What do we do? I am sure they are 
over there working on it right now. There will be another Bill 
C-926 or whatever it will be called. It will be thick and full of 
gobbledegook. It will not be as simple as saying: ``Look, there is a 
problem. Let us fix it''. That is not the way it is done. The game is 
not being played right.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	I am tired of playing the game. I have been here two years and I 
have been listening to nothing but games. We ought to be able to 
accomplish something in the House. Instead, the best thing that has 
yet happened is the legislation on DNA testing. The only reason 
that happened is this party put the Liberals in a corner and they had 
to do it. They refused it for a year. Then all of a sudden out of the 
blue they decided it was a good idea, after I had asked for about the 
tenth time.
<P>
	I do not know how members of that party can sit opposite to us 
and laugh, thinking this is all a big joke. I wish they had spent an 
afternoon with me talking to a few widows and orphans. I would 
bet they probably do not know what a victim of crime looks like.
<P>
	I wish they had been with me when I spoke with the mother of 
the five-year old girl who was found in a garbage dumpster in 
Calgary with her throat cut. She is a single mother with no income, 
barely making ends meet. She has not received one penny's worth 
of help and has two other people living with her. The best they 
come up with over there are giggles and laughs.
<P>
	Somebody is going to wake the government up. I am trying to. I 
am sure I will not accomplish it but I will guarantee there are 
Canadians all across the country. Your day is coming. You guys at 
the pig trough talk about 1.5 million kids starving in this country. I 
have  news: Let us all give up our pensions and steer that money 
toward those starving children. What is wrong with that? You are 
too greedy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> You are on pension already.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The hon. member does not even know what he 
is talking about. If he wants to talk to me about my teacher's 
pension I will be more than glad to do it. Once he understands it I 
am sure he will say: ``Well, I didn't realize that''.
<P>
	Let us solve the problems. There are hungry children in this 
world and people living in poverty. Do something. Join the rest of 
us, including six of your own members. Give up those pensions and 
let us do something. Let us steer that money that way. You do not 
want to? You like what you have? You live with it and wait until the 
next election. You explain it to people in your community who may 
have these starving kids. You explain to them why we continually 
bring up legislation-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member has used the word you 
referring to other members at least four times in the last three 
minutes. I ask him please if he is using the word you to refer to 
whoever happens to be sitting in the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> There I go again. Mr. Speaker, you realize what 
I am saying. If these people are starving and hungry and there is 
poverty in Canada, why do we not do something? We have had 
more and more opportunities. I am fed up to here. This justice 
system is not a justice system; it is a legal system. It is an industry. 
My goodness we spend a lot of money in this industry. We take 
forever to get the Bernardos convicted. We spend millions. We plea 
bargain with the Homolkas. We pay Clifford Olson $10,000 for 
every body he leads us to. Does that make any sense at all?
<P>
	My hon. colleague will sit over there and say: ``Ah, that 
simplistic old fool''. Another will say: ``Just because that guy 
taught for 30 years in a school, he is not entitled to $900 a month 
pension'', even though it is all my money to begin with.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Not taxpayers' money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> It was not taxpayers' money.
<P>
	I am more than pleased to give up my pension in the House. I am 
not an opportunist. I do not plan to make a career out of politics. I 
plan on trying the very best I can to get some laws changed so that 
my grandchildren-I have three of them who are about this 
big-and your grandchildren and a few more young children and 
women will be more than pleased to go downtown by themselves 
and feel safe. What is wrong with that?
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	I know what is going to happen though. The cabinet will decide 
and the puppets will vote and support its wishes. It is not the justice 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14970"> 14970 </A></B>
<P>
system that will grow; the  Liberal system will grow. That is a real 
danger to Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member in his usual folksy and entertaining way has made a 
speech in which, of course, he has managed for the most part to 
stay away from the subject matter before the House today, Bill 
C-45. He has ranged over the Young Offenders Act, MPs pensions, 
his travels throughout the country, but what has he really talked 
about? Has he really addressed the issues of Bill C-45?
<P>
	The reason I am up is that yesterday the hon. member visited the 
very nice community of Scarborough of which I am privileged to 
be one of the five members of Parliament. Five hundred and fifty 
thousand people live in the city of Scarborough. I hope we made 
the hon. member feel welcome as a member of Parliament and that 
he had the opportunity to express his point of view which in a 
democracy everybody is entitled to do.
<P>
	I want to talk about Bill C-45 and ask the hon. member a 
question. He talked about gobbledegook. He talked about how laws 
are written in gobbledegook. That may be if one is not a lawyer.
<P>
	What we do in the House is write and pass laws. If we do not 
understand them, somebody has to understand them. We hope that 
they are the lawyers in the justice department. If they do not 
understand them, then as has been done in the past, the courts will 
tell us what they mean. I will be referring to that very topic in my 
speech in a few moments. We do not want to be told by the courts 
what we meant. Therefore we had all better make an effort to 
understand this gobbledegook because if we do not understand it, 
then we are at the mercy of the lawyers.
<P>
	The previous speaker from the hon. member's party gave the nub 
of the problem of the Reform Party which is that there is really 
nothing wrong with Bill C-45. It is actually kind of good. It 
actually does some good amending to former Bill C-36. However 
the Reform members dare not support it because, in the words of 
the hon. member for Medicine Hat, that might be enough and we 
will not go any further.
<P>
	I recall the Reform Party members, when they came here, saying 
they would do things differently. They were not going to oppose for 
the sake of opposing. If something was good, they would support it. 
What is really wrong with Bill C-45 that the member cannot 
support it while still making the points he makes about the various 
other topics he spoke about?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess it is more of what is not 
there than what is there which bothers me. I talked about dangerous 
offenders. I hope the message went out that I feel it should not 
apply to the offenders of children only. It should go beyond that to a 
great extent. Because  my time ran out I did not get a chance to talk 
about a couple of other things that should be in the bill.
<P>
	For example, drugs are a very serious problem in our prisons. I 
am sure hon. members including the member for Scarborough West 
would agree that they are a serious problem. I am trying to figure 
out why we have not brought in legislation which says there will be 
no more drugs in the prisons that they will be out of there. Does it 
make any sense when 70 per cent of the people going in there have 
a drug problem? Yet they are sending them to a place where drugs 
are more accessible than they are on any street. We are going to 
rehabilitate them while they are in there. Think about that.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Here is a guy who is going to prison. He represents about 70 per 
cent of the prison population in that he has a drug problem. That is 
why he got into trouble to begin with. We are sending him to a 
prison where drugs are more accessible than they are on the streets. 
To help him we will give him the bleach program or sterilized 
needles. Then in four years we will let him out and he will be 
rehabilitated. We might as well take an alcoholic and sentence him 
to a wine cellar for six months and see how well he is fixed when he 
gets out.
<P>
	It is not so much what is in the bill, but it is a lot of what is not 
there that should be. There are some things in there we would like 
to support, but why do we always have to make the tough decision 
about supporting something we do not want to in other parts?
<P>
	I know the hon. member struggled with Bill C-41. There are 
some good things in Bill C-41. Should we support it? That is the 
decision which is always tough. They could do better when it 
comes to the gobbledegook. Why do we not stick to what 
Canadians want? Why do we not listen as parliamentarians to what 
Canadians say? My people are saying: ``We want this; we want 
that. Now write the laws''. Is it so difficult that these guys over 
there are so smart that they cannot write in common English, 
French or a language we can understand?
<P>
	The hon. member is right. We had better understand it. I am 
trying to make every effort I can to understand it. It is too bad we 
cannot pick up a lot more by ourselves without having to get a 
bunch of help to do it. I do not know if it is possible, but if it is not 
impossible let us fix it. Let us give a direction to the authors of our 
laws that from now on when they write income tax laws or criminal 
justice laws they are written so that the farmer in Alberta or the 
bushman in British Columbia can sit down, look at them and 
understand them. That is simplistic according to some members 
but to me it is common sense.
<P>
	Why do we not take the good things that the people want? Let us 
listen to them and talk about them as parliamentarians. We should 
put our differences aside and say: ``Here are some things we have 
really got to  fix''. Why do we not go into committees together, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14971"> 14971 </A></B>
<P>
work together and get this done? Because it is not the Liberal way. 
It is not the Conservative way. It is not the way we do it in Canada. 
Maybe it is time to change.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine made a very eloquent 
presentation. I was surprised that my colleague on the other side 
did not listen to the parliamentary secretary. All that Bill C-45 does 
is close some of the loopholes which exist in the present system.
<P>
	Does the hon. member have a problem with the government 
making it easier for the parole board to keep people in the 
penitentiaries until the end of their offences if they are sex 
offenders or repeat offenders? Does he have a problem with the 
parole board being able to keep people who have committed violent 
crimes until the end of their sentence? Does he have a problem with 
those two recommendations? If he does not, does that mean he will 
support the bill when it comes before the House for the vote on 
third reading?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, there again he is talking about a 
bill which is this thick and he talked about a very small portion of 
the bill. That is what he talked about.
<P>
	Certainly I can support that idea. Can I support the entire 
package? If I want to support that idea I have to vote for the whole 
ball of wax. It reminds me of the Charlottetown accord. How many 
times has the Prime Minister said: ``You do not want a triple-E 
Senate; if you had wanted a triple-E Senate you would have voted 
for the Charlottetown accord''. Hogwash. That is maybe one thing 
in there we did like, but there was a whole pile of stuff in there that 
people did not like, obviously, or it would not have gone the way it 
did. Sometimes you do not buy the whole package because of some 
good stuff.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	That is why it is really difficult when we sit over here. When the 
government does produce something that has the sugar in it that we 
like, the things that ought to be in there, why does it colour it black 
with some other stuff when it knows people do not want it? Why do 
we have to buy the whole package?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have been listening attentively to the debate. I have listened 
attentively to the Reform Party and its position.
<P>
	It is difficult to be in opposition. The Reform Party sometimes 
forgets that our party was in opposition for nine years. It is not as if 
we do not know what it is like to be in opposition and how difficult 
it is sometimes.
<P>
	I gather basically that what the Reform Party is saying is there is 
nothing wrong with Bill C-45 per se; what is wrong is there is not 
more in it. I take some solace in that. There is nothing wrong with 
Bill C-45 specifically.  Everything can be improved. We can always 
do better. There can always be suggestions coming forward based 
on what happens in certain cases. That is no reason not to support a 
bill in which there is nothing really wrong, other than that it is not 
thick enough, I guess would be the way we would put it.
<P>
	In my brief time I will concentrate on two aspects of Bill C-45 in 
the context of how individual members of Parliament can make a 
difference to the legislative process. This is reasonably relevant in 
view of the member's comments about puppets. There is an 
unfortunate belief pervading Canada that the individual member of 
Parliament cannot do anything, cannot contribute, does not make a 
difference.
<P>
	I will talk about the history of this bill and what happens when 
individual members of Parliament take an interest. What piqued 
my interest in this topic was what one of the Reform Party justice 
critics said last Wednesday, September 20, 1995, the hon. member 
for Crowfoot, with whom I have worked on the justice committee. 
On page 14658 of <I>Hansard</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Canadians can no longer tolerate the likes of Wray Budreo, who psychiatrists 
diagnosed as a sadistic pedophile having a 30-year history of molesting 
children, being released unsupervised from a maximum security prison because 
correctional services did not have the power to detain him even though the 
parole board ruled him likely to reoffend. They cannot tolerate it because the 
cost is far too high.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have had an intimate relationship and knowledge of that 
particular section of the previous act and of the Wray Budreo case, 
which I am about to relate. I thought my friends in the Reform 
Party might be interested in the facts of that matter. They do not 
quite gibe with the quoted comments of the hon. member for 
Crowfoot.
<P>
	While we were in opposition I was the official opposition critic 
for the solicitor general. As such, I was charged by my party with 
watching over Bill C-36, the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act. I struggled with my party with the very points my friends in 
the Reform Party have brought up today. Ultimately, we voted 
against the bill.
<P>
	I put in something like 20 or 30 amendments, which were 
accepted and which in my view strengthened the bill. In the end, in 
our view there were sufficient problems with it to vote against it. In 
a parliamentary democracy we lost the vote and the bill proceeded. 
It is now the law of the land. It has been implemented. Correctional 
services asked us to give the bill a chance to work and if we found 
any errors we would plug them, thus Bill C-45.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	Before Bill C-45 we came up with the problem of Wray Budreo, 
and that is specifically section 130 of the act. My friend will know 
how things go in these deliberations. We go over it with a fine tooth 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14972"> 14972 </A></B>
<P>
comb, line by line, word by word, comma by comma. Fifteen or 
nine  or however many members of the justice committee who were 
there at that time missed something. We did not purposely overlook 
it; we simply missed it. That was the serious harm clause which 
states that by statute every prisoner must be released after serving 
two-thirds of their term.
<P>
	I am not talking about a life sentence here. Generally, if there is a 
fixed term then after two-thirds of that term you must be released 
unless certain things happen. One of those is a reference to the 
board. If the board finds that an offender, if released, is likely to 
commit an offence causing the death of or serious harm to another 
person before the expiration of the offender's sentence, according 
to law the board can order that they be kept in for the balance of 
their sentence.
<P>
	We read that, agreed with it and passed it. I did not offer any 
amendments. What happened was that the Wray Budreo case 
pointed out to us that we had missed something. What happened? 
Wray Budreo is not, I suppose, depending on how you use the 
words, a sadistic pedophile, which implies what we might call 
actual physical assault on children. Wray Budreo is a pedophile, 
there is no doubt about it; but as far as we knew from the profile he 
did not sodomize young boys. What he liked to do was in effect pet 
them on the abdomen. This caused him sexual pleasure.
<P>
	The board took the interpretation that petting a child in that 
manner, not even touching the sexual area, just the abdomen, was 
not serious harm as defined in that section. Serious harm was 
deemed to be, for example, sodomizing a young child. Of course, a 
petting would not be an offence likely to cause death.
<P>
	The board felt its hands were tied and it would have to let Wray 
Budreo out after he had served two-thirds of his sentence. It agreed 
he was likely to reoffend. It agreed he was likely to find other 
children and touch them on the abdomen and various other places. 
It also agreed he was not likely to cause death and he was not likely 
to cause serious harm as that section had been interpreted.
<P>
	When that hit the papers, perhaps to use some of the rhetoric of 
my friend, I went ballistic. I brought this matter before the justice 
committee, which at that time was chaired by Mr. Bob Horner, a 
Conservative. The committee was controlled by Conservatives. I 
asked the committee to review this section and see if we could 
come up with a suggested approach for the government. All of the 
parties agreed, and the New Democrats were represented on that 
committee as well. We undertook a study of section 130 in specific 
reference to the Wray Budreo case and we came up with a 
unanimous report, which we tabled in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Sadly or perhaps happily, depending on whether we are looking 
at it politically or in terms of solving this problem, we were 
approaching the end of the Conservative mandate. There was not 
enough time for  the Conservative government to react to this 
unanimous report.
<P>
	The current solicitor general reacted to it immediately. As soon 
as he was appointed solicitor general one of the first bills he 
brought in was Bill C-45, the government's response to what I have 
just laid out as what happened in the Budreo case.
<P>
	I will now quote from the amendment to section 130, contained 
in section 43: ``The board may order that the offender not be 
released from imprisonment before the expiration of the offender's 
sentence according to law, where the board is satisfied'', among 
other things, ``that the offender is likely if released to commit a 
sexual offence involving a child before the expiration of the 
offender's sentence according to law''.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	That is a direct response to a private member's initiative, which 
plugs the Wray Budreo loophole. That is a response brought 
forward by the government in direct response to the entreaties 
initially by me and ultimately the justice committee. It addresses a 
wrong and a loophole we did not notice in our initial examination 
of the bill.
<P>
	That is the history behind that amendment. That is why the 
amendment has been brought forward. It still leaves in place the 
requirement of death or serious harm for other circumstances, but it 
protects children.
<P>
	Often the very damaging serious psychological harm takes 20 or 
30 years to manifest itself. While touching the abdomen of a young 
child might not be considered serious harm in a physical sense, it 
might be serious harm in a psychological sense 20 years later. That 
is the whole purpose behind this particular section.
<P>
	This is an example of what individual members of Parliament on 
a committee can do in terms of strenghthening legislation.
<P>
	Clearly this is an amendment that needs to be supported. If it is 
in a bill that has all kinds of other terrible things in it, obviously we 
cannot support it. If it is in a bill that for all intents and purposes is 
not criticized except for what is not in it, it can be supported and 
still go after what is not in the bill in amendments by members at 
committee and in private members' bills. Sometimes the germ of 
the idea of a private member's bill gets accepted by the government 
of the day.
<P>
	The second aspect I wish to talk about in Bill C-45 pertains to 
section 743.6 of the Criminal Code. I relate it to private members 
and what I talked about in my question to my hon. friend about the 
courts, whether we tell the courts what we mean or whether they 
tell us what we mean.
<P>
	According to law you must be released after serving two thirds 
of a fixed sentence unless certain things occur, which I just talked 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14973"> 14973 </A></B>
<P>
about. In the same way, you are  automatically by law eligible to be 
considered for parole after serving one third of your sentence.
<P>
	In some circumstances, and I am sure my friends in the Reform 
Party will agree, there are egregious cases in which people say no, 
there should not be automatic eligibility for parole after one third 
of your sentence.
<P>
	A section was passed in the Criminal Code which in part says: 
``Where an offender receives a sentence of imprisonment of two 
years or more for an offence set out in schedule I or II to that act'', 
that is very serious offences, prosecuted by way of indictment, ``the 
court may, if satisfied, having regard to the circumstances of the 
commission of the offence and the character and circumstances of 
the offender, that the expression of society's denunciation of the 
offence or the objective of specific or general deterrence so 
requires, order that the portion of the sentence that must be served 
before the offender may be released on full parole is one half of the 
sentence or 10 years, whichever is less''.
<P>
	What does all that mean? It means that if a judge sees a case that 
he thinks requires that the offender serve at least one half of his 
time before being eligible for parole then he can so order under this 
section. In my view, it is pretty clear what the House of Commons 
meant by ``the objective of specific or general deterrence so 
requires''. What do I know about what is clear?
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	On February 20 of this year there was an article in the Toronto 
<I>Star</I> about a drug trafficker. The trial judge, quite rightly I think, 
thought it was a pretty bad crime, that we did not want drug 
traffickers, particularly in heroin. The gentleman was sentenced to 
only three years, but the court ordered that he serve one-half of his 
sentence before he be considered eligible for parole.
<P>
	Because I do not rely on what is in the newspapers I did some 
research by pulling the court of appeal decision in the case and 
finding the trial judge's reasons which stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The most important factors of sentencing that ought to be brought to bear in 
my mind on this case are the factors of individual and general deterrence. 
General deterrence means that the sentence should send a message to other 
persons in like situations, or who are considering becoming involved in like 
situations, that this is likely what you will receive.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The trial judge got it right. That is exactly what the House meant 
when we passed the legislation. It was as clear as a bell to me and I 
thought it was clear in the words of the section.
<P>
	Along comes the court of appeal of the province of Ontario to 
state the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Unfortunately the wording of section 741.2 provides the judge with very 
little guidance to determine when this exceptional authority over parole 
eligibility should be exercised.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It also states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The presumption is that Parliament intended section 741.2 to have some 
additional purpose.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I thank the court of appeal. Of course it did. It then states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It then falls to the courts to give the section meaning and function.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When I read that I said that it was wrong. It is up to us to tell the 
courts what we mean when we pass a statute. Therefore I brought 
the matter to the attention of the justice committee. My friend from 
Wild Rose was on the justice committee at that time. I pointed out 
that was not the intention.
<P>
	The court of appeal overruled the trial judge and stated that the 
section could only be used in the rarest of circumstances and that in 
all cases rehabilitation of the offender must be paramount. That 
was not the intention of Parliament. I was here and I know what the 
intention of Parliament was. We heard the debates, which were 
obviously not read by the court of appeal.
<P>
	The court of appeal states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In my view section 741.2 should only be invoked as an exceptional measure 
where the crown has satisfied the court on clear evidence that an increase in the 
period of parole ineligibility is required.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is no onus in this section for the crown to shown anything. 
There is no requirement on the crown to prove anything.
<P>
	Therefore I asked the justice committee if it would consider an 
amendment for the sole purpose of overturning the Court of 
Appeal's interpretation of what Parliament meant when it passed 
that section. The result of my request to the justice committee is 
subparagraph (2) of that section, an amendment in Bill C-45 which 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For greater certainty, the paramount principles which are to guide the court 
under this section, are denunciation and specific or general deterrence with 
rehabilitation of the offender, in all cases, being subordinate to these paramount 
principles in this section.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If that is not clear to the court of appeal, we had better send it 
back to school.
<P>
	There was unanimous recommendation of the justice committee. 
The government accepted the recommendation and the 
amendment. It has already been passed in Bill C-41. It will pass if 
we vote for this bill. It is another example of how individual 
members of Parliament on their own initiative, working with others 
in committees, can make bills better.
<P>
	I support the bill. We know from the other party there is nothing 
wrong with what is in it. We can understand there should be more 
things in it. They can work for those, but they should not throw the 
baby out with the bath water. I urge members to support the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14974"> 14974 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had 
a great time in Scarborough. The hospitality was wonderful.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to know about the consecutive sentencing in Bill 
C-45. I believe, and memory is getting about as old as the rest of 
my body, if people commit another crime when on parole that 
sentence is added to what they did not serve on the other crime. 
Then they get two-thirds knocked off and are eligible for parole 
again after one-third of the time, if I am not mistaken. That is 
wrong.
<P>
	Consecutive sentencing is something the government avoids 
talking about. I know it does not happen in the court. It is 
deplorable to see people like Bernardo commit nine serious crimes 
and only serve the amount of time one of the crimes would call for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Sixty-two rapes, 
plus, plus, plus.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> ``Sixty-two rapes, plus, plus, plus''. Clifford 
Olson committed 12 murders but is only serving time on one.
<P>
	Could the member tell me if he has any knowledge about why we 
cannot change that and make it retroactive for those who were 
sentenced previous to Bill C-45?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Wild 
Rose for his question. I believe the hon. member was not referring 
to consecutive sentences but rather to multiple sentences contained 
in section 139 of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. If 
there is a section of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act 
which might qualify as the word my friend used in his previous 
speech, gobbledegook, it is that section.
<P>
	We struggled with the section when we initially went through the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act. We had flow charts. We 
had chiefs of police showing us what would happen if someone 
sentenced to 20 years for armed robbery committed another 
robbery while on parole. He would get out even before he ended up 
serving any time on the first offence.
<P>
	The solicitor general at the time, Mr. Lewis, acknowledged there 
was a serious problem, that there was a lot of difficulty, and that he 
would set up a commission or a group of people to examine the 
matter and come back with some recommendations.
<P>
	My understanding is that it has been dealt with to some extent in 
Bill C-45. However I think there is a lot of room for improvement 
with respect to the multiple sentence calculation. As I said, we 
missed the Wray Budreo situation but when that situation arose we 
dealt with it. Tragically it may very well be that the amendments to 
multiple sentencing, the changes to the calculations, have not dealt 
with all the problems. It is a  very complicated section and a very 
complicated area of the law.
<P>
	However if a case comes down that slips through the cracks or 
exposes an egregious error in the calculations that Canadians 
simply cannot abide, we will have to come up with an amendment. 
I am certain the government of the day will do so. No government 
is in the business of permitting loopholes to legislation. No 
government is in the business of wanting wild animals to walk the 
streets to threaten ordinary law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	We have made an effort to change section 139. I do not know that 
it is perfect. If it is not perfect we will soon know about it. 
Whatever government is in power at whatever time will make 
whatever changes are necessary to tighten the multiple sentence 
calculations.
<P>
	I cannot sit down without a word about the Bernardo case, which 
my friend has raised a number of times. Canadians may not like the 
reality of the law, but it is that Paul Bernardo has been sentenced to 
life in prison. I am not talking about when and if he will ever be 
paroled. He is under a sentence of life and as long as he lives he 
will be under a sentence of life imprisonment. As the law currently 
stands-and never mind the 15-year faint hope clause for the time 
being-he cannot even be considered eligible to apply for parole 
until he serves 25 years of his sentence. When he applies for parole, 
assuming he does, after that 25 years there is no guarantee he will 
get parole. The parole board can refuse him parole for the rest of 
his natural life and he can spend the rest of his natural life in prison.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Even if he gets parole 25 or 30 years from now, he is still under a 
sentence of life imprisonment. If he breaches any of the conditions 
of his parole at that time, 25 or 30 years from now, he can be 
brought back into the prison system to serve the rest of his 
sentence.
<P>
	I want to make it clear that it is incorrect to say that persons who 
commit first degree murder is sentenced to 25 years. That is false. 
They are sentenced to life in prison and they have the opportunity 
to apply for parole after 25 years.
<P>
	It is up to the parole board to decide on a case by case basis 
whether or not a particular murderer should be granted parole. For 
my part I certainly hope that neither Bernardo, Clifford Olson nor 
the people who murdered Emanuel Jacques, the shoe shine boy, 
ever get out of prison. I hope they rot in their cells, daily 
remembering the tragedies they have wrought.
<P>
	Let us talk facts. These people are under sentences of 
imprisonment for life.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I noticed the 
member for Scarborough West passed very quickly over the faint 
hope clause. I would rather he did not do that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14975"> 14975 </A></B>
<P>
	How does the member feel about clause 745?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I only passed over it because there is 
really not much in it. It is merely a regurgitation.
<P>
	There will be circumstances where persons change so 
dramatically in life-and they will be few and far between-that 
they should be given the opportunity to put their situation before a 
jury of their peers, not a judge but ordinary citizens like us.
<P>
	My problem with the current section is that the persons only 
have to convince two-thirds of a jury. When they were convicted 
the jury had to be unanimous that they were guilty. However under 
the current provisions of section 745 they have to show two-thirds 
of the jurors that they should be allowed to apply for parole before 
they serve 25 years.
<P>
	It should be a unanimous requirement. If they cannot convince a 
jury unanimously that they are entitled to early parole eligibility, 
they should not get it.
<P>
	In the absence of an amendment saying that, I do not support 
section 745 as it is currently drawn. The hon. member for York 
South-Weston has moved a private member's bill in that regard 
which I supported at second reading and which I support now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, nothing strikes a chord more deeply in the heart and soul 
of Canadians than the issues we are discussing today. Crime, 
punishment and safety are essential to their feelings of security.
<P>
	Bill C-45, an act to amend the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act, deals with many very important issues such as 
detaining sex offenders of children, a system to remove parole 
board members, a system to deal with reoffenders while on parole, 
and a system to deal with restitution to the state. All these are 
integrally important changes that must be made to our justice 
system.
<P>
	However, tragically we see again a lost opportunity. Another 
opportunity we have had to deal with these very important issues 
and make a significant impact upon our justice system has now 
passed us by because the government has done what it usually does, 
that is nibble around the edges.
<P>
	I will make some constructive suggestions which my colleagues 
in my party have been working very hard on, issues that we have 
tried to convince the government to enact for the betterment of all 
Canadians. Once again it has failed to do so.
<P>
	The first deals with sex offenders and it only deals with sex 
offenders of children. Sex offences involving anyone is a crime. 
Whether it is done to adults or children, by men or women, it is a 
crime and it needs to be dealt with very severely.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	We should be imposing sentences which have as their primary 
purpose the protection of society and innocent civilians. What we 
have seen in the criminal courts for decades is that the rights and 
protection of innocent civilians have not been held in as high a 
regard as they could have been. In many cases we have seen the 
rights of the criminals being held in higher regard than the rights of 
innocent civilians. The innocent civilians have paid the price, 
tragically at times with their lives, because the justice department 
has not done its job.
<P>
	There is the case in my riding of Robert Owens. He is a 
pedophile. He used to be a principal in a school. He had committed 
over 1,000 sexual offences. The reason they know that is he used to 
make a record on a Garfield calendar every time he committed a 
sexual offence on a child. His sentence was for 13 years. He served 
eight and a half years and is now living among his victims in my 
riding near a school. When we brought this to the attention of the 
authorities they said: ``We are sorry. Our hands are tied. That is the 
law''. If that is the law, the law is not doing a good enough job of 
protecting those victims living in that community.
<P>
	I ask any member of the House to put themselves in the shoes of 
those victims. They have to completely change their lifestyle. The 
system does not address it but my colleagues have been putting 
forward constructive suggestions to address it.
<P>
	We also need a better system to deal with parole board members. 
There have been numerous tragic situations brought up by my 
colleagues. There are some constructive things which we can do.
<P>
	First, do not make them appointments, make them public service 
jobs.
<P>
	Second, I was appalled that the parole board members, who are 
in effect acting like judges, go into the job often having no 
knowledge of justice issues. I find that absolutely incredible. How 
can we have parole board members who are appointed to positions 
making decisions with respect to people who could pose a 
significant threat to Canadian society when they have very little or 
no knowledge of the justice system? Make those people public 
servants and ensure they get the job based on merit.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It's not the Liberal way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Third, as my 
colleague from Wild Rose said, if a person is on parole and 
commits an offence they must serve the remainder of their sentence 
before they are sentenced again, and the sentencing must run 
consecutively, not concurrently.
<P>
	Fourth, the bill supposedly deals with restitution. It proposes that 
up to 30 per cent of what an incarcerated individual makes should 
go to the state. What about the victims? Who gives money to them? 
There is no ample  compensation for victims, particularly for those 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14976"> 14976 </A></B>
<P>
who are victims of violent crime. It would be far more productive if 
the individual who has committed the offence knows full well that 
he will have to pay directly to the victim moneys to compensate for 
the harm he has done.
<P>
	The bill deals with sentencing. We have spoken about criminals 
being eligible for parole after serving one-third of their sentence. 
Karla Homolka will be eligible for parole after serving three years 
of her sentence. The public may not be aware that individuals are 
eligible for day parole after serving one-sixth of their sentence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Presuming they get it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Oftentimes they do 
get it.
<P>
	They are eligible for full parole after serving two-thirds of their 
sentence. They only serve a maximum of two-thirds of their 
sentence because automatically they are awarded with good 
behaviour. A better idea is to ensure that every convicted criminal 
will automatically serve the full sentence and that sentence would 
be pulled down based on the behaviour of the individual in jail. Let 
us not assume that there has been good behaviour, let us make sure 
it is earned. There are many ways that can be done.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Furthermore all moneys an individual earns in prison should go 
to the state to help offset the $60,000 to $100,000 that it costs to 
have someone incarcerated and also moneys to the individuals 
themselves.
<P>
	Work and training should be obligatory for individuals who are 
incarcerated. The training would go a long way to decrease the 
recidivism rate of those in our jails. It would enable people to get 
the skills necessary while they are incarcerated so they can become 
active and productive members of society. Not enough of that is 
done now. Furthermore it is not obligatory which it ought to be, if 
someone were to have the wherewithal to do that.
<P>
	Number six is sentencing. We spoke about section 745 which 
should be repealed now. It shows the lame inability of the 
government to deal with significant issues of justice by not 
addressing section 745.
<P>
	My colleague from Scarborough mentioned that when people are 
sentenced to life they serve life. That is absolute nonsense. I have a 
list that is pages long of individuals who were convicted of first 
degree murder and because of section 745 their sentence has been 
commuted to 15 to 17 years. That includes people who have killed 
police officers in cold blood. I am happy to share that list with 
anyone in the House.
<P>
	Is that justice? I hardly think so. That is not the case at all. 
Section 745 should be repealed now. The government would be 
showing that it is truly committed to justice if  it would take heed of 
what my colleagues have been saying for so long.
<P>
	Number seven is young offenders. The government has promised 
to deal with the Young Offenders Act and has done virtually 
nothing. I implore members of the government to speak to police 
officers who are working on the street. Their hands are tied. They 
are frustrated with the inability of the justice system to back them 
up when dealing with young offenders.
<P>
	Having worked with young offenders in jail I can say they 
receive very little penalty, very little deterrence to committing 
offences. That is why we see the terrible rate of recidivism among 
young offenders.
<P>
	Here are a few concrete suggestions. Publish the names of young 
offenders. It would send a very clear message that they cannot 
engage in these activities with anonymity. Have the stiffer penalties 
that my party has been putting forward for a long time. Make work 
and school obligatory in their incarceration.
<P>
	Part of the sentencing problems that we see are because the 
justice department and all departments are hamstrung because of a 
lack of funds. That is why we see people being released very early 
on, earlier than they should be. The trade-off is that the justice 
department due to a lack of funding is releasing people to save 
money at the expense of the safety of Canadians from coast to 
coast. That is not justice.
<P>
	We have a couple of concrete solutions. We cannot take 
individuals who are young offenders, who often grow up in tragic 
and terrible home situations, put them into closed custody for a 
period of a few months, then put them back in the environment that 
they were in and expect things to change. It will not happen.
<P>
	They are usually in an environment in which there are terrible 
cases of substance abuse, physical and sexual abuse and violence. 
If they are in this kind of milieu, it is impossible, no matter how 
much counselling is given to these kids to actually move forward-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Put them in the military.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Military training.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, I am quite 
aware there are some strong views on both sides of this issue. 
However I remind you that when members are sitting close to the 
person who has the floor time the microphones are open. I am 
having a difficult time hearing the intervention of the hon. member. 
I ask you to keep that in mind.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate that.
<P>
	As I said before, we simply cannot deal with young offenders 
and make sure they do not reoffend if they go back to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14977"> 14977 </A></B>
<P>
environment they were in before, regardless  of how much money 
is poured into counselling and counselling services.
<P>
	A better idea is to incarcerate them for a longer time in an area 
away from their former environment where they can focus on work 
and education in a disciplined environment. It is essential to 
remove them from their former environment if we are to ensure 
these kids do not become adult offenders in the future. A ounce of 
prevention is a pound of cure. It is a worthwhile investment in our 
time. It need not cost us more money but it is something we 
desperately need to look at now.
<P>
	We have to look at a new approach for dealing with crime and 
punishment. Oftentimes we see the precursors to criminal 
behaviour very early on. They are often rooted in cases in which 
there is a terrible environment of violent sexual abuse and neglect. 
These children need to be identified and picked up very early on.
<P>
	Furthermore, it would serve many departments well if they were 
to work in collaboration with the educational department, 
particularly grade school, in trying to identify families at risk, by 
bringing the parents into the educational system so that they can 
also learn the fundamental aspects of being a good parent and what 
is considered to be reasonable behaviour. They in turn can help 
when the kids go home and the children will have an environment 
that will be conducive to building the pillars of a normal psyche.
<P>
	There has been some interesting work done on this in a number 
of areas. The early data show that this is a very worthwhile 
investment of our time. If we can focus more on children when they 
are three, four and five and early on to identify families that are in 
crisis when a lady is pregnant, if we can have early intervention 
into these areas it will pay off in spades later on.
<P>
	Therefore I strongly implore the government to show a 
leadership role in working with its provincial counterparts to try to 
address these problems which will decrease the cost to our justice 
system, our social programs and make a healthier and safer society 
for all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member made a good speech in the sense that he set out, 
apparently very clearly, six or seven alternatives to the current bill.
<P>
	I am surprised he is not supporting the bill because all his 
colleagues know the bill goes some way to meeting the complaints 
they have raised regarding Canada's justice system. Yet because it 
does not go far enough, they say they are going to vote against it, 
which has to be the silliest logic I have ever heard. I will set that 
aside for a moment.
<P>
	I want to talk about the six or seven points that he raised. 
Frankly, they were sugar coated. I think he will admit that because 
although he said he wanted to look at  sentencing again, he wanted 
to revise sentencing here and he wanted to change the rules there to 
make things a little different, the underlying message in almost 
every one of his points was that he wanted people locked up more 
often and for longer.
<P>
	At the very end of his speech, having said nothing whatsoever 
about the cost of incarceration of inmates or persons in prison, he 
said: ``Of course if we did these other things we would reduce the 
cost of the system''. However, if he does all of the things he listed 
at the beginning he will increase the costs enormously. To 
incarcerate an inmate in maximum security costs something like 
$60,000 a year. It is an extremely expensive process.
<P>
	What will he do to reduce the cost of the justice system? He says 
the government is spending too much money. The Reform Party 
has as its policy drastic cuts. Where will it cut in our justice system 
if it is to keep throwing people in jail or keeping them there for 
much longer?
<P>
	I urge the hon. member to come to Kingston and tour the prisons. 
I will be glad to show him around. I think he would benefit from 
learning the way our justice system works and that part of the 
purpose of the justice system is to rehabilitate offenders so when 
they are released they do not reoffend. We have had remarkable 
success, quite frankly, in that. The hon. member should be pointing 
out those successes and giving figures.
<P>
	If the member looked at the day parole statistics, for example, 
and he talked about the evils of letting people out early in their 
sentence on day parole, he would find that over 95 per cent of 
them-possibly 98 per cent but I do not have my little book here to 
recite the figures for him-or more are successful. It is a very 
successful program. It works and it helps reintegrate inmates into 
the community which is important for the long term development 
of our communities. We just cannot spring somebody at the end of 
a 20-year sentence and expect them to readjust to life outside. 
People lead a different life in there.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	I am not saying that incarceration is not necessary. It is in certain 
cases. However it is not necessary to lock everybody up for life 
which is what the Reform Party seems to be urging.
<P>
	Will the hon. member take a tour of prisons in Kingston and 
learn something about our prison system before his next speech on 
the subject? I know the hon. member for Wild Rose has done that. I 
congratulate him for it but obviously it did not work.
<P>
	Finally, with respect to his own points, will he admit that what he 
was proposing would drastically increase costs for our prison 
system and greatly increase sentences for offenders in Canada?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14978"> 14978 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to bring the hon. member back for a reality check.
<P>
	I used to be a correctional officer and I also worked for seven 
years in both adult and young offender jails. I have a little 
experience on these issues.
<P>
	If the hon. member wants to cut costs, I will give him a concrete 
way to cut hundreds of millions of dollars from the budget every 
year. One-third of all individuals incarcerated today are there for 
non-payment of fines. Those are the facts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Nonsense. Not in federal prisons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, these 
individuals should not be in jail. The people who should be 
incarcerated are those who have proven to be a threat to society, 
who have victimized innocent civilians, usually in a violent 
fashion.
<P>
	There is a trade-off here. Should we save money by discharging 
people into the community who would pose a threat to society, or 
should we tell the Canadian public that its rights and safety are the 
most important things? I believe everyone in the House would 
think the latter. The member's point with respect to saving money 
is perfectly valid and I have given him a very concrete reason for 
doing this.
<P>
	He mentioned that I did not know anything about the costs. It is 
$60,000 a year for an inmate in a federal penitentiary and $90,000 
for a youth in a young offender institution. That is too much money.
<P>
	We have been presenting solutions on how to get inmates to 
work for their keep which in turn would cut costs. Again we must 
get those individuals who are violent offenders and who might be a 
threat to society and those who are incarcerated for non-payment of 
fines to work for their keep.
<P>
	Another thing the hon. member mentioned was recidivism rates. 
The recidivism rate is 33 per cent for adults on parole. What is the 
recidivism rate for adults once they are off parole? No one can give 
me those figures. One thing is for sure, it has to be higher than 33 
per cent.
<P>
	With regard to young offenders, the recidivism rate is 40 per cent 
to 50 per cent. Those are the facts. That number is far too great. 
Obviously a 40 per cent or 50 per cent recidivism rate does not 
serve society and it certainly does not serve the kids who are young 
offenders very well.
<P>
	We have to find a better way. I hope the hon. member will look at 
some of the concrete suggestions I have made which do not 
necessarily need to cost more if they are organized properly. I know 
members in this party would be happy to help anyone on the other 
side to make our justice system better for all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to follow up on the question raised and the answer given by the 
hon. member.
<P>
	First, people are not in federal penitentiaries for non-payment of 
fines. It is important for people to fundamentally understand that 
and not to allow the red herring being thrown out by the Reform 
Party to confuse the issue.
<P>
	Second, the member mentioned that he worked in the justice 
system with young offenders and adults for seven years. I have 
worked in that system and I also worked with young offenders, 
adults, victims and victims' groups for 20 years. The hon. 
member's example of not incarcerating people for their inability to 
pay fines was addressed in Bill C-41.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	That is something the hon. member with his colleagues voted 
against. We on this side and the government supported it. It is 
important for people to understand that there is the option now 
where somebody does not get incarcerated because they are unable 
to pay a fine. If they refuse to do the alternative, then they get 
incarcerated. That is a correction which was made to the sentencing 
process and which was long overdue.
<P>
	The member for Wild Rose, a member of the party who 
promised to do things differently, calls that socialism. I am amazed 
at the shallowness of the member's understanding on this very 
complicated issue.
<P>
	There is a very important point to be made. I wish my colleague 
from the islands would put his mind to it that prisons are very 
expensive, federal penitentiaries being even more expensive.
<P>
	Surely the people in prison should be relegated there because 
they are a danger to the community and are not able to follow the 
conditions of their probation or parole for other crimes. Surely the 
member would agree that prisons should be reserved first and 
foremost for the small numbers who are a threat to public safety 
and second for those people who are given alternative options, say, 
for a property offence and not making restitution, not following the 
probation order then of course one cannot do much else but enforce 
the law that way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very happy the hon. member agrees with us. I hope he crosses the 
floor on this bill.
<P>
	We believe individuals in a federal penitentiary should be those 
who pose a threat to society. There are many ways one can argue a 
threat. There are threats in terms of violence and also threats in 
terms of those individuals who wilfully cause damage in other 
fashions to individuals. It is not only individuals who have been 
incarcerated for violent offences.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14979"> 14979 </A></B>
<P>
	I hope the hon. member will work with us in devising new and 
innovative ways in which we can actually decrease the costs by 
not necessarily having individuals incarcerated in expensive, 
closed custody, federal penitentiaries. We want new ways in which 
we can send a clear message of deterrence to criminals, make sure 
that there is a penalty for individuals who are committing an 
offence, to deal with the issue we have been trying to deal with 
in trying to garner some restitution for the victims and the state, 
and ensure that individuals will not continue to reoffend.
<P>
	We can identify the reasons why they reoffend, address those 
reasons and provide individuals with the ability and wherewithal to 
become a productive employed member of society. If we work 
together on these issues, we will make Canada a safer place.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in the House today at third reading of Bill C-45 to address the 
principles, objectives and effects of the legislative changes 
proposed by Bill C-45.
<P>
	From the outset, let the record show that the people of my riding 
of Central Nova support the principles and objectives of Bill C-45. 
My constituents appreciate the government's response to the 
legitimate concerns of all Canadians who are demanding a higher 
standard of public protection from high risk, violent offenders.
<P>
	The proposed government reforms as set forth in Bill C-45 will 
restore public confidence, close gaps in the corrections system and 
respond directly to identified shortcomings in our present system to 
give further protection to our children.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	The legislative changes introduced in Bill C-45 require 
amendments to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, the 
Criminal Code of Canada, the Criminal Records Act, the Prisons 
and Reformatories Act and the Transfer of Offenders Act. The 
legislative changes in Bill C-45 are clearly in the best interests of 
all Canadians.
<P>
	In my riding of Central Nova, many constituents, the police, 
parents, the public at large and organizations, including the newly 
formed organization of Child Safe of Pictou County, have raised 
time and time again legitimate concerns regarding sex offences 
against children. The purpose of Child Safe of Pictou County is to 
educate the public, to promote a sexual abuse free environment for 
children and to enhance the services for sexually abused children. 
These services are provided by an organization that certainly has 
the best interests of our children at heart. Therefore they applaud 
this legislation.
<P>
	For the information of my constituents, Bill C-45 introduces 
legislative provisions that will make it easier to detain sex 
offenders who victimize children in penitentiary until the end of 
their sentences by removing the requirement that serious harm 
must be established as a criterion for detention in these cases.
<P>
	Let me emphasize the government recognizes that all sexual 
offences are serious. The current Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act already authorizes the National Parole Board to detain 
offenders beyond the normal statutory release point if they are 
considered likely to commit an offence causing death or serious 
harm before the end of their sentence.
<P>
	The vulnerability of individual victims is an important 
consideration in any release or detention decision. However the 
effectiveness of current legislation is limited because the serious 
harm criterion is difficult to establish in cases involving children.
<P>
	Experience has shown that unlike cases involving adult victims, 
it is often difficult to establish serious harm where the child victim 
must provide the evidence because often the child cannot articulate 
the personal impact of the experience. Further, research has shown 
that the impact of such a crime on a child may not always become 
evident until many years later.
<P>
	The legislative changes in Bill C-45 are in keeping with the 
government's desire to improve the protection of our children from 
high risk violent offenders and sex offenders. Bill C-45, in its 
treatment of the definition of serious harm for sex offences against 
children, will require the National Parole Board only to establish 
that a sex offence was committed which victimized a child and that 
a further sexual offence against a child is likely to be committed 
after release. This legislative change is long overdue and is 
welcomed by our Canadian families which hold sacred the security 
and protection of the person of all children in our country of 
Canada.
<P>
	In addition to the prolonged detention of sex offenders and high 
risk violent offenders the government has introduced a legislative 
change to enhance and expand treatment programs for child sex 
offenders while in penitentiary. Correctional Service Canada 
presently carries out institutional treatment for sex offenders but 
resources are limited. The introduction of additional resources 
would strengthen treatment programs and are intended to improve 
public safety.
<P>
	Speaking of public safety, in my capacity as member of 
Parliament I had the opportunity in May to visit the maximum 
security penitentiary in Renous, New Brunswick. For those who are 
familiar with this institution, it was here in May 1989 that Allan 
Legere escaped custody, committed four murders in the community 
and was then recaptured in November 1989. This was certainly a 
tragedy for that community.
<P>
	Since 1989 considerable improvements have been made to this 
maximum security facility. The present warden, Mr. Jon Klaus, 
provided me with an opportunity to meet the correctional services 
staff, to visit with inmates and to see firsthand the maximum 
security institution. I was impressed with the high level of security 
and the latest surveillance technology being utilized at that facility.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14980"> 14980 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	The penitentiary concentrated on rehabilitation, upgrading, 
training, counselling, and there was segregation of high risk violent 
offenders from the other inmates. There is no question about it, 
Renous is a maximum security penitentiary that is state of the art. It 
provides the inmates with comfort, security, and every opportunity 
to rehabilitate their criminal behaviour. At the same time, it exists 
to protect the public from high risk offenders.
<P>
	The criminal justice system and the penal correction system are 
interrelated. The general public must come to understand that it is 
the judiciary that has judicial discretion to impose sentences upon 
high risk and dangerous offenders, while Correctional Service 
Canada and its officials and staff are charged with the custody and 
rehabilitation of the high risk violent offenders while incarcerated. 
Then it is the National Parole Board that has the authority to release 
these offenders from detention.
<P>
	The success of our criminal justice system and our penal 
correction system does not primarily rely on legislation. The 
fundamental success of our criminal justice system relies on the 
ability of man to administer justice without abuse of authority and 
power and the ability of man to administer justice coupled with 
equity and mercy.
<P>
	Justice, law and morality are inseparable. If a moral society 
existed there would be no need for criminal sanction. It is a 
requirement of this criminal sanction in our society that 
necessitates this government to deter, to punish, to rehabilitate its 
members of society.
<P>
	It is the human element that determines the success or failure of 
our criminal justice system and our penal correction system. The 
human element includes ourselves as individuals who are expected 
to be law-abiding citizens; the community at large, which develops 
public opinion; the role of our law enforcers, which is to enforce 
law; the role of our prosecutors administering justice within the 
system; the role of defence counsel defending and protecting the 
rights of the accused; the role of the judiciary rendering a decision; 
the role of our probation officers, psychologists, social workers, 
health care professionals, penal institution employees, our 
clergymen regarding the rehabilitation of the accused; and the role 
of us here today, the legislators enacting the law.
<P>
	In my 18 years of practice as a litigation lawyer I have 
experienced firsthand the oppression, manipulation, and abuse of 
many people arising from the abuse of power, abuse of authority, 
and abuse of the process within the systems of government. These 
abuses I am referring to not only are in relation to the victims of 
crimes, but also in many cases the accused defendant as well.
<P>
	It can be legitimately argued that the system of government is 
not working as it should. The legislative,  the executive, and the 
judicial branches of government require reform from time to time 
to ensure justice and equity are meted out to all Canadians.
<P>
	With respect to the legislative branch of government, it is time 
we as legislators put responsibility and morality back into the law. 
Justice, law and morality go hand in hand. They are inseparable.
<P>
	With respect to the executive branch of government, which 
administers the law, it is time to diminish the authority, power, and 
discretion of the bureaucracy and make it more accountable for 
decisions and attitudes that affect individual Canadians.
<P>
	With respect to the judicial branch of government, which 
interprets and enforces the law, it is time that consideration be 
given to electing our judiciary. The people must live with the 
decisions of courts. Therefore, it is time we give consideration to 
electing those who make these decisions.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	Constituents of Central Nova have also raised the issue 
concerning the jurisdiction, power, and authority of the National 
Parole Board, an administrative tribunal with immense power and 
authority in relation to our high risk offenders. It is submitted that 
the government should seriously give consideration to ensuring 
maximum public input in the selection process of the National 
Parole Board members and that this selection process should be 
opened to public scrutiny. This legislation is not intended to 
address this issue.
<P>
	Bill C-45 does establish a mechanism for the discipline of the 
National Parole Board members. The Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act is to be amended to allow the chairperson of the 
National Parole Board to report situations to the solicitor general 
that cause concern about the appropriateness of a board member's 
conduct or performance. Then if the minister agrees, a judge will 
conduct an inquiry focusing on whether the board member had met 
the responsibilities of the position. Grounds for the inquiry include 
incapacitation, misconduct, failure to execute duties, and being 
placed in a position incompatible with the execution of the 
member's duties. A judge could recommend that a member be 
suspended without pay, be removed from office, or he could 
recommend other remedial measures. This recommendation would 
be put before the governor in council.
<P>
	The proposed mechanism will be modelled on a process found in 
the Immigration Act for the Immigration and Refugee Board. This 
enhanced accountability will be supported by increased training for 
the National Parole Board members in risk assessment and 
management of high risk sex and violent offenders.
<P>
	Presently it should be noted that there is no formal mechanism 
for the discipline or removal from office of any National Parole 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14981"> 14981 </A></B>
<P>
Board member in specified  circumstances. Therefore, Bill C-45 is 
implementing legislation that is necessary in Canada today.
<P>
	It is respectfully submitted that this discipline mechanism is 
imperative. However, it is further submitted that until a procedure 
for appointments to the National Parole Board is subject to 
maximum input from the general public at large in the selection 
process of appointees, there will be continued problems and a 
continual public outcry for the decisions that are being made by the 
National Parole Board. Likewise, it is submitted that it is time we 
give consideration that our judiciary-the decision makers, the 
interpreters of law, the imposers of sentences after 
conviction-should be elected to their positions by the public at 
large.
<P>
	I further support the additional legislative proposals in Bill C-45 
and in particular the legislative change that will modify the system 
of sentence calculation to ensure that all offenders on conditional 
release who receive new custodial sentences are returned to 
custody and that all offenders serve at least one-third of a new 
consecutive sentence before being eligible to be considered for 
release.
<P>
	In addition, I support Bill C-45's expansion of the list of offences 
for which an offender could be referred for detention until the end 
of sentence. These offences would include serious drinking and 
driving and criminal negligence offences that result in bodily harm 
or death, criminal harassment, also known as stalking, and 
conspiracy to commit serious drug offences.
<P>
	A further legislative proposal in Bill C-45 I support is to broaden 
the authority of Correctional Service Canada to make deductions 
from an offender's income to help offset a portion of an offender's 
room and board costs.
<P>
	It is without question that the positive changes proposed to be 
implemented in Bill C-45 have my support and the support of my 
constituents. I am urging all hon. colleagues to lend their support at 
third reading to Bill C-45.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
pleased to hear that speech. I was pleased especially because the 
hon. member kept referring to the fact that her constituents were in 
support of the bill. We do not hear that very often from that side of 
the House, so I appreciate hearing it. That is what it is all about.
<P>
	The hon. member suggested that we ought to consider electing 
judges. I wonder if she might expound on that a bit more. Should it 
possibly go further and apply to other positions in the government 
that are traditionally appointed positions?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Skoke:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is certainly not the first time I have 
raised the issue in the House of giving serious consideration to the 
election of our judiciary.
<P>
	I realize that appointment of our judiciary from our barrister 
societies and from our law profession across the country has been 
the tradition. However, I am calling on the government to give 
serious consideration to the fact that the responsibility the judiciary 
has is very important. Over the last two years that I have been in the 
House of Commons we have seen the effect judicial decisions have 
on what we enact in law and how we respond to the precedents they 
set.
<P>
	Also, we understand that the role of the judiciary is not only to 
enforce the law as it comes before them, but to interpret the law. 
Those judges are in positions of trust and their decisions affect the 
daily lives of individuals. In my mind, I feel it is imperative that we 
move forward and take the necessary steps to ensure that our 
judiciary is elected by the public at large.
<P>
	With respect to administrative tribunals and appointments to 
boards, I have some reservations with respect to board 
appointments and the selection process and also the functions of 
those boards. That is due to the fact that administrative tribunals do 
have a judicial function and a role to play in the country, and an 
appeal of the decisions administrative tribunals make is very 
difficult. Appeals can only be made in the event there is an error in 
law on the face of the record. Therefore, they are primarily 
predicated on ensuring that natural justice takes place at the board 
level. It goes without saying that the appointments to the boards are 
of crucial importance to our country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I came to 
the House I had strong hopes that I could support legislation that 
was moving in the right direction. Bill C-45, I admit, does just that.
<P>
	I would like to be able to vote for the bill. I would like to be able 
to stand in the House and say the government is doing an excellent 
job with Bill C-45. However, like my colleague from 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, I look at the bill from a slightly different 
perspective.
<P>
	I do not want to talk about myself, so let me talk about the hon. 
member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca. As was mentioned in his 
answer, he is an individual who has had experience in the prison 
system. He served for some seven years as an officer and dealt 
directly with criminals. He also has had occasion in his life to be on 
the receiving end of the results of violence. He has dealt with raped 
kids. He has dealt with lacerations. He has dealt with gunshot 
wounds. He has dealt with body bags. He has served in an 
emergency department of a very busy community hospital. He has 
consequently dealt more with victims than I think most individuals 
have. I am afraid he approaches this bill with that perspective: 
Does it go far enough for victims?
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	I do not think it does and I am going to reflect on a couple of very 
specific parts of the bill. The first part is  how sexual offenders are 
treated under the bill. It attempts to improve the sentencing for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14982"> 14982 </A></B>
<P>
sexual offenders. It takes a child who has been sexually assaulted 
and gives the offender, because when it is a child harm does not 
have to be proven but presumed, the full sentence. I say great. How 
could a physician argue with a full sentence for a sexual assault on 
a child? Great.
<P>
	However, it goes on to state that an adult who is sexually 
assaulted and has serious harm must prove the harm. That is wrong. 
There is no serious sexual assault committed on a man or a woman 
that does not have serious harm.
<P>
	In my own practice I had a 47-year old woman who originally 
came from South Africa. She had problems in her life: depression, 
anxieties, suicidal impulses, a host of serious problems. She had 
unhappiness in her marriage and had actually attempted suicide at 
one point in her life. Over a fairly long period of counselling with 
this lovely, sweet woman, her story was told. It came out in a way 
that is difficult to describe publicly, but she told how how she had 
been sexually assaulted in her youth by a member of her family. 
She had been unable throughout her life to ever divulge that to 
anyone. With tears streaming down her cheeks, with anguish in her 
heart, shaking and miserable, she divulged that to me.
<P>
	What had that done to her, that one single episode of sexual 
assault in her life? She had frigidity in her marriage. She was 
unable to respond properly to affection. She was distant to her male 
children. She could not get close to her boys. She was fine with her 
little girl who she gave love and affection, but she could never ever 
respond properly to her boys, the children she bore.
<P>
	I mentioned the depression and the anxiety. The end result was a 
broken marriage. She never got over that assault. That proves to me 
that a sexual assault on a child is devastating.
<P>
	I have also had the opportunity, over and over again, to deal with 
sexual assault on young women and young men. It is not commonly 
known that sexual assault takes place against young men as well. 
There is not one single instance in any of those assaults that the 
assaults were harmless.
<P>
	To have to prove harm when sexually assaulted is wrong. There 
is no excuse and no reason to have to prove physical harm, none.
<P>
	The second issue in this bill is the way drunken driving is 
handled. I am a teetotaller. I do not drink. I am a fellow who 
believes alcohol can have harmful effects. Many of my chums have 
a beer or two and do not have a problem. However, drunken driving 
is considered to be a very serious problem in our society. Damage 
to someone when drunk is treated with vigour.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	This bill says that serious injury due to drunken driving demands 
the full sentence. It will come down hard on those individuals that 
drive when they are drunk and hurt someone. However, an adult 
woman hurt seriously by a pervert once again has to prove harm 
with no necessity of a full sentence. There is an inconsistency in 
this law in this regard.
<P>
	On one hand we have a premeditated perverted act. On the other 
hand we have a disease. Surely we understand that alcohol and the 
problems with alcohol are treatable and can be righted. On the 
other hand, we have perversion that generally cannot be treated.
<P>
	There is a medical treatment for sexual perverts which is very 
specific. However, in our society we do not contemplate castration 
for a sexual pervert. I also want to bring to the attention of 
members and those who are watching that even if an individual 
who has a sexual perversion decides he wants to be surgically or 
medically castrated, he cannot.
<P>
	There was a recent case of a sexual criminal in Quebec. He said: 
``I know that I am going to reoffend''. He requested of his 
physician to have those impulses taken away. He said: ``I want to 
have my hormones changed so this will no longer be the case''. Not 
a chance; it cannot be done. Human rights activists come along and 
say he cannot even make such a decision on his own.
<P>
	I believe in our society. We have constantly talked about not 
having solutions for problems. I raise this specifically as a solution 
for certain sexual crimes for certain sexual criminals. It is quite 
possible to make a little incision and inject a tiny amount of 
medication repetitively in the arm of an individual who has these 
sexual problems and stop the perversion. Give protection to our 
children. Give protection to our mothers and yes, protection to our 
sons.
<P>
	I have another specific solution. I have heard from a number of 
members opposite that Reformers would like to throw everybody 
in the clink and toss away the key. There are a number of young 
offenders that do not need incarceration of any kind.
<P>
	In my own community I asked practical, solid citizens: ``What 
would you do to prevent a youngster from recreating their criminal 
behaviour''. I am going to propose an idea that has come to me 
from these sensible common folk. They do not want to give these 
young people a job that will take work out of the workforce. They 
want to give them a job that is hard physically but does not take 
work and money from somebody that has done nothing wrong. 
What sort of a job is there like that? The job they came up with is 
rock picking.
<P>
	I live in an area where there has been a little glacial activity. 
Every time the farmers in my community plough up their fields 
they turn up a new bed of rocks. Young men and women that have 
done wrong should be rock  pickers. They should go through the 
fields, pick the rocks, pile them on the side. Nice rocks might be 
usable by a mason for fireplaces. The next year the farmer ploughs 
the fields up again and guess what? More rocks appear. There are

	In my part of the community we freeze in the winter and rock 
picking does not work well then. I have other ideas about what they 
could do in the winter but I will stop there.
<P>
	There is one more solution for victims. Remember that I come 
down harsh on the criminal and really easy on the victim. This bill 
does not do that. Thirty per cent of a prisoner's income going to 
treatment of victims would do a lot for a women such as I 
described. She could not afford a psychologist. She could not 
afford to do anything but go to her family physician for 
counselling. Time and space are very limited for that. She could 
well have been helped by restitution from the person who harmed 
her. These solutions would improve the bill.
<P>
	I have listened to members opposite say: ``You do not like 
everything in the bill. It is going on the right direction. Support it''. 
I ask members opposite, how did they vote when this exact same 
bill came before the last Parliament? The record shows they voted 
against the law and order bill that was presented by the Tories. 
Reformers are saying this is a bill moving in the right direction, 
some parts of it flawed, some parts fair.
<P>
	We are saying to the Canadian public as plainly as we can, until 
the rights of the victims are placed well above the rights of the 
perverts and the criminals there will never be satisfaction with our 
justice system.

	The House resumed from September 26 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-94, an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and 
the importation for commercial purposes of certain manganese 
based substances, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I remind the House as we 
resume debate on Bill C-94 that we are at the stage of debate during 
which members have a maximum of 10 minutes without questions 
and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am proud today to speak on Bill C-94, the manganese 
based fuel additives act. This bill is intended to prohibit the 
importation and interprovincial trade of MMT, a manganese based 
additive to unleaded gasoline. The law will take effect 60 days after 
royal assent.
<P>
	Canada is one of the only countries in the world that is using 
MMT. The United States banned MMT in 1978. Only Bulgaria and 
Argentina are considering using MMT.
<P>
	Environment Canada has received and reviewed study after 
study after study of the effects of MMT on this equipment. I agree 
with our Deputy Prime Minister and with Ford, Chrysler, General 
Motors, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, BMW, Volkswagen, Volvo, the list 
goes on, that MMT adversely affects the sophisticated onboard 
diagnostic systems where the pollution control equipment is found.
<P>
	These systems are extremely important for the environment. 
They are responsible for monitoring the vehicle's emission controls 
and for alerting the driver to malfunctions. They ensure the cleaner 
burning engines of today and tomorrow operate as designed. They 
ensure automobiles are properly maintained resulting in decreased 
tailpipe emissions and improved fuel economy. Therefore this is a 
very important technology. It is even more important that it works 
and that it does its job. We will make sure it does.
<P>
	To ensure this technology works it must be free from MMT. 
OBD systems are designed to monitor the performance of pollution 
control systems, in particular the catalysts, and alert the driver to 
malfunctions. If the OBD system is not functioning because of 
MMT and if the catalyst is not working at all, tailpipe emissions 
could be increased up to 40 times.
<P>
	The third party has suggested that MMT reduces NOx emissions 
by 20 per cent. However this reduction is based  on data collected 
by Ethyl from test cars. When examined in the context of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14984"> 14984 </A></B>
<P>
current Canadian fleet, Environment Canada analysis indicates that 
NOx reduction would only be 5 per cent.
<P>
	The third party has asked why the minister did not try to 
negotiate an agreement between the two parties. I can assure the 
House the government has been working since 1985 to broker a 
solution. Senior departmental officials from environment, 
transport, industry and natural resources have worked with senior 
representatives from the petroleum and automotive industries for 
several years in an effort to resolve this issue.
<P>
	More recently the Deputy Prime Minister attempted to negotiate 
an agreement between these industries. She met with 
representatives of the petroleum industry on two separate 
occasions. The Deputy Prime Minister was prepared to support the 
introduction of a green pump containing MMT free fuel in an effort 
to resolve this issue. The petroleum industry rejected this approach.
<P>
	It is now time to act. If we do not act now then the federal 
government's vehicle emission reduction programs will be in 
jeopardy. We risk missing out on major reductions in smog, carbon 
monoxide and hydrocarbons. If we do not act now, Canadian 
consumers will be prevented from taking advantage of state of the 
art emissions reduction technologies simply because they do not 
have access to MMT free gasoline.
<P>
	If we do not act now, we could face a situation where automakers 
will be forced to turn off the diagnostic systems scheduled for 1996 
models because of the damage MMT causes. General Motors is 
already bringing models off the assembly line with some of the 
onboard diagnostic functions disconnected. GM, like others, is no 
longer prepared to assume the increased warranty risks for damage 
caused to pollution control equipment.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	In the end Canadian motorists will have to pay more to have their 
cars maintained because of this kind of industry action. We as a 
government will not let this happen. We will not allow the buck to 
be passed to the Canadian consumers. We will not allow 
anti-pollution equipment in Canada to be less effective than 
anti-pollution equipment in the United States. We will not allow 
the competitiveness of our auto industry to be threatened. We will 
not allow investment and the thousands of Canadian jobs which 
depend on this investment to be put in jeopardy.
<P>
	Let us be clear. The job of reducing motor vehicle pollution can 
no longer be addressed just by the auto industry, the petroleum 
industry or the government. Progress at reducing vehicle pollution 
demands action by all.
<P>
	The petroleum industry needs to keep making improvements in 
the composition and properties of the fuels the engines burn. The 
auto industry needs to keep  making improvements in vehicle 
emissions control technologies such as those offered through 
onboard diagnostic systems.
<P>
	Preventive action means producing goods more cleanly. It means 
using less energy and conserving our natural resources. It means 
developing and using the latest green technologies, like the 
emissions reduction technologies in today's cars and trucks.
<P>
	This bill before the House is one measure of prevention. This bill 
is pro environment, pro consumer, pro business. Eighteen of 
Canada's automaking companies think we are doing the right thing. 
Canadians think we are doing the right thing.
<P>
	MMT can no longer stand in the way of the progress we continue 
to make on vehicle emissions reduction and environmental 
protection. Let us protect jobs, protect investment, protect 
consumers and protect the environment. Let us make Canada the 
last country in the world to use MMT.

	The House resumed from September 25 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-93, an act to amend the Cultural Property Export 
and Import Act, the Income Tax Act and the Tax Court of Canada 
Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee; and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great 
pleasure to speak on Bill C-93. As a background to this legislation, 
the purpose of the bill is to amend the Cultural Property Export and 
Import Act with consequential amendments to the Income Tax Act 
and the Tax Court of Canada Act, to establish an appeal of 
determination by the Canadian Cultural Property Export Review 
Board of the fair market value of certified cultural properties.
<P>
	Going back a little, in December 1991 the responsibility for 
determining the fair market value of cultural property donated to 
designated Canadian museums, art galleries and libraries was 
transferred from Revenue Canada Taxation to the review board. 
The review board assumed this new responsibility at a meeting 
which was held sometime in January 1992.
<P>
	There was no provision for appeal of review board decisions 
included in the legislative amendment despite the fact that the right 
of appeal existed when this responsibility was with Revenue 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	Donors and custodial institutions expressed serious concern 
about the lack of an appeal mechanism. As a result the Department 
of Canadian Heritage, in co-operation with the review board, 
undertook a series of consultations with the community about the 
need for an appeal process. As a result of these consultations it was 
agreed that a legislative amendment should be prepared to establish 
the right of appeal to the Tax Court of Canada.
<P>
	The bill gives a donor or a custodial institution the right to 
request that the review board reconsider its initial determination of 
fair market value. If after receiving a redetermination from the 
board the donor is still not satisfied, he or she may take the second 
step of appealing the board decision to the Tax Court of Canada.
<P>
	There are a number of items in the legislation I would like to 
share with my colleagues. The Cultural Property Export and Import 
Act provides tax benefits to encourage donations to public 
institutions of objects and collections of outstanding significance 
and national importance.
<P>
	It is the only program of the Government of Canada that 
provides financial support through tax credits for  donations to 
museums, art galleries, archives and libraries. Museums, art 
galleries, archives and libraries in every province and territory of 
Canada will benefit through the receipt of donations of cultural 
property as a result of the tax credits.
<P>
	Cultural property valued at approximately $60 million is 
donated to Canadian institutions each year. The fair market value 
of cultural property certified by the review board as a result of the 
legislation will become eligible for a tax credit of 17 per cent on the 
first $200 and 29 per cent on the balance if it is over $200.
<P>
	The donor can claim the fair market value of the gift up to the 
total amount of his or her net income, and there is no tax payable on 
any capital gain resulting from the gift. There is a cap and the cap is 
the total income of the individual on an annual basis.
<P>
	Because a donor receives a tax credit the amount of money 
realized as a result of the donation is approximately 50 per cent of 
the fair market value. The donor does not therefore receive a tax 
refund equivalent to the fair market value of the gift.
<P>
	Donors, museums, art galleries and professional associations 
have been lobbying for the right to appeal review board decisions 
as it was perceived that the lack of an appeal was a denial of natural 
justice. To that end the government has taken action.
<P>
	The establishment of an appeal should be viewed as a 
reinstatement of the right of appeal that was lost when the 
responsibility for determining fair market value was transferred to 
the review board back in 1991. The amendments will ensure that 
donors who disagree with determinations of the review board will 
have the right of appeal to the court and will not be denied natural 
justice.
<P>
	The announcement of the establishment of an appeal process was 
received positively by donors, museums, art dealers and the media. 
These amendments therefore enjoy a high level of public support.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	The amendments are technical in nature and respond to strong 
concerns expressed by the heritage community. Their passage into 
law should be seen as part of the ongoing commitment of the 
Government of Canada to ensure the preservation of Canadian 
heritage.
<P>
	Bill C-93 has dealt with all the concerns in communities and all 
wishes of different art galleries, museums, libraries and similar 
institutions. All those concerns have been studied and legislation 
that responds to them in a positive way has been brought forward.
<P>
	It is a perfect example that the government is willing to listen to 
the concerns of the people, that the government is willing to take 
action, and that the government has taken action on an issue of 
national importance and of great concern to the art community of 
Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14986"> 14986 </A></B>
<P>
	I congratulate all those who have made representations to the 
Department of Canadian Heritage, my colleagues in the House of 
Commons, the committees and the administration through direct 
communication. I also thank all those who worked tirelessly to 
ensure the legislation would come before the House in a timely 
fashion.
<P>
	I am sure my colleagues on both sides of the House will stand to 
speak in support of the great initiative taken by the department of 
heritage. We truly believe that if somebody is willing to do good 
and give to a national institution such as a gallery, a library or a 
museum, the individual deserves the right to be recognized and to 
be given an incentive.
<P>
	This is why we made provision in the legislation to give a tax 
credit for any Canadian citizen, or for that matter a landed 
immigrant in Canada, who might have something of national 
significance to give as a gift to the crown. The individual will be 
given a tax credit of up to 17 per cent if the gift is worth less than 
$200 and up to 29 per cent of his or her annual income. I think that 
is fair. I call on people from coast to coast to coast who might have 
valuable items to consider giving them to museums and so forth.
<P>
	Some of my colleagues might have some points to make. This 
would be a most opportune time to put their points on the table so 
that we can deal with the legislation in a timely manner.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise to support the bill, an act to amend the Cultural 
Property Export and Import Act.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Hon. members opposite find this act a bit of a 
joke. I am sorry they think so. It is sad that they have moved 
amendments to delay adoption of the bill in the House. This 
surprises me because it shows they really do not care about 
Canada's cultural community with which the bill deals. If hon. 
members opposite gave two hoots about Canada's cultural 
community, they would not have moved all the amendments.
<P>
	I will read the amendment moved by the hon. member for 
Medicine Hat. I believe it is the second or third one; I have lost 
count. The amendment reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-93, an act to amend 
the Cultural Property Export and Import Act, the Income Tax Act and the Tax 
Court of Canada Act, since it fails to address the issue of the burden the tax 
credit system places on middle class taxpayers who are asked to pay for a 
potentially endless stream of donations of questionable cultural and artistic 
value claimed by wealthy Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	The amendments shows a complete disregard for Canada's 
cultural community because it says that the work of Canadian 
artists is worthless, that the  acquisitions of art by Canadians are 
worthless, and that these are ``donations of questionable cultural 
and artistic value''. That is what Reform Party members are saying. 
Those are the very words of their motion. That is what they are 
saying to Canadian artists and philanthropists involved in 
supporting Canada's artistic community. It is a disgrace.
<P>
	My hon. friend for Ottawa Centre will appreciate that I had 
occasion to go to Alberta in July of this year. One place I visited 
was the Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller. There are a lot of dinosaurs 
in that museum and I can say that the resemblance between some of 
the dinosaurs there and members of the Reform Party was 
absolutely striking. I could tell where their ancestors came from.
<P>
	I was very impressed with the Tyrrell Museum. It is one of 
Canada's cultural centres. It has an excellent collection. I enjoyed 
my visit immensely. I took a tour of the entire museum and I saw 
the workings of the very specialized people involved in the digs.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Hon. members opposite seem to be regarding this 
as bit of a joke. I do not find anything particularly funny about a 
tour of Canada's cultural industries. Hon. members opposite talk 
about deficit reduction and they forget that Canada's culture 
contributes mightily to our economy. They do not pay any attention 
to the fact that people spend billions of dollars a year attending 
artistic events, concerts of all kinds.
<P>
	These are the artists the bill is designed to assist. The bill 
promotes artistry and culture in Canada, and hon. members 
opposite are opposed to it. They keep moving amendments to delay 
its passage. Why are they opposed to it?
<P>
	Surely the member who represents Drumheller and sits on that 
side of the House is aware of the museum and its value in his 
community. It is a big drawing card for Drumheller. I have no 
doubt the bill will assist the museum in some of its work. Yet hon. 
members opposite attack the bill.
<P>
	What about the famous museums in Calgary? The city of 
Calgary is burdened with Reform representation in the House. 
These people cannot represent. Unfortunately, with no adequate 
representation in the House, members from Calgary are failing 
their very famous museum in Calgary, the Glenbow Museum. I 
have been to it.
<P>
	Hon. members opposite laugh and treat it as a cavalier matter 
when that museum is a major drawing card for the city of Calgary. 
The museum attracts tourists to Calgary to see the art and the other 
exhibits. Hon. members opposite should be ashamed of their 
mocking of Canada's cultural industries.
<P>
	What are the objectives of this very important piece of 
legislation? The bill amends the Cultural Property Export  and 
Import Act and related legislation to establish a process to appeal 
decisions by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14987"> 14987 </A></B>
<P>
the Canadian Cultural Property Export Review Board on the fair 
market value of certified cultural property. That is a significant 
change and it is not all for the benefit of the wealthy.
<P>
	Deals work both ways. The minister can also appeal if he thinks 
the valuation is wrong. Hon. members opposite fail to mention that 
in their amendments and in their speeches. Their only reason for 
doing so is that they are out to kill Canada's cultural industries.
<P>
	In the 1990 federal budget responsibility for determining the fair 
market value of cultural property donated to designated Canadian 
museums, art galleries and libraries was transferred from Revenue 
Canada to the review board. No provision for appeal of review 
board decisions was included in those amendments, despite the fact 
the right of appeal existed when the responsibility was with 
Revenue Canada. In other words, we are trying to get some fairness 
back in the system, fairness not just for the donor but also for the 
Government of Canada, which has a right of appeal in these cases.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Donors and custodial institutions have expressed serious concern 
about this lack of appeal process. It led the Department of Canadian 
Heritage, ably led by the hon. Minister of Canadian Heritage, in 
co-operation with the review board, to undertake a series of 
consultations with the community, which has resulted in this bill.
<P>
	Hon. members opposite think this bill was an idea conceived by 
the government acting on its own. Nothing can be further from the 
truth. As usual, the government consulted extensively with 
Canadians and came up with a process that is fair and reasonable. 
Accordingly, these amendments were prepared. There is a right of 
appeal established by this bill to the Tax Court of Canada. The 
creation of the appeal process is a reinstatement of a right of appeal 
lost in 1991 and a means of ensuring that there is no denial of 
natural justice.
<P>
	I know the words ``natural justice'' must be something difficult 
for members opposite to understand. We have been listening to 
them this morning talk about Bill C-45 and sentencing. Their 
notion of justice is wildly different from the notion of most other 
people in this country. The hon. member for Vancouver Quadra 
may have missed that part of the speech. I expect he was in 
committee this morning. All they want to do is lock people up and 
throw away the key. We heard about that.
<P>
	Unfortunately I missed the hon. member for Wild Rose's speech 
too. I understand it was a real blockbuster. As usual, it was the kind 
of speech that involves locking people up and throwing away the 
key. It is not a useful contribution, in my view, to the 
administration of justice or to the rehabilitation of offenders that 
we are all seeking.
<P>
	I want to return, as return I must, to Bill C-93, which after all is 
the subject of my remarks this afternoon.
<P>
	The government is committed to improving the collections of all 
Canadian cultural institutions through a combination of import 
controls to retain cultural property in Canada and tax incentives to 
encourage donations to designated institutions. This approach to 
cultural property preservation is acknowledged internationally as a 
model for other countries to follow. Canada is a world leader in that 
regard.
<P>
	When I was at the Tyrrell museum in Drumheller-and hon. 
members opposite ought to be supporting these institutions instead 
of tearing them down-I discovered there was a rule in Alberta 
prohibiting the export of fossils from Alberta. They could not be 
removed from the province. Hon. members opposite should be 
aware that kind of cultural legislation exists, not just at the federal 
level but also at the provincial level.
<P>
	In making it easier for individuals to appeal rulings and 
valuations to the tax court, the government is demonstrating its 
commitment to allow Canadians efficient access to the judicial 
system to challenge the decisions of government boards. This has 
been the policy of the government for many years. The policy of 
this party has been to favour fairness in treatment for all.
<P>
	We have striven for fairness in many ways. That has been 
evident in most of the legislation that has been introduced in this 
House, including the legislation that was debated so vigorously this 
morning, which hon. members dumped on because they wanted to 
lock people up and throw away the key.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, on the other hand, has been relatively silent 
today. I congratulate the hon. member for Longueuil-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member has indicated he does not want me to refer to 
what was said by members of his party about this bill. But I must, 
because they always argue that the province of Quebec does not 
receive enough funding for culture in this country. They are wrong. 
The hon. member knows perfectly well that the province of Quebec 
receives more-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> More than its share.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> -more than its share. Exactly. I thank the hon. 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine for his assistance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In any event, although Quebec makes up only 25 per cent of the 
Canadian population-it is a significant percentage and I should 
not say only-an average of 36 per cent of federal funds for 
cultural organizations were distributed in Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Thirty-six per cent of federal funds for cultural 
institutions were distributed in Quebec, including 37 per cent of the 
funds for Telefilm Canada, 40 per cent of the National Film Board 
funds, and 37 per cent of the funds for CBC. Let me perhaps repeat 
that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	My translation is not perfect. Although the province of Quebec 
represents only 25 per cent of the population, 36 per cent of federal 
funding for cultural organizations was distributed in this province, 
including 37 per cent for Telefilm Canada, 40 per cent for the 
National Film Board and 37 per cent for Radio-Canada. Imagine!
<P>
	If these figures are accurate, the hon. member has no reason to 
argue in this House that there is a problem with what the federal 
government does about culture in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	I realize that the hon. member for Témiscamingue, who chairs 
one of the organizing committees for the referendum in the 
province of Quebec and probably has quite a few problems on his 
plate right now, has his own views on the subject. If there are any 
museums in his riding, he should talk to his friends in the Reform 
Party who want to kill these museums. He probably wants to 
support them. If there is a museum, it will certainly get a lot of 
money from the federal government, because of the huge amounts 
the government is spending in his province.

	I urge the hon. member to recant his heresy, abandon the idea of 
separation, and jump on the bandwagon so that he can keep 
receiving all these benefits the museums in his constituency 
receive from the Government of Canada.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition, and I thank the member for 
Ottawa West for reminding me of this statement, declared before 
the Bélanger-Campeau commission
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	``One of the splendid achievements of the Canadian dream was 
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. We all know that our 
cultural roots developed largely thanks to and under the aegis of 
those cultural titans who worked at the CBC''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Leader of the Oppostion and the premier of Quebec are 
henchmen in leading the parade for the yes vote in Quebec. If he 
acknowledges that Canada has contributed so greatly, surely he 
ought to acknowledge that a little more often during the 
referendum debate. I have not heard him speaking on that subject. I 
do not understand it.
<P>
	Since the hon. member for Témiscamingue is here and hearing 
this, perhaps when he next speaks with his leader he could remind 
him of this statement and of the tremendous support Canada gives 
to cultural industries in Quebec and indeed elsewhere in the 
country.
<P>
	We in this party are proud to support Canada's cultural 
industries.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Let me wipe my tears.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member says he is about to break into 
tears. I can understand that because his party seems hell bent on the 
destruction of Canada's cultural industries.
<P>
	I am delighted that so many of my colleagues are here to show 
their support for Canada's cultural industries. I know the hon. 
member for Halifax attends cultural events in her community on a 
regular basis. She goes to concerts, to museums, to art galleries, 
and all these great things in Halifax. The hon. member for Ottawa 
West visits cultural events in this community. The hon. member for 
Windsor-St. Clair visits cultural events in her community. The 
hon. member for Saskatoon visits all kinds of cultural events and 
sites in his beautiful city of Saskatoon.
<P>
	This country is covered with excellent cultural facilities and has 
a tremendous number of very gifted artists. Hon. members in the 
Reform Party should be ashamed that they are trying to destroy that 
cultural heritage.
<P>
	Hon. members opposite may have received recently a diskette of 
the Juno award winners in Canada. Hon. members should realize 
that this kind of bill can assist in organizations that are distributing 
this kind of material in our country and promoting Canadian artists 
here and abroad. These are all part of the policies of the 
government that are supported by this Bill C-93.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	I urge hon. members opposite to abandon their position, support 
this bill, and let us get it passed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We have time for a very brief question and 
comment. The hon. member for Windsor-St. Clair.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if in two years or so some Liberals, perhaps under the 
leadership of the Prime Minister, were to travel to Wild Rose 
country, where there have been some sightings of dinosaurs, and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14989"> 14989 </A></B>
<P>
sneak up behind a couple of them and knock them off and then try 
to donate them to  a museum, how would this act work to allow us 
to have a tax credit for knocking off dinosaurs in Wild Rose 
country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to attempt to answer 
the hon. member's question.
<P>
	I do not claim to be an expert on the bill. Whether the bill would 
assist in knocking off dinosaurs, I do not know. One thing that will 
help will be the vote on this bill. If hon. members opposite vote 
against it, I am sure the electors in their constituencies will want to 
do their best to knock them off in the next election. We will look 
forward to that.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being almost 2 p.m., we will proceed to 
Statements by Members and hope the topics will be more up to date 
than the dinosaurs.

	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, AIDS is a problem we must all address. It has 
significant implications for public health, human rights, and 
impacts on our economy and our health and social service systems.
<P>
	Our government recognizes the tragic nature of the disease and 
has allocated $203.5 million over the next five years for education 
and prevention initiatives, for research and monitoring, and to help 
people living with this disease. The people directly involved know 
that even this generous support will not be enough.
<P>
	On October 1, for the first time the residents of the region of Peel

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, former 
Senator Arthur Tremblay has made it very clear he will vote yes in 
the upcoming referendum. From very start, this senior civil servant 
of the modern Quebec state helped develop and put in place the 
vital tools Quebecers gave themselves in the early 1960s under 
Jean Lesage's vision of ``Maîtres chez nous''.
<P>
	Hardened by his many years of experience and his knowledge of 
the workings of federal political machinery, Mr. Tremblay said it 
was no longer possible, within federalism as it exists, to recover the 
powers that Ottawa  had taken on over the years and that the time 
has now come for Quebec to take charge of its destiny.
<P>
	In Mr. Tremblay's words, if Quebec is to escape from trusteeship 
federalism and domination by a central government continually 
reinforced by the dynamics of the general powers it has given 
itself, sovereignty is the only option.

	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
week we were subjected to the gloating of government members 
over the re-election of Frank McKenna's Liberal government.
<P>
	Of course those members forgot to mention that the way 
Mr. McKenna is running his province proves that he is no longer 
pursuing a Liberal agenda. In Halifax two weeks ago the upper 
management of two major corporations told me that doing business 
with Frank McKenna's government is like doing business with a 
private enterprise corporation. They also confirmed that 
Mr. McKenna seems to have abandoned the old style tax and spend 
dependency programs of the Liberals.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	Clearly Mr. McKenna has joined the Reform wave that is 
washing Liberalism right out of provincial politics in every part of 
the country. Mr. McKenna is now running a Reform style 
government.
<P>
	Government members rarely credit their constituents with any 
intelligence, but our side of the House can see that the Reform 
message has been clearly received and understood by the voters of 
New Brunswick. If only Liberal members at the federal level had 
the same degree of understanding.

	Last year a crowd in excess of 100,000 people jammed Queen

<P>
	It is my understanding that in the very near future the minister 
will announce the details of the review: who the chairperson will 
be, how long the review will take and whether it will be held in 
public or in private.
<P>
	In the past I have called for the minister to establish an 
independent commission that would evaluate the performance and 
mandate of Canada Post on an ongoing basis. Rural and urban 
communities have been greatly affected by post office closures, 
privatization, community mailboxes, slow delivery and stamp and 
service price increases.
<P>
	Therefore, I urge the minister to ensure that the review recognize 
that service is important to the public and not use the results of the 
review only to justify further privatization and service reductions. 
The review should be held in public with cross-country public 
hearings and adequate time given for groups and individuals to 
make presentations.

development.
<P>
	When Reformers visit Atlantic Canada they say they will 
eliminate subsidies to stimulate business. However, what does the 
Liberal Party record say? The Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency invests in business. The government has eliminated grants 
and every $1 we invest in the economy has a $4 effect.
<P>
	When Reformers visit Atlantic Canada they say they want to get 
away from Ottawa-directed approaches. However, regional 
development in Atlantic Canada is just  that, regional and local. 
ACOA's 94 per cent success rate proves it is working.
<P>
	If the member for Fraser Valley West is an example, maybe 
Reformers do not really mean what they say when they visit 
Atlantic Canada, but Canadians cannot take that chance.
<P>
	Reform has proven that it does not understand Atlantic Canada, 
but the government is proving that regional development works.

united Canada work together and not engage in self-serving 
political opportunism.
<P>
	The questions raised by the Reform Party to the Prime Minister

	It would be in the Bloc member's interest to read again some

idea after all to finally define this new society referred to in the 
proposed agreement''.
<P>
	In his statement, Victor Lévy-Beaulieu concurs with 75 per cent 
of the people of Quebec who demand that the partnership offer be 
made public before the referendum. The people are entitled to 
know what is this partnership offer that an independent Quebec

Speaker is from the government party, two of the junior chair 
officers should be from the opposition so that the four presiding

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when pressed with questions yesterday about the dreaded 
federal reforms in unemployment insurance and old age pensions, 
the leader of the No side, Daniel Johnson, did not answer, saying 
this was up to the federal government. Since Mr. Johnson has 
refused to take any responsibility for the future of social programs, 
including those that apply to Quebec, I will direct my questions to 
the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that the best way to respond to the 
concerns of the unemployed and the elderly would be to table his 
social program reform now, so that Quebecers will know what to 
expect after a No to the referendum question?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I said early this week, and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development fielded questions on the subject several 
times, that we are working on the unemployment insurance reform. 
The process started some time ago. A green paper was tabled, and 
there were consultations with members. As soon as the bill is ready, 
we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14993"> 14993 </A></B>
<P>
will table it in the House of Commons, there will be a  debate and 
amendments will be proposed by all parties, including the 
opposition's party.
<P>
	There is a debate going on now, and I want to repeat that the 
reform will apply to all Canadians. It will apply not only to 
Quebecers but to all Canadians. We want to make sure that the 
unemployment insurance program and social reform will focus on 
job creation and on giving Canadian and Quebec workers the 
dignity of work, the dignity they desire.
<P>
	As for old age pensions, this is our responsibility. As everyone 
knows, the federal government has an obligation to meet with the 
provincial governments every five years to review what is referred 
to in English as the CPP with the nine other provinces. Although 
the Government of Quebec is fully autonomous in this area because 
the Quebec pension plan is strictly under its jurisdiction, it is party 
to the discussions because it does not want to undo the 
harmonization that exists in Canada.
<P>
	This meeting will take place in a few weeks, and the finance 
minister will be there. In any case, we have absolutely no intention 
of compromising the security of senior citizens who depend on 
government pensions. That is not our purpose. The point is that we 
must act responsibly and face up to our responsibilities. The point 
is not to have one policy before the referendum and another one 
afterwards, as seems to be the case with the Parti Quebecois in 
Quebec City.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the federal social program reform is reminiscent of 
Penelope and her weaving. Every night Penelope, who was playing 
for time, would unravel what she had woven during the day. In the 
case of the federal government, every night it ushers its officials 
into the office of the Minister of Human Resources Development to 
undo what was written the day before, to make sure the reform is 
not ready before the referendum.
<P>
	According to various leaks and to information reported just this 
morning in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, the social program reform is ready 
but the government has decided to postpone its release.
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is: When will he put an end to 
the uncertainty and apprehension of the unemployed and 
immediately release this reform which is locked away in the vaults 
of the Minister of Human Resources Development, so that 
Quebecers can make an informed decision on the kind of society 
they want on October 30?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are acting very responsibly, and the legislation is not 
ready yet because the appropriate decisions have not been made. 
As soon as these decisions have been made by cabinet, the 
legislation will be drafted and tabled in this House. If the 
legislation is ready before the referendum, it will be tabled before 
the referendum.
<P>
	We have discussed these matters and obtained the input of a 
great many people on this reform. We want to do a good job, and 
we will ensure that Quebecers are treated exactly the same as 
everybody else. This has no connection with the referendum. It is 
because we want to act responsibly.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to ask the Leader of the 
Opposition if he would care to clear the air about what he said 
yesterday. He probably said more than he intended, because at this 
stage, the Leader of the Opposition cannot afford to give foreign 
markets the impression that some provinces or governments in 
Canada would not do what any country would have to do, which is 
pay its debts as agreed in contracts with investors.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Prime Minister wants to reassure foreign markets, 
he should tell them he will behave reasonably, will respect 
Quebec's democratic Yes vote and will negotiate. Investors tend to 
shy away from lending money to undemocratic governments.
<P>
	This does not fool anyone. The Prime Minister wants to 
postpone the tabling of this reform, because he has every reason to 
fear the devastating scope of the cuts he is about to make. Does he 
not realize that by taking his cue from the simplistic and heartless 
solutions proposed by Mike Harris, he is preparing the ground for a 
fractured and divided society in Canada and Quebec, of which we 
saw a sample last night at Queen's Park, unfortunately?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, speaking of a democratic society, when we 
have a leader of the opposition in a democracy, sitting in 
Parliament and proposing the division and break up of the country 
in which he lives, this has to be a record for democracy anywhere in 
the world.
<P>
	In a democracy, people who propose separation should have the 
courage to say they are separatists, not just to the Americans but to 
the people in that province, so they will understand. In a 
democracy, they should have the honesty to say clearly what they 
want to achieve with their objective, which is separation, but the 
Leader of the Opposition is afraid to tell Quebecers the truth as he 
should, in a democracy: that he is a separatist and wants to leave 
Canada.
<P>
	But Quebecers will understand, and on October 30 they will vote 
to stay in Canada. I am sure they will, because they know the 
opposition does not have the courage to do as it says.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, is the 
Prime Minister announcing that he would not be prepared to 
respect Quebec's electoral democracy? The leader of the official 
opposition has been duly elected, and a goodly number of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14994"> 14994 </A></B>
<P>
members here have been  elected by more than half of their fellow 
citizens, unlike many other people.
<P>
	It can be seen from this morning's <I>Globe and Mail</I> that the 
minister prefers to hand out scoops on his unemployment insurance 
reform to the major dailies rather than to table the reform so it can 
be judged in its entirety by the population of Quebec.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Human Resources Development admit that 
the leak referred to by the <I>Globe and Mail </I>proves beyond a doubt 
that his plan is not only to come down hard on the unemployed but 
also to go over the heads of the provinces, thumbing his nose at the 
Quebec consensus?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
</B><B>Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it quite strange that the 
hon. member would comment on the fact that we are divulging 
things.
<P>
	It was only a day or so ago that her leader and other members 
were waving leaked documents in brown envelopes. All of a 
sudden they are totally discounting those and asking: ``What is the 
real truth?'' Two days ago the leader of the opposition was saying: 
``I have the truth here''. Now the hon. member for Mercier is 
saying: ``No, that was not the truth''.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is Bloc Quebecois members do not know 
what the truth is any more because everything they do is geared to 
the agenda of separatism. If they want to have a serious debate 
about social reform they should be putting their positions and 
suggestions forward.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	The problem is they are distracting Parliament from the real 
work of helping people to get jobs, of helping people to get 
security, and of helping people to see their future. As a result 
Parliament cannot do the work it should be doing because the hon. 
member is totally distracting and knocking people off their feet.
<P>
	That is why I keep saying to the hon. member ``simply say you 
are going to vote no'' so we can get down to the business of the 
House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
precisely because there have been trial runs of Canadian 
federalism, over and over again, that Quebec premiers from Jean 
Lesage up to Bourassa have been trying over and over again to gain 
control over occupational training. Just that. And the reason we are 
sovereignists is that we have seen federalism's inability to reform. 
For the good of the common people.
<P>
	Does the minister acknowledge that, in this plan which we have 
all read, he is not only cutting social transfers  but also dumping 
onto the provinces the burden of the long term unemployed, 
without any financial compensation for that burden, while at the 
same time retaining control over the unemployment insurance fund 
and its surplus in order to finance new federal initiatives?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask my colleagues to shorten the 
questions a bit. They are quite long.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me first comment on the 
remarks of the hon. member about the need to work with the 
provinces.
<P>
	On October 5, I wrote to the new employment minister in 
Quebec, Madam Harel, offering to sit down and negotiate a 
devolution or decentralization of labour market programs. The 
answer was no.
<P>
	I was still interested so I tried again. I wrote on October 27, 1994 
to the same minister and said: ``Let's get together and study the 
problem of duplication and overlap. We will sort of join to do the 
program''. The answer again was no. The question of co-operation 
was not a problem on our side. It was from that minister of 
employment.
<P>
	In all good faith I kept trying and as a result last summer we had 
some success. We negotiated an agreement to help jointly fund a 
major income supplement program in Quebec. We were able to 
arrive at an agreement to do a joint program for apprenticeship 
training in auto mechanics for young people. We have also arrived 
at a preretirement program.
<P>
	It shows that I will keep trying as long as they will too.

Environment.
<P>

somehow it conflicted with her view of centralized environmental 
management.

better than centralized federalism?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

applause from the separatists with whom he is working.
<P>
	Also I welcome the member's newfound interest in the 
environment. We have been sitting here now for almost two years 
and I got my first question from him on the issue this week.
<P>
	When it comes to agreements, in the last 23 months we have 
signed 12 major agreements which I would like to read into the 
record. They are administrative agreements with the province of 
Alberta. These are equivalency agreements which the province of 
Alberta signed on June 1, 1994. There is the Canadian 
intergovernmental agreement on the NAFTA signed on August 15, 
1995. There is the administrative agreement on pulp and paper with 
British Columbia-
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Calgary Southwest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister's contempt for this line of questioning is the 
same contempt she shows for the provinces.
<P>
	The minister has unilaterally banned the use of lead shot. She is 
unilaterally banning the use of MMT and benzene as fuel additives. 
The minister is setting standards for greenhouse gas emissions 
without real consultation. The minister stopped all the 
harmonization talks and scuttled progress on transferring control of 
the inland fisheries to the provinces. The concerns of the provinces 
are met not with understanding but with the minister's reverse 
charm and recycled rat pack tactics.
<P>
	Why does the minister stubbornly cling to the centralizing 
prejudices and policies of the seventies when decentralization is 
the watchword of the 1990s?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to table for the 
record the 12 agreements we have signed. I would also like to 
inform the hon. member there are 12 other agreements we are 
working on presently.
<P>
	I was elected to the House of Commons to speak for Canada. 
There are many environmental issues which touch all Canadians in 
the same way. If I drop something in Hamilton harbour it ends up in 
the water of la fleuve St-Laurent.
<P>
	If there is any area where there are national needs for a national 
vision, it is in the area of the environment. Surely the leader of the 
third party should recognize that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government's unwillingness to recognize public and 
provincial demand for decentralization in social services, in health 
care financing and in natural resources management is bad for 
federal-provincial relations and bad for national unity.
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister not remove the centralizers from 
his cabinet and send a strong signal to Quebec and indeed to all 
Canadians that federalism can work better by accepting and 
practising the principle of decentralization?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I remind the hon. member 
who may have forgotten that in his own response to the prebudget 
speech in the House of Commons on February 1, 1994 he took the 
position that we should maintain and increase federal support for 
the environment.
<P>
	I also underline that even the leader of the Bloc Quebecois has 
stated in the House that the federal government has very clear 
jurisdiction in the area of environmental impact assessment. That 
jurisdiction is not challenged.
<P>
	Our job here is to develop environmental standards which can 
work for the whole country. That is what I was elected to do. I 
would hope that the member would stop being a mouthpiece for 
one province and would start working for all Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	While the Minister of Foreign Affairs is visiting seniors' centres 
saying that his government will never touch old age pensions, the 
Minister of Labour said yesterday that the federal government was 
going to reform the Canada Pension Plan. What is more, the latest 
budget also announced a reform of the old age pension, a different 
program from the Canada Pension Plan.
<P>
	Since his ministers are all mixed up, would the Prime Minister 
confirm once and for all that old age pensions will indeed be 
reformed, as the budget provided, and that this reform has nothing 
to do with the five-year review of the Canada Pension Plan?
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the budget, the Minister of Finance said that a periodic 
review of the CPP, as I said earlier, was necessary at least every 
five years in cooperation with the Government of Quebec, which 
has its own pension plan, but which works with the federal 
government to harmonize both systems.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14996"> 14996 </A></B>
<P>
	I have said it and I will repeat it, we will never compromise 
the security of seniors who depend on the government pension. 
However, there are problems with this system as with all the 
others, and we want to ensure the system is adjusted, but not 
simply for this year and next, because good management requires 
us to be able to predict what the situation will be for people 
reaching retirement age in 2005 and 2010. We are doing studies 
right now, because, if we are not careful, people reaching 
retirement at that point might perhaps not enjoy the same services 
as people today do.
<P>
	Those who have reached that point today, those who are 
receiving pensions from the Canadian government and need them 
in order to survive, may rest assured that we do not intend to 
change them, because we know it is vital to allow them to keep 
their current standard of living.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in describing old age pension reform, the latest budget 
talked about affordability, controlling financially sustainable costs 
and staying within our means.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister have the courage to say to us seniors 
today that the aim of his reform is to cut costs in the old age 
pension program and thus reduce the size of seniors' cheques?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have just said that we do not intend to cut the old age 
pensions of people who are currently retired. This is very clear; we 
have said this. We said so. The only thing is that some work has to 
be done to make sure that, in 2005 or 2010, we still have an old age 
pension system in Canada.
<P>
	I can understand the hon. member and the Bloc members. They 
see no further than October 30. We are thinking about the future of 
all Canadians and about the pensions of Quebecers and Canadians 
not only for 1996, but for 2005 and for 2010 as well.

	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	In 1992 a study of the <I>Irving Whale</I> said that PCBs were on 
board the barge at the time of sinking. The minister claims she had 
no knowledge of this until July 6 of this year. She has stated in this 
House that it was the transport ministry that overlooked this report 
and not her ministry, Environment Canada.
<P>
	Will the minister put Canada first and tell the House in just a 
word who is responsible for the mistakes that led to a prohibitive 
court injunction, transport or environment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I informed the House last 
week that the investigation into the PCB presence is continuing. In 
fact, the Irving company is being interviewed this week on the 
issue. As I said a couple of weeks ago, when we determine who is 
responsible for not formally informing the government about 
PCBs, there will be action taken.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of the Environment has been politically 
grandstanding on this from the very beginning. It was her call to 
raise the <I>Whale</I> and now Canada is further in debt by $12 million 
and everything is still at the bottom of the sea with no hope to rise 
again as the <I>Mary Ellen Carter</I>.
<P>
	Will the minister get a grip on her ministerial accountability and 
will she admit that it was the fault of her department for ignoring 
the 1992 Marex study?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to take 
responsibility for a lot of things but as Minister of the Environment 
even I cannot dictate the weather.
<P>
	The member will know the reason the <I>Irving Whale</I> was not able 
to be lifted this year was specifically because of the small window 
of opportunity for raising the <I>Whale</I>. We needed two very calm 
days and those days were not forthcoming because of the delays 
occasioned by the court case.
<P>
	Everything is in place for the <I>Irving Whale</I> to be lifted next year. 
It seems to me that the presence of PCBs which if laid out would 
cover a football field three feet deep makes it even that much more 
urgent to lift the <I>Irving Whale</I>. We intend to do that as soon as the 
weather and the courts permit.

the leader of the No side, Daniel Johnson, who was clearly 
uncomfortable and unable to answer seniors properly, invited 
people to direct their questions at the Prime Minister of Canada.

going to happen''. But the Prime Minister can do so. We will 
therefore ask him to make some promises.
<P>
	Instead of trying to confuse all seniors by talking sometimes 
about the Canada pension plan and sometimes  about the old age

reassure seniors, that he will reject out of hand, right away and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14997"> 14997 </A></B>
<P>
clearly, any reform of old age pensions for seniors, as they now 
fear?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at the rate of one scare a day and with 32 days left, they 
still have to come up with 32 new scares. I think that the opposition 
is starting to feel scared that they will run out of scare stories. As I 
clearly stated earlier in response to his colleague who is already 
receiving his old age pension, we will never compromise the 
security of seniors who depend on government pensions.
<P>
	That is clear. I cannot be any clearer than this. I am not saying 
that there will be no reforms because there will be reforms. I know 
that opposition members will not be here at that time, but we on 
this side hope to be here for a few more years. We must now ensure 
that there will still be an old age pension plan for those who will 
retire in the coming millennium.
<P>
	These are our responsibilities, and we are not about to say that 
we are not looking at these problems when we are. But to those who 
are afraid today because PQ members are trying to scare them, I 
say: ``Do not be afraid''. There will be no statements on cutting 
their old age pensions either in November or in the February 
budget. I cannot be any clearer than this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we finally 
heard the admission that the Prime Minister will reform the old age 
security system. Given the direction in which the Minister of 
Finance is heading, this reform will certainly involve cuts. I would 
be surprised if old age pensions were increased, in the light of what 
they have done in the past two years. I imagine that he may will not 
think that representing seniors in this place is trying to scare 
people; we are simply trying to protect their security.
<P>
	Given the extremely disturbing information for seniors that 
come from government back rooms, could the Prime Minister 
assure us beyond any doubt that his government is not planning to 
defer beyond 65 the age of eligibility to the old age pension? Can 
he deny today this piece of bad news for seniors?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in our concept of society, people aged 65 and over already 
receive pensions. They therefore have no reason to worry. I am 
saying that we will have to look at the problems in the years to 
come. We will see; studies will be done.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ah, ah.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice): </B>Yes, we will see.
<P>
	But if we really want to reassure retired people in Quebec, the 
best way to do so is to tell them that they will continue to receive 
their old age pensions from the government of Canada after 
October 30, while the Parti  Quebecois is creating extreme 
uncertainty with its separation plans. The best way to reassure 
Quebec seniors is to tell them: ``The government of Canada will 
still be there after October 30 to pay your old age pensions''. There 
will be no doubt about that.

states in part that a tenable position should be identified with

this position may be to the current government.

was prepared to table his UI reform during the referendum

HIV/AIDS is a serious concern for all Canadians and it is a priority 
for this government. This year we are spending $40.7 million 
against this deadly disease. Half of these funds go toward research; 
the balance goes toward education, prevention, care, treatment and 
support.
<P>
	For example, recently I announced the government's support for 
a 1-800 information line. This information line will be accessible 
coast to coast in both official languages and will give information 
on care and treatment to people concerned with HIV and AIDS.
<P>
	This Sunday I will be joining the AIDS community in Sudbury to 
march and raise funds for this worthy cause. I invite each and every 
one of you to participate in your communities as best you can in 
whatever way you can. It is a very worthwhile cause.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to speak about our province of Ontario, the forgotten province.
<P>
	In June, Mike Harris and his common sense revolution were 
endorsed by the voters in Ontario. Mike Harris listened to the 
people of Ontario. He had the same message Reform did: Stop the 
madness of deficit financing, introduce a victims' rights bill and 
put an end to employment equity.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell the House when his government is 
going to start listening to the people of Ontario and stop this deficit 
financing, introduce a victims' rights bill and end employment 
equity?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

Parliament there was a riot involving 5,000 people outside the

	I very much hope the hon. member is not advocating that

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting we should talk about the riot at Queen's Park. It was 
evident that many of those protesters were members of the 
Canadian Union of Postal Workers. Can the government explain 
why federal employees were rampaging at Queen's Park when they 
should have been earning their federally subsidized paycheques?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, apparently we have touched a 
nerve.
<P>
	The reason the government continues to enjoy the widespread 
support of Canadians is that we are performing as we said we 
would. We are fulfilling our red book commitments and we have 
every intention of continuing to do exactly that.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, to whom I say that we will never trade our votes for 
training programs.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	Thanks to his UI reform, the minister will get, from the cheques 
to the unemployed, the money to finance his human resources 
investment fund, thus creating more duplication in manpower 
training due to the development of new federal training programs.
<P>
	Given the consensus in Quebec on the need to transfer the whole 
manpower training sector to the province, and considering the 
significant savings which could result from such a transfer, does 
the minister agree that it is improper to reduce payments to the 
unemployed in order to finance new federal manpower training 
programs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first let me point out to the 
hon. member that the unemployment insurance system is very 
clearly a federal national responsibility. It goes back to 1940 when 
all the provinces agreed it would be the responsibility of the federal 
government to give people a sense of security against 
unemployment, and like any good insurance policy, to make sure 
that we reduce the risk.
<P>
	The best way of reducing the risk in unemployment insurance is 
to get people back to work. That is one reason that over the years 
we have very carefully invested in a variety of programs to enable 
people to develop their employment prospects.
<P>
	We are saying in the modernization of it that we have to get 
better. We have to use the money more effectively. We have to get 
better value for the money. Therefore, we have to begin to look at 
how we can streamline and consolidate many of the 40 some 
programs into several programs and do those where we can work in 
close co-operation with the provinces. That is very clearly part of 
what we want to do. We want to develop a series of co-operative 
relationships with the provinces to help people get back to work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the only way to have an effective employment policy in 
Quebec is to have a sovereign Quebec that will control the UI 
system.
<P>
	Will the minister recognize that his flat refusal to transfer the 
whole manpower training sector to Quebec, as the province is 
asking, is a blatant example of the hard-nosed attitude of the 
federal government and its lack of understanding of Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with the indulgence of the 
member I remind him of my comment to his colleague earlier. I 
wrote to the Quebec employment minister offering to sit down and 
talk about issues of decentralization and devolution and the hon. 
minister of employment for Quebec said no.
<P>
	I have had similar very productive, very constructive discussions 
in the province of the leader of the third party. We now have a 
series of locations dealing with youth services. The federal and 
provincial governments are now working together in five different 
centres developing joint projects in that area.
<P>
	We are even working in the province of Quebec in a co-operative 
way. In the southwest corner of Montreal we have the RESO 
program in the area the hon. Minister of Finance represents thanks 
to his leadership.
<P>
	My point is there are many ways in which we can help people. 
The most important thing is to get rid of the disputes between 
jurisdictions and get down to budget-

	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
in the House the Minister of Human Resources Development gave 
a very ambiguous response to a question asked by my colleague in 
regard to the $533,000 grant that was given to a group in Winnipeg 
known as Manitoba Entertainment Complex Inc.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15000"> 15000 </A></B>
<P>
	Would he clarify today what process the group followed to 
obtain these funds and what was the criteria for qualification?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question. I think it is properly put and one which deserves 
clarification in comparison to what I heard yesterday.
<P>
	The answer is very clear. The industrial adjustment service is a 
program that works nationally throughout Canada to help a broad 
range of communities which are facing adjustment problems, 
either the loss of major industries or the prospect of developing 
new industries. In each of these cases the IAS program is set up 
through an independent committee.
<P>
	In the case of the new arena in Winnipeg the MEC worked out 
with the regional director of human resources to establish an 
independent committee. It is made up of people who are not 
involved in the program designed to bring the stakeholders 
together. There is no involvement by the minister. There is no 
direct involvement.
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	They work with all those involved in the project to find a way of 
making an adjustment. In this case the primary objective was to 
develop alternate plans to save 1,400 jobs at risk as a result of the 
decisions being taken in relation to the arena.
<P>
	That was the process which was taking place, an independent 
committee making decisions and working with major stakeholders 
to ensure we could find the best means of saving jobs in Winnipeg.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> I have a supplementary 
question, Mr. Speaker, for the same minister.
<P>
	Was the minister aware at a time prior to the awarding of the 
$533,000 grant that some of the people in Entertainment Inc. were 
contributors to his campaign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after representing the city of 
Winnipeg for close to 24 years I must say with some modesty that a 
large number of people contributed to my campaign.
<P>
	I say with some regret that of the fifty-five business partners in 
the MEC only five have made contributions to my campaign. All 
the rest went somewhere else, which is something I had better look 
into.
<P>
	I did not have any connection whatsoever. I had no assessment of 
who was making applications to MEC or who was getting 
contracts. It was the responsibility of the independent committee to 
determine what kind of contracts were to be let and where the 
money should go.  I had no involvement whatsoever, and I hope 
that clarifies the matter for the hon. member.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment and 
concerns the need to strengthen the current proposal for the 
endangered species protection act.
<P>
	As presented, the minister proposes to apply the terms of the new 
act to only 4 per cent of Canada's total land base and eliminates the 
northern jurisdiction entirely.
<P>
	Is it the minister's intention therefore to ensure effective 
protection of endangered species by broadening the premise of the 
proposed new act and at the same time by providing us with a 
guarantee that the new $2 coin in not the last place on earth where 
we will ever see a polar bear?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question of 
the hon. member.
<P>
	The hon. member has underlined one of the things that we have 
been trying to do in national government, and that is to respect 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	We have come out with an endangered species framework, the 
first of its kind in Canada. We have also been very careful to 
respect the fact that provincial governments have jurisdiction in 
certain areas. That is why at first blush the legislation does not 
cover as many species as we would like.
<P>
	In launching the process of the national endangered species act, 
not only have we seen the leadership that was already shown in the 
province of Quebec which had the first endangered species 
legislation but we have seen a number of other provinces come on 
board. We expect by the time the federal act is proclaimed that we 
will have at least seven other provinces contributing in a 
constructive way to a goal that I believe we should all share, and 
that is protecting endangered species.
<P>
	Endangered species do not respect provincial boundaries. They 
travel nationally and that is why I think we need a national 
framework, which I know even the Reform Party would support.

next week?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we will continue today, and if necessary tomorrow, with the debate 
on second reading of Bill C-93, the cultural property legislation, 
and seconding reading of Bill C-98 regarding oceans.
<P>
	If these items are disposed of before the end of the day 
tomorrow, I propose to call second reading of Bill C-78, the 
witness protection bill, and Bill C-64, the employment equity bill. 
This will be for debate at report stage and second reading since the 
bill was referred to committee before second reading.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	Next week we will commence with a motion for reference before 
second reading of Bill C-101, the transportation bill, followed by 
another motion for reference before second reading of Bill C-84, 
amendments to the Regulations Act.
<P>
	We will then return, if necessary, to the legislation listed for 
today and tomorrow at the place where we left off. That concludes 
the weekly business statement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. My question is also with regard to procedure.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I take it that it has to do with the Thursday 
question on upcoming House business.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last week I 
asked the hon. member, the House leader for the government, what 
kinds of bills were in the works and what would be proposed in less 
than 10 days now.
<P>
	I have not had a response to that or on whether there will be any 
legislation that will perhaps be delayed until the end of November 
or December when we would go into a format of closure. I would 
appreciate a response from the House leader, if possible.
<P>
	The other question I have is with regard to procedure, how the 
government is handling procedure in the committees and the 
direction that is being given by the House leader and the whip of 
government.
<P>
	Yesterday in the public accounts committee, while debate was 
going on with regard to the chairmanship, the government whip 
commanded the Liberal members and the Bloc members to vacate 
the committee after 25 minutes so that there was not a quorum for a 
discussion to proceed with regard to the chairmanship.
<P>
	It looks like a very unacceptable precedent has been set. I would 
like to ask the House leader whether that is the kind of procedure 
that will continue in the House on other occasions as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think our whip is ready to respond to 
the second point raised by the hon. House leader for the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	With respect to his first point, I was not able to be present at the 
House leader's meeting this week. I will endeavour to see what 
further information I can provide him in response to his question.
<P>
	We have a number of bills listed on the Order Paper. These will 
be the measures on which we will be drawing for the legislative 
program of next week and ensuing weeks.
<P>
	As I said to him last week, there may well be other measures in 
preparation that the government will be putting on the Order Paper 
within the next 10 days. I am sorry I cannot give him a precise list 
of additional measures at this point, but we will endeavour to assist 
the House in presenting the government's program in an orderly 
and meaningful way.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It would seem that we are stretching out the points 
of order, one on top of the other. I will permit it today, if the 
government House whip is prepared to answer, but I would prefer 
we deal with one area at a time when dealing with this type of 
information.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday afternoon shortly after question period and 
pursuant to an all-party agreement duly signed by all whips of the 
House, a meeting was held to proceed with the election of officers 
of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. As I said, there 
was an agreement signed by all whips to the effect that the 
committee along with other committees would meet at previously 
agreed to hours and days.
<P>
	Contrary to the agreement, one group of individuals chose not to 
allow the votes to proceed on the election of the chair and decided 
to filibuster the committee for whatever reason.
<P>
	That was confirmed in an informal conversation I had with 
members of that party, at which point we were forced to adjourn the 
meeting by causing it to lose its quorum.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15002"> 15002 </A></B>
<P>
	At 3.30 this afternoon we will once again attempt to elect 
officers pursuant to the agreement made. If that fails, we will 
attempt to do it again until we succeed in having not only the order 
made by the House some time ago on the repartition of members by 
party but also the all-party agreement made by the whips.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	We intend to do our part as a government to ensure the standing 
orders are adhered to. Hopefully members of the third party will 
co-operate today, unlike what happened yesterday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order regarding House business. In 
support of your statement a few moments ago that it is not good to 
split up these matters, I noticed that in the course of the whip 
responding to the second question the government House leader 
vacated his seat.
<P>
	I still have a question relating to House business for him. 
Perhaps the parliamentary secretary could answer my question. 
However in the future, Mr. Speaker, I want you to know that I 
support your contention that these points should be made 
separately and individually so that we can deal with matters in 
specific order.
<P>
	With respect to House business for the coming week, the 
government House leader is aware that the recent supreme court 
ruling in respect of tobacco products marketing has been thrown 
back to the government for a response. The government has said 
that it is looking at options in response to this ruling but for the 
most part is relying on staff in the Department of Health for ideas.
<P>
	In light of the fact that it would be better for members of 
Parliament to be examining the options, would the government 
House leader be willing to support a request from the House that 
the government offer this week the study of these options to the 
Standing Committee on Health so that a more public examination 
of the options and the issues could be undertaken?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will draw the hon. member's 
suggestion to the attention of the chair of the committee. If I am not 
mistaken, under our current rules the standing committees have 
wide powers to undertake studies at their own initiative rather than 
only at the request of the government. The committee may see fit to 
begin looking at this matter in a general sense.
<P>
	I also assure the hon. member that this issue is being actively 
examined within the government. The judgment which I received 
just yesterday is very lengthy and very bulky. It is understandable 
that the government's response would not be forthcoming within 
days of the judgment.
<P>
	The member's point about a vehicle for some public 
examination of the issue is one that, as I have said, the health 
committee might well want to take a look at under its ongoing and 
existing authorities.
<P>

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-93, 
an act to amend the Cultural Property Export and Import Act, the 
Income Tax Act and the Tax Court of Canada Act, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Unless there are more questions following my 
speech, I am finished.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the member. I was hoping he would regale 
us with more dinosaur tales.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an honour 
to rise to debate Bill C-93, particularly because over the course of 
the last few days as we have been discussing the bill I have been 
interested in the misinformation and in some ways nonsense that 
have been lobbed at this side of the House, especially by members 
of the third party.
<P>
	I should like to clarify certain aspects of the bill to ensure the 
people of Canada understand and fully appreciate its importance to 
them and to us as a country. As I was listening to the debate, 
particularly the day before yesterday, there were indications from 
members that the bill would cost the government $60 million. That 
is wrong.
<P>
	As a result of the bill and the notion that Canadians can donate 
artefacts of importance to our cultural heritage to museums, 
libraries and art institutions, we have had 1,100 donors give to our 
country the value of $60 million. The cost to our country, from a 
tax incentive point of view, has been just about half of that, $25 
million to $30 million. In fact, what we have are priceless 
donations of our country's history, culture, and art from other 
nations which is remaining in Canada for all of us to enjoy, value 
and appreciate. We have received $60 million dollars worth of 
priceless art and goods for the value of $25 million.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	That makes good sense to me, yet the members of the third party 
are misconstruing the information and having it printed in <I>Hansard</I> 
that it is costing us $60 million because they have not taken the 
time to understand the bill. In fact, I understand that they refused 
briefings from the parliamentary secretary and bureaucrats from 
the ministry. As a result we get misinformation in the House and 
that is not acceptable. It is good to have this opportunity to clarify 
that particular point.
<P>
	There were challenges from the third party saying: ``Did you 
know that this does not only apply to  Canadian artefacts and art, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15003"> 15003 </A></B>
<P>
but to art from around the world? Is that not terrible?'' I do not 
think it is terrible at all. Are we to assume that Canadians are not 
interested in works of art done by people from other parts of the 
world? We are a melting pot. We are a multicultural society. We 
can all learn from and appreciate art from other cultures. Those are 
the kinds of donations which are accepted under the bill. They are 
of value to us. I want to clarify that for the House. It makes sense 
and I appreciate it as a Canadian.
<P>
	The particular argument that the third party makes of the bill is 
that it only benefits rich people, in fact it is the Canadian 
government again servicing the rich, giving them an opportunity to 
receive a tax incentive for making a donation to a museum, an art 
gallery or a library.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> If that were true, then you would think they would 
support it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> The parliamentary secretary makes a 
good point. He says: ``If that were true, then you would think they 
would support it''. I tend to agree with him. What they are saying is 
that the government is not being fair, that it is all one sided and that 
it is only going to the rich. No, it is not. Donations are made to our 
art galleries, our libraries and our museums and we all benefit.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party are suggesting, I believe, that 
people who are not rich are not interested in art, do not value our 
history and our culture and do not like to go to museums. I can tell 
them that is not true. By virtue of this kind of legislation we have a 
very unique and important way of ensuring that our heritage 
remains in Canada, that it is here for us to enjoy and value, and that 
it is here for our children.
<P>
	If we go to the National Art Gallery, just behind Parliament Hill, 
we can go for free. Anybody can go for free and see incredible 
works of art, whether they be from the Group of Seven or from the 
Renaissance period. That is of value to all Canadians. Perhaps 
Reformers want us to charge for that. I do not know.
<P>
	The results of the bill do not just service the rich, they service us 
all. They enrich our culture, our society and our heritage. These are 
important points which have to be put on the record as we discuss 
Bill C-93.
<P>
	I was interested in some of the comments from the third party, in 
particular those that suggest the members of that party are credible 
art critics. If we go back through <I>Hansard</I> we can read of those 
members talking about particular pieces of art in the National Art 
Gallery and chastising that gallery for the purchase of those works 
of art or for even presenting them. It makes me wonder if the 
members from that party can spell art, let alone understand what art 
is all about. Quite frankly, art is a very personal thing. Art speaks to 
people in different ways, given the experiences, the culture, the 
point of view  or gender of an individual. It is something that is 
very important as we discuss this bill. We are clarifying, 
crystallizing the differences between the party in government and 
the party on the other side of the House by showing an appreciation 
and value for our history and culture. Quite frankly, the attacks that 
have fallen on us are all focused by the third party on the dollar 
figure. Nothing else is important.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	I agree that when times are tough, and we are finding it that way 
now, it is very easy to say stop, do not spend. Stop everything and 
focus on one issue. That is not good for our history, not good for 
our future. We have to remember that culture is continuing. Do we 
want a void in our history, in our collections, in our programs just 
because at this time we have a tough fiscal circumstance? I do not 
think we do.
<P>
	Fortunately the government in place is a balanced government 
which understands the importance of all aspects of culture and of 
the fiscal realities of society. As my colleague pointed out, we are a 
national government that knows the importance of differences. Art 
comes from the Atlantic provinces or from Vancouver, British 
Columbia or from the prairies. Those are things we should be 
thankful for and they should continue.
<P>
	The most important and telling point in this debate for me comes 
from my understanding of my own riding where we have a 
wonderful museum, the Brant County Museum, which has recently 
benefited from the philanthropy of one individual, Mr. Scheak, 
who over the course of his lifetime has collected a fabulous and 
very eclectic grouping of art, artefacts and historical documents. 
As a philanthropist he donated that collection to us in the riding of 
Brant. We now have an opportunity to look at historical pieces 
from around the world, whether it be from the Middle East, Asia 
and Europe, right in our own hometown. We do not have to travel 
to see it. There was nothing like that in my community before. 
Through legislation such as this, that is allowed to happen.
<P>
	No one in my community would chastise Mr. Scheak for getting 
a 50 per cent return on that collection. Let us be clear. That is what 
he gets; 50 per cent of the value of the collection. He does not get it 
all, just 50 per cent. We as a community benefit greatly not only 
because our children get a firsthand attachment to that history, but 
because others come to our community to see it as well. From a 
point of economic development and tourism the riding of Brant is 
going to win.
<P>
	As we listen to the strategies of the third party and their attack on 
this bill, we realize that a one-track, myopic approach to legislation 
is just not good enough. There are so many other aspects. There are 
no simple questions and there are no simple answers. Governing is 
very difficult. It takes a broad perspective, a complete  understand-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15004"> 15004 </A></B>
<P>
ing of a country, its people, its history and its values. Fortunately, I 
believe the government shows that.
<P>
	In this bill we are tangibly indicating that commitment. It is a 
proactive approach. As I mentioned, it is a unique strategy. There is 
one other country, interestingly enough, that provides tax 
incentives for donations to cultural institutions. That country is our 
neighbour to the south, the United States.
<P>
	I continue to find it interesting that the third party touts the 
United States as the be all and the end all. They want us to have a 
political system like the United States. They want us to be like 
Newt Gingrich. They want us to be far, far on the right and forget 
about those in our community who have not got the same 
resources, capabilities and skills as others.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Now they find their heroes to the south doing something not so 
different from what we are doing here in Canada and they do not 
like it. I wonder. It is very rare that it happens, but we in fact have 
with this legislation implemented a program where Canadians can 
make donations to our very important cultural institutions. By and 
large they are doing it philanthropically because as I mentioned 
they are not getting the full return for the value.
<P>
	They could sell them. They could insist that their collections go 
out of the country where we do not have the value for them and sell 
them beyond our borders, lost to us forever. But no, many people 
are philanthropic. They give to our institutions. It is very 
appropriate for us to in return give them at least a 50 per cent 
return. As I say, the people of the country do not object to that.
<P>
	I know each of us as members of Parliament find as we talk to 
our local cultural institutions that they do not have the money to go 
out and buy artefacts and pieces of art. It is through donations that 
they create their significance, their contents and their importance. 
We do not want to ever lose that.
<P>
	This bill is a good bill, bringing together pieces of several acts 
that have been historically part of the mix, clarifying them, 
improving them and making our country, as a result, much better.
<P>
	I would like to thank the House for its indulgence. I appreciate 
the opportunity to clarify some of the points that have been floating 
around over the course of the last few days of debate and at this 
point recommend the bill to the good graces of our House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise and speak in support of the act 
to amend the Cultural Property Export and Import Act, the Income 
Tax Act and the Tax Court of Canada Act.
<P>
	The opposition to the bill and the thrust of the amendment to the 
bill would undermine cultural  institutions from coast to coast. 
Culture is the one legacy that the past leaves to the present and the 
present prepares to leave to the future.
<P>
	By establishing the incentives that are inherent in this bill it will 
encourage people in this country who have items of great 
significance nationally, of great significance regionally or great 
significance locally to donate those items to art galleries, museums 
and heritage buildings that may be in any town, city or county.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to amend the Cultural Property Export 
and Import Act, with consequential amendments to the Income Tax 
Act and the Tax Court of Canada Act, to establish an appeal 
determinations by the Canadian Cultural Property Export Review 
Board of the fair market value of certified cultural property.
<P>
	In December 1991 the responsibility for determining the fair 
market value of cultural property donated to the designated 
Canadian museums, art galleries and libraries and significant 
heritage buildings transferred from Revenue Canada Taxation to 
the review board and the review board assumed this responsibility 
at its meeting held in January 1992. No provision for appeal of the 
review board decisions was included in the legislative amendments 
despite the fact that the right of appeal had existed when this 
responsibility was withdrawn from Revenue Canada. Donors and 
custodial institutions expressed serious concerns about the lack of 
an appeal process that is inherent to have built into any program 
like this where value is to be judged.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage in co-operation with the 
review board then undertook a series of consultations with the 
community about the need for an appeal process. As a result of 
these consultations, it was agreed that the legislative amendments 
should be prepared to establish the right of appeal to the Tax Court 
of Canada.
<P>
	This bill establishes two processes. The first gives the donor or 
recipient institution the right to request that the review board 
consider its initial determination of fair market value. If after 
receiving a determination from the board the donor is not satisfied, 
he or she may take the second step of appealing the board's 
decision to the Tax Court of Canada.
<P>
	There are key messages inherent in this bill. I will review some 
of them at this time. The cultural property export and import tax 
provides tax benefits to encourage donations to public institutions 
of objects and collections that are of outstanding significance and 
national importance. This support is the only program of the 
Government of Canada that provides financial support through tax 
credits for donations to museums, art galleries, archives and 
libraries.
<P>
	Museums, art galleries, archives and libraries in every province 
and territory in Canada benefit through the  receipt of donations of 
cultural property as a result of these tax credits. Cultural property 
valued at approximately $60 million is donated to Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15005"> 15005 </A></B>
<P>
institutions each year. A significant amount of real property is 
donated to public institutions.
<P>
	The fair market value of cultural property certified by the review 
board is eligible as a tax credit at 17 per cent for the first $200 and 
29 per cent on the balance over $200. The donor can claim the fair 
market value of the gift up to the total amount of his or her net 
income. There is no tax payable on any capital gain resulting from 
this gift.
<P>
	Because a donor receives a tax credit, the amount of money 
realized as a result of the donation is approximately 50 per cent of 
the fair market value. The donor does not therefore receive a tax 
refund equivalent to the fair market value of the gift.
<P>
	Donors, museums, art galleries and professional associations 
have been lobbying for the right to appeal review board decisions 
as it was perceived that the lack of an appeal was a denial of natural 
justice. In most cases where there is arbitration the laws of natural 
justice in this country must be seen to be in action. Due process 
must be seen to be in action.
<P>
	The establishment of appeal should be viewed as a reinstatement 
of the right of appeal that was lost when the responsibility for 
determining the fair market value was returned to the review board 
in 1991.
<P>
	These amendments will ensure that donors who disagree with 
determinations of the review board will have the right of appeal to 
the courts and that they will not be denied natural justice. The 
announcement of the establishment of an appeal process was 
received positively by donors, museums, art dealers and the media. 
These legislative amendments therefore enjoy a high level of 
public support.
<P>
	The amendments are technical in nature and respond to strong 
concerns expressed by the heritage community. Their passage into 
law should be seen as part of the ongoing commitment of the 
Government of Canada to ensure the preservation of Canada's 
cultural heritage.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	As I said before and would like to stress again, the era of a 
country is known by the culture it passes on to another. We must 
bring those significant items that demonstrated the culture of that 
era into a place of safekeeping so that they can be studied, viewed 
and appreciated by people in future eras.
<P>
	Throughout history works of art have been prized by 
civilizations as expressed by the cultures that created them. They 
are regularly protected, conserved and displayed as both symbols 
and concrete examples of the history of a particular society or 
cultural group. We see this now as our natives in this country seek 
to preserve  items of their cultural heritage which have great 
meaning to them. Other groups in our society are seeking now to 
preserve items of cultural heritage that will have great meaning to 
future generations.
<P>
	All nations define themselves in the present by events of the 
past. It is therefore vitally important to preserve our nation's 
history and heritage.
<P>
	Canada passed the Cultural Property Export and Import Act to 
provide cultural patrimony and preserve in Canada significant 
examples of the nation's cultural, historic and scientific heritage in 
movable cultural property. As a means to protect its cultural 
property, Canada adopted unique combinations of export controls 
and tax incentives for making gifts to the designated public 
institutions and incorporated these in legislation by establishing the 
articles that flowed from that act.
<P>
	May I speak from some personal experience. Last Sunday I 
attended a cultural heritage event. I stood in for the minister of 
culture at a ceremony for a plaque commemorating a historic 
building of significant architectural importance. Its interior was 
significant; it was the most outstanding example of fresco painting 
in three dimension in Canada. I was pleased to be there as were all 
the people of that community. It is not a sophisticated metropolitan 
community but the town of Baden of approximately 2,000 people.
<P>
	People gathered in great numbers to celebrate the historic 
recognition of Castle Kilbride. Significant artefacts that belonged 
to that castle from the early 19th century were donated. People 
brought them back and these items were of significant value 
because they were owned by a man of considerable wealth. They 
returned them to this heritage building and museum so that the 
people of that community would see the architecture and painting 
of significance to Canadian history and how life was lived in that 
building.
<P>
	I live in a town where there are a number of buildings of 
architectural significance that will be declared heritage buildings. 
There is not just the culture of significant and exciting designs but 
there is also the finest English speaking repertoire theatre in North 
America, the Stratford Festival Theatre and its three stages. We go 
down the trail and recognize great writing, great playwriting and 
performances in Stratford, which by the way is playing to its best 
year in history.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	Canadians will look back on those significant events which 
developed their culture, developed their appreciation for fine 
architecture, developed their appreciation for fine art, which were 
developed in Canada by Canadians, for Canadians today and for 
Canadians tomorrow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to be able to speak in support of this bill today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15006"> 15006 </A></B>
<P>
	As the hon. member for Perth-Wellington-Waterloo so ably 
said, there is a technical reason for this bill, which is to enable 
an appeal procedure to be put into place so that the proper amount 
of taxation deductions will be calculated and applied in the course 
of allowing citizens to make donations to institutions in Canada. 
That in itself is an extremely important public policy 
consideration.
<P>
	In some respects the bill seems very narrow in scope because it 
is reinstituting an appeal procedure which existed some time ago 
under previous legislation. In that sense it is rectifying a situation 
which needed to be dealt with.
<P>
	Some of the objections which were raised by members of the 
third party when we were debating this bill the other day attacked 
not only the thrust of the bill and the whole purpose of what we are 
trying to do here, but also the need for an appeal procedure. If 
members of the third party are sincere about having genuine 
intellectual problems with this whole idea, they certainly should 
support the thrust of the bill, which is to ensure that there will not 
be an arbitrary decision by just one authority as to how these 
matters will be dealt with, but rather they will be subject to an 
appeal. They will go to the tax appeal court and from there they can 
go to the federal court. We will be able to ensure that these matters 
will be handled by strict, appropriate, legal methods.
<P>
	This bill deals with an extremely important aspect of public 
policy concern in Canada, that is, that we should have proper 
procedures in place to ensure the good administration of all aspects 
of our justice system. In that sense the bill fits within the whole 
purpose of what the government is trying to do, which is to ensure 
that the people in Canada have a judicial system which is fair and 
open and which ensures proper judicial procedures for all. We 
should look at that aspect of the bill when we are considering it.
<P>
	I sat in the House the other day and heard the attacks on the bill 
by members of the third party, who used, as one so often does in the 
course of debate, rather outrageous examples. One member stood 
up and said they had seen a painting that was scurrilous or 
unattractive. Imagine that. Someone had donated it and received a 
tax deduction for it. We could all probably go to an art gallery and 
find some paintings which are unacceptable to us.
<P>
	In the course of my travels I have been to the Louvre. I was told 
that some of the finest paintings in the Louvre were, at the time 
they were painted, offensive, despicable and unacceptable. The 
whole thrust of the impressionist school when it first came out was 
quite unacceptable to the public. The paintings which today fetch 
$50 million were totally and utterly unacceptable to certain people 
at that time who said: ``This is a class of art with which we do not 
wish to be associated. It does not conform to our traditions. It does 
not conform to exactly the way we  think. Nothing except the way 
we think is acceptable in this world. We will not accept artistic 
values or views that are different from what we represent''.
<P>
	That is not the view of the government. It is not the view of 
average Canadians. Average Canadians know that art, literature and 
culture must represent a vast gamut of society. There must be 
tolerance. There must be a willingness to accept that we need an 
expression of culture in our country that is broad, embracing, and 
global in nature if we are going to take our children into the next 
century with a sense of what the world is about.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	This bill fits into that. It enables small communities to take 
artifacts, libraries, and things of real value to those communities 
and give them to local museums and allow them to stay in place so 
that people can be a part of their own culture. There is nothing 
lamentable about that. There is nothing to criticize in that. It seems 
to me to be an extraordinarily valuable contribution we are making.
<P>
	When we turn to what the third party was complaining about in 
the House the other day, the fact that this bill enables wealthy 
people to make contributions to Canada, I think we have to take 
this into proportion. We have to look around our country and look 
at some of the contributions that have been made.
<P>
	In my own riding of Rosedale there is a museum called the 
George R. Gardiner Museum, of which I was privileged to be a 
trustee some years ago when I was teaching at the University of 
Toronto. Mr. Gardiner donated a collection of extremely valuable 
porcelain to the City of Toronto. That collection is contained in a 
part of the museum that the University of Toronto helped to build. 
That is, to use that much overtaxed phrase, a world class collection. 
It receives world class attention. It receives visitors from around 
the world. It contributes to the economy of Toronto. People stay in 
the hotels nearby. They use taxis to get to it. They eat in the 
restaurants around it.
<P>
	It is calculated that during the course of the Barnes collection 
exhibition in Toronto the spin-off effect for the economy of Toronto 
was some tens of millions of dollars. We cannot forget that not only 
are we enriching our cultural heritage when we allow, enable, and 
encourage, as this government does, this type of activity, we also 
enable our economy to be strong. We enable a real contribution to 
be made to our economy in the form of tourism or in the form of 
people coming here.
<P>
	I myself have had the privilege of going to Calgary. Many 
members of the third party must have visited the Glenbow 
Museum. The Glenbow Museum would not exist if it were not for 
measures like this. Where would we be if we did not have that 
wonderful repository of our First Nations' art and artifacts that are 
found in that fabulous institution that is the Glenbow Museum, 
which is a pride for all Canadians, not just Calgarians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15007"> 15007 </A></B>
<P>
	It is measures such as this that make the existence of the 
Glenbow Museum possible. The Glenbow Museum, the George 
R. Gardiner Museum, the Royal Ontario Museum, and over 300 
small and local institutions in this country all have requested this 
measure to enable them to survive and continue to do the job they 
are doing so well for Canadians. That is why I support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If I go to Montreal, I have the opportunity to see the Montreal 
Museum of Fine Arts. I can visit the architecture museum created 
through a gift from Mrs. Lambert, an extraordinary museum which 
has made Montreal famous. People come to Montreal from all over 
the world to visit these museums which enjoy a worldwide 
reputation, not merely a local one.
<P>
	All of these contribute not only to Montreal and Quebec culture 
but to Canadian culture as well and I dare say contribute to the 
economy of Montreal and of Canada also.
<P>
	If we acknowledge that donors, museums, art galleries and 
professional associations are all lobbying for the right to challenge 
the decisions of the review board, we must as a government 
acknowledge that they are justified in making such demands and 
put into place in the legislation a reliable and valid system for 
handling this situation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to conclude along the lines of my colleague from 
Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, who pointed out that we should 
keep this in proportion. This is 50 cents on the dollar these people 
are getting. This is not some huge tax give-away. It is 50 cents on 
the dollar.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	At some point a government, if it is to be faithful to its mandate, 
must provide cultural objects for its citizens. Do the members of 
the third party suggest that we should go out, collect the taxes, and 
then go and buy objects with that tax money? That is a much more 
expensive way of doing it. This way we get the benefit of the 
generosity of Canadians who have collected wonderful things 
during their lives. At the same time, we enrich our communities 
and we do it in the most tax efficient way possible.
<P>
	That is why I support what this bill is about and why I support 
what the government is doing when it tries to ensure that we have a 
better country that is enriched by the activities of our citizens and 
we enable them to put their life's work and their life's collections to 
the benefit of our society and that of our children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for the previous speaker.
<P>
	I come from an area where there is an endeavour under way to 
establish a new resource of heritage. I am wondering whether or 
not he sees any mechanism through this bill that would enable in a 
general way a  new facility, a new collection of artifacts to be set up 
to encourage the general community to bring forward its artifacts 
in a particular manner.
<P>
	I will give a little background. We are the oil capital of 
Manitoba. We have a problem of encouragement to the oil industry 
to bring some of those artifacts back into a setting whereby they 
will be on display. I would ask if the hon. member sees any 
mechanism that would be available.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am certainly not in a position 
someone in the ministry would be to answer a technical question of 
the nature the hon. member poses.
<P>
	I think the question has some general value that I would like to 
address. First, this bill is not directed to the problem or the issue of 
just collections of art, porcelain, or other items of that nature. 
Anything that is of value to society would be perfectly acceptable, 
as I understand it, to be the subject matter of a museum or another 
form of institution.
<P>
	As a result, I would suggest to the member that what this bill 
does by putting in place this appeals procedure is it ensures that 
when the institution of which he spoke is set up and when donations 
are made to it, which they will be, those donations then will be 
properly accounted for. There is a procedure whereby if there is any 
debate about their true value it may be appealed to the courts and 
we can ensure that for the benefit of Canadians and Canadian 
society and other Canadian taxpayers that will be done in an 
orderly way. In that sense, the bill does contribute to enabling what 
the member would like to see done in his riding.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one 
would think we were debating today whether to establish or not 
establish a tax benefit for the donation of cultural property to the 
institutions of this country that have the mission of securing for 
future generations examples of art and literature in its many forms. 
We are not. What we are doing is debating a fairly minor 
amendment to the process by which that is done. That is in fact a 
situation that has been in place for some time.
<P>
	The Reform Party has been critical of this. I guess I have to ask 
why. I have also heard the Reform Party say that there are things 
the government should get out of, that the government should be 
spending less money, that in any way possible government should 
be allowing the private sector to do what the private sector can do.
<P>
	This policy, which has been in effect for many years now, of 
allowing the private sector to contribute to the preservation of 
Canadian heritage and culture and to receive a tax credit for their 
contribution is one way of ensuring that government does not have 
to do everything in this country-unless one believes of course that 
a nation should not seek to collect the best heritage examples of art, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15008"> 15008 </A></B>
<P>
of literature, of sculpture. I do not  believe the Reform Party is of 
that opinion, but one would almost think so.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	There is a bit of a contradiction here between saying allow the 
private sector to do more and let government do less and then 
speaking against a provision that encourages that very kind of 
private sector contribution to building the nation.
<P>
	For many years I have had the privilege of living in the nation's 
capital. Part of that privilege is to share as part of my community 
the very fine national institutions our country has built over the 
decades: the National Gallery, the Museum of Nature, the Museum 
of Civilization, the Museum of Science and Technology. Over the 
years I have applauded the efforts of those institutions to take their 
collections and their knowledge to different parts of Canada and 
share with all Canadians the wealth of the collections and exhibits 
we have built in this country.
<P>
	I do not think we can over-emphasize how important it is to the 
heart and soul of a nation to have a sense of its past. We cannot 
over-emphasize how important it is for young people to have an 
opportunity to be exposed to those things that express different 
points of view, through art of one kind or another, about the world, 
about ourselves, and about our nation.
<P>
	My colleague from Rosedale just spoke about the attitude 
towards the impressionists when they first began painting. Our own 
Group of Seven, who are virtually universally revered, suffered the 
same lack of acceptance among their fellow citizens when they 
tried to express in a new way what the country meant and how it 
appeared.
<P>
	I said it was important for children to have the opportunity to to 
experience many different expressions, visually and verbally, in 
music, views of their country and of the world. I go back to my own 
experience when our own National Gallery was housed in half of 
what is now the Museum of Nature. It was a very small collection. 
As a 10-year-old I had the wonderful opportunity of going there on 
a Saturday morning with dozens of other children, spreading a 
newspaper on the floor and using bottles of bright-coloured paint 
and being able to express myself. Then we would spend time 
looking at the masterpieces. We would have a world-renowned 
painter like Henri Masson spend his Saturday mornings with young 
children like me, commenting on our paintings and encouraging 
and discussing with us the other wonderful works that were in that 
very tiny gallery. These are the experiences that influence one's 
perception of the world and of oneself and that change one's future 
in many ways.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	I hope nobody in this Parliament needs to be convinced of the 
value of a nation building up a reservoir for the generations to 
come of those things which have  been an important expression of 
our culture and our history and our way of viewing the world.
<P>
	We are not talking about whether we should or should not have 
provisions in the Income Tax Act to allow people to gain some 
credit, and it is only a partial credit, through the income tax system 
when they choose to donate something which is their own to their 
country and to their fellow citizens. That has been well established.
<P>
	All we are talking about is making sure that the interests of the 
donor, the interests of the institution receiving the gift and the 
public interest are protected. We are here today to establish a 
process where the review board that determines the value of such a 
gift is subject to appeal, so that if a donor is not satisfied that the 
value that has been put on his or her gift by the review board is 
adequate, there is an opportunity to appeal.
<P>
	Why is that important? It is important because a donor may 
choose to give or not give a gift to the nation, depending on 
whether it is valued as it should be. If I were to offer a gift to the 
National Gallery, which the gallery would first have to determine is 
of national and historical importance, and a review board were to 
say to me it is worth this much, when I know very well it is worth 
two or three times that much, I would choose not to give that gift 
under those circumstances.
<P>
	If I have an impartial appeal process to go to, to say what is the 
real value of this and to have it established, then those gifts are far 
more likely to be made to the institutions of our country.
<P>
	On the other hand, a donor may have an over-inflated view of the 
value of an artefact or a painting or a book which the donor wants 
to give to an institution, in which case the institution has an 
impartial process to go through to demonstrate to the donor that 
this is the value of that property and whether he or she still wishes 
to donate it or not, that is the value which the museum or art gallery 
is prepared to accept as its value.
<P>
	I said it also protects the taxpayers and it does. While we want to 
give tax credits that encourage people to donate in that way, we 
also want to be sure that those tax credits are based on fair value. 
We want to make sure there is a process with an appeal built into it 
in case there is disagreement about those values.
<P>
	We encourage charitable giving in many ways. We encourage 
charitable giving toward various causes: health research, programs 
for children, programs for young mothers, preservation of the 
environment. In all those cases we give exactly the kind of tax 
benefit that is being slightly modified in this bill. I cannot help but 
feel that giving something of great value to the mind and soul of a 
nation is equally important as contributing to research in a variety 
of ways. I am surprised that there are those in the House today who 
would question it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15009"> 15009 </A></B>
<P>
	In fact, I would take this opportunity to encourage the 
government to look further at how in times of tight financial 
situations we might achieve other national objectives through the 
same means.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	For instance, there is no reason why someone should not be able 
to contribute an environmentally sensitive area to the nation for 
preservation and receive the same encouragement through the tax 
system to do that as they would do with the donation of an 
extremely valuable and historically important book.
<P>
	Perhaps we should be considering a tax treatment that 
encourages people to preserve and to donate to the nation important 
historical buildings. Now the tax system seems more designed, 
according to the National Round Table on the Environment and the 
Economy, to encourage the demolition of heritage buildings and 
the construction of new buildings than to preserve existing ones.
<P>
	I consider this legislation a safeguard of the public interest, the 
donor's interest and the receiving institution's interest. When a 
Canadian chooses generously to give something which he or she 
owns of great cultural value to all of us, I consider this act 
introduces a safeguard to ensure it is done based only on the proper 
value of that property.

	The House resumed from September 26 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-98, an act respecting the oceans of Canada, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee; and on the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The House will recall the 
member for Calgary North had not finished her speech. She is not 
prepared to go ahead at this time so I will recognize the member for 
Vancouver Quadra.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to resume the debate on Bill C-98, the 
oceans act.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to hear the closing minutes of the debate 
the other day on this bill. It was late in the evening; one was 
scattering twilight ashes so perhaps there were some 
misconceptions that might not have been formed at an earlier time 
of day.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	Allow me to correct them by saying what this bill is not. It is 
certainly not an attempt to rewrite the Constitution Act, to rewrite 
the Constitution or to change the balance of federal-provincial 
powers as established under the Constitution Act and under the 
extensive jurisprudence developed on that act over the last 128 
years.
<P>
	It is a bill with a more modest purpose, although one of great 
value to the Canadian public and great value certainly to those who 
have grown up since the last war. It is a compendium, a collection 
in convenient form of Canada's position on the law of the sea.
<P>
	International law is made in various ways. The great bulk of it 
has been made much as the common law of Canada has been made: 
by custom, practice which by its reasonableness and its acceptance 
becomes concretized as a rule of custom.
<P>
	Other parts of the international law of the sea have been made by 
jurisprudence, by the decisions of the courts of which the 
International Court of Justice has been a leader, although 
sometimes national courts spill over. Still further change has been 
made by legislation, by treaties.
<P>
	What is not perhaps generally understood is that until 1945 
virtually all of the projections of Canada's power in international 
law of the sea and of the world community's position on the 
international law of the sea did not exist.
<P>
	Until 1945 the law of the sea was a law of movement as my good 
friend, the great French scholar, René-Jean Dupuy of the Collège 
de France has described it, a law of movement which was 
concerned essentially in establishing the rights of all parties that 
passed freely to and fro on the seas, the concept of the high seas and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15010"> 15010 </A></B>
<P>
the  concept of a very limited national, territorial sea abridging 
those limits.
<P>
	That was the regime which lasted for more than 300 years. It was 
developed originally as a debate between two great scholars, and 
the modern law of the sea, as the 300-year old law was then called. 
It was established by the brilliant Dutch jurist, Grotius, who in 
essence said the high seas belong to everybody. Everybody has the 
right of passage to and fro. The national, territorial sea is limited 
and it is a three-mile sea, no more.
<P>
	This was itself an heretical doctrine because it overthrew an 
earlier doctrine established by Spanish and Portuguese jurists and 
ratified by a pope with a decree in 1494 that appropriated the 
oceans and divided them between Spain and Portugal. Grotius 
overthrew this. He was resisted by some sceptical people, including 
the great English jurist, Selden, but his views prevail largely 
because they made sense in the world community as it was 
developing, particularly in the aftermath of the Thirty Years War. 
But even before the signs were apparent. When he was writing, it 
was quite clear that the modern state founded on the rules of 
commerce must have freedom of access to and fro on the seas.
<P>
	Those were the theories that he presented. Since they 
corresponded to the needs of the world community they were 
widely accepted and became the general rules, subject only to very 
minor exceptions for some special Scandinavian rules and the like 
and some exceptions that were made by special bilateral treaties 
very recently. In fact the changes are largely in response to illegal 
Canadian activities, treaties governing rumrunning and attention of 
vessels outside the three-mile territorial sea of the United States. 
These were directed against Canadian smugglers in the 1920s and 
were basically British-U.S. treaties.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	What this act does, and I think it is its primary purpose, is to give 
a compendium, give a résumé of the elements in the modern 
Canadian position of the law of the sea. Our law reflects 
international law. It is a rule of international law that the general 
customary rules of international law are part of the common law of 
Canada. To be operative, treaties as such must be incorporated into 
our law by legislation. The conventions in the law of the sea up to 
date, until the most recent one, are directly parts of Canadian law.
<P>
	This particular act is not directed to the 1982 convention, the 
so-called third United Nations law of the sea convention, but it 
achieves essentially the same thing because it recites all those 
additions to the international law that have become part of 
Canadian law by various Canadian actions.
<P>
	I should add here that a treaty, even though unratified by a 
country, may, according to the best jurisprudence of the 
International Court of Justice, become binding upon  a 
non-signatory, non-ratifying country simply because it is evidence 
of a general rule of international law binding on all states. This 
flows from a celebrated dictum of the late president of the world 
court, Judge Lachs, and it is now generally accepted.
<P>
	If we look at this legislation we do get for the first time a 
complete and comprehensive recitation of the segments of the 
Canadian law of the sea: the territorial sea of course, but the 
extension of the territorial sea from three marine miles to twelve; a 
ruling on the contiguous zone, which is itself an extension into 
general treaty law and then into general customary law of those 
special American treaties that were designed to cover the rum 
runners, the smugglers, and not much more. The contiguous zone 
goes well beyond that today.
<P>
	Something that was a revolutionary doctrine when it was 
proclaimed by President Truman for the first time in 1945 is the 
international law of the continental shelf. President Truman 
asserted that claim on behalf of the United States defence policy. It 
was designed, as he said, and there was some evidence for that, to 
establish a legal basis for early warning systems and the like 
outside the three-mile territorial sea. But there was also very 
clearly an economic motive: the development of submarine oil 
deposits and other mineral resources outside the three-mile limit. 
So that is the continental shelf.
<P>
	Then we join forces with another interesting segment to which 
Canada has very specifically contributed, the establishment of 
fishing zones. These were originally unilateral assertions by 
several Latin American states with a poor economy but rich seas in 
terms of marine fish resources: the unilateral extension to 200 
miles of their jurisdiction and enforced against ships owned by 
Greek shipowners but registered under flags of convenience. It was 
an heretical doctrine when first asserted, but its reasonableness in a 
world of diminishing resources was fully recognized and other 
states adopted this. Canada was one of the leaders in that, firstly by 
unilateral act and then by a series of bilateral treaties with other 
countries.
<P>
	A further and more interesting doctrine is this doctrine of the 
exclusive economic zone, which now goes 200 miles from our 
coast. It has been said by the international court that with a slightly 
different development the exclusive economic zone might have 
become unnecessary, that the doctrine of the continental shelf 
could have been capable of further generic extension. But we face 
the reality today that the international law has developed in 
separate steps, not necessarily overlapping.
<P>
	What we have in this bill for the first time is a comprehensive 
presentation of the Canadian law, the Canadian recognition and 
application of the international law of the sea in the different ways 
in which we have done it. It is a bit more comprehensive than the 
1982 international treaty. It covers more matters. These are matters 
that I would say Canada has pioneered.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15011"> 15011 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	I go back here to the great dean of the University of British 
Columbia law school, George Curtis, who was very active in the 
two great international conferences in 1958 and 1960 that gave rise 
to the first great international conventions post-war on this subject. 
I would also add the distinguished Vancouver and Victoria scholar 
and long-time legal adviser to the Canadian foreign ministry, Alan 
Beesley, Ambassador Tommy Koh of Singapore, and Judge Aguilar 
Mawdsley of Venezuela, who is now a judge of the world court. It 
can be said that they developed the modern law of the sea.
<P>
	Here we discover something that is distinctively Canadian and of 
which we can be very proud, because it draws together certain 
imperatives of Canadian society that are widely recognized, 
perhaps more than ever in western Canada and on the west coast. 
That is to say that we view the resources of the sea as something to 
be protected, and it is not a rule of international law and it should 
not be the case that people can do anything they like as long it is not 
specifically prohibited in some act that someone can cite. What is 
being said here, which was the Canadian position in the extended 
meetings leading up to the 1982 convention, is that there is today 
an imperative of conservation, that in a world of diminishing 
natural resources the common heritage of humankind consists of 
these natural resources and every state has a duty to investigate, to 
monitor their utilization, and to protect them.
<P>
	In its basic conception this is a modest law, but it does 
comprehensively state what is the Canadian position on the 
international law of the sea as applied in Canada. It also goes 
beyond that and carries forward the thrust of the Canadian interest 
in conservation, which we have pioneered and successfully 
demonstrated to other countries.
<P>
	I have a certain interest in this. In recent months I attended, at 
the invitation of the UN Secretary-General, his conference on the 
future of international law. It was at the height of the so-called 
turbot war, which involved our country in a dispute with two other 
countries. It was a matter of great interest to be greeted by the 
ambassadors of a number of European countries and to be 
requested to pass on congratulations to our government for taking a 
position in terms of conservation of the world's diminishing 
resources. These people said very frankly: ``We cannot be quoted 
on this. Our government, for reasons of regional solidarity, may 
take a different position, but something had to be done.''
<P>
	I suppose this really directs attention to the international 
law-making process. Most of the international law of the sea has 
been made by unilateral acts of countries. Somebody asserted the 
principle. Sir Francis Drake and others were the first to challenge, 
on behalf of Queen Elizabeth I, the Portuguese and Spanish  claims 
to hegemony over the oceans and the appendant lands at the end of 
the 16th century. However, in terms of the contemporary law of the 
sea, it is worth reflecting that almost all the customary law results 
from unilateral acts, which by their reasonableness and the 
perception that they accord with the trends of history have been 
considered to be right and proper for the world community.
<P>
	I think in that respect our actions in the turbot war were right and 
in conformity with international law. In the House I made that 
suggestion at the time.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	This particular legislation does carry forward the imperative, 
which has always been part of Canadian post-war thinking and is to 
be found in the great diplomatic conferences in which we played 
such a leading part and which were carried on by governments of 
different political complexions at times but with the same general 
outlook. While it is true that the international law of the sea has 
moved from this law of movement, open to everybody, no rulings 
on property, to a narrower concept of national appropriation of 
economic resources, those new imperatives resulted from the clear 
fact that many countries were poor and had no resources and 
reached out to the fishery and mining resources and the like. 
Notwithstanding this change, a new drive or a new imperative has 
been received in international law thinking, and that is the 
obligation of conservation of scarce natural resources.
<P>
	If we look at this legislation we will see that it is a modest law. It 
is perhaps too long. It is true that civil servants in Canada and 
elsewhere draft laws that are longer and more complex than they 
need be, but the great truths are there. It is a compendium of the 
law. We have caught up in our national law with the emerging 
international law of the sea. In our presentation of that law we are 
more comprehensive than the most recent 1982 treaty that is at the 
point of being ratified by Canada.
<P>
	Also in our law we are providing this obligation of setting up the 
duty to monitor, supervise, and essentially act like a good citizen. 
In that we fulfil what civil law countries know in their law as the 
``droit du bon voisinage'', the law of good neighbourliness. The 
common law is less developed than the civil law, and international 
law has borrowed largely from the civil law principles. It is in that 
respect that the law is a very good law and is worth commending to 
you.
<P>
	Do not worry about questions of effects on federal-provincial 
constitutional powers. This law could not change them. They are 
sufficiently regulated by the Constitution and by the jurisprudence 
on it. On careful re-reading after hearing some members' questions 
on that, it is not my conclusion that the law in any way attempts to 
change that. Look to its larger purpose and  accept the fact also that 
it carries forward the case we successfully made a year ago in the 
so-called turbot war.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15012"> 15012 </A></B>
<P>
	Incidentally, there has never been any doubt in international law 
that a country's jurisdiction, including its criminal jurisdiction, 
extends beyond national territory, including national territorial 
waters. It is a clear principle that acts outside one's territory that 
impinge on or have effects within the territory are subject to 
national criminal jurisdiction. In fact, such jurisdiction has been 
asserted by English courts successfully since the 17th century and 
is part of the jurisprudence of most countries today.
<P>
	Therefore, it is my pleasure to commend Bill C-98 to this House 
as a codification and a progressive development of international 
law in the best traditions of those Canadian civil servants, 
politically neutral as they were, who did so much to establish the 
great international acts I have referred to in my discourse.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak today on Bill C-98 and in 
particular the amendment we have called for. The amendment is to 
put down this bill and refer the contents of it back to the committee. 
The reason is because this bill once again shows that this 
government is just doing window dressing on a number of serious 
issues.
<P>
	I am going to speak to Bill C-98, an act respecting the oceans. It 
would be a very welcome bill to help ratify the UN Convention on 
the Law of the Sea if it were something more than just window 
dressing.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	I will explain what we agree and disagree with in the bill and 
provide some constructive solutions that we humbly submit the 
government should pay heed to.
<P>
	We agree and commend the government in its effort to cost cut 
by streamlining the coast guard and by enacting the partnership 
programs which will save the taxpayer money, something we 
would all welcome. We agree with the intent of the oceans 
management strategy to co-ordinate the oceans strategy across 
provincial and federal governments.
<P>
	However do we need to create another level of bureaucracy to 
fulfil the oceans management strategy? Should this not be the 
responsibility of DFO? Why not convene representatives from the 
provinces and the federal government to develop a concerted 
strategy that DFO would monitor? Why do we need to create 
another level of bureaucracy to do it? Why do we need to create 
another group of people to watch people who watch other people, 
who watch people watching people do some work? This is ``Yes, 
Minister'' at its worst.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is a make work project.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> That is right. The 
minister truly believes that he is as interested in sustainable 
development as we all are, but from what I have heard in the House 
on the issue the facts bear that this is nonsense.
<P>
	I will tell the House what has been happening on both coasts, 
particularly the west coast where we are trying to avert the disaster 
that occurred on the east coast. I have repeatedly warned the 
minister of the devastating poaching that is taking place on the west 
coast. We have seen very little being done about it. The proof is in 
the pudding. All we need to do is look at the catchments that have 
come back this year in so many different fish species to see the 
devastation that has been wracked on our west coast fish species. 
There is a lot of poaching going on. I will give some examples.
<P>
	In Mill Bay in my riding there was a three-day salmon derby 
which 300 fishermen attended and caught seven salmon. On 
Hornby Island just a couple of months ago there was another 
salmon derby. The third prize winning fish was a dogfish because 
nobody caught any salmon. That is what is happening in the west 
coast salmon fishery.
<P>
	It is affecting groundfish and other species. One could not catch 
a ling cod if one's life depended on it. Shellfish are being 
decimated. The abalone fishery was closed in 1989 on the west 
coast. Yet there is widespread poaching of abalone all over the west 
coast. Just recently the ex-head of the Vancouver aquarium said 
that a large population of Asian individuals are pillaging the 
shellfish off Stanley Park.
<P>
	I invite the minister and the parliamentary secretary to come to 
Vancouver Island to see the decimation of the shellfish stocks. A 
number of Vietnamese individuals on Vancouver Island have been 
pillaging shellfish all over the island. DFO has been unable to deal 
with the problem. It is a huge problem as our shellfish stocks are 
being significantly affected. Furthermore the poachers are taking 
shellfish out of polluted areas.
<P>
	Seiners are vacuuming the ocean off Vancouver Island. Since 
1957 when the seiners first started catching salmon there has been a 
reproduceable inverse relationship between the intensity of seine 
fishing, the numbers of spawners that are coming back and the 
catchment by sports fishermen.
<P>
	Just a couple of years ago there was a revenge seine fishery to 
penalize the Americans, yet we decimated our own fish stocks. 
That is not sustainable management, but that was the decision 
made by the ministry.
<P>
	All salmon species are being decimated. All one has to do is go 
up the Fraser River to see what is happening. There are nets strung 
from one end to the other. Aboriginal people are stringing nets 
across the river and are pillaging and raping the fish stocks. The 
ministry knows that. It should be coming down on individuals who 
are hiding behind the aboriginal fish strategy to poach fish. They 
have been unwilling to do that because it is  politically incorrect. I 
strongly advise the ministry that for all people, aboriginal and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15013"> 15013 </A></B>
<P>
non-aboriginal people, it should have one commercial fishing 
strategy. It should enforce the laws for all people regardless of who 
they are.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Fish know no bounds. They do not care who is pillaging them, 
but there are individuals hiding behind their ethnic origins who are 
doing it, and because it is not politically expedient the DFO is 
unable and unwilling to deal with it.
<P>
	I do not blame the officers because they are hamstrung by 
mid-level bureaucrats that are hamstringing the minister. Part of 
the problem is in the bureaucracy. When DFO was reorganized it 
transferred decision making from hardworking DFO officers in the 
field to mid-level bureaucrats in Ottawa and Vancouver. The 
number of DFO officers went down.
<P>
	The result is that decisions are made a distance away from where 
the actual poaching is taking place. What we see are decisions that 
do not actually affect the problems in the fisheries. It has also 
contributed to the decimation of fish stocks on the west coast.
<P>
	I actually commend the ministry for increasing the numbers of 
fisheries officers somewhat, but I bring to its attention that it has 
also increased the bureaucracy. I give the example of what 
happened in my riding in Sooke where they closed the only 
fisheries office and increased the bureaucracy in Victoria.
<P>
	The result has been greatly increased pressure from poachers 
within Vancouver Island and poachers coming across the Strait of 
Juan de Fuca from America. They know full well they cannot fish 
in their own waters because of the decimation of the stocks. 
Therefore they come to good old Canada and decimate our stocks. 
They know they will not be penalized because fisheries officers are 
unprepared to deal with them.
<P>
	I bring to the attention of the ministry that the morale of DFO 
officers is at an all time low because mid-level bureaucrats have 
hamstrung them. They have made it unable for them to do their job 
or to acquire the means to do their job. The ministry needs to 
investigate the loss of morale. It is losing a lot of good people who 
have historically done a great job in fisheries.
<P>
	Another aspect is that groundfish are being decimated. We find 
that trollers are decimating the reefs all over the west coast in an 
effort to extract whatever fish are there. These delicate reefs are 
being smashed to pieces.
<P>
	We need one commercial fishing strategy. We also need to 
decrease the number of nets in the water. There are simply too 
many nets right now to make the extraction of species sustainable. 
We also need to decrease seiner activity and have a release program 
for adult Chinook salmon, which is possible if the weather is 
co-operative.
<P>
	We should try to preserve sports fishing capability, the reason 
being that sports fishing injects on a per fish basis much more than 
the commercial fishery, in fact about $37 per fish.
<P>
	We should enforce the law we have right now. I implore the 
ministry to enforce the laws we have. It has not been doing it. The 
poachers are aware of it and taking full advantage of the situation.
<P>
	There should be commercial fishing strategy for all people. We 
should not allow poachers to hide behind the aboriginal fishing 
strategy for their own personal financial gain, at the expense of all 
honest fishermen from all walks of life.
<P>
	We need to push for an extension of our jurisdiction beyond our 
200-mile zone. There is a doughnut in the Pacific Ocean where 
immature salmon go to fatten up. International poachers are 
pillaging that doughnut of fish which normally come back to us. 
The issue was investigated years ago. For a number of reasons the 
investigation was quashed internally. We need to try to enforce 
through international agreement the preservation of that area so we 
can ensure that a reasonable number of fish will come back to us.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	We also have to deal with the dumping of toxins that is occurring 
not only in our country but in others because they wind up in our 
ecosystem. I remind everyone of who is at the pinnacle of that 
ecosystem. The number one predator is man. This is what happens. 
Toxins are accumulated in an individual. The higher up one is in the 
predatory system, the more the toxins become concentrated and the 
greater chance they have of becoming carcinogenic and 
teratogenic.
<P>
	I strongly advise the minister to work with science research and 
development in the Department of the Environment rather than 
have the department work in isolation. There are many very 
talented and skilled scientists in the Ministry of the Environment 
who are doing a lot of incredible work on the issue of sustainable 
development with respect to the oceans. I suggest they tap into that 
resource for the benefit of the fishery.
<P>
	I also suggest co-operative effort between other ministries and a 
leadership role for DFO. I know it can play this role because it has 
many very talented people. We are looking for somebody to take a 
leadership role among the ministries and we have it within our 
capabilities.
<P>
	The minister claims, as I have said before, that he is very much 
in favour of sustainable management of our resources. Yet in 
British Columbia he is closing down hatcheries left, right and 
centre. They closed the hatchery down in Sooke. If we did not have 
those hatcheries we would not have a fishery. That is the cold hard 
reality. If we do not have them the number of spawners coming 
back are negligible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15014"> 15014 </A></B>
<P>
	I propose the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans should start up 
a sustainable hatchery in my riding near Sooke. The start-up costs 
are $1 million with a quarter million dollars per year. It could be 
self-financing in four years. I ask him to look at the proposal. It 
could inject over $90 million into Vancouver Island. Furthermore 
it would be self-financing. We just need some co-operation from 
the ministry to do it.
<P>
	I would also like to look at the area of aquaculture. We were a 
leader in aquaculture a few years ago. However, because of 
mismanagement and a lack of support from governments, Chile has 
now taken over from us in the aquaculture industry. We as a 
country can play a leadership role internationally in aquaculture.
<P>
	Some very good work is being done in a vet college on Prince 
Edward Island and at the University of Prince Edward Island on 
research in aquaculture that could enable Canada to garner a niche 
in aquaculture and become a leader in the area. The economic 
spinoff benefits for the west coast would be huge.
<P>
	I hope the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans will look into the 
matter and work in co-operation with the University of Prince 
Edward Island, and other universities that are similarly doing other 
exciting work, for the benefit of the people of the area and for the 
benefit of the resource.
<P>
	The minister also claimed that he was interested in looking at 
protecting spawning sites. I completely agree. Yet we do not have 
adequate data on the spawning sites as they exist. We need to 
acquire them.
<P>
	There is another aspect. There are other fisheries involving sea 
cucumbers, sea urchins and geoducks for which there is an open 
fishery. That would be absolutely fine except for the fact that we 
have absolutely no idea what stocks there are in these areas. We 
need to establish what the stocks are before we move ahead and 
cull a sustainable number of these species, to maintain a 
sustainable resource in these other shellfish species for the future.
<P>
	Bill C-98 has a lot of good intentions. Unfortunately it falls far 
short of what it was meant to be. I hope the ministry can ask for the 
opinions of people in the areas that are being affected by the 
fishery. I hope and pray we will not have an east coast disaster on 
the west coast. As we stand here now, poaching is widespread 
through virtually every species we can imagine. The only people 
who are going to be hurt are future Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	I would implore the minister once again to enforce the law for all 
people regardless of who they happen to be. It is not politically 
incorrect to enforce the law because the people who are poaching 
are of an immigrant population or are aboriginal people. It does not 
serve those people within those groups or any other group who are 
honest individuals within the industry and are  working within the 
legal framework of that industry to have any group of people within 
their population poaching the fish and other fish species.
<P>
	We need a sustainable fishery in this country. We can have a 
sustainable fishery in this country but we can only have it if the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans shows the leadership it is 
obligated to show. I and my colleagues in the Reform Party would 
be more than happy to help the government to work toward that 
end. It just takes the political will, strength and courage to do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member and I would like to commend him on 
some interesting ideas he has put forward. I took notes on many of 
his concerns.
<P>
	He spent some time on ensuring that enforcement and law and 
order is very important. The Reform Party often puts forward that 
if there are people illegally fishing or poaching we should take 
action. He would know that the Reform member for Delta was 
charged with illegally fishing and that whenever anyone does not 
abide by the law they will be charged as the member was under the 
DFO act.
<P>
	The member also talked about enforcement. He knows that one 
of the things we have accomplished this year is we were able to get 
an increase in the budget for enforcement. This is not an easy thing 
to do these days when there are tremendous budget cuts. As the 
Reform Party often brings forward we should be cutting the deficit 
and cutting our costs but this is one area where people such as the 
hon. member and others have told us that we need more 
enforcement. Therefore more enforcement has been added on the 
west coast. It is the one area where there has been a budget 
increase.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about the sports fishery. He knows that 
the sports fishery is very important from a tourism point of view in 
developing that whole industry. Would he and his party designate 
the chinook and coho as an exclusive sports fishery? I am 
interested to know his view on that topic and what his position 
would be.
<P>
	I also would like to hear his view on our new aquaculture 
strategy. I wonder whether he feels that is the right direction and 
whether he agrees with our new aquaculture strategy which was 
just brought in by the minister. We think aquaculture is very 
important. I would appreciate it if the hon. member could respond 
to those questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to preface my remarks by bringing forth a couple of the 
hon. member's concerns. My colleague did indeed put his nets into 
the water. Quite bluntly, the reason he put his nets into the water 
was to show that the law was not being enforced equally between 
aboriginals and non-aboriginals. I cannot comment on a situation 
that is going to be before the  courts but the motivation was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15015"> 15015 </A></B>
<P>
frustration. The facts are that the laws are not and were not being 
applied equally to both aboriginals and non-aboriginals.
<P>
	I just draw from a safety point of view the poaching I mentioned 
earlier along the Fraser River where aboriginal people were 
extending their nets right across the river and taking as much as 
they could possibly take. This was done in front of DFO officers. 
The DFO officers would not go in there because they were afraid of 
being shot and killed. I do not blame them but that is the reality 
under which we live.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	I would like to also ask if the taxes that are going to be applied to 
catchment also apply to aboriginal and non-aboriginal commercial 
fishermen. Do they also apply to commercial fishermen under the 
AFS? At some time in the future I would like to know the answer to 
that.
<P>
	The hon. member asked me about the chinook and coho 
fisheries. We know the numbers of both are declining quite 
dramatically and I would put the ball back in his court. Our first 
concern is to ensure we have adequate chinook and coho coming 
back into our waters as spawners. That is not happening right now. 
If we enable the hatcheries to occur, such as the one I mentioned 
which can be sustainable, then in time when we get a sufficient 
number of chinook and coho back, yes we could have a commercial 
fishery in that.
<P>
	The overriding concern we must have is to ensure that our 
chinook and coho and every other species are going to have 
sufficient sustainable numbers in our waters so that this resource 
can be increased over time. When it gets to a level that is 
considered to be sustainable, I am sure the ministry will have 
enough data to show how many fish can be taken off in a 
sustainable fashion in a commercial way.
<P>
	The aquaculture suggestions I mentioned to the hon. member are 
suggestions I have not seen put forth in any area by the ministry. If 
it is there, I would certainly like to be made aware of it. To my 
knowledge and from what I have seen, there is no record of the 
other constructive ideas I have put forth to the hon. member with 
respect to maximizing our aquaculture capabilities within Canada.
<P>
	As I said before, I have no doubt that Canada can be a world 
leader in aquaculture because we have superb research taking place 
now. There is no reason that not only can we do this domestically 
but there are also enormous international trade possibilities in 
aquaculture existing around the world. In the future with our 
resources being decimated, we are going to need new sources of 
protein to feed the burgeoning populations in this world. 
Aquaculture could provide a large part of that protein.
<P>
	There are great opportunities for Canada. I am sure the hon. 
member will pass that information back to the minister so he can 
act on it forthwith.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to speak to Bill C-98, an act respecting the oceans of 
Canada, at second reading and to address the amendment before 
this honourable House.
<P>
	It is a privilege to support Bill C-98 in principle and to support 
its objectives and its implementation. The people of Central Nova 
applaud the due diligence and leadership role the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans has played in our country since assuming his 
responsibilities as Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	Thanks to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, our Canadian 
people have a renewed hope, a new vision for our coastal 
communities: protection for our fisheries and oceans. Finally, we 
have a human face of compassion amidst our fisheries crisis in 
Canada.
<P>
	On Tuesday the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans addressed this 
House on the oceans act and its importance to the maritime nation 
which is Canada. The vision of the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans is to make Canada a world leader in oceans and marine 
resource management through this legislation. He enunciated for us 
the mission which this government has set for itself, to manage 
Canada's oceans in close co-operation with others so that our 
oceans are clean, safe, productive and accessible.
<P>
	In my riding of Central Nova there exists the north shore and the 
eastern shore of the Atlantic Ocean. My constituents applaud the 
vision of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans which he boldly 
pronounced on November 15, 1994 in the document ``A Vision for 
Oceans Management''. This document is based on the 
recommendations of the National Advisory Board on Science and 
Technology Report on Oceans and Coasts. At that time the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans said: ``It has been long recognized for a 
long time that there is a need for one act to clearly assert Canada's 
sovereign rights and responsibilities over its oceans and 
territories''.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Our minister of fisheries pointed to the proprietary pride which 
Canadians have in their oceans: the Atlantic, the Pacific and the 
Arctic. These are fundamental to much of our existence, 
individually and as a nation. They have provided the means of 
transportation, trading, communications and subsistence from time 
immemorial. Generations have depended on our oceans for food, 
clothing and even medicine.
<P>
	Canada with its three coasts has the longest coastline in the 
world and the second largest continental shelf spanning more than 
six and a half million kilometres. As the Minister of Fisheries and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15016"> 15016 </A></B>
<P>
Oceans pointed out in his vision document, Canada's oceans are 
equal to half of our territorial land mass and have been a key to our 
evolution culturally and economically. Fisheries, transportation 
and shipping, tourism and recreation, offshore oil and gas have all 
been beacons of hope and  economic stability for numerous coastal 
communities along all three oceans.
<P>
	In his 1994 vision paper the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
related as well the need to diversify our reliance on the maritime 
resources in light of the collapse of groundfish stocks along the east 
coast and in light of ever increasing stress being placed on the 
maritime habitat by our society. Critical habitat destruction, 
foreign and domestic overfishing, as well as marine and 
atmospheric pollution were all cause for concern.
<P>
	This government recognized that a new oceans management 
regime was needed, one based on an ecological approach and on 
the development of an integrated management system for all 
activities affecting oceans and coastal waters. The time had come. 
The wake-up alarm had sounded for all Canadians to turn away 
from the band-aid measures of short term need to a policy which 
would result in the sustainable use of resources and environmental 
protection.
<P>
	Through the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans the Government 
of Canada identified several key objectives of any new legal 
instrument:
<P>
	First, to preserve and protect the oceans' environment, the 
ecosystems and resources they contain. Second, to establish a 
framework and guidelines to manage the oceans' resources, both 
renewable and non-renewable, on an economically sustainable and 
environmentally acceptable basis. Third, to enhance, focus, 
co-ordinate and disseminate Canada's scientific, environmental 
and management information relating to oceans and their 
resources. Fourth, to assert and enforce Canada's sovereign rights 
and responsibilities over its ocean resources and areas. Fifth, to 
establish the legal framework to support the implementation of this 
oceans management strategy. Sixth, to establish a clearly 
identifiable lead federal agency accountable for oceans 
management.
<P>
	As the minister suggested, this should best be initiated by the 
development and passage of Canada's oceans act. As the minister 
pointed out to the House, Canada's oceans policy at present is like a 
big jigsaw puzzle, the pieces all scattered in front of us waiting for 
us to fit them all together. It is not easy to visualize the entire 
picture without seeing the box which the puzzle came in and its 
cover illustration. However, a great deal of work has gone into 
visualizing what the whole picture must be and determining a 
logical pattern for the pieces to be placed together, pieces as 
diverse as deep ocean research and cold ocean rescues, inspection 
and protection, emergency responses and sustainability, 
conservation and commercialization, navigational safety and 
national security, national goals and regional initiatives, restoration 
of our marine resources, and job creation.
<P>
	We all know that it will take many minds to finish the puzzle in 
time for all Canadians to enjoy the results of the effort. From the 
outset this has not been the vision of  one person or one group of 
persons imposed upon the rest of us. The Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans has signalled clearly his openness toward full participation 
in the process so that all sides of the House, all stakeholders, all 
organizations, disciplines and sectors of society having an interest 
in our oceans can contribute.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Consultation has been a hallmark of the government in the 
carrying out of its responsibilities but the minister has sought 
more; namely, a partnership for a successful conclusion to this 
challenge; this beckoning to us from the future generations of 
Canada.
<P>
	Through this legislation, Canada will be bringing into its own 
domestic law provisions for 200 nautical miles from its low water 
line to which it is already entitled as part of the modern 
international community.
<P>
	Canada is taking on its rights and responsibilities as a member of 
the global community, a community with a growing realization that 
our actions are all interdependent, whether at the most local 
community level or at the level of global interaction and 
co-operation for survival.
<P>
	The oceans act makes it possible for the federal government to 
solicit and expand partnerships in the many enterprises involved in 
scientific research, maritime communications and safety, fisheries 
conservation, management enforcement, underwater exploration 
and seabed mining, the understanding and sustainable exploitation 
of marine plants, the maintenance of trading routes through block 
ice.
<P>
	It makes us all working shareholders in the development of a 
flexible, workable and ecologically sound ocean strategy for today 
and for the future, one well in keeping with Canada's motto, from 
sea to sea to sea.
<P>
	In conclusion, this is a vision of Canada as being much more 
than the Rockies, the Laurentian Shield and great plains between 
them, of great cities lining up at our southern borders; it is also a 
view of myriad port cities and coastal communities, of diverse 
marine activities extending economic and social benefit to future 
generations brought to us by the rolling swells and rippled waves of 
blue beginnings at the edges of our land maps.
<P>
	The oceans act is a vision of the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans and of the Government of Canada. However, it is more than 
that: in its ink and paper, in the millions of electronic impulses and 
images which have gone into its preparation and discussion and 
communication from this very Chamber, it represents the 
aspirations of millions of Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15017"> 15017 </A></B>
<P>
	It is a declaration by a maritime nation that it will continue to 
shoulder the challenges of the present but that it welcomes the 
support of all concerned as it navigates into the future.
<P>
	A special thank you to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans from 
all Canadians for Bill C-98 and for recognizing the importance of 
the maritime nation which is Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of the 
oceans act and, in so doing, to pay tribute to its author, the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans. In the short time he has occupied that post 
he has shown exemplary leadership by leading our country through 
one of the worst crisis in the Atlantic fishery and turning that 
difficult situation on the Atlantic coast, and as well in other 
respects on the Pacific coast, into an opportunity for Canada to 
assert its pride as a nation internationally and its sense of 
leadership on behalf of the world's oceans.
<P>
	The oceans act which was tabled on Tuesday and which the 
minister addressed on Tuesday is, as he has pointed out, legislation 
that constitutes one element, but a major element, in the overall 
strategy of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to intensify its 
effort toward the oceans and will be complemented by a number of 
other policies and activities in the months ahead.
<P>
	The objectives of the oceans act are to recognize in domestic law 
Canada's jurisdiction over its ocean areas and their resources, to 
provide the legislative framework for a new oceans management 
regime and to regroup key federal ocean related statutes under the 
oceans act.
<P>
	The legislation consists of three parts, each of which contains the 
regulatory enforcement and operational authorities required for its 
implementation.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	Part I is Canada's maritime zones. This part defines Canada's 
maritime zones by incorporating provisions of the Territorial Sea 
and Fishing Zones Act. It declares Canada's rights and jurisdiction 
over the contiguous zone and the exclusive economic zone and it 
defines the minimum limits of Canada's continental shelf as 
provided for by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the 
Sea.
<P>
	Let me point out that the declaration of the contiguous zone and 
of an exclusive economic zone is in full agreement with 
international practice. The limitation of Canada's maritime zones 
also outlines the area over which Canada will now apply its new 
oceans management strategy.
<P>
	In accordance with the government's efforts to consolidate key 
ocean legislation under the umbrella of the oceans act, provisions 
of the Territorial Sea and  Fishing Zones Act and the Canadian 
Laws Offshore Applications Act are incorporated into the this bill. 
This legislation further emphasizes Canada's rights with respect to 
the continental shelf. Canada has rights to living organisms 
belonging to sedentary species on or in the shelf and jurisdiction 
over the exploration and the exploitation of minerals and 
non-living resources of the seabed and of the subsoil.
<P>
	The declaration of Canadian jurisdiction over the territorial sea 
and the contiguous zone and the exclusive zone is crucial. Most 
Canadians may not know these technical terms, but many 
Canadians will have heard the phrases 12-mile zone and 200-mile 
zone. Canada's territorial sea extends from the coastline out 12 
nautical miles. In the territorial sea Canada has full jurisdiction to 
ocean waters, to the seabed beneath these waters and the space 
above.
<P>
	The contiguous zone will extend an additional 12 nautical miles 
from the outer edge of the territorial sea. In this zone Canada will 
have the power to enforce our criminal, fiscal, immigration, 
sanitary and customs laws.
<P>
	The exclusive economic zones will encompass all of the ocean 
area out to 200 nautical miles from the coastal baseline. In this 
zone Canada will have jurisdiction for exploring and exploiting, 
conserving and managing the living and non-living resources of the 
waters, seabed and subsoil. Canada's jurisdiction in this zone will 
cover marine scientific research, protection and preservation of the 
marine environment and artificial islands, installations and 
structures.
<P>
	Through this legislation Canada will establish major new rights 
over the ocean. In the councils of the world Canadians pushed hard 
to establish these rights. These new zones grant Canada powers that 
go well beyond the powers our country asserted in the past. The bill 
will put in place a clear definition of jurisdiction that is fully 
supported by global agreement.
<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans expressed this clearly on 
Tuesday in the House when he stated: ``The world backs Canada's 
jurisdiction over Canadian waters''.
<P>
	This brings me to Part II, oceans management strategy. This part 
commits us to the development of a new method by which we shall 
manage the oceans and their resources. It identifies the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans as the federal authority responsible for the 
co-ordination and facilitation of the development and 
implementation with stakeholders of an oceans management 
strategy. It provides the minister with the necessary statutory 
authority to do so. This part also authorizes the minister to create 
marine protected areas for the protection of the fishery resource.
<P>
	Let me review the goals of the strategy outlined in the 
legislation. One goal is to integrate planning and management of 
activities within and among jurisdictions. Another is to reduce 
regulatory duplication and conflict.  Still another is to increase the 
effectiveness of environmental protection measures and to replace 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15018"> 15018 </A></B>
<P>
existing sectoral approach to resource management in favour of a 
more comprehensive ecosystem-based approach.
<P>
	The act thus provides the building blocks for integrated 
management and sustainable development of Canada's ocean 
resources. It outlines a new ecosystems approach to marine 
resource management. It provides a common focus for federal 
responsibilities and consolidates federal programs. It gives 
Canadians legislative tools with which to begin working on ocean 
management holistically, rather than sectorally.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	We have long known the need for sustainable development of 
resources. This need was clearly put forward in the report of the 
1987 World Commission on Environment and Development, better 
known as the Bruntland report after its chairman, Gro Harlem 
Bruntland, now Prime Minister of Norway.
<P>
	Here is how the commission defined sustainable development: 
``Activity in which the environment is fully incorporated into the 
economic decision-making process as a forethought, not an 
afterthought''. The report called for: ``Development that meets the 
needs of the present, without compromising the ability of the future 
generations to meet their own needs''. The government is acting on 
the commission's call.
<P>
	Last year the National Advisory Board of Science and 
Technology called for an oceans act to address the needs of ocean 
frontier development for the present and the future. The advisory 
board called for Canada to develop a proactive oceans policy that 
plans for the future, rather than just responds to crisis.
<P>
	In November 1994, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
released a document setting out the potential elements of an ocean 
management vision for Canada. The government sought the advice 
of Canadians across the country. Certain themes recurred in that 
advice. The federal government has a leadership role to play in 
oceans policy. There should be one federal department taking the 
lead in developing a new strategy. People want to be involved 
locally in developing solutions to regional priorities. There is a 
need to sustain resources and to diversify.
<P>
	Such was the advice we received. It came from provinces, 
municipalities, coastal residents, fishermen, business, labour, 
environmentalists and scientists. The bill before us sets out the 
elements of an oceans policy. But all Canadians must be involved 
in developing specific mechanisms, planning and management 
structures, as well as the guidelines and standards needed to bring 
about sustainable use of oceans and their resources.
<P>
	The oceans management strategy envisaged by this legislation is 
broad in scope and flexible in  implementation. It recognizes the 
consensus building that is needed for a cohesive and coherent 
oceans policy for our country.
<P>
	Again, let me quote the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans from 
his address to the House on Tuesday: ``The bill identifies federal 
leadership and commitment to a comprehensive approach to oceans 
management. The bill seeks to address regulatory duplication, 
conflict and inadequacies that result in inefficiencies, failure to 
protect the environment and impediments to development and this 
bill is founded on the principle that long term solutions require 
long term co-operation''.
<P>
	The oceans act will give the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, on 
behalf of the Government of Canada, legal authority to draw 
together all of Canada's ocean stakeholders, to develop a strategy 
based on the sustainable development and integrated management 
of activities and resources in estuarine, coastal and marine waters.
<P>
	The act provides the authority to develop the actual mechanisms 
to implement the new strategy. It gives the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans the ability to enter into new partnership agreements in 
order to ensure that the ocean management strategy meets regional 
needs and fulfils regional aspirations.
<P>
	Part III deals with the powers, duties and functions of the 
minister. This part provides for consolidation and clarification of 
federal responsibilities for managing Canada's oceans. It reflects 
the enhanced mandate of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
and it provides statutory authority for Canadian Coast Guard 
functions transferred to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
Those functions include provision of services for the safe, 
economical and efficient movement of ships in Canadian waters; 
the marine component of the federal search and rescue program; 
pleasure craft safety and marine pollution prevention and response, 
as well as ships, aircraft and other marine services in support of 
other federal programs, boards and agencies.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	Oceans related provisions previously contained in other 
legislation have been incorporated into this section of the act. Most 
notable is the authority of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
to conduct hydrographic, oceanographic and marine scientific 
surveys, to conduct research and to publish various products.
<P>
	As the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans observed at the last 
debate on the oceans act, with this legislation we are coming to the 
successful conclusion of a long and dramatic chapter in Canada's 
maritime history. With this legislation we are coming to the 
beginning of a new and even more vital chapter in that history.
<P>
	The Canada oceans act will give our country and exclusive 
economic zone covering almost 5 million square  kilometres of the 
Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans. With the passage of this act 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15019"> 15019 </A></B>
<P>
Canada will effectively increase by one-half as our jurisdiction will 
encompass both the land mass and the oceans.
<P>
	As the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans said, the Canada oceans 
act does expand our notion of Canada as a country. The oceans 
management strategy increases the priority we place as a society on 
wise development of our waters. It signals that Canada and 
Canadians are prepared to act in making the most of our ocean 
assets, opportunities and obligations.
<P>
	The fisheries and oceans minister has aptly described the Canada 
oceans act as the last step forward toward formal jurisdiction over 
Canada's ocean territory. However, the act is also the first step 
toward recognizing the extraordinary importance and potential of 
this vast territory.
<P>
	In legislative terms the bill establishes jurisdiction over 
Canada's ocean area and ocean resources. It establishes the primary 
rules and provides the tools to help support Canada's new oceans 
management regime. It consolidates and clarifies federal 
responsibilities for managing Canada's oceans.
<P>
	In real life terms the bill marks a transition in Canadians' 
relationship with our oceans. It marks an acceptance of reciprocal 
obligation; as the oceans benefit us, so we are agreeing to act to 
benefit the oceans.
<P>
	The oceans act signals a renewal of Canada's leadership in 
oceans management. With this act we are asserting Canada's role 
as a world leader. Sustainable development is a goal to which all 
nations must be committed, not only of the fisheries resource but of 
all ocean resources.
<P>
	There may be seven seas but there is only one ocean. The oceans 
make up one single global organism connected by great currents 
flowing from hemisphere to hemisphere. Oceans play a vital role in 
regulating our climate. Oceans also play a key role in the water 
cycle, the chemistry of the atmosphere and the making of climate 
and weather. Oceans also supply us not only with food but also 
energy, minerals and medicines.
<P>
	With the oceans act Canada will be in an even stronger position 
to show the world the way of conserving ocean resources. As the 
member for the Cape Breton Highlands-Canso, a constituency 
which depends greatly on the oceans near its coasts, be it for 
fishing or as a vital link in eastern Canada for ocean protection, for 
conservation and for environmental response through the Strait of 
Canso, I am very pleased to greet this Canada oceans act and the 
co-ordination and consolidation that it represents in Canada's 
oceans policy.
<P>
	I am pleased also to support the government in bringing this 
legislation forward as well as the initiatives which will flow from 
this initiative in expanding Canada's sense of responsibility over 
the oceans and also in  continuing the leadership which our 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has demonstrated to the great 
pride of all Canadians in taking the lead in the world in managing 
our ocean environment.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened with interest for the last several hours to the 
debate with regard to this bill.
<P>
	I find something very disturbing as I look through it. I have been 
very involved in Bill C-68, the gun control bill. Now I look at Bill 
C-98 and at many other bills before the House and there is a trend 
that disturbs me very much, a trend toward centralizing power in 
Ottawa, the big bubble, the place that seems to lose touch with the 
concerns of grassroots Canadians, the concerns that people have 
out there trying to make a living, trying to find a livelihood they 
can depend on. This bill does not address that. In some instances it 
makes it even more difficult. Let me explain.
<P>
	A bloated bureaucracy is being developed. There is the minister 
centralizing power within his office. It is a very top heavy 
administration, just like in agriculture, an area I am very familiar 
with. A study was done. In agriculture we have approximately 1 
bureaucrat for every 5.8 farmers.
<P>
	If we look at the fishing industry, how many bureaucrats does it 
take for the fishermen to fish, to do their work? We have through 
this bill even more of this type of bureaucracy developing.
<P>
	I listened to what was said, things like we need to co-ordinate, 
we need to do all these wonderful things. Are they just 
euphemisms? Are those code words for more bloated bureaucracy?
<P>
	I look at other things in the bill. The governments says it will 
need fees to cut back on the deficits in this area. This is just another 
word for taxes these fishermen will have to pay.
<P>
	It was an eye opener for me to go to New Brunswick a couple of 
weeks ago, to the southwestern part of the province, and talk with 
the fishermen who are being squeezed out of the fishery by the 
regulations the government is putting in place, by the taxes in the 
form of fees which are driving these fishermen out of work. I find 
that unacceptable. The bill makes that even more possible. We have 
to start addressing the real concerns of real people out there.
<P>
	Is it the intention of the government to give big corporations 
more power to fish? If we talk to the people out there they will tell 
us about the draggers, the big chains destroying the environment. I 
hear the member speaking about how the government will protect 
the environment and protect all of these things. That is not 
happening. That is not the reality of what is happening.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15020"> 15020 </A></B>
<P>
	These people are allowed to fish and the handliners are being 
restricted. They are not being allowed to fish. It does not make 
sense that we allow these huge boats that carry these big chains 
or drag these big nets to fish every day of the week but the 
handliners are being restricted to one or two days and sometimes 
not even that.
<P>
	We have a real problem and the bill does not address that 
problem. The government is out of touch with reality. It is 
becoming obvious to Atlantic Canadians that big central 
government, just like it has become obvious to the Bloc and the 
people of Quebec and the people of western Canada, is attempting 
to centralize power and this big central government grabbing this 
power is not the answer to the needs of people out there. That is a 
big problem.
<P>
	What about allowing more fishermen a say in their industry? Is 
there anything built into the bill, any structure, whereby they can 
have elected boards or make their bureaucrats and politicians more 
accountable? I do not see it. It is not there.
<P>
	It sounds so good to have Ottawa co-ordinate all this stuff. I 
think it is just another euphemism, another excuse for more big 
government.
<P>
	The bill also makes it possible for special interest groups to 
influence the minister and the bureaucrats to get their way. That is 
probably happening already at this time.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	The government could have done things like extend the 200-mile 
limit to solve some of these problems, but they are not in here. The 
teeth for this I do not find in the bill.
<P>
	In Canada there are over 6,000 department of fisheries officials 
managing 65,000 licences. It sounds just like the department of 
agriculture, a huge number of bureaucrats. The fishermen do not 
warrant such numbers.
<P>
	The department operates with a budget that exceeds $750 
million to administer it. Clearly there is room for a little cost 
cutting at the very top, and not simply increasing the fees of the 
fishermen. Perhaps the minister could lead by example and save a 
little money on his office furniture. That was a concern; maybe one 
less oak table could have helped one more fisherman in Atlantic 
Canada. It would say the minister and the department are not 
treating the fishermen with absolute disdain if there were some 
cutbacks made by him and by the department.
<P>
	It is adamantly clear the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is not 
committed to downsizing his bloated department. He would rather 
try to slip a new level of bureaucracy into his department under the 
guise of broad consultation rather than deal with the harsh realities 
of downsizing.
<P>
	Has the minister not got the message? Canadians want less 
government. Everywhere I go they repeat government members 
should be listening but they are not. Canadians want less 
government.
<P>
	What the Atlantic fishermen tell us in no uncertain terms is their 
distress over the licensing fees for Atlantic Canadian fishermen is a 
very serious matter. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans wants 
to collect $50 million in access fees from the fishermen who ply 
their trade in the waters off the coast of Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	These fees are just taxes, as I have already explained. No matter 
how the Liberals dress them up they are simply more taxes. Fees 
are nothing new to the industry but it is irresponsible for the 
government and the minister to subject the fishermen of a region 
already devastated by mismanagement to further hardship.
<P>
	These people are having a rough time. They cannot afford this. 
Talk to them when they have to increase their fees from less than 
$100 to four times that amount. Some of them will have to pay up 
to $16,000 if they want to fish in certain parts of the industry.
<P>
	It is ridiculous that a government would expect them to come up 
with that kind of money. That is more than their net income in an 
entire year. This tax will only make things worse for the fishermen. 
It will be an unbearable burden on all fishermen from coast to 
coast, not just the people of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, 
Newfoundland or P.E.I.
<P>
	The tax increase will be enormous. The Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans collects about $13 million in licence fees and its goal is 
to increase this to $50 million, three to four times the present 
amount. That is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	Any Atlantic Canadian MP who speaks up for the fishermen in 
his or her own riding knows well they may end up in political 
oblivion. The bureaucracy that has developed within the Liberal 
Party, within this Ottawa bubble, has made it so that the common 
people cannot even have their voice heard.
<P>
	Another problem is that in the future any decisions made on the 
new fees will be through governor in council decrees without 
parliamentary scrutiny. We saw the same thing on gun control, Bill 
C-68.
<P>
	The minister gives himself absolute power to make these 
regulations, to do these things behind closed doors. That is not 
acceptable in this day and age. We need to open things up. We need 
to give the fishermen a voice in what is happening in their own 
affairs.
<P>
	What message does this send to Canadians on the accountability 
of government? Governments need to be more accountable and I do 
not see it happening in the bill. I wish I could go on. I appreciate the 
time I have had to represent the people of New Brunswick. I hope 
the government will listen.

	The House resumed from May 29 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-316, an act to amend the Immigration Act and the 
Transfer of Offenders Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-316 
today. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the hon. 
member for Cambridge for his efforts in this regard.
<P>
	The intent of the bill is simple: non-citizens convicted of serious 
criminal offences in Canada should be deported. There is nothing 
earth-shattering in this idea. In fact, it is currently the law of the 
land.
<P>
	Bill C-316 attempts to bring some certainty to the process by 
having the deportation incorporated into the offender's sentence. I 
can see why the hon. member for Cambridge found it necessary to 
try to bring some certainty to the process. It is not there now.
<P>
	Many who have spoken in opposition to the bill, including the 
parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, have stated that what we have in place now is more 
than sufficient. The reality is that there are major deficiencies in 
our present legislation, even with Bill C-44. On occasion these 
deficiencies have outrageous and tragic consequences.
<P>
	I would like to advise the House about a current case taking 
place in British Columbia. On September 23, 1993, Hector 
Lopez-Tello, a Guatemalan refugee claimant, was convicted of 
drug trafficking and ordered deported. He was allowed to remain in 
Canada while he appealed the deportation order. On April 28 of this 
year Francisco Castro, a refugee claimant from El Salvador, was 
also ordered deported after being convicted of drug trafficking. He 
was also allowed to remain in Canada while he appealed. On May 7 
Lopez-Tello, Castro, and a third refugee claimant were arrested and 
charged with the second degree murder of 24-year-old Matthew 
McKay. The three murder suspects appear in court on October 16 
of this year.
<P>
	Meanwhile, McKay left behind a wife, a 16-month-old daughter, 
and a mother who wonders about Canada's justice system and 
immigration system. She should wonder. How does a man like 
Francisco Castro get to  continue to walk the streets of Canada 
when, according to an IRB spokesperson, he had an extensive 
criminal record for trafficking in a narcotic?
<P>
	We provide the man with refuge and instead of thanking us he 
involves himself in the drug trade. When he is ordered deported he 
takes advantage of the numerous appeals available to refugee 
claimants and walks the street a free man. Meanwhile, a young man 
is murdered and leaves behind a wife and child.
<P>
	If ever the hon. member for Cambridge needed an example as to 
why his bill should succeed, this is it. If Lopez-Tello and Castro 
had been deported immediately after their drug trafficking 
convictions, maybe Matthew McKay would still be alive today.
<P>
	Most Canadians think that we should be deporting these 
individuals. Less than a year ago I included the following question 
in one of my householders: Should immigrants or refugees 
convicted of serious offences be automatically deported? I received 
2,829 responses to the survey, of which 2,744 people, or 97 per 
cent, said yes. Only 61 people, or 3 per cent, disagreed. That shows 
us the support that is out there for such legislation.
<P>
	The Canadian people have traditionally been generous in 
welcoming new immigrants to this country. We welcome people 
from countries all over the world to come to Canada to start new 
lives. We welcome legitimate refugees fleeing war and oppression 
in their homelands. However, Canadians' hospitality does not 
extend to criminals. Those who enter Canada illegally, with 
criminal records, or those who commit serious criminal offences 
once they arrive in Canada should not expect an equally generous 
reception. Those with criminal records prior to their entry to 
Canada are inadmissible; thus, they should not even be in this 
country. However, those who commit serious criminal offences in 
Canada have violated the basic agreement of their welcome to 
Canada. In exchange for a safe haven or the opportunity to start a 
new life that Canada offers refugees or immigrants, we have every 
reason to expect these individuals to obey the laws of our land. If 
they do not, they have sent us a clear message that they are not 
prepared to live up to their end of the bargain. Why should we feel 
compelled to allow these individuals to remain in Canada when 
they are telling us that they are not going to play by our rules? The 
deportation of these individuals should be automatic-end of the 
argument.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	This brings us back to Bill C-316. Many of those who have 
spoken before me have pointed out some of the technical flaws of 
the bill. Yes, there are problems, but nothing that cannot be 
corrected by amendments made at committee or report stage. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15022"> 15022 </A></B>
<P>
intent of this bill is sound. It deserves the opportunity for further 
hearing.
<P>
	It is important that this House send two important messages. The 
first message should be sent to immigrants  or refugees intent on 
committing serious criminal offences: If you commit a serious 
crime, on top of the other penalty that you may receive, you will be 
deported. The second message needs to go to the Canadian people, 
and that is that this Parliament is intent on ridding Canada of 
foreign criminals. This is most important.
<P>
	Although those immigrants and refugees who commit serious 
crimes are a very small minority, they receive all the headlines. 
Canadians become outraged when they see the difficulty we have in 
deporting these criminals. It ends up bringing the entire 
immigration and refugee program into disrepute. Thus, we have to 
show Canadians that we are prepared to get rid of these few 
individuals who adversely affect the reputations of all immigrants 
and refugees.
<P>
	Passing Bill C-316 will demonstrate that we are prepared to deal 
with the issue and deal with it quickly. It deserves a full and 
comprehensive hearing. Those in favour of the bill and those 
opposed should have the opportunity to appear before the 
committee and present their views. From there the committee can 
make whatever amendments necessary to make this a workable 
piece of legislation. After all, if the government made over 80 
amendments to Bill C-68 at report stage, and that was its own 
legislation, we should have no problem in amending this bill. 
Those who are convinced that the final product is not acceptable 
can still vote against it at third reading. However, it deserves the 
opportunity to pass second reading and go to the committee.
<P>
	I urge all members of this House to consider the bill carefully 
and to give it their support at second reading.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, before I get into the specifics of 
the bill I would like to take a minute to talk about my colleague, the 
member for Cambridge.
<P>
	Many of you who sat in the previous Parliament or two 
Parliaments ago would remember that the member for Cambridge, 
Mr. Chris Speyer, Conservative member of Parliament, devoted 
most of his time to issues related to securing safety in the streets 
and law and order in this country. In fact he distinguished himself 
in this House working on such issues and later he was appointed to 
the Federal Court of Canada.
<P>
	Our colleague, when he was elected in the last election, had a 
tremendous challenge in front of him, quite frankly, to fill those 
shoes. It is obvious that in less than two years he has already, on 
behalf of the community of Cambridge, filled those shoes and gone 
beyond. I think that today's bill is not only representative of the 
feelings and views a lot of his own community has, but it is also a 
representation of what I know most of the people in my community 
in downtown Toronto feel. It is a bill that my community would 
want supported.
<P>
	I salute my colleague from Cambridge for a tremendous effort in 
bringing this private member's bill before the House.
<P>
	It is great to see that the Reform Party members are getting 
behind this bill. It is very rare that a member can bring to the House 
of Commons a bill and achieve such all-party consensus. That is a 
great achievement for a member of Parliament in his first term.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-316 has a personal appeal to me because the parents and a 
lot of the relatives of Georgina Leimonis lived in my riding. In my 
downtown Toronto riding there are more members of the Greek 
community than any other community outside of Athens. Our 
community was deeply disturbed by the tragic death of Georgina. 
This is a very specific example of why this bill must be passed, 
must go to committee, must be properly amended and made the law 
of the land.
<P>
	Bill C-316 enables the court, in addition to any other sentence, to 
order the removal of a non-citizen convicted of an offence 
punishable by 10 or more years. It accelerates the deportation 
process and would save Canadian taxpayers money, because two 
separate hearings, immigration and sentencing, would not be 
needed. This bill does not apply to anyone who arrived in Canada 
prior to 16 years of age.
<P>
	Today in our correctional service system, our prisons, there are 
non-citizens who are using this defect in our current law, and it is 
costing the taxpayers of Canada close to $50 million a year. 
Conceivably, for the same group who are in our prisons today, that 
same group, without any increase, over the term of a government 
we would be talking $250 million.
<P>
	When the fiscal framework of this country is in such tough 
condition and we are all trying to the best of our ability to be frugal 
and to cut and eliminate waste and duplication, it seems to me that 
alongside the basic justice in the bill there is also an economic 
factor that has to be looked at.
<P>
	If we did not support this bill it is not inconceivable that within 
two or three years it could cost the taxpayers of Canada $150 
million a year to look after non-Canadians who have criminal 
offences as part of their record and who are abusing our laws. I 
believe this is another factor in the equation.
<P>
	Another thing I believe we must understand is that the member 
for Cambridge did not just listen to his own community and 
members here; he went to other organizations. I want to quote 
specifically from a letter he received from Victims of Violence, the 
Canadian Centre for Missing Children: ``Mr. Peric's bill focuses on 
those immigrants who have committed serious criminal offences, 
sometimes violent. His bill distinguishes the criminals from the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15023"> 15023 </A></B>
<P>
overwhelming majority of law-abiding immigrants. Those 
convicted of offences punishable by  10 years or more should be 
deported from Canada as quickly as possible. Victims of Violence 
would like to congratulate Mr. Peric on his efforts. On behalf of the 
Canadian public and the many crime victims we serve throughout 
Canada, we would like to thank him.''
<P>
	CAVEAT has written a similar endorsement. The Canadian 
Police Association has written to support the bill of the member for 
Cambridge.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	I urge all members to look into the bill. We have a unique 
opportunity to get behind it in committee. As the member for 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, the immigration critic for 
the Reform Party, stated earlier, the bill has some flaws that can be 
amended in committee. However the overall thrust or the overall 
approach is right. I urge all members of the House to get behind the 
member's bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak this evening on Bill C-316. As has 
been pointed out by many hon. colleagues who have already 
spoken to the bill, there are a number of problems with it. However 
the private member bringing it forward did not have access to a 
battery of lawyers or experts in the departments of justice or 
immigration to point them out.
<P>
	The role of private members is to bring good ideas for legislation 
forward. It is the role of the House and the committee to which it is 
assigned to improve it and make it workable. In this case I believe 
the member for Cambridge has focused the attention of the House 
on a problem Canadians want to see solved. It is now our job to 
ensure the bill makes it to committee where we will have the 
benefit of the expertise of departmental officials who have been 
studying the issue. I am sure the hon. member would agree to 
changes that maintain the spirit and intent of the bill while making 
it legally defensible.
<P>
	Canadians want non-citizens who commit abhorrent crimes 
deported. It is our duty as their elected representatives to ensure the 
bill does not get buried in committee. We must send a clear 
message to other criminals who believe they are living in a land 
where there are relatively light consequences for breaking the law.
<P>
	If we have the political will we can overcome any road blocks. 
By failing to act in an expeditious manner to treat the deportation 
of non-citizen criminals as a high priority, the government is not 
acting in the best interest of the safety of Canadians.
<P>
	Canadians want to see criminals dealt with decisively. They will 
be much more willing to accept the fact that the vast majority of 
immigrants respect our laws if they see a government commitment 
to immediate deportation of those who break them.
<P>
	I have heard Liberal colleagues across the way say that 
sentencing foreign criminals to deportation would be cruel and 
unusual punishment under the charter. Frankly, if they do not 
respect any of our other laws, they can exercise their charter rights 
somewhere else in the world.
<P>
	The charter of rights has an implied charter of responsibilities. 
We already treat non-citizens differently by denying them the right 
to vote. We already deny convicted criminals the freedom of 
mobility. I do not think it is beyond the spirit or intent of the charter 
to deny non-citizens convicted of violent crimes or drug trafficking 
the right to remain in Canada.
<P>
	In the meantime too many criminals are tying up our legal 
system and slipping out the side door while we bend over backward 
to apply the charter to protect their rights. The charter seems to be 
the only piece of legislation some criminals are aware of. Our 
charter is supposed to be a shield to protect the rights and freedoms 
of Canadians, not a sword to be used against us by criminals who 
do not respect any of our other laws.
<P>
	In the time remaining I should like to focus on a couple of 
matters I believe should be looked at when the bill goes to 
committee. One problem is the section that allows for the 
deportation of dependants. This clause must be looked at. For 
example, what if the non-citizen was convicted of first degree 
murder of his or her spouse. We would hardly want to deport the 
children with the convicted parent. We would want to consult with 
family and friends to determine the safest home for them, be that in 
Canada or in the country of origin.
<P>
	It has also been argued that by having the sentencing judge issue 
the removal order it makes deportation a punishment rather than 
merely an administrative option available to the government.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	The objection is then made that we are not treating non-citizens 
the same as citizens and therefore they are being doubly punished 
for the same crime. That objection can be dealt with. The 
sentencing judge could be responsible for delivering the crown's 
administrative decision that deportation proceed. Then we could 
eliminate the inquiry stage.
<P>
	The bill also prevents appeals through the immigration appeals 
division. It is trying to make sure non-citizens do not disappear 
between the end of their prison sentence and the immigration 
appeal hearing.
<P>
	For example, in August, Montreal papers reported the story of 
Patrick Baptiste who was under deportation orders for drug dealing 
but not surprisingly failed to show up at the hearing when his 
appeal was rejected. The police caught up with him a few months 
later. Only this time he was implicated in planning a murder. Now 
that his deportation appeal has been rejected, I hope when he  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15024"> 15024 </A></B>
<P>
finishes his current jail term he will not be given a chance to escape 
again.
<P>
	His is not an isolated case. According to a <I>Gazette</I> article a 
special task force made up of RCMP and immigration officers has 
identified 1,888 convicted criminals ordered deported who 
remained here. Twelve hundred were serious criminals, liable to 
more than 10 years imprisonment. Those are ones the bill is trying 
to deal with. As of August one-third had either left the country or 
had been deported. Another third, 671 of the 1,888, had appealed 
their deportation orders or claimed refugee status and a further 300 
are still missing.
<P>
	Despite eliminating a right to appeal through the immigration 
appeals division under clause 3 of section 32.1 unfortunately the 
bill adds an automatic appeals process under the Criminal Code. 
This would certainly have to be amended should the bill go further.
<P>
	By allowing an automatic appeal hearing it would actually be a 
small step back from the Bill C-44 changes and I do not believe Bill 
C-44 went far enough. In addition to violent offenders, non-citizens 
who are habitual criminals should also be denied the right of 
appeal.
<P>
	I view the three years before a landed immigrant takes out 
citizenship as a probationary period. Canadians have welcomed 
them into our house and have given them the opportunity to 
become part of our family. If they do not respect our laws they have 
broken their contract with us.
<P>
	Why do we wait a minimum of three years before granting 
citizenship? Is it just so new immigrants have time to learn the 
name of our Prime Minister or how many provinces there are? 
Surely we place greater value on Canadian citizenship than that.
<P>
	Habitual criminals, drug traffickers and violent criminals are not 
welcome. How many times should someone be allowed to break 
our law before we show them the door? When we show them door 
because they have committed a serious criminal offence in Canada, 
they should not be allowed to come back in.
<P>
	Just today the paper reported on a criminal who has been 
deported from Canada five times at an average cost of $50,000. 
That is $250,000 taxpayers have had to pay for this one case. He 
was first granted landed immigrant status in 1975 and by 1976 had 
been convicted of theft. He was deported in 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987 
and 1988. Then he came back in 1990 and claimed refugee status. 
Now he is an arsonist, setting fires in public malls.
<P>
	I am encouraged to see that immigration officials have taken the 
unusual step of trying to appeal his refugee status. The problem is 
that other criminals we deport also come back claiming refugee 
status. This is a loophole Bill C-316 does not plug.
<P>
	Even the UN High Commission for Refugees does not support 
asylum shopping. That is exactly what it is when people who have 
already been deported return to Canada claiming they are refugees.
<P>
	During 1993-94 according to Correctional Service Canada there 
were over 1,000 foreign nationals serving time in our prisons. At an 
average cost of almost $46,000 this amounts to almost $50 million. 
The auditor general estimated the real cost of maintaining someone 
in prison was closer to $80,000. This means it costs taxpayers 
around $80 million to keep foreign nationals in prison every year.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	To put this in another context, the entire immigration department 
including enforcement, settlement, language training for new 
immigrants and so on has been ordered to cut $54 million from its 
budget over the next couple of years.
<P>
	In conclusion, despite the problems the member has made a 
valiant attempt to address a serious issue. Let us take the bill to 
committee where we will have the advice and expertise of 
departmental officials and counsel to improve it so that we can 
bring it back to the House.
<P>
	Immigration officials are studying ways of streamlining 
deportation of criminals, but it could be another year or two before 
the minister brings a comprehensive plan forward. Let us work on 
the problem now using the bill before us as the vehicle.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I too want to 
congratulate the member for Cambridge for bringing forward Bill 
C-316 and to compliment him on his efforts to try to deal with what 
I consider to be a justice issue and a law and order issue.
<P>
	I probably should not say it this way, but I approach support of 
the bill with some trepidation because I see Reformers are also 
supporting it, which means that if they are I must be wrong. At the 
same time the bill is a positive effort. I am hopeful once it gets to 
committee and has the chance to have the shared view of many that 
the improvements necessary to make the bill function properly will 
be put forward.
<P>
	I believe all of us are in accord that the direction, the aim or 
intent of the bill is a proper one, one all of us in Canada would like 
to see happen.
<P>
	If I may I would like to read the summary of the intent of the bill. 
It captures where the member for Cambridge wants us to go and 
reflects the intent of most Canadians.
<P>
	It says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If a person is convicted of an offence punishable by 10 or more years 
imprisonment and is or is seeking permission to remain in Canada, but is not yet a 
citizen, a court may, on application by the prosecution, order in addition to any 
other sentence, that the person and anyone dependent on that person be removed 
from  Canada. Such an order discontinues any other process, procedure or appeal </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15025"> 15025 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>under the Immigration Act and any other right to parole or any other early or 
temporary release.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are not talking about trying to take away anybody's rights. 
We are not trying to do anything different except streamline the 
process. Rather than dealing with the criminal justice aspect and 
then turning around and going through the procedures under the 
Immigration Act, the legislation empowers the judge to deal with 
the issues together, as he has heard the evidence of the case, and to 
decide whether or not deportation should be part of the decision.
<P>
	That approach is a proper one. There are some constitutional or 
charter of rights issues that will have to be dealt with. I am sure 
some other fine tunings are necessary.
<P>
	At the same time the object of the bill warrants that it goes to 
committee and that it has the necessary input from all concerned so 
that in the end result we will have a stronger situation that provides 
necessary protection for Canadian society.
<P>
	We have heard recounted in the debate over the last number of 
hours some of the horror stories that have occurred. Those are 
horror stories for sure, but perhaps they also point to some of the 
flaws that presently exist in our law. The bill is aimed at trying to 
resolve some of them.
<P>
	The bill has received support from a number of agencies and 
organizations in Canada. To name a few, the Canadian Police 
Association, CAVEAT and Victims of Violence are organizations 
that watch what is happening in the criminal justice system and for 
the flaws that may be present. When we achieve their support I 
believe we are moving in the proper direction. Therefore, a 
committee study of this legislation should go a long way to helping 
protect Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	Others have talked about the actual cost associated with this 
process. In the years 1993-94 there were over 1,000 foreign 
national offenders serving time which cost the taxpayers of Canada 
roughly $46,000 per prisoner.
<P>
	Obviously with this bill we are going to save a little money. I do 
not think that should be the motivation for the legislation. The 
protection of society and the proper administration of justice 
should be the foundations, but we also can look at the financial 
aspect of this particular bill and see the merits associated with it.
<P>
	It is a proper bill for committee study. It is a bill aimed at solving 
a problem which is of concern to Canadians. I again congratulate 
the member for Cambridge. He has done a tremendous job in his 
efforts to correct a situation he saw in his riding and from what he 
heard from his constituents, but also to represent the views of many 
Canadians across the country.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to debate at second reading Bill C-316, an act to amend 
the Immigration Act and the Transfer of Offenders Act.
<P>
	Congratulations to my hon. colleague from Cambridge for 
bringing forth a bill to amend the Immigration Act that will take 
steps to ensure that those who came to this great country Canada 
and refuse to abide by the laws are not permitted to stay. This bill if 
adopted will make Canadian streets safer.
<P>
	Canada has a proud tradition and reputation not as a country that 
merely tolerates immigrants, but rather as one that welcomes them 
with open arms. It is no secret that this great country was built by 
immigrants and that the vast majority of people that come to this 
country today continue to make an honest and meaningful 
contribution to our ever evolving Canadian society.
<P>
	As you are aware, the law has always recognized that serious 
criminality is grounds for deportation and the Immigration Act 
provides the mechanism to facilitate this. Bill C-316 in no way 
attempts to undermine or contradict the current Immigration Act 
but rather to improve, streamline and broaden some of the 
regulations that exist in the current act.
<P>
	It is important to recognize that this government is concerned 
about addressing serious crime by non-citizens and has taken steps 
to ensure removal of these types of offenders. This past spring the 
House passed Bill C-44 which limited the rights of serious 
criminals to appeals under the immigration system. These 
offenders will also no longer be eligible for any form of early 
release or parole.
<P>
	Bill C-316 if adopted will complement the accomplishments of 
Bill C-44. The bill will fill in many of the cracks and loopholes that 
still exist between sentencing and the deportation hearing. Bill 
C-316 will permit a court at the time of sentencing of an offender 
convicted of a serious offence with a penalty of 10 years or more to 
make a deportation order at the same time. Offenders may appeal 
within the criminal process but will no longer have access to the 
appeals process under the Immigration Act.
<P>
	There have been concerns that this process may be an 
infringement on the rights of the offenders, but this bill does not 
create any new or special offence or any new distinction between 
citizens and non-citizens. The distinctions already exist under the 
Immigration Act. The offender is already subject to criminal 
sanctions and deportation. Bill C-316 merely puts both matters in 
the hands of the courts. There are also two important additional 
measures contained in this bill worth noting.
<P>
	First, the bill addresses how to proceed with offenders who came 
to Canada at an early age. It is recognized that many people 
immigrate at an early age and for one reason or another have not 
become a citizen. For this  reason there is a provision in the bill that 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15026"> 15026 </A></B>
<P>
would exempt a person who has immigrated to Canada prior to 
their sixteenth birthday and who has had no criminal convictions in 
five years previous to the offence in question.
<P>
	Second, the bill provides for the transfer of offender by court 
order to their country of origin to serve their sentence if the 
reciprocal conditional release provisions exist. Under the Transfer 
of Offenders Act, a transfer can currently happen only upon the 
request of the offender. This bill removes the decision from the 
offender and places it in the hands of the judge.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	In this bill, as in many private members' bills intended to amend 
existing legislation, there are procedural and substantive issues 
which arise. Several of my colleagues raised some of these 
concerns today during debate. Issues to be addressed relate to the 
procedure of deporting dependents of convicted offenders, the 
training that will be necessary for judges in these cases and the 
possible constitutional challenges.
<P>
	We must keep in mind that what we are debating here is the 
principle of this bill. No one can argue that the intent and principle 
of the bill is not valid and that we as legislators have a 
responsibility to develop and enact legislation that will make 
Canadians safer. Bill C-316 will achieve this principle.
<P>
	The hon. member for Cambridge has expressed his willingness 
to work in co-operation with the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration and the standing committee to address any procedural 
or substantive concerns that may arise.
<P>
	In conclusion I would like to restate my support for Bill C-316 in 
principle and call upon my fellow parliamentarians to do the same. 
The member for Cambridge is attempting to make the streets safer. 
The people of Canada deserve no less.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
with pride to endorse Bill C-316 and to offer congratulations to my 
colleague the member for Cambridge who recognized a problem 
that exists in the system as we have it today. He has dealt with it in 
such a way that it looks as though with the endorsement of the 
House it will go on to become law.
<P>
	We would be remiss if we did not reflect a little on why a debate 
on a private members' bill can become as important as it has in this 
session. Those who are new here will not see any difference, but 
those who have been involved in political life and parliamentary 
procedure in the past years realize that historically private 
members' bills hardly ever, if ever, have seen the light of day. They 
have been a medium for debate and probably have established 
some tone of opinion among parliamentarians, but they had no 
chance of becoming law.
<P>
	To the credit of this government, now private members' bills do 
have a chance to become law and they are subjected to a free vote 
so that everyone in the House can deliver their opinion. We now 
have private members' bills, some applying to law and order 
issues, which have been introduced by thoughtful members of the 
House and are moving on to become part of our justice system.
<P>
	It is interesting to note an article which appeared in the Toronto 
<I>Sun</I> on September 17, written by Sean Durkan of the Ottawa 
bureau. He talks about the quiet war on crime that is being waged 
by the present government. It is not big headline grabbing stuff, but 
little by little the Minister of Justice is clawing away at the 
loopholes and flaws that are present in the judicial system. He said: 
``The Liberal government has actually done more to toughen up the 
system in two years than the previous Tory government did in 
nine''. That should go on record to show that the government has 
taken the issue of law and order very, very seriously.
<P>
	Laws of this nature do not get introduced and are not made 
without some reaction to an incident or occurrence. Of course that 
is the evolution of virtually all law over, above and beyond our 
Constitution. When bills are passed in the House they are passed 
because some situation has arisen. This is an evolutionary process. 
It goes on. We who serve here for our brief time have an 
opportunity to contribute.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	It is only in this 35th Parliament of Canada that we have had the 
opportunity as private members, or backbenchers as we are called, 
to be able to make a solid contribution to the way these laws unfold 
and the way the legislative system progresses. It makes these bills 
very important to the life of Canada. I know that members as a 
result assume far more personal responsibility when they introduce 
bills of this nature.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate all of the people who participated in 
the debate. I believe everything that could have been said on this 
subject has been said. Now is the time for us to take it to the next 
stage, shepherd it through and ensure that our efforts are not 
wasted, so we will see in due course in the slowness of the 
democratic process, this becoming part of our legal system and 
making a great contribution to it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I wonder if the hon. 
member for Cambridge would like to use his right of reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to participate in the 
debate, but I do not want to take the time normally allotted to the 
member for closing. If my speaking causes that, I will not speak.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> You will have five or six 
minutes.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15027"> 15027 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I wanted to take a few minutes to speak on this 
bill and perhaps in a peripheral way to raise an issue which should 
be of import to members of the House. I want to bring the 
following to the attention of members.
<P>
	I see in the bill a provision whereby the effect of the proposed 
legislation would not apply to people who were less than 16 years 
of age when they came to Canada. That is an important issue and I 
want to talk about it a bit, particularly because I have a 
constituency case where such an incident occurred. It is roughly the 
following. I will change the ages ever so slightly to ensure that I 
respect the privacy of the constituent in question.
<P>
	I was approached by the family of a constituent who came to 
Canada when he was two years old. He lived in this country and 
when he was an adult he committed a crime. The incident was 
something like a brawl in a bar and he was charged with assault 
causing bodily harm. It was very serious. The victim nearly died.
<P>
	My constituent was incarcerated, served his time and was 
eventually released from jail. He was reintegrated into society and 
led a normal life. He found a job and so on. Three or four years 
later when everything was behind him, the authorities came 
knocking on his door to inform him that they were commencing 
procedures to deport him.
<P>
	The difficulty is the following: The individual had never seen 
another country in his life. I am dealing with this case right now 
and I have brought it to the attention of the minister.
<P>
	When we come across the easy cases, particularly in the popular 
press when some person has come to Canada, has abused the laws 
of this country and therefore, we should kick him or her out, it is of 
course generally a proposition I agree with. But it is not always that 
easy. The case I am bringing to the House today is to illustrate that 
sometimes it is a lot more complicated.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To take the example of someone who came to this country when 
very young, aged two, then that person is actually a product of 
Canada, if we can use that term. If that person has developed 
criminal tendencies, he or she certainly did not have them on 
arrival in Canada when less than two years old. That is the first 
proposition.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	The second is, if that person is deported, deported to where? Any 
country is like any other, because the person has never been 
anywhere except Canada.
<P>
	Third, if we as a society do not want other countries shipping 
their criminals here, why should we take ours and ship them 
elsewhere? I say ours because I consider someone who was only 
two when he came here to indeed be one of us.
<P>
	I am taking up the House's time to explain this because the 
problem lies not in this bill but in the present statute.
<P>
	I trust that when the parliamentary committee studies this 
initiative-and I congratulate my colleague from Cambridge for 
having presented it to the House-it will look at the entire problem 
at the same time.
<P>
	I have just been speaking with a colleague who tells me that 
someone he knows very well has in fact defended cases similar to 
the one I have just described here in the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a Canadian, as a parent and as a member of the House, my gut 
feeling is always that when someone commits a crime and is not a 
Canadian we should do our best to send them back. That is still 
generally true in what I believe.
<P>
	I caution the House and invite colleagues, particularly those who 
sit on the committee, to think of the peripheral issues I have just 
raised because they are very real and they do affect many people.
<P>
	I thank hon. members in advance for their study of the bill. I 
congratulate the member for having brought this issue to the 
attention of Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I take 
this opportunity 
to briefly thank all the members who have spoken on my private 
member's Bill C-316.
<P>
	I understand certain members have some concerns with 
particular elements of the bill. I assure them their concerns can be 
addressed through amendments at the committee stage.
<P>
	I urge my colleagues to support Bill C-316 at this stage in the 
process. I look forward to working with them in making this an 
even better piece of legislation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> On division.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and referred to a 
committee.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 6.20 p.m., the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.20 p.m.)
