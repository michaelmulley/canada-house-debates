	The House resumed from September 23 consideration of 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I rise in this House to speak to the 
motion put forth by my hon. colleague from Calgary Northeast, 
a proposal that came as a surprise to me, and I must say right 
away that I am totally opposed to it.
<P>
	Before preparing my remarks, I read with a great deal of 
attention the speech the hon. member for Calgary Northeast 
made before this House to try to understand where he was 
coming from, and I must confess that a few of the things I read 
made me jump.
<P>
	At first glance, the member seems to justify denying entry 
into Canada to HIV-positive applicants for economic reasons. 
But a closer look revealed deeper and more troubling underlying 
reasons. For one thing, the cost argument is not really relevant in 
this debate, and this for two reasons: first, as regards the real 
cost of treating AIDS patients, my colleague inflates the figures. 
Based on available estimates, the cost to treat each patient is 
certainly not a minimum of $200,000; it is actually closer to half 
the amount quoted by my hon. colleague.
<P>
	In addition, nothing proves that more money will be saved by 
subjecting immigration applicants to HIV screening than to 
screening for other diseases. An extensive study by a group of 
researchers from the McGill Centre for Medicine, Ethics and 
Law shows that if Canada were to decide to systematically test 
all immigrants to determine if they are HIV positive, this would 
be a political decision rather than one based on economic 
considerations.
<P>
	As part of their study, the researchers compared AIDS and 
coronary disease using available data concerning all immigrants 
admitted to Canada in 1988 to demonstrate that these two health 
problems weigh equally heavily on the Canadian health system.
<P>
	To target only the HIV virus is discriminatory, I believe.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	In his September 23 speech the hon. member continues to 
surprise us by saying: ``When implemented the motion would be 
a significant step in the war on AIDS''. This shows how little my 
colleague knows about AIDS. AIDS is an international plague 
that hits indiscriminately without sparing any society, culture or 
country.
<P>
	How can the hon. member think for one minute that closing 
off our borders will solve the problem? According to this logic, 
we should also require all Canadians coming back from abroad 
to take this test. And what about the open border with the U.S., 
diplomats and the cost of all these millions of tests?
<P>
	As the Official Opposition critic on health, I am, needless to 
say, concerned about AIDS. This terrifying disease is spreading 
at an alarming rate. According to the most conservative 
estimates, over 30 to 40 million people will have AIDS by the 
year 2000, less than six years from now. It is predicted that 
30,000 Canadians will develop AIDS within the next five or six 
years. These figures are alarming and closing our doors to 
immigrants will not change this reality in any way.
<P>
	So what can we do? While we wait for a cure, the only tools 
available to try to stop the spread of this terrible disease are 
awareness and prevention. That is why the Official Opposition 
is asking the government to create a committee to review the 
Canadian AIDS strategy, Phase II.
<P>
	That is also why I regularly ask the Minister of Health to 
allocate her budget better, because cutting transfer payments for 
health-care to the provinces every year is no way to help them 
launch effective awareness and prevention campaigns.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7066"> 7066 </A></B>
<P>
	Spending $12 million on a forum that will be totally useless 
is no way either to protect people in Quebec and Canada. If the 
federal government took the AIDS threat seriously, it would 
have invested the forum's $12 million in research or in 
assistance or awareness programs. Despite several years of 
efforts to sensitize the population, there obviously remain many 
prejudices about this terrible disease and the virus associated 
with it.
<P>
	The motion before us reflects very well this lack of 
understanding and the prejudices attached to it. Some still think 
that HIV can be contracted through casual contact, just like the 
flu. We know that such is not the case. Others even see this 
disease as God's punishment. It is high time to sensitize 
everyone to this disease that will become increasingly present in 
our society.
<P>
	What is worse is that those who support this motion seem to 
mistakenly believe that an HIV-positive person can no longer 
make a contribution to society, that they can only be a burden to 
society. This attitude is regrettable and even shocking for 
Canadians with this terrible disease who must learn to live not 
only with the virus but also with the prejudices, lack of 
understanding and fear of others.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois reject this attitude of denigrating 
and attacking everything one fears or does not understand; of 
closing our minds instead of opening them; of telling 
Canadians: ``Let us keep our heads in the sand and maybe when 
we stick our heads out again, the AIDS problem will be gone and 
we will be spared''.
<P>
	No, Mr. Speaker, that is not the attitude we should take. It is 
not Quebecers' attitude and it is certainly not the attitude that 
the vast majority of Canadians would want to take.
<P>
	This motion betrays ignorance about the terrifying AIDS 
problem. Should it be implemented, this backward initiative 
would take us back to the dark ages and that is why the Bloc 
Quebecois and I vigorously oppose this motion.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, thank you for providing me with the opportunity to 
continue the debate regarding the private member's motion 
placed before the House by the member for Calgary Northeast. 
The member is demanding that all applicants for immigration to 
Canada be tested and screened for HIV, the AIDS virus, that all 
testing be regulated by the government, and that a positive result 
of an HIV screening be included as grounds for inadmissibility 
to Canada.
<P>
	The member for Calgary Northeast tells us in Commons 
<I>Debates</I> of September 23, 1994 there is no need to debate his 
motion, that common sense should prevail and dictate the 
direction the government should take. The only sense revealed 
by the member may be common to him and his colleagues of the 
same ilk, but  not common to those with analytical minds that 
seek the relationships between and among ideas, concepts, facts, 
events and other dynamic phenomena that assist one in a search 
for truth.
<P>
	It is true the Immigration Act requires that visitors and 
immigrants meet two medically related criteria before being 
allowed into Canada. The first states that immigrants must not 
represent a danger to public health or safety. The second states 
that their admission must not cause excessive demands on 
Canada's health and social service systems.
<P>
	To meet these criteria, applicants for immigration are 
medically examined according to a standard format used 
worldwide. This medical examination depends on a complete 
medical history, a complete physical examination, a urine test 
for applicants five years and older, a chest X-ray for those over 
10 years old, and a syphilis blood test for those 15 years and 
older.
<P>
	The blood test for syphilis is the only test performed for one 
specific disease. The X-ray, in turn, may detect a variety of 
possible ailments such as heart abnormalities, tumours and 
tuberculosis.
<P>
	Although there is an attempt to consistently adhere to 
established procedures, variations in testing will always exist 
from country to country, from doctor to doctor, depending on 
expertise and resources available.
<P>
	It must be noted that immigrants are not routinely tested for 
HIV. However, during the course of any routine examination the 
doctor may decide to order further specific tests. At times, if the 
initial medical assessment indicates symptoms compatible to 
HIV-AIDS or if the client falls within a high risk group, the 
doctor may proceed with an HIV test.
<P>
	In the recent past, several applicants have been refused 
admission due to the advanced state of their disease. Most of 
these people were classified as inadmissible to Canada based on 
the excessive demand criterion and not a declaration that they 
were risks to public health.
<P>
	HIV infection and AIDS are not contagious like diseases such 
as tuberculosis. AIDS and HIV can only be transmitted by 
specific high risk activities such as injected drug use or unsafe 
sexual practices, not through casual contact. Therefore, a 
Canadian resident who is willing to engage in high risk activity 
with a visitor or immigrant is as likely to engage in a similar 
activity with another Canadian. The risk of HIV infection comes 
not from the presence of foreigners but the practice of specific 
behaviour.
<P>
	The best defence against the spread of HIV, whether from a 
Canadian or from a foreigner, is an educated population. It is not 
a surprise therefore that many organizations such as the 
Canadian Public Health Association, the Canadian Hemophilia 
Society, the Canadian Red Cross, the European Parliament, the 
British Medical Association, to name just a few, all support the 
view that visitors do not represent a danger to public health.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7067"> 7067 </A></B>
<P>
	In January 1991 a discussion paper prepared by Employment 
and Immigration Canada as part of its review of medical 
inadmissibility criteria in the Immigration Act stated:
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	``At the present time Health and Welfare Canada does not 
consider persons with HIV-AIDS per se as a danger to public 
health or safety. HIV-AIDS is not considered a dangerous 
infectious disease, but rather a chronic disease like cancer or 
heart disease''.
<P>
	The scientific community has argued that allowing a person 
with HIV into Canada does not pose a threat to the health and 
safety of Canadians, a position endorsed by the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	In April 1991 the then minister of health and welfare, Perrin 
Beatty, announced in Vancouver: ``Our expert advisory 
committee concluded AIDS and HIV are not a threat to public 
health during short term travel to Canada. I am pleased to 
announce that we have revised the guidelines for our medical 
officers. We will ensure that visitors with AIDS or HIV infection 
will be treated in exactly the same manner as any other visitor to 
Canada''.
<P>
	The government's position was reinforced further by the hon. 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration when he stated: ``It is 
the policy of this government that persons with HIV-AIDS do 
not generally represent a danger to the public. Our main concern 
is with respect to excessive demands on the health care system''. 
These statements are contained in a letter addressed to the 
Canadian AIDS Society dated August 3, 1994.
<P>
	In dealing with the second health related criterion, that of 
excessive demand, there will be little concern with those 
visiting Canada for a short period of time, no concern because 
they would not qualify for health service and most visitors 
would be carrying their own health protection plans. The 
excessive demand criterion would be invoked when there is a 
reason to believe that the applicant would require medical 
treatment while in Canada.
<P>
	In the case of immigrants, it would be inappropriate to 
institute a blanket exclusion of persons with HIV. The Canadian 
Human Rights Commission states that comprehensive 
individual assessments must be the main tool for determining 
eligibility, and lumping individuals into groups or broad 
categories is discriminatory.
<P>
	In assessing whether an immigrant with HIV would place 
excessive demand on Canada's health care and social services 
system many factors need to be taken into consideration. These 
include whether the person is ill, and the person's potential 
contributions to Canadian society.
<P>
	We know that some people have been infected with HIV for at 
least 12 years and still do not show signs of illness. We do not 
know whether everyone with HIV will go on to develop AIDS. 
How can we refuse to allow a person to immigrate on the 
grounds that he or she might become ill? Even those who have 
some signs of illness can still make a significant contribution to 
Canadian society.
<P>
	Current Canadian immigration policy focuses too much on a 
person's disability and fails to take into account his or her 
ability to contribute to society. Each case must be judged on its 
merits.
<P>
	The hon. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration states: ``It 
is the policy of this government that persons living with 
HIV-AIDS not be singled out for immigration purposes. I would 
like to assure you that I and the officials of citizenship and 
immigration will do our utmost to ensure that persons living 
with HIV-AIDS are treated with the same respect and concern 
for rights as any other visitor to Canada''.
<P>
	The current Immigration Act requires that persons seeking 
admission to Canada as visitors or as immigrants be subject to 
standards of admission that do not discriminate in a manner 
which would be prohibited by the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms. Section 15 of the charter dictates: ``Every 
individual is equal before and under the law without 
discrimination and in particular without discrimination based 
on physical disability''.
<P>
	Canada has traditionally taken a leadership role in 
recognizing human rights and extending a helping hand to those 
in need. I am sure the member for Calgary Northeast would be 
proud and so would his party members in seeing Canada 
continuing with these honourable, worldly aspirations.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before I begin my speech let me say that I am 
absolutely and thoroughly appalled at the statements that have 
been made in this House on this motion. It reflects an absolute 
and profound lack of understanding of the disease and more 
important, a lack of understanding and consideration for the 
health and welfare of Canadian citizens.
<P>
	This is obviously a politically protected disease. We feel sorry 
for anybody who is HIV positive and has AIDS. But let it be 
known that we cannot compromise the health and welfare of 
Canadians.
<P>
	In any event, I rise today in support of my esteemed 
colleague's Motion No. 285 to screen all immigrants for HIV 
under sections 11(1) and 11(3) of our Immigration Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7068"> 7068 </A></B>
<P>
	It is not pleasurable to speak about this topic, a modern 
plague that up to 1993 has claimed 9,910 adult cases including 
107 pediatric cases. Of these, 6,930 people have been killed. 
It is a disease that is as horrific as any fatal illness, particularly 
so since the individuals who have it are in the prime of their 
lives. They usually succumb between the ages of 25 and 45, a 
period that is most productive, with a major part of their lives 
still remaining.
<P>
	I have had numerous patients in the past with this terrible 
disease. I can say from a personal factor that it has been a 
sobering and profoundly tragic experience to deal with these 
individuals, particularly in my age group when these individuals 
are dying before me.
<P>
	You cannot cure them. All you can give to them is palliative 
treatment and treat their intercurrent illnesses. To see them 
waste away is a horrible thing. I encourage those here who have 
contact with anybody who has AIDS to get to know them and 
understand the profound pain, agony and anguish they and their 
families endure.
<P>
	Equally tragic is to deal with the survivors who are left 
behind, the family and friends who have to pick up the pieces 
after their loved ones die. No kind words or understanding can 
ever fill the void that is left behind from the death of a loved one. 
It is impossible to fathom or quantify this loss in any terms 
whatsoever.
<P>
	My friend has brought this motion forward, not because we 
are against people who are HIV positive and not because we are 
against people who have AIDS, the physical manifestations of 
having the virus. He brought it forward because we are public 
servants and we are compelled and obligated as elected 
representatives of this country to protect its people and to enact 
legislation along these lines. We do this especially for diseases 
or events that are going to be of great harm to them.
<P>
	There is no question that HIV positively leads to AIDS and 
AIDS kills. If any member does not believe this, if a doctor said 
you were HIV positive, look into your hearts and see what you 
would feel. Therefore we do this in the name of public safety for 
all Canadians.
<P>
	I should mention that we already protect the health and 
welfare of Canadians in a number of forms. We test drugs and 
therapeutic modalities in health to ensure they are safe. There is 
the checking of blood products which has caused so much 
consternation of late. There is the checking of products that are 
sold over the counter to ensure they are safe for public use and 
the checking of food stocks, both local and imported. 
Immigrants to this country are checked for a number of 
illnesses, including tuberculosis and syphilis, diseases that are 
generally not fatal, diseases that are cheap to treat and are 
curable, unlike AIDS.
<P>
	Why is there such a vocal opposition to my friend's motion? 
The disease is pandemic, which means it covers the entire 
planet. It is universally fatal. It is incurable and it costs money. 
It costs a lot of money. Every patient who is deemed HIV 
positive will ultimately cost the  taxpayer at least $100,000 per 
year. This does not take into consideration the very important 
factor of potential years of life lost for these people.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Between 1987 and 1991 the potential years of life lost for men 
rose from 17,650 years to almost 40,000 years. Why is there 
such a backlash against something that we believe is so 
fundamentally necessary for the protection of Canadians? Why 
is there so much opposition to this?
<P>
	The reason is that it is not an opposition by the majority of 
Canadians. At least 77 per cent of people in recent polls are 
strongly in favour of immigrants being tested for HIV positive. 
The reason for this vocal opposition is that it comes from very 
small groups, small in number but loud in voice. These groups 
do not represent the majority of people in this country and are 
admittedly there for their own interests. They believe that 
people coming to this country if tested positive for HIV, would 
have a stigma attached to them, that they would be discriminated 
against.
<P>
	Fortunately for the Canadian public and perhaps tragically for 
them, they would not be allowed into this country. This is not 
something personal. This is something we are going to enact for 
the betterment and the health and welfare of Canadian people. 
The individuals who are HIV positive or who subsequently 
develop AIDS deserve our sympathy and compassion, but it 
does not mean we have to subject Canadian people to exposure 
to this illness which is fatal 100 per cent of the time.
<P>
	We can argue this on purely moral grounds, but another 
compelling reason is the cost. Unlike what my colleague 
mentioned earlier in the day that she does not believe it would 
cost more to the Canadian taxpayer, any health professional in 
this country would tell you that it is expensive to treat somebody 
who is HIV positive.
<P>
	They do have a series of blood tests that are used to monitor a 
subsection of their lymphocyte count and we give them 
medications to prevent intercurrent illnesses. Due to better 
drugs and better treatment modalities and prophylactic 
treatments we can use this material to lengthen people's lives. 
This actually increases the cost to our health system, one that I 
would say is falling apart at the seams, one that does not have 
any money. These costs are not inconsequential. As my 
esteemed colleague across the way mentioned, we are going to 
have 30,000 more people with AIDS. How much is this going to 
cost the Canadian taxpayer? Three billion dollars.
<P>
	Our health care system right now is falling apart. Waiting lists 
are increasing. Hospital beds are closing. People are dying on 
waiting lists. From her own province alone she has tens of 
thousands of people on waiting lists, hundreds of whom are 
waiting for urgent surgery. If more people are let in to add to the 
overall cost burden to our health system, those Canadian 
citizens will not get the treatment they deserve.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7069"> 7069 </A></B>
<P>
	Is this threat from HIV real or is it imagined? Let us look 
at some areas of the world. As I said before, it is a pandemic. 
In certain areas of Africa where I have worked the HIV 
positivity rate is 30 per cent or more. In south east Asia there 
has been an explosion of HIV positivity. What a tragedy for 
those countries, but does it mean that we need to bring this 
tragedy to our door, bring it to this country and expose 
Canadian citizens to it?
<P>
	The World Health Organization says that AIDS is a pandemic 
and that it will continue well into the 21st century. I quote the 
WHO's AIDS program director: ``There is far worse to come as 
millions of infected people will fall ill and die''.
<P>
	There is no breakthrough and I do not think one is imminent. 
If the HIV epidemic continues to expand at this rate on the Asian 
continent, we will soon see more Asians infected with HIV than 
in Africa where there is an explosion of HIV positivity. If this is 
not a problem, if this disease is not infectious, if this disease 
does not kill, then why is the WHO so concerned about it?
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, this is not a diatribe against people who have 
HIV. This is not a diatribe against people who have AIDS, drug 
abusers, homosexuals, hemophiliacs or any other unfortunate 
person who has been infected with the disease. These people 
deserve the deepest sympathy and compassion which everybody 
from my side of the floor extends to them. As I said before, a far 
more important concern for us is to ensure the health, welfare 
and safety of Canadians.
<P>
	That is the reason for the motion of my friend. Anyone who 
does not support it is sticking his or her head in the sand and 
severely compromising the health and welfare of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
me respond to a few of the comments of the hon. member from 
the other side.
<P>
	First he attacked our motives. He said that we were merely 
being pulled along by some minority group. The government has 
announced that it is reviewing its policy on testing for HIV so I 
think the member who has introduced the motion should take 
some comfort in it.
<P>
	The reason we are opposing the private member's motion 
today is that we want to give the government time to review the 
bill and make a decision. Once the government makes its 
decision perhaps we can have a more focused and more 
productive debate.
<P>
	I acknowledge as much as anyone that HIV leads to AIDS and 
AIDS is deadly. Out of my high school graduating class of 55 
people, 3 are dead from AIDS. One of them happened to be a 
very close friend. I do not think that anyone from that side of the 
House or this side of the House has the right to say that we 
obviously do not care, that we are sticking our heads in the sand, 
or to make any other personal comment.
<P>
	Canadians recognize that AIDS is deadly and that it kills, but 
too often the debate gets mixed into other issues. Too often it 
gets thrown into an intolerance toward certain communities in 
our country. Too often it gets mixed into homophobic groups, 
groups that say that AIDS is a plague on the homosexual 
community because God is bringing down his wrath. It is that 
kind of thing we want to avoid. We want to have a reasonable, 
high quality debate based on the facts.
<P>
	An uninformed decision by the House would accomplish very 
little. As I have said, the government is currently reviewing the 
extensive information we have on HIV and will be announcing 
its decision soon. Our decisions will appropriately reflect 
concerns for public health demand on the health care system, 
social justice and economic matters that concern us today.
<P>
	We must not aggravate public misunderstanding about HIV. 
Too many people think one can get HIV and AIDS through 
casual contact. Too many people think one get it by shaking 
hands when in fact one can only get it through the transmission 
of certain body fluids, more specifically blood and semen.
<P>
	We must take care to dispassionately analyse and reflect on 
the issues that are too often fraught with prejudice and 
discrimination. It is also incorrect to say that AIDS can be 
transmitted by simple contact. Too many people think we should 
not even allow visitors into the country who have AIDS. Last 
year for example, there was a forum on AIDS in Vancouver and 
certain members of the House said that we should not let these 
people in because they were a risk to Canadians.
<P>
	In short, we must avoid being stampeded into adopting a 
policy based more on fear than on fact, fear that is often based on 
misunderstanding, misinformation and ignorance. Public 
misunderstanding could direct a misunderstanding toward 
immigrants even though immigrants are no more likely to test 
HIV positive than native born residents.
<P>
	My friends from the other side have indicated there are certain 
places in the world that have an epidemic of AIDS. Certainly it 
is clear given the current policy that even in those places we 
would test for HIV and AIDS.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> But you are not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> You are not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> We are. Check the facts. It would merely foster 
the kind of misunderstanding and fear about HIV that we should 
be working to overcome.
<P>
	The government recognizes Canadians' concerns about HIV 
and HIV testing for immigrants. We are addressing these 
concerns in the most constructive way possible, by conducting a 
thorough review of all medical testing with the benefit of the 
best expert advice and of consultations. When the review is 
complete the government will take whatever action is necessary 
to protect the health and safety of Canadians and to preserve the 
integrity of our health and social services.

	HIV testing takes place now under certain circumstances. 
Under current guidelines immigrant applicants found to be HIV 
positive may be deemed to be medically inadmissible. Those 
grounds for refusing admission are based on the consequences, 
the impact admitting a particular person would have on Canada, 
whatever the person's specific medical condition.
<P>
	Medical opinion does agree on the fact that a person with HIV 
does not represent a threat to public health or safety merely 
because of the infection. In other words the persons must 
involve themselves in a high risk activity, which normally 
means unsafe sex.
<P>
	Refusing admission to applicants with HIV would have to be 
based on any excessive demand they might place on our health 
care system or social services. The act and regulations do not 
require medical officers to test for HIV. They are authorized 
however, to do so if they have reason to suspect an infection. As 
it stands now testing for HIV does take place when there is 
reason to do so. We must ask the question: Are the current 
guidelines working to protect the Canadian health care system 
from excessive demands?
<P>
	In conclusion let me say that the government is reviewing the 
matter. Let us wait for the government's decision and then we 
can have a more focused and more productive debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I speak in support of the motion to regulate testing of 
all applicants for immigration for HIV-AIDS.
<P>
	Today I would like to talk about a potentially massive health 
care problem which could be easily averted if we as 
parliamentarians take action. The problem is the entrance into 
Canada of HIV or AIDS infected immigrants. We are talking 
about immigrants, not visitors.
<P>
	AIDS is a relatively new phenomenon in comparison with 
other diseases. The term has only entered the vocabulary of most 
Canadians over the past decade. Public awareness of the disease 
is still far less than it should be. Consequently there has often 
been a lag in the response of governments and institutions in 
dealing with the problem. We are aware that AIDS is only 
communicated in certain instances, not by casual contact. This 
is a situation which we must rectify today.
<P>
	What is proposed is mandatory HIV-AIDS testing for all new 
immigrants to Canada. There is a great deal of logic and 
common sense to the proposal. I believe the action would be 
supported by a substantial majority of the Canadian public.
<P>
	The facts are simple. The treatment of patients infected with 
the HIV virus and AIDS is an enormously expensive 
undertaking. Despite the millions of dollars spent on research, at 
this time there appears to be very little hope for a cure or even an 
effective vaccine. Those who study AIDS continue to advocate 
prevention as the best line of defence.
<P>
	The motion could play a key role in reducing the number of 
Canadians who would otherwise be infected by the disease. HIV 
and AIDS infection is spreading rapidly across the world. These 
are the current numbers: by mid-1994 approximately 986,000 
cases of aids have been reported. However, as the World Health 
Organization has noted, several factors suggest this is only a 
small part of a larger total. Many countries were slow to admit 
they have an AIDS problem and to move to set up systematic 
surveillance and reporting.
<P>
	In areas where expertise and blood testing facilities are 
lacking it may be difficult to differentiate AIDS from other 
common diseases. In remote parts of the developing world many 
people fall ill and die without ever coming into contact with 
modern health services. Given these factors the World Health 
Organization believes the number of people to be infected with 
AIDS is much higher. The WHO estimates that by early 1994 
more than three million cases of aids have actually occurred, 
including over 500,000 infants born to HIV infected women.
<P>
	Some may argue that three million cases in a world population 
of over five billion does not represent a major health crisis, but 
the number of AIDS cases is actually a small part of a much 
larger problem. AIDS is the late stage of infection by a virus that 
can take more than a decade to cause illness.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	The real measure of the scope of the epidemic is the number of 
people infected with HIV. The World Health Organization 
estimates there are more than 15 million people worldwide, 
including more than a million children infected with the virus. 
By the year 2000 if conservative forecasts prove correct, the 
cumulative total of HIV infections may reach 30 million to 40 
million and the number of AIDS cases, more than 10 million.
<P>
	A World Health Organization publication entitled ``AIDS, 
Images of the Epidemic'' notes the need for proper surveillance 
for better understanding of the disease. It notes that the most 
convenient approach to surveillance is to locate it in the health 
care system and test people who come in for care.
<P>
	I believe the motion being put forward today is very much in 
the spirit of that recommendation. Canada already has in place 
the means to impose HIV-AIDS testing on immigrant 
applicants. These powers are contained in subsection 19(1) of 
the Immigration Act.
<P>

<HR>

<P>
	Canada has a long history of facing the challenge of 
infectious and lethal diseases brought to our country by 
immigrants and newcomers. For example, the forced quarantine 
of European immigrants for cholera and typhoid on the Quebec 
island of Grosse-Île is well documented. The island is now 
considered to be part of Canadian history and was recently 
visited by Irish President Mary Robinson because of its 
significance. Although Grosse-Île was at times a place of death 
and great suffering, it served the purpose of protecting the 
Canadian population as a whole from infection by these terrible 
diseases. It was the guiding principle then and it must remain 
the guiding principle for our immigration officials today.
<P>
	Members of Parliament are accountable to the people they 
were elected to serve. Too often as members we hear stories of 
how the system failed. Sometimes it is a case of a criminal being 
paroled to offend a second time. Other times it is a case of a 
deportation order not being followed through and a policeman 
being murdered as a result.
<P>
	If we do not follow through on the motion being discussed 
today, I believe one day the government will have to account to 
victims and friends and families of victims who contracted the 
disease through government inaction.
<P>
	Why must we allow this to happen? Why is it that so often the 
government and governments like it must wait to be confronted 
by the victims before they make changes to policies? It is not 
unduly cruel to deny HIV and AIDS sufferers entrance to the 
country if it will prevent even one Canadian from contracting 
the disease. Persons infected with HIV and AIDS clearly, in the 
words of the Immigration Act, are or are likely to be a danger to 
public health or public safety. Something must be done.
<P>
	Protection of the public is not the only criterion for denying 
individuals infected with AIDS or HIV the right to immigrate to 
Canada. The second part of the act takes into consideration 
another important component of any discussion of health care 
and that issue is cost. The act recognizes it should not be a 
priority of government to admit to the country those who will be 
a burden on the Canadian health care system.
<P>
	Clearly immigrants infected with HIV or AIDS would be a 
source of excessive demand on the Canadian health care system. 
The disease is as expensive to treat as it is inexpensive to 
prevent. Recent figures from the United States show the average 
cost of treating a person with AIDS was $32,000 a year and the 
annual cost of treating a person with HIV but not AIDS was 
estimated at $5,150 a year. In 1991 the cost of HIV and AIDS 
care in the United States was estimated at $5.8 billion, including 
$4.4 billion for people with AIDS and $1.4 billion for HIV 
infected persons without AIDS.
<P>
	In Canada some figures have shown the cost per year for 
persons infected with AIDS is $33,900. Our health  care system 
is already overburdened and many Canadians have been forced 
on to waiting lists because of funding cutbacks. I call on the 
government not to aggravate the problem further by allowing 
immigrants with a terminal contagious disease into the country.
<P>
	There are other factors to consider. Canada's taxpayer funded 
health care system is available to all citizens who want to use it. 
This is not the case for most other countries. It is conceivable 
that individuals knowingly infected with this virus could come 
to Canada because we have a publicly funded and accessible 
health care system. Our system may even be desirable to U.S. 
residents suffering from the disease, millions of whom have no 
health care insurance.
<P>
	I would also like to note at this point that the United States 
already tests applicants for legal immigration to that country for 
AIDS and HIV.
<P>
	In conclusion, a battery of blood tests is already part of the 
standard medical examination that is mandatory for all 
immigrants. Adding HIV will not substantially increase the cost 
of examinations, most of which are user pay. The cost of an 
HIV-AIDS test is $12, approximately one-third the cost of a test 
for tuberculosis. There is no good reason not to test for and 
exclude immigrant applicants with HIV since those with other 
untreatable or serious communicable diseases are already 
subject to exclusion.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at 
the risk of disappointing my hon. colleague, I would like to point 
out that he is not the first one to deal with the issue which he is 
bringing to our attention today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government has already begun a review of the issue of 
inadmissibility on medical grounds. Indeed, the review was long 
overdue. The last time immigration legislation concerning 
medical inadmissibility was reviewed was in 1978. It obviously 
needs to be updated. There we agree.
<P>
	The scope of the review goes well beyond the question of HIV 
testing of potential immigrants.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Although it is an important part of the problem, it is only one 
aspect among others. Indeed, the situation is much more 
complex than it seems. We are now reviewing the whole issue of 
inadmissibility for medical reasons. The provinces and 
interested non-governmental organizations have already been 
consulted about some recommendations arising from this 
review.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7072"> 7072 </A></B>
<P>
	You must understand that routine examinations go back way 
before AIDS appeared. The nature of the tests has evolved as 
technology progressed, so it is necessary to say what specific 
examinations prospective immigrants should now undergo.
<P>
	In particular, the effectiveness of routine examinations to 
discover diseases that threaten Canadians' health or to identify 
people whose health would impose an excessive burden on our 
social or health systems is being reviewed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is important to point out that medical experts all say that 
AIDS does not threaten the health of Canadians because it is not 
an illness that can be transmitted by casual contact and because 
it can be prevented. As things stand now, if there are clinical 
signs during medical examination to suggest that a person may 
be infected by HIV or even has AIDS, that person is obliged to 
undergo a screening test.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If they refuse, they cannot be admitted to Canada because they 
did not take the required medical examinations. In this case, the 
screening test is intended to determine whether treating the 
disease at its present stage would be an excessive burden for our 
social or health services. That is why someone with this disease 
may be refused admission to Canada; it is not because of the 
nature of the disease.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One might ask why these people should be treated any 
differently from those who are afflicted with some other chronic 
illness, for example those who suffer from kidney failure or 
cancer. These illnesses too can impose demands on our health 
care system.
<P>
	Research on the progression and treatment of AIDS is 
ongoing. People diagnosed as sero-positive can now expect to 
live much longer than they could even 10 years ago. Even if they 
test HIV positive many can continue contributing to Canadian 
society for many years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Furthermore, we must also reconcile our economic and social 
interests with our humanitarian commitments. Of course we 
must continue to be vigilant, but we must also see that we 
maintain Canada's traditions of fairness and compassion. In its 
red book, our government committed itself to continuing to 
apply a dynamic immigration policy that reconciles 
humanitarian considerations with our demographic and 
economic needs.
<P>
	Requiring prospective immigrants to take an HIV screening 
test may seem a simple matter at first glance, but that is far from 
the case.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	We cannot and must not consider it apart from the other 
problems it raises. This issue must be approached in a much 
wider context, in which we take account of developments in the 
medical tests used, the concept of excessive burden for Canada's 
social and health systems, the nature of the treatment for this 
disease, the contribution of sero-positive people to our society 
and Canada's long humanitarian tradition. My hon. colleague 
will admit that these are important considerations which we 
cannot ignore.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My colleagues and I on this side of the House appreciate the 
concerns hon. members have expressed about not imposing an 
excessive burden on our country's social and health services. We 
must take care to dispassionately analyse and reflect on issues 
that are too often fraught with prejudice and discrimination-I 
repeat what my hon. colleague on this side of the House 
said-and avoid being stampeded into adopting a policy that is 
based more on fear than on fact and more on economic 
considerations rather than humanitarian concerns, which is not 
the Canadian way.
<P>
	We care about humanity. We have to be cautious when we 
adopt certain policies and laws that this aspect is also taken into 
consideration. Our laws and institutions must reflect the 
progress we have made in terms of our attitudes toward diseases 
in general. It is the government's responsibility to show 
leadership. We have done that by undertaking a review of the 
issue of inadmissibility on medical grounds.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member will reconsider his motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a few things to say after listening to the debate. I am really 
curious as to what is the hang-up on the other side of the House 
with regard to AIDS testing.
<P>
	I heard that AIDS testing is undertaken. It is not undertaken 
on a consistent basis at all.
<P>
	I heard that we should be a humanitarian country. I presume 
that means allowing immigrants to come into our country that 
are HIV infected. I totally disagree with that philosophy and I 
am sure most Canadians do as well.
<P>
	We have to get down to the meat of the issue. The fact is that 
AIDS is a serious situation throughout the world. Why introduce 
more of that serious situation into Canada when we can prevent 
it to some extent by testing for AIDS prior to immigrants 
coming into the country? That seems so logical, so simple, it is 
actually missing the minds of the Liberals. Sometimes that 
happens. Logical, simple, practical things do tend to miss their 
support.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7073"> 7073 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to support very much my colleague's motion to have 
all immigrants tested for the HIV virus. The reasons for this 
need are clear. They are not related to phobias. They are not 
related to prejudice. They are related to a more important fact 
and that is the innocent individual who contracts such a virus 
by knowingly allowing that virus to come into the country.
<P>
	The hard facts are that we live in a world where we are faced 
with harsh realities, of which HIV infection and AIDS are two of 
the major ones. We especially need to address the question on 
how seriously is the government treating the AIDS question in 
light of the serious nature of the disease and the great economic 
factors associated with it.
<P>
	We are told we should not support this private member's 
motion because the government is going to assess this once 
again. It is going to research. It is going to document. It is going 
to think about it. We are getting so sick and tired of hearing that 
kind of thing from the Liberal government. What we want is 
action. This private member's motion will go a long way in 
doing something positive for this situation.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	It just escapes me how the government can take a problem and 
defer it to the future by saying: ``We will look at it''. Never in 
the history of governance in the country have I heard that so 
much as in the last year and few months. It is shameful really. 
This is not a time for being passive but for firm action. It is a call 
for action that has been shouted from many different sectors 
within our society.
<P>
	It is especially necessary that we look into this matter from 
the perspective of those who are dealing with the spread and 
consequences of the disease on a daily basis, not from the 
perspective of those who come to Ottawa from other parts of the 
country and debate and debate and debate. Let us get down to 
where the action really is, where the people are being infected by 
this virus.
<P>
	Dr. Don Sutherland in his letter of introduction to recipients 
of the ``Quarterly Surveillance Update: AIDS in Canada'' dated 
May 2, 1994 states that the statistics continue to emphasize the 
point that the AIDS epidemic continues to increase except in 
those persons infected through blood and blood products where 
the trend is declining. By the end of 1993 it is estimated that 
14,000 persons had developed aids in Canada since the onset of 
the epidemic.
<P>
	Dr. Sutherland uses the term epidemic which according to the 
dictionary means ``the rapid spreading of a disease''. The 
present Liberal government appears to treat the epidemic as a 
mere inconvenience which can be overlooked in the area of 
immigration. That is really what is happening here.
<P>
	This is such a serious issue but so many things get cloaked in 
this country under immigration. The Reform Party must be 
anti-immigration because it is concerned  about convicts 
coming into the country. It is concerned about testing for AIDS.
<P>
	In my riding just a short time ago a young lady was raped by 
an illegal refugee. She spent six months waiting for the results 
of an HIV test while this individual basically ignored the whole 
situation. Had we originally tested that particular individual on 
coming into the country, she would not have had to go through 
that six months of torture, unfortunate as it was.
<P>
	One does not have to look far to see just how serious an 
epidemic in AIDS and HIV infection are considered by 
Canadians. In an article from the November 10, 1993 <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>, we read about how the disease has taken over the lives of 
over 1,000 people a year in Canada. Can members imagine? 
That is 1,000 people a year in 1994 when five years ago this was 
really hardly even noticed.
<P>
	Epidemiologists expect an even greater number succumbed to 
AIDS in 1993. Dr. Martin Schecter, an epidemiologist at UBC in 
my home province is still concerned about the current spread of 
the disease. He says: ``The signals we are getting are troubling. I 
think HIV is relentlessly spreading''.
<P>
	With all these kinds of comments coming from the experts in 
the field of HIV, I am perplexed why the government would not 
say: ``Yes, we know it is a serious problem. Yes, we can stop a 
part of the spread of that problem right now by adopting a 
private member's motion that sits before the House''.
<P>
	Because a private members' motion on HIV testing of 
immigrants is put to the House by the Reform Party is no real 
reason to get into political rhetoric, to turn it down. What has to 
be looked at here is how important is that private member's 
motion to society in general. Forget the Liberal Party rhetoric.
<P>
	Dr. Martin Schecter estimated that between 35,000 and 
40,000 Canadians have been infected by the AIDS virus since 
the disease was first diagnosed. Even more sobering is the 
September 11, 1993 article from the Vancouver <I>Sun</I>.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	Here is an excerpt from the article: ``AIDS robs Vancouver 
men under the age of 75 of more years of potential life than do 
cancer, heart disease and accidents, according to a team of 
Vancouver researchers. In 1992 alone AIDS cost Vancouver men 
about 6,000 years of life, 50 per cent more than each of the other 
three major causes of death''. Even more disturbing were the 
chilling comments by demographer Robert Hogg who said in his 
team's findings: ``If I had told somebody last year, nobody 
would have believed me''.
<P>
	In the minute I have left I want to appeal to this Liberal 
government to get away from the rhetoric, get away from the 
partisan politics, get away from the study. We will look at this a 
little later. Get into the meat of my colleague's private member's 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7074"> 7074 </A></B>
<P>
motion. That is what we are  here for, the protection of the lives 
and the property of Canadian citizens.
<P>
	If there are immigrants coming into this country with the HIV 
virus, then this government has an obligation to test them. It has 
an obligation to the citizens of this country. I urge members to 
get away from this rhetoric and partisan politics and support my 
colleague's bill.

	The House resumed from October 7 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to participate in this important debate today.
<P>
	I can honestly say that during my time in this House and in 
other Houses in other jurisdictions social reform policy is one of 
the most important issues I have debated. We have known for a 
long time that this situation was coming to a head. It is now time, 
as is often said, to cross the proverbial bridge. I speak for myself 
and for others in saying how pleased we are that we have a 
person of the calibre and the social conscience of the minister 
heading up the question of social security reform in this country.
<P>
	Canadians are aware now and have been for some time that 
our social security system must be changed. We have come 
through a difficult economic period over the past number of 
years, fueled by recession and high rates of unemployment. 
High unemployment has caused a tremendous strain on Canada 
and has presented new and difficult challenges. As I said earlier, 
we are fortunate to have a person in place who is strong enough 
in his convictions to address these challenges.
<P>
	We have reached this point only after having consulted 
Canadians. As we know last year the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development held hearings across the 
country to seek the opinions of those who would be affected by 
changes in the social safety net.  They were told that there are 
disincentives built into the present system and that those who 
need help the most simply are not getting the assistance they 
require.
<P>
	All Canadians know at this time that change is inevitable. The 
difference with the change that this government will bring about 
is the heart and the compassion that will be shown for the 
average citizen of Canada. The weakest and those least able to 
defend themselves will be protected by any change initiated by 
this government. The deficit will not be fought on the backs of 
the poor.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	We have heard a lot over the last few years about the global 
village and the new world economy and how we must be trained 
to face a changing economic situation around the world. That is 
why this is not a hack, slash and burn economic recommendation 
but rather a constructive reform which will help Canadians get 
back to work.
<P>
	It is an accepted fact that training and education are the keys 
to economic development. We must see that Canadians are 
trained in the most efficient and most effective manner. The 
money that is to be spent on education must be directed toward 
those people who need it the most. The people who come out the 
other end of the system as graduates must be trained second to 
none because they are competing with people from around the 
world and must be prepared to do that.
<P>
	In the last three years as statistics show, 17 per cent more jobs 
were available for university students but there were 19 per cent 
fewer jobs for those who did not complete high school. That says 
it all: education equals opportunity. We must educate more 
people and we must provide better access to education and 
training throughout their lives.
<P>
	We in the part of the country that I come from believe that if 
we have trained people we are better able to attract enterprises to 
our area of the country because these companies by and large are 
looking for a stable, well trained workforce.
<P>
	At the present time the federal government is providing more 
than $8 billion a year to post-secondary education across 
Canada. The time has come to sit down and ask ourselves if we 
are doing this in the most appropriate manner. Under the current 
arrangement if the status quo were continued the cash portion of 
the federal contribution to education would decrease 
proportionately and could disappear within 10 years. Therefore 
we must find ways to help more people finance their higher 
education so that they will be prepared to compete on a 
worldwide basis.
<P>
	We believe that investment in learning makes good economic 
sense but we must deliver the training to our people in the most 
efficient and effective manner possible. We must therefore 
ensure that access is available to all young people regardless of 
their economic situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7075"> 7075 </A></B>
<P>
	As I am sure others in this House did last year during the 
election campaign, I visited learning institutions in my riding. 
Students in my riding indicated they were not satisfied with the 
arrangements that are there now for student loans. They want 
changes made to the system. Proposals are out now. I say to 
those students in my riding and others: Tell us what you think 
of them, come forward with different and better ideas and we 
will certainly look at them.
<P>
	The other item in the minister's statement that has caught the 
most attention especially in the part of the country I come from 
is with respect to the unemployment insurance program. It is a 
chilling fact to think that 13 per cent of people have been out of 
work for a year or more. That is three times the level of long 
term unemployment that this country suffered in 1976. Forty per 
cent of claimants have claimed for unemployment benefits at 
least three times in the last five years. This indicates that we do 
have a problem.
<P>
	Coming from a region that has a high rate of unemployment I 
can assure my fellow members of Parliament that those who are 
on the unemployment treadmill are not there by choice. They are 
there because of the economy and because the level of training 
does not permit them to have jobs year round. We must continue 
to look at these people who form our greatest asset in the diverse 
regions of this country. We must provide them with the basic 
skills necessary to be employable year round.
<P>
	I believe there is some responsibility for government through 
economic or trade policies to see that the opportunities are 
afforded to Canadians wherever they live.
<P>
	I am glad to say that the minister has appointed a working 
group to study the effects of unemployment insurance in areas of 
the country where seasonal work is the dominant work. In the 
province I come from 50 per cent of the workforce has seasonal 
jobs. This is part of our history. This is the way tourism, 
agriculture and the fishery industry work, on a seasonal basis.

	The discussion paper released by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development asked Canadians how we can address 
these problems in a spirit of co-operation and compassion. This 
government is not interested in fighting the deficit on the backs 
of the poor and the unemployed. Nor is it interested in the 
system collapsing, serving no one.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, this is a time of great challenge. It is a 
time that challenges government. It challenges members of 
Parliament and it challenges the people of the country. We are 
not arrogant enough to believe we are the only ones who can 
meet these challenges. Canadians know what is in their best 
interests. Between now and January the human resources 
committee and individual members of Parliament will be 
talking to Canadians, seeking their advice.
<P>
	The discussion paper is a road map from St. John's to 
Vancouver. Through our consultations Canadians will tell us 
how to get from where we are to where we want to be. This 
exercise is about finding better ways of doing things. What 
worked fine in the sixties and seventies is no longer working 
properly. In fiscal times such as these it is possible to do better 
with less. By working with all Canadians this government will 
deliver what it promised during the election: a vibrant, 
prosperous economy and a country where the needs for social 
programs will decline.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Questions or comments? 
Debate. Before the hon. member for Malpeque begins I want to 
be assured that the time is being split with 10 minutes of speech 
and 5 minutes questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to speak on social security reform in 
the early stages of this debate.
<P>
	The document prepared by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development will lead to future policy and legislation. I believe 
this issue is one of the most important decisions this government 
will make in its term in office. I must emphasize that social 
security reform cannot be looked upon in isolation of other 
programs and other activities like economic development and 
tax reform. What will happen in those areas directly relates to 
the issues of social policy reform.
<P>
	As an example of what should not happen I would like to turn 
for a moment to look at what happened in the United States 
during President Reagan's term. It is dealt with extensively in a 
book by John Kenneth Galbraith, <I>A Journey Through Economic 
Time</I>. I encourage members to get that book and read it. There 
are a lot good comments in it in terms of what not to do in 
people's interests in the economy. I quote from Mr. Galbraith in 
his book:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For aid to the rich-the large reductions in marginal tax rates in 1981-the 
Reagan cover was a declared need to stimulate more energy, initiative and 
investment. Effort by the already well endowed was being inhibited because of 
the high marginal rates.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He goes on to explain how great tax advantages were given to 
the rich by the Reagan administration. On the other hand, for 
those less well off financially he says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Similar and perhaps more successful was the position as regards help to the 
poor. Here income, indeed assistance in almost any form, was held to be 
damaging to character, initiative and effort and thus to the well-being of the 
impoverished. As the rich needed the incentive of more money, so the poor 
needed the incentive of less.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7076"> 7076 </A></B>
<P>
	This was according to President Reagan's principles of 
economic development. That is something we want to avoid and 
which I am sure this government wants to avoid in our 
discussions leading up to social security reform and to 
economic reform in this country.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	This issue will be of fundamental importance to us in Prince 
Edward Island and our ability on Prince Edward Island and in 
my riding of Malpeque to produce and prosper. I cannot 
emphasize enough the need for people to become informed, to 
understand the options and to become involved in offering 
alternatives. I encourage people to get the discussion document 
put out by the minister's office and to look at the facts, not some 
of the criticism or some of the assumptions they may see in the 
media.
<P>
	This proposal on social security reform will affect my 
province of Prince Edward Island, either positively or 
negatively, probably more than any other province given the 
structure of our economy. It is my hope that everyone thinks 
through the implications on an individual basis, on a labour 
basis, on an employer basis, how it affects students and how it 
affects the economy as a whole.
<P>
	With the foregoing in mind, I held a public meeting in my 
riding to try and lay out those facts in as straightforward a way 
as I could. I will give the results of that meeting in a moment. I 
did that because I felt that communities and interest groups must 
prepare themselves for the standing committee that is to follow 
and hear their points of view in a concrete, constructive way.
<P>
	As I said at the beginning of that meeting, I want to be very 
clear. Changes are going to be made. For us to argue to maintain 
the status quo or the system exactly as it is is not even in the 
cards. It is not a winnable argument. We have to understand that. 
In understanding that we have to be a part of the process; we 
have to become involved as communities and as people within 
communities in a very constructive way.
<P>
	I want to relate some of the points I raised at the public 
meeting. Some of them are critical of our position. We accept 
that criticism because out of constructive criticism will come 
good debate and at the end of the day will come better solutions.
<P>
	I encouraged public participation in the meeting. It was very 
high and quite vocal. My constituents realize that changes are 
needed. However, they feel that at the moment the changes are 
directed solely at one group of people, the less wealthy in 
society. Let me expand on what my constituents told me at that 
meeting.
<P>
	First, the government continues to say that too much is spent 
on social programs and cuts are needed, yet no one wants to 
admit that we in Canada do not have a fair taxation system. It is 
the middle class that pays 58 per cent of all taxes, while 
businesses and corporations pay less than 15 per cent.
<P>
	Second, they said there exist massive tax loopholes that allow 
corporations and wealthy individuals of Canada to escape 
paying their fair share. At least that is the perception. These 
loopholes are subsidies and tax expenditures, thus costing the 
government a loss of revenues.
<P>
	Third, they indicated that the government is looking at social 
reform in a one dimensional manner. Before programs are cut 
the government must take action in reforming taxation. The 
deficit cannot be put solely on the backs of the middle class and 
the less wealthy. From my constituents' point of view that 
relates to the overall thrust of social security reform.
<P>
	I do not accept that criticism in its entirety. We are intending 
as a government to look at tax reform and other areas as well and 
we must as we go down this road.
<P>
	There was a considerable amount of discussion on education. 
A lot of concern was raised by students in terms of when they are 
finished university if the new approach is taken what kind of 
debt loads will they face. On that point we have a lot more work 
to do in the area of education.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	On UI, people at the meeting said they believe the changes to 
UI will have the greatest negative impact. The impact will be 
greater in Prince Edward Island and the maritimes as a whole 
than in other areas of the country because of our seasonal 
industries.
<P>
	The two leading industries in P.E.I. are agriculture and 
tourism. These two industries rely heavily on seasonal workers. 
Without the availability of seasonal help the employers within 
these industries will be lost in terms of operating their 
businesses. Seasonal workers play a tremendous part in 
allowing whole industries to be profitable. As my colleague 
from Hillsborough said a minute ago, we are pleased the 
Minister of Human Resources Development has now appointed 
a special committee to look at seasonal industries in light of the 
impending changes relative to UI.
<P>
	If these changes are taken without careful consideration all 
that is simply going to occur is fewer people on UI and more on 
welfare, once again transferring the deficit on to the backs of 
poorer provinces. We cannot allow that to happen under these 
changes.
<P>
	In the social security reform paper job training and retraining 
are talked about extensively. My constituents feel that skills 
retraining is a necessity however, it is only worthwhile if jobs 
exist in the sector they are being trained in. For example, there is 
little use training an out of place worker skilled in electronics if 
there exists a surplus of electricians. Before job training occurs 
we need to know in what areas there are going to be jobs. I want 
to re-emphasize the need to work in economic areas to try and 
ensure that the jobs will be there once people are trained.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7077"> 7077 </A></B>
<P>
	Some of my constituents believe that the reform paper is 
really a plan to cut the deficit, a plan that puts our deficit on 
the backs of those who can least afford it. We cannot lose sight 
that Canada is a country which is built on the ideals of having 
a social program for all its citizens, for all to have a level 
playing field to succeed. I certainly countered that argument 
because the position of the discussion paper and other measures 
we are taking is to recognize that changes need to be made and 
they must be done in a very constructive way to see that 
ordinary people's needs are met.
<P>
	I had an interesting experience the weekend before last when I 
was the only MP who attended a meeting of the Council of 
Canadians. At that meeting all MPs who sit in this House, 
particularly those on my side of the House, were under attack 
because of the social security reform. I stood at that meeting and 
asked those people how many of them had talked to us as MPs 
and very few raised their hands. That is what this debate is all 
about. It does no good for those groups out there that are 
attacking our discussion paper to talk to themselves. They have 
to get out to these hearings and put forward alternate proposals 
in a very constructive way. In that way we will listen.
<P>
	In closing I want to quote from the Prime Minister's speech in 
Fredericton in which he indicated where we are really going on 
this issue: ``We need a national debate on our options. We are 
looking for good ideas from the provinces, the private sector, the 
trade union movement and individual Canadians. When new 
legislation is introduced next year it will reflect what we have 
learned during that consultation process''.
<P>
	What is important is this consultation, this debate, so that at 
the end of the day we come up with a better social safety net than 
we currently have.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the comments made by the hon. member 
for Malpeque who was referring to critics he heard in his riding. 
Indeed, Prince Edward Island will be very affected by this social 
security reform, as it has already been by UI cuts. In fact, the 
same situation occurred in Quebec, and more particularly in my 
riding.
<P>
	I am pleased that the hon. member is trying to find other ways 
to finance social security in Canada, particularly from a taxation 
point of view. I suggest he take a look at tax havens, which 
should be eliminated. As well, family trusts must be controlled. 
This is the only way to finance social programs. Our social 
programs must not be destroyed. It took a long time to build a 
social safety net in Canada; we must improve it, not eliminate it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question 
and would agree. We have certainly talked about those very 
issues in the discussion on this side of the House within our 
party and within our caucus. We have to look at all the areas of 
taxation. We are concerned and we must be assured that there is 
some balance. A tax advantage to the wealthy is in effect a 
subsidy to the wealthy. I agree with that. I think there has to be 
balance. We have to look at the subsidies to the wealthy that are 
allowed by tax advantages. On the other side we have to ensure 
that there is a sound social safety net for citizens across Canada.
<P>
	We can take pride in what Canada has put in place to date but 
we recognize that now it needs to be changed. We are going to 
look at that in a comprehensive way. At the end of the day I hope 
we will all be better off as Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
always interesting to hear speeches by these Liberals who have 
converted to the Reform point of view that there have to be 
changes. It is interesting that none of these things came out 
during the last election.
<P>
	The member speaks about going to his constituents and also 
going to the Council of Canadians and asking how many have 
talked to MPs. If they had spoken to the Liberals during the last 
election they would not have been hearing the same thing that 
the member was talking about to his constituents at this meeting 
he was reporting on.
<P>
	The Reform Party by contrast has consistently stipulated that 
there must be protection for the disadvantaged in our society and 
the only way we can do it is to make sure that the pie is carved up 
in their favour.
<P>
	Does the member agree that the outdated concept of 
universality that was touted consistently by the Liberals in the 
election is now dead? Or does he believe, as the member sitting 
behind him seemed to believe in debate the other day, that it is 
universality if necessary but not necessarily universality?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Mr. Speaker, no, I certainly do not believe that 
universality is outdated. Universality is important especially in 
a caring, sharing nation like Canada.
<P>
	It is too bad the member had not been in my riding during the 
last election. I spoke extensively in my riding during the 
campaign about the importance of protecting and enhancing the 
abilities of the disadvantaged, the difficulties we have in some 
areas where we need regional development programs to better 
those programs through changes in taxation policies and 
through other reforms the government may undertake.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7078"> 7078 </A></B>
<P>
	We cannot look at each particular reform in isolation. The 
government is looking at it in many areas. It is looking at 
reform in terms of social security reform and economic reform. 
The government is willing to stand up and lead the way. That 
is what I believe we are doing.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Resuming debate. The 
hon. member for Drummond. I would ask the hon. member to 
give me confirmation that Bloc Quebecois members will split 
their time.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
indeed share the allotted time with my colleague.
<P>
	I am pleased to inform the House of the reactions and 
comments following the release of the details of the social 
program reform announced by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	First, I think this reform should be named more accurately. 
Indeed, the minister's initiative is not a reform of our social 
program system but, rather, an exercise which is part of an 
operation to cut into the budgets allocated for social programs. 
Ultimately, this exercise will result in cuts of $15 billion over a 
period of five years.
<P>
	The paper released by the minister is very clear on this, at 
page 23, where it says: ``Reform of social security cannot be 
contemplated in isolation from the fiscal realities facing 
governments in Canada''. Three pages further, the document 
provides more details on the real intentions of this government: 
``A social security system that is financially unsustainable is a 
dead end''. The minister can certainly not be accused of lacking 
in imagination; he wants to make profitable a social system 
whose raison d'être is to help those who are in need of 
assistance.
<P>
	What we have before us is not an initiative to help needy 
Canadians and Quebecers. Nor is it one which will provide them 
with some security. It is not designed to make the world a better 
place for everyone. On the contrary, this is an initiative from a 
government which wants to cut its spending and reduce its 
deficit at the expense of the poorest ones in our society. In fact, 
this reform is a tool which the government will use to cut its 
expenditures and put its finances in order.
<P>
	There is another purpose for this reform and it is to centralize 
powers in Ottawa. This is every federalist's dream. So, this 
reform will be a very useful tool indeed. Most of the options 
proposed in this reform tend toward centralization. All in all, the 
government's two main objectives are very clear: to drastically 
reduce its social spending in order to put public finances in 
order, and with what is left, to try again to centralize the powers 
in Ottawa, at least in the jurisdictions it sees fit, notwithstanding 
the provisions of the Constitution Act of Canada and the 
priorities of either Quebec or the other provinces.
<P>
	Quebec and Canadian taxpayers give the federal government 
large sums of money, a portion of which is intended for health 
care and education pursuant to the 1977 agreement. The problem 
is that the federal government prefers to use this money not for 
its specified purposes but to reduce the deficit. The federal 
government must realize that by increasing the tax burden of 
Quebec and all the other provinces, it directly affects the whole 
social system the Quebec and Canadian people rely on. It is 
estimated that the federal government has saved $22 billion 
since it started to cut spending and to freeze transfer payments. 
The federal government has squeezed Quebecers and all 
Canadians to the tune of $22 billion.
<P>
	Despite higher taxes, federal contributions to the health and 
welfare program via transfer payments have so drastically 
decreased that the basic principles of the health and welfare 
system are being questioned and jeopardized.
<P>
	This reform confirms the federal government's intention to 
continue cutting transfer payments. Now, after reducing health 
transfer payments, the federal government is attacking 
education transfer payments with the reform proposed by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Let us briefly review the implications of this reform for the 
education sector. The reform provides for the total elimination 
of education transfer payments for post-secondary education, 
meaning that the provinces will get, at the very least, $2.6 
billion less than before.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	This decision will have two consequences. First, the federal 
government will again reduce its deficit on the back of the 
provinces by substantially raising their fiscal burden. Second, 
this loss of revenues will force provinces and universities to 
contribute more to the funding of the education system. The rest 
is easy to guess: education costs and tuition fees will have to be 
higher and students will end up being the ones to pay for that by 
contracting more loans.
<P>
	For Quebec alone, this loss of revenues will reach $300 
million a year; that is, $300 million Quebec students will have to 
pay themselves because tuition fees will increase two-fold. 
While reaffirming the importance of university training, the 
federal government submits a proposal that restricts access to 
post-secondary education by increasing student indebtedness. 
This means that the proposed reform reduces the accessibility of 
post-secondary education for students whose financial means 
are limited.
<P>
	We have been fighting for at least 20 years in Quebec to 
democratize access to post-secondary education and now the 
federal government is trying to undo what we have done. The 
government even goes beyond that by proposing dangerous and 
ridiculous ideas. First of all, it proposes to establish a central-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7079"> 7079 </A></B>
<P>
ized loan program in Ottawa. The game is easy to understand: 
first the federal  government deprives the provinces of the 
funding it had promised them and lets them deal with their 
financial problems on their own, then it takes sole responsibility 
for the student loan program and wants to standardize it. 
Second, it goes as far as to propose that students use their RRSPs 
to finance their education. Mr. Speaker, do you know many 
students who have more than $25,000 in RRSPs? Personally, I 
do not know any.
<P>
	This government who promised jobs to everybody, who talked 
about jobs, jobs, jobs for months, had a good opportunity to put 
in place a structure that would focus on job creation. Yet, we do 
not see any employment policy in this reform, any incentive to 
create jobs. While there is a consensus in Quebec and in the 
other provinces regarding the urgent need for a joint action plan 
for job creation, the Liberal government tables a discussion 
paper whose main objective is to cut social programs by several 
billion dollars annually.
<P>
	The green paper tabled by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development first gives us an inventory of unemployment 
insurance, training and welfare programs and then tells us how 
to weaken them even further. To deal with structural 
unemployment related to inadequate manpower training, the 
federal government should have started by letting Quebec set up 
a sensible manpower training system. This is one of Quebec's 
traditional demands, one on which a consensus was reached long 
ago by employers, unions and politicians. It is truly unfortunate 
that this government failed to use this opportunity to get rid of a 
lot of the costly overlap produced by a federal system that is in 
very poor shape.
<P>
	The duplication and administrative overlap that exist between 
the Government of Quebec and the federal government are 
partly responsible for the disastrous political and economical 
situation facing Quebecers and Canadians every day. The 
federal government, which insists on pushing its centralist 
approach, is largely responsible for the costly and inefficient 
proliferation of duplication and administrative overlap between 
both levels of government. Through massive use of its spending 
powers, the federal government is gradually and deliberately 
encroaching on Quebec's jurisdiction over health care, while 
ignoring what has already been done by the Government of 
Quebec.
<P>
	According to a study introduced in 1991 by the federal 
Treasury Board, 45 per cent of the programs of departments, 
Crown corporations and federal agencies, representing a total of 
$40 billion in spending annually, were introduced although 
similar measures had already been initiated by provincial 
governments. This wasteful use of financial resources caused by 
duplication and administrative overlap between Ottawa and the 
provinces, is to us a clear indication that the disastrous state of 
public finances and the deteriorating competitive position of the 
Canadian economy are a direct result of the crisis in Canada's 
political structures. This wasteful spending must stop. Quebec 
has always demanded that  the federal government stop 
encroaching on its jurisdictions.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Recently, Quebec again asked the federal government to stop 
interfering in manpower and occupational training, which cost 
Quebec taxpayers $250 million annually. Instead of realizing 
this and withdrawing from this area, the federal government has 
decided to use this reform to interfere on an even broader scale 
and make this administrative mess even more costly.
<P>
	In this area as in so many others, the federal government 
should stop being stubborn and start acting in the interest of 
efficiency and effectiveness. Our level of indebtedness, the 
failure of the present policies as illustrated by the 
unemployment rates, and the number of people on welfare do 
not permit us to allow this wasteful overlapping of jurisdictions 
to continue only to satisfy the federal government's desire to 
control everything.
<P>
	Today, because of overlapping, we are unable to implement 
efficient programs geared to social and economic needs. 
Therefore, we must come to the conclusion that if the federal 
government was really concerned about the welfare of 
Quebecers and Canadians, it would cancel its ill-conceived 
reform and concentrate instead on dealing with the issue of 
overlapping. In so doing it would realize that, in the area of 
social services, most stakeholders come under provincial 
jurisdiction, and that the federal government has no business 
getting involved. Quebec and the provinces are already there 
and in spite of under-funding, are more successful than the 
federal government.
<P>
	Far from trying to deal with these cases of counterproductive 
overlapping, with its ill-conceived reform, the federal 
government is creating more overlapping by proposing to 
regroup under one roof all manpower programs managed by 
various levels of government.
<P>
	It goes without saying that, as opposition health critic, I am 
looking at the health aspects of this ill-conceived reform.
<P>
	We of the Official Opposition believe in maintaining the five 
major principles which are universality, comprehensiveness, 
accessibility, portability and public management. However, 
what we are decrying is the fact that the federal government still 
insists on imposing these principles while at the same time 
cutting funding, especially since these cuts which, on many 
occasions, the Quebec government has called unacceptable and 
inconsistent, have not been followed by a drop in Ottawa's 
meddling. It is sticking steadfastly to its national standards and 
continues to intervene in areas where Quebec and the provinces 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7080"> 7080 </A></B>
<P>
have jurisdiction, by creating parallel programs and therefore 
more problems of overlapping.
<P>
	The link between poverty and health has been clearly 
demonstrated by several studies. Low-income people are more 
often sick, consume more drugs and require more care. We know 
that in the last few years poverty among young people has 
increased dramatically. Not only will these children cost more in 
health care, they will have learning disabilities and will be twice 
as likely to drop out of school as their wealthier friends.
<P>
	In the end, these children will depend on welfare instead of 
contributing actively to the development of our society. To 
better control the general state of health of the population in 
Quebec and Canada, and therefore reduce health costs, we must 
start by fighting poverty to the finish. What does the federal 
government propose in this regard? I can see nothing. The 
reform even proposes to reduce family benefits of low-income 
families. This reform will only aggravate a situation already 
tragic for the over 1.2 million children in Quebec and Canada 
who live in poverty.
<P>
	By refusing to acknowledge the link between poverty and 
health problems, the federal government is jeopardizing the 
effectiveness of our system.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I am sorry 
to have to interrupt the hon. member, but her 10 minutes are 
certainly over. I will nevertheless take the liberty of asking our 
colleagues whether we could allow the hon. member for 
Drummond to conclude her remarks. We would forgo the 
five-minute question and comment period. Does the House 
agree?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I had only one more paragraph.
<P>
	On behalf of the people, the neediest and the middle class, we 
reject the proposal of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and we urge the government to come up with real 
measures, measures to create jobs.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity today to participate in this debate on 
the proposed reform of social security programs put forth by the 
minister of social program cuts.
<P>
	Let me tell you right away that this long-awaited reform 
proposal finally laid before us in a discussion paper will not be 
translated into actual legislation before next fall at the earliest, 
and perhaps not before 1996, as Chantal Hébert indicated in <I>La 
Presse</I> on October 5.
<P>
	This use of public consultation to forestall objections by the 
provinces and pressure groups gives credence to the contention 
that this government intends once again to go it alone, 
by-passing the provinces as it recently did at the National 
Forum on Health.
<P>
	It is always the same thing. ``This recipe for income security 
to reform sounds like one Pierre Trudeau, Brian Mulroney or Joe 
Clark would have cooked up'', writes Chantal Hébert.
<P>
	The minister's document presents this reform proposal as a 
magic recipe to boost the economy as well as job creation. Make 
no mistake, the primary objective of the federal government is 
to make cuts in social programs to bring the deficit and the 
national debt down.
<P>
	References made to compassion and fairness in this document 
have a rather conservative flavour to them, while the real face of 
this reform is rather hideous. Especially when we already know 
that, as indicated in a secret document submitted to Cabinet and 
published by the <I>Toronto Star</I> on October 5, this government 
plans to make another $7.5 billion in cuts over five years on top 
of the $7.5 billion announced in the last budget. So much for 
compassion!
<P>
	On the subjects of job creation and unemployment insurance, 
I will only touch on a few aspects of the proposal dealing with 
job creation and changes to the Unemployment Insurance 
Program.
<P>
	The proposals made in this document rest, in fact, on a 
misdiagnosis of the current situation. The problem facing 
Canada and Quebec is job scarcity. The reform proposal deals 
exclusively with employability, while what we really need is a 
real job creation policy.
<P>
	A group of professors of social law at the University of 
Quebec in Montreal wrote recently: ``They talk about 
employability, adapting individuals to the labour market and 
training people for jobs that do not exist, instead of adopting a 
real job-creation policy''. The group adds: ``It is incorrect to 
postulate that the unemployment problem is due to individuals 
not being adapted to the market, as though they were 
merchandise [-]To put people back to work, they first need 
something more than insecure, underpaid jobs''.
<P>
	As for the employment situation, the employment/population 
ratio is the most reliable indicator of the actual employment 
situation. In Quebec, this ratio is now 54.7 per cent, while in 
April 1990, just before the last recession began, it was around 
58.6 per cent. This statistic shows that we are still very far from 
the pre-recession employment level and that the employment 
recovery is very slow.
<P>
	Considering population growth, 800,000 jobs would have to 
be created in Canada, more than 200,000 of them in Quebec 
alone, to return to the level of April 1990; at the present rate of 
job creation, assuming that there will be no slowdown before the 
end of 1995, it will take at least three years to return to the 
pre-recession level.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7081"> 7081 </A></B>
<P>
	This shows how anemic the recovery that the federal 
government tells us about is. In fact, this recovery is due more 
to increased productivity than to increased employment. 
Statistics for September 1994 show that following a large rise 
in the previous month, unemployment stabilized in Quebec at 
12.2 per cent, while in Ontario it continued to fall, reaching 9.2 
per cent.
<P>
	In particular, employment in the Montreal market is growing 
a little more slowly than in the first quarter of 1994. The annual 
rate of growth in the metropolitan area went from 4.8 to 2.6 per 
cent. Moreover, Montreal continues to lag behind the rest of the 
country and has not recovered one fifth of the jobs lost during 
the recession. This is taken from <I>L'économie de Montréal</I> for the 
second quarter of 1994.
<P>
	The jobless rate for residents of the City of Montreal is three 
points higher than for the metropolitan Montreal census area.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	As for the proposed reform recommendations, one of the 
options favoured by the government is to introduce a second 
class of unemployed for those with precarious jobs. We know 
full well that such jobs are mostly held by young people, women 
and artists. These second-class unemployed people would be 
subject to ``compulsory'' employability measures and forced to 
participate in community work. They would also have to pay 
higher premiums in return for lower benefits.
<P>
	Proposing such measures takes a certain amount of cynicism, 
as they clearly show that this government sees the unemployed 
as lazy people-beer drinkers, as the Prime Minister 
said-whom a very paternalistic government must force to take 
the necessary steps to find jobs.
<P>
	We can only conclude that the federal government has no 
job-creation policy as we know full well that coercive measures 
do not generate employment. Yet, the term ``employment'' can 
be found throughout the discussion paper. They even talk about 
employment insurance, which is misleading, as it would be 
more accurate to refer to poverty insurance or social insecurity 
reform.
<P>
	By attempting to reduce the debt through arbitrary cuts in 
social programs, the government will only manage to increase 
the number of welfare recipients.
<P>
	The first thing this government should do about 
unemployment is to allow interested provinces to implement a 
coherent manpower training program, as it just did in the case of 
Quebec's Mohawks. ``This is truly a double standard'', said 
Quebec's employment minister, Mrs. Louise Harel, to the daily 
<I>Le Devoir</I>, adding that, from the federal government's 
perspective, what is good for the Mohawks is bad for Quebecers.
<P>
	But let us go back to that system with two types of 
unemployed workers: those who hold precarious jobs and those 
have seasonal jobs. Bureaucrats use a very politically correct 
expression in reference to these people, calling them frequent 
claimants.
<P>
	One of the most disturbing aspects of these recommendations 
is that women would be the first to be affected, given the family 
income criteria.
<P>
	``Taking the family income into account transforms the UI 
program into a more selective program, somewhat like the 
social assistance program. [-]Such a measure would put an end 
to the universality of the right to work. Once again, women are 
the ones who will be affected'', added the UQUAM task force.
<P>
	Several other questions remain unanswered. For example, 
what does the reform recommend for workers aged 50 and over? 
These are people who have held the same job for 20 to 25 years. 
Training? Retraining for a year or two and for non-existent 
jobs? What will happen to the very limited Program for Older 
Worker Adjustment, POWA, which is unfair to Montreal 
workers precisely because of the federal criteria being applied?
<P>
	All this, finally, to follow the finance minister's orders: 
cutting assistance to the poor rather than taxing the rich. Thus, 
new and even more arbitrary cuts will be hardly surprising, since 
the government wants to reduce its deficit by $25 billion by 
1997.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development tries to 
sound compassionate and alarmist when insinuating that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>if we do not carry out this reform-that is, if we do not cut social 
programs-the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the 
international financial establishment could do it in our place.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There are other ways to reduce the deficit and to put into place 
a real job creation policy, and we have indicated some of these to 
the government. Cutting social programs will certainly not rid 
us of the unemployment plague.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
to the hon. member's comments with some concern. It seems to 
me he was very negative in his references to the government and 
made it seem as though one of our initiatives is a way of getting 
even with the unemployed because we feel they are lazy.
<P>
	He also said that with our social security reform, we were 
taxing the poor. It is of course not the first time that comments 
from the Bloc Quebecois are rather negative and do not 
represent the real situation.
<P>
	Where did the hon. member get his information, and could he 
quote his sources?
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Daviault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments. In <I>Creating a Healthy Fiscal Climate</I>, released last 
week by the Minister of Finance, the minister said that major 
structural changes had also been  made in the Unemployment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7082"> 7082 </A></B>
<P>
Insurance Program, in this budget. However, these changes are 
only a first step. The document entitled <I>Improving Social 
Security in Canada</I> contains proposals that would further 
change the structure of various programs and lead to major 
additional spending cuts, the objective being two-fold: to 
reduce premiums and reinforce job development services.
<P>
	Of course, it is the government's job to be positive about these 
proposals. There are others who question the consistency of the 
Liberal government. For instance, today we read in <I>The Citizen</I>, 
in an analysis by Mark Kennedy, and I will quote the passage in 
English:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In 1990 the Mulroney government changed the 
unemployment insurance program so that people had to work 
longer to qualify for UI and if they did their benefits expired 
sooner. The Liberal report at that time said the measure had led 
to dramatic increases in the number of people being forced from 
UI to welfare. The party urged the government to rescind the 
change.
<P>
	In 1990 the Mulroney government froze transfer payments to 
provinces for health care and post-secondary education. The 
Liberal report condemned the action. In opposition the Liberals 
said funding limits for welfare programs would just hurt those 
who had nowhere else to turn. In government the Liberals have 
not repealed the Tories' funding formula. Rather, they want a 
new formula that means even less federal spending on basic 
welfare.
<P>
	In opposition the Liberals said a freeze on health care funding 
runs counter to the fight against child poverty. In government 
the Liberals have not ended the freeze and the Prime Minister 
warned last week that health care funding will need to be cut or 
medicare will be destroyed.
<P>
	In opposition the Liberals said cuts in federal support for 
post-secondary education have led to higher costs for education 
which include higher tuition fees and that led to higher 
unemployment for youth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In government, they do the same thing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would appreciate it if my colleague from Ahuntsic could help 
me reassure senior citizens, especially those living alone.
<P>
	In the town of East Broughton, in my riding, there is a lady 
called Mrs. Lessard, who calls me just about every week in need 
of reassurance. Again last Friday, she called my office to tell me 
that she could hardly make ends meet. She reminded me once 
more that the Liberal government had been elected on the 
promise to get rid of the GST. She told me that she had 
postponed filling up her oil tank in the hope that the GST would 
disappear before winter. But she realized that she could wait no 
longer and had to have her tank filled; and, of course, she had to 
pay the infamous GST plus the QST.
<P>
	Once again, I would ask the hon. member for Ahuntsic to help 
me make senior citizens, especially those living alone, feel more 
secure.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would ask the member 
for Ahuntsic to please give a short answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Daviault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would very much like to make 
senior citizens feel more secure. But this measure was taken on 
the spur of the moment, without any strategy. As mentioned in 
the UQAM's document, the government wants us to believe that 
we are being consulted. First, it threatens us with cuts, no matter 
what the consultations result in. Then, it fails to link its reform 
with other issues such as Old Age Security, the national health 
policy, or a concrete and comprehensive reform of the tax 
system, which are all important points. The government is only 
looking at the problem from a cost standpoint without giving 
itself the means to solve it through taxation. It is only going to 
review the tax system six months down the road.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to participate in the debate regarding the 
future of Canada's social services.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	I wish to congratulate the Minister of Human Resources 
Development for his commitment to ensure that all Canadians 
can participate in this consultation process. The result will be a 
fundamental change in our social services. The reason for this 
change is evident. As the Prime Minister has already said, the 
status quo is not an option.
<P>
	It has been Liberals who have responded to previous needs for 
social service programs and put into place the social services 
that we have today. Liberal governments of the past have 
introduced among other programs old age pensions, 
unemployment insurance, the Canada pension plan and student 
loans.
<P>
	This Liberal government now calls upon Canadians to accept 
the challenge to redefine priorities, to identify what is important 
and to create a new social policy for the next century. This 
challenge is not about change for the sake of change. It is the 
government's response to Canadians who have demanded 
changes in the way that our social system operates now. It is a 
response to a changing society. We have been asked to do this by 
Canadians.
<P>
	The programs that exist today were created for different 
circumstances and under different times. The recession and 
restructuring felt deeply by millions of Canadians make what we 
are setting out to do not only urgent but fundamental for our 
survival as a nation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7083"> 7083 </A></B>
<P>
	Yesterday's solutions are not going to answer today's 
problems. New solutions are necessary and we are going to 
provide those solutions for Canadians.
<P>
	The task is enormous, make no mistake. We are asking 
Canadians to redefine what is fundamental to many. With this 
reform we are going to change everything from unemployment 
insurance to social welfare. The task is not government's alone, 
however. All Canadians have been asked to participate and 
support this effort to provide better service.
<P>
	The need for reform is evident and clear. We are taking a 
responsible approach to a difficult agenda. It is easy to simply 
cry for cuts and reductions. What lies before us is a task of 
nation building. We are participating in a historic opportunity to 
reshape our social security programs. The end result should 
ensure that the world will again look to Canada as a nation that 
cares for its own and has rebuilt its social programs to respond to 
our needs now.
<P>
	This exercise is more than deficit reduction. Obviously we 
would not be experiencing this sense of urgency without the 
need to control our debt and deficit. More important however, 
we are responding to programs which no longer reflect the 
changing needs of a changing society. Quite evidently the status 
quo, as the Prime Minister has said, can no longer be accepted.
<P>
	My constituents know that we are facing serious decisions. 
They want our government to act. They also want to participate 
in a process which makes them a part of the solution. They want 
us together to confront poverty, to ensure that our children are 
able to enjoy the best post-secondary education and they want to 
be protected from unforeseen circumstances. While they want 
government to provide these services, they know we no longer 
are able to afford the services of the past, especially services 
which are unable to respond to current needs.
<P>
	The standard of living in Guelph-Wellington is very good. 
Despite a lower than average unemployment rate, we still have 
incidents of child poverty; there are a number of seasonal 
workers more affected by economic downturns than most of us; 
we have seniors and students who fear for their future; and the 
United Way and other agencies are busy with demands for their 
services. Guelph-Wellington like all of Canada has felt the 
ravages of the recession. We have individuals who relied on and 
continue to need the kinds of social services that we are being 
asked to improve.
<P>
	What the people of Guelph-Wellington have always 
demanded from government is quality. They want their money 
to be well spent, they want value and they demand excellence. 
They want a social service network that protects those most in 
need, allows for flexibility, encourages growth in the human 
spirit and above all assists in job creation and economic 
renewal, for that truly is the way to success. They do not want 
people to be dependent but rather they encourage independence.  
They want to help build and encourage. They no longer want, 
nor will they accept the status quo.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	My constituents know that many of the proposals in the green 
book are new and daring but they want to take the chance in 
order to effect change. I have discussed for example the 
proposals regarding income contingent repayment loans for 
students with the president and the students of the University of 
Guelph. They know there are risks in this proposal but they want 
the freedom to better plan their post-secondary education. They 
want to take a more active role in what affects them.
<P>
	The University of Guelph welcomes new innovations and 
ideas. The people of Guelph-Wellington welcome the 
opportunity to effect change in post-secondary education and 
other programs. They want to share responsibility with this 
government. They want programs which will be fair and will 
benefit all Canadians fairly.
<P>
	We must address fundamental and very real issues in the next 
few months. Above all we are not only talking about programs, 
we are addressing real people with real needs. We are talking to 
the seasonal worker who in his or her construction trade faces a 
two year waiting list for employment after they have completed 
a job. We are talking about the teenager in Erin, Ontario who is 
hoping to attend university. This reform is about the senior in 
Guelph and the newborn in Puslinch.
<P>
	We are going to talk about new ways to help those who are 
struggling to make ends meet. We are going to find new ways to 
assist Canadians who today have no idea that they will need 
social assistance in the future, but because of some unfortunate 
circumstance they will find themselves seeking help at some 
point in their life.
<P>
	The majority of people in my riding voted Liberal because 
they trust a Liberal government. They know that Liberals have 
in the past responded to similar difficult situations. They want 
reductions in government spending to be sensible and 
reasonable. They want a responsible approach to social service 
renewal and they want real consultation.
<P>
	This process will result in a new and better way to provide 
social services. It will end the duplication of services and build 
on new partnerships.
<P>
	The people of Guelph-Wellington no longer want to know 
who is to blame for the past. They want to know who to turn to 
for their future. They want decision making which will be for 
their benefit and for the benefit of all Canadians. They want to 
join our government in renewal. They want jobs, security and 
education for their children and for themselves and assistance 
for the unemployed. They want welfare that teaches, encourages 
and trains for new skills rather than a government handout that 
demeans and discourages. They want literacy, employment 
opportunity and the dignity of work that our Prime Minister is 
quick to always encourage. They want to participate in nation 
building, not division.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7084"> 7084 </A></B>
<P>
	We are responding to the demands of our history. Last fall 
the Liberals asked Canadians to help create opportunity. This 
fall we are asking them to seize that opportunity and build a 
better Canada. The people of Guelph-Wellington are ready to 
answer that call. Together we will build a Canada that will 
remain the best country in the world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to what the member for 
Guelph-Wellington said about the reform of social security in 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Last weekend, I spent several hours meeting groups of my 
constituents in Frontenac and when they were told that the 
country is on the brink of bankruptcy, with an accumulated 
deficit of $550 billion, some of them reminded us that this 
monstrous debt was created not by the Conservatives but by the 
Liberals, a government to which the present Prime Minister has 
belonged practically since his youth.
<P>
	Remember that this $550-billion debt was not created 
overnight. The deficits began to pile up in the early 1970s, in the 
Trudeau era, and now a real climate of fear is being created 
throughout the land; people are almost made to feel guilty for 
collecting an allowance for their children or an old age pension 
or a welfare cheque. Some feel guilty, as though they were 
cheating the country, but they are not.
<P>
	Most of these social measures were brought in by a Liberal 
government and now it will cost a fortune in advertising and 
cross-Canada tours to try to make the electorate swallow the 
pill. I asked my constituents on the weekend what they proposed 
to reduce this famous deficit. Since it was in the news, they said 
why not cut the $2 million for the Robin Hood, William Tell and 
Top Gun exercises.
<P>
	Of course, Mr. Speaker, you will tell me that $2 million is a 
drop in the bucket. Yes, a little snow does not stop a locomotive, 
but billions and billions of flakes of snow will stop the whole 
train. You see, $2 million are being spent so that some sixty of 
our soldiers can go and have fun in Florida.
<P>
	Two weeks ago, we were told that $2 million a year were spent 
on the restaurant here on the sixth floor while senators and MPs 
invited their constituents and friends for lunch and forgot to pay 
before leaving. Two million a year; it is a real disgrace! It is 
really shameful, and then we hear that politicians are unpopular. 
With things like that, the voters in Frontenac are right to 
question politicians' good will.
<P>
	I wonder if the member for Guelph-Wellington could give us 
her opinion, her own, not her government's which I already 
know, but her own opinion on tax shelters or family trusts which 
contain billions of dollars that could be collected from wealthy 
individuals.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, I could go on forever on 
this one. To the hon. member for Frontenac, you are quite right, 
a Liberal government was responsible for many programs that 
have helped this community-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Members should be sure 
they direct their comments through the Chair and not directly to 
one another.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was just getting started. 
There is no doubt a Liberal government has been responsible for 
many of the innovative and new reforms that have made Canada 
what it is today, clearly the best country in the world rated for 
the second time. Let us put that on record.
<P>
	It is important to understand that all of the benefits brought in 
by a Liberal government were brought in for the country as a 
whole, including Quebec. It is very important for that member to 
understand that we look after all Canadians.
<P>
	The member for Frontenac talks about our growing the debt. I 
wish to inform him that to begin with some of the debt was 
caused by the Liberal government. Then we had the new regime, 
the Tories, and a small debt grew into a huge debt.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	The member for Frontenac says that we are on the verge of 
bankruptcy. I wish to be very clear on that. We are not on the 
verge of bankruptcy. That is clearly a tactic to entice Quebec 
people to buy into that notion. As we know from the recent 
election many Quebec people do not buy into that sort of 
thinking or mindset. We know it is not true.
<P>
	We are however at a crossroads. Clearly the government is 
going to act on reforming social programs. I draw the attention 
of the hon. member to the <I>Financial Post</I> of today that states 
clearly Canadians are in support of this reformation. We are 
catching up to what all Canadians want, Quebec included.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of change. Although I have not 
entirely determined my position on all the proposals contained 
in the government's discussion paper ``Improving Social 
Security in Canada'', I am carefully considering the various 
options. Frankly I am waiting for my constituents to digest these 
ideas and tell me what they think.
<P>
	However I am certain of my support for the process the 
discussion paper initiates. It is a process of change. The 
government is once again showing its commitment to 
innovation and complete consultation with Canadians in an open 
and constructive manner.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7085"> 7085 </A></B>
<P>
	The change I speak of is necessary because in Canada we 
have a social security system that is simply not working 
properly. Our social programs no longer function adequately, 
often neglecting those people who need help. I need only cite 
recent statistics on child poverty to prove the point.
<P>
	Clearly there are some people caught in the revolving door of 
welfare who are otherwise capable and willing to work. That is a 
problem. It hurts the system and impedes our ability to deliver 
efficient programs. We must improve the system. We must bring 
about change.
<P>
	When the Minister of Human Resources Development 
released his discussion paper a short while ago, immediately we 
listened to the barrage of criticism from across the House and 
complaints from interest groups across the country.
<P>
	I could not be happier. In my mind the discussion paper is a 
total success. That is exactly what a discussion paper is 
supposed to do: to get Canadians talking about our social 
security system. Whether the comments are positive or negative 
Canadians have started the debate on social policy. That is 
exactly our intention. It is debate by Canadians that will inspire 
the creative ideas we need to improve our social security 
programs.
<P>
	I remind members across the floor that the discussion paper is 
not government policy but rather a framework of proposals to 
work toward solutions. The debate will continue. The 
government is listening to the condemnations from political 
camps and special interest lobbies. Lo and behold the silent 
majority speaks. Canadians were recently solicited for their 
opinions. Scientific sources tell us the strong majority of 
Canadians think the social security system needs change.
<P>
	That is one reason I am a member of this majority 
government. We promised change. We were elected to a 
majority for change and now we are delivering on change. 
Furthermore an overwhelming majority of people in the country 
apparently think specific programs like unemployment 
insurance and welfare desperately need change. I reiterate that I 
stand in support of change.
<P>
	I also support the nation's exemplary tradition of helping our 
poor, our disadvantaged and our unfortunate. However I am 
concerned that what began as a system of assistance for the poor, 
the unemployed and disadvantaged has turned into a social trap. 
The system now applies social assistance inappropriately, thus 
missing the target and costing far too much in the process. 
Canada's social security system has drifted from its original 
intent. That is why we are here re-examining the issue with the 
objective of improving it.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	I cannot speak for my colleagues but I have received several 
letters from people who are upset. They say that we are unfairly 
subsidizing the social security system and that we must 
seriously address those concerns.
<P>
	I am not blaming the victims in our society. I want a social 
security system that will protect and help victims of misfortune. 
If we do not improve the system we will not be able to help those 
people in the future. We also have to face financial realities. 
When social programs are unfairly applied those truly in need 
are the people who suffer.
<P>
	I would like to examine a couple of specific ideas if I could. 
One is the concept of getting people back to work. The other is 
the essence that in the priority of the government jobs for 
Canadians will solve a lot of our social security problems.
<P>
	There is a deficiency with programs such as welfare and 
unemployment insurance. For example it often makes more 
sense to remain on the welfare roll rather than seek employment 
because sometimes welfare benefits pay better than low end 
jobs. There is no incentive for people to enter the workforce and 
advance careers into better paying jobs. The problem is well 
documented.
<P>
	I do not think it is unreasonable to expect we should develop 
policy that motivates people on welfare to enter the workforce. 
By encouraging Canadians to find jobs we are also helping 
individuals gain the dignity we all desire.
<P>
	The proposal of supplementing wages with social assistance 
until people rise above the poverty line while remaining in the 
workforce is a commendable idea. We must also develop 
effective job training programs so that people can acquire the 
skills they need to excel in the workforce.
<P>
	Social programs must involve the availability of education. 
We must explore policy options that direct federal funds to 
provide education and training for people who currently receive 
social assistance. Far too many children live in poverty because 
parents do not have the option of furthering their education and 
developing meaningful careers. By providing opportunities for 
education and training we will see welfare rolls decrease.
<P>
	The proposed two tier system of unemployment as it relates to 
insurance has received considerable support in my riding at this 
early stage of social policy review. I contend that the UI 
program is being abused. The program should be used only as 
insurance in circumstances where Canadians find themselves 
unavoidably caught between employment opportunities. That is 
what the program was originally intended for but is not how the 
program operates today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7086"> 7086 </A></B>
<P>
	Unfortunately many Canadians have learned to depend on UI 
as a steady source of income. I do not think it is fair to ask 
working Canadians to subsidize those who consistently 
calculate UI into annual income strategies. We have to pay 
special attention to our seasonal workers. There are many 
Canadians and many careers in Canada that depend on seasonal 
employment. Those people cannot be left out in the cold, but 
we must address the excessive costs to Canadian taxpayers of 
a system that allows people to depend on social assistance when 
they are capable of working.
<P>
	Rather than simply ignoring frequent UI applicants we should 
help them find long term employment, or perhaps multiple 
seasonal jobs. The government is obviously open to 
suggestions. We cannot escape the fact that the UI system needs 
improvement.
<P>
	In conclusion I support the discussion paper on social policy 
because it represents an agenda for change. We are going 
through profound changes. Some of these changes are stamped 
with dire predictions of doom and gloom. I say that just the 
opposite is true. Social policy review is one component of a new 
process for change. We are asking that Canadians temper their 
immediate expectations. We are asking for sacrifice today so 
that our children may prosper in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the dissertation of my hon. 
colleague from Kenora-Rainy River on the very important 
subject of social policy reform.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	Would the hon. member opposite be good enough to clarify 
his personal views on two very basic subjects? First, does the 
member opposite feel that entitlements or benefits should be 
based on need or want? Second, should those benefits be 
available universally or universally available, which is a very 
different phrase? Third and because it is so important, what 
would the hon. member opposite consider to be the minimum 
definition of a child in poverty?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Mr. Speaker, to my colleague across the way let 
me make it clear I believe that benefits should be based on need.
<P>
	The fact remains that we as a government can assess policy 
options through the review we are having with Canadians once 
the consultation process is over. I believe there is a strong 
possibility that we will be able to create change and programs 
and policies that base their assumptions on the needs of certain 
Canadians.
<P>
	On the question of what is perceived to be the definition of 
poverty, I grew up in what would probably be classified as a poor 
to lower middle class family with 10 children. Our father and 
mother worked their tails off to get us through school and to a 
point where we could succeed as Canadians should. To me 
poverty is when there is no opportunity to succeed. That is a 
pretty easy, simple definition. When I went to school and was of 
university age I would never have had the ability to go to  
university without government participation. My parents could 
not afford to send 10 kids to university.
<P>
	There is a need for governments to participate in helping 
people with the capabilities get from one school level to the 
next. The government and its record will prove that we have 
done that in the past and will do it in the future.
<P>
	To me poverty also means that the basic necessities of life are 
looked after so students do not go to school hungry. In 
Kenora-Rainy River I represent the most aboriginal 
communities of any member of the House with a total of 46. A 
large majority of the kids I represent in First Nations 
communities go to bed hungry and go to school hungry.
<P>
	If we as a government are not cognizant of that fact and do not 
create programs to deal with young people, how can they be 
expected to get off the treadmill they are on? Governments 
should participate in a program that makes sure young people 
have an opportunity or a chance by having a roof over their head 
and by being well fed and well nourished. Then when they do go 
to school, because we are supplying education, they will want to 
learn. They will be willing to get to the next step.
<P>
	As a young person I had the opportunity to get into an 
educational institution to better myself so that I could make my 
way and make a life for my own family.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member has stated that the consultation document being 
debated for the past few days ago accommodated a need for 
change. I would like to tell him that we will wait and see how the 
people react, if they feel there is really a need to cut in our social 
safety net. Let me give him an example of the impact one of the 
measures contained in this document will have.
<P>
	As this is only a consultation document, I will ask him to tell 
us how he feels more particularly about cuts in established 
programs, the post-secondary education shared-cost programs 
between the federal government the provinces. A $300 million 
cut is contemplated. Cutting transfers in this area will have the 
following impact on the provinces, which have no more 
financial resources than the federal government: just for the 
education system to be maintained, tuition fees will have to be at 
least doubled.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	On the other hand, the same document mentions training 
objectives, the fact that in today's competitive market, adequate 
training is essential and we must find a way to target training 
well, to make sure Canadians are adequately trained. At the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7087"> 7087 </A></B>
<P>
same time, the government pushes for a measure that will result 
in tuition fees doubling, because we must recognize that these 
fees will double. I have heard the member give the example of a 
large family. Does he not believe that this measure will 
adversely affect access to post-secondary education and  thus 
hinder training in terms of secondary and post-secondary 
education?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Mr. Speaker, this question has been brought up 
before. I do not know how long the member opposite has been 
out of school but as you can tell I have not been out of school that 
long. I remember when I borrowed money from the government 
through the system that was in place at that time which basically 
has not been changed very dramatically since then.
<P>
	One of the issues the member talks about is the fact that there 
is a proposal to make cuts in the funding that flows directly to 
provinces. I totally encourage that. In fact I have discussed it 
with my colleagues. The present system of dollars flowing to the 
provinces for post-secondary education has totally failed young 
Canadians. It has not worked.
<P>
	If the member is concerned that tuition is rising, he should 
look at what has been happening around him. It has been rising 
10 per cent per year for the last four or five years. It is on the 
move up.
<P>
	The government is suggesting a system where students can 
pay back the dollars they borrowed based on how much money 
they make when they get out of the system. It is a system used in 
other parts of the world and is much more efficient.
<P>
	If he talks to the staff in his office about one particular 
constituency problem he may regularly face, he may find that 
young people are coming in on a regular basis because they 
cannot afford to pay their student loans. There has to be a way of 
changing the system and that is one of its major problems.
<P>
	Last, he asked about training. One of the proposals is about 
transferring dollars to training and supplementing the people on 
welfare with training dollars. We are not reducing the amount of 
money that a Canadian will get. We are increasing it with a 
built-in incentive which is a much more appropriate process 
than saying to someone: ``Here is your welfare cheque. Don't 
ever bother coming back into the system. Stay where you are. 
We like you being on the poverty line''. We are saying that we 
will give a minimum amount of welfare but we will supplement 
it with training dollars so people can improve themselves and 
get back into the workforce. In this way they will be a part of the 
constructive society we are trying to build.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf 
of our whip and pursuant to Standing Order 43(2) the Reform 
caucus will be dividing its time.
<P>
	I would like to comment briefly on the discussion paper 
before us on social security released by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. As well I would like to comment on 
remarks made regarding the <I>Financial Post</I> and the poll it has 
taken. I note there is major support for what is called 
``Axworthy's reforms''. The question is very simple: Do you 
support reform of the social security system? Anybody would 
say yes to that. Anybody. The question really does not have very 
much credibility when you look at it.
<P>
	Of note also in that poll is another statistic that is relevant and 
I would like to talk about it here today. It is that 78 per cent of 
those people polled thought that reforms were to save money 
and to meet the government's goal of deficit reduction. People 
are very conscious of their responsibilities and of the current 
circumstances of the government.
<P>
	This discussion document has established three objectives: 
first, to help Canadians get and keep work; second, to support 
those most vulnerable; and third, to ensure affordability. These 
are certainly laudable goals which all of us can support. 
However the discussion paper does not set out a realistic plan to 
achieve them.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	First, the paper does not adequately recognize the gravity of 
the financial situation we are facing in this nation. Second, the 
paper attaches no price tag to any of the proposals. If the 
document is to enable Canadians to make intelligent choices 
regarding our social security system, it must include the cost of 
the programs and a realistic picture of how much money we can 
afford to spend. I certainly want to emphasize the word afford at 
this point in time.
<P>
	The first objective of the social security review is to increase 
employment. How does the minister propose to do this? Three 
ideas are presented and it is worthy of note that none of them are 
specific nor do any come with a price tag.
<P>
	The minister suggests improving employment development 
services. The list includes job counselling, training, labour 
market information and various other buzzwords that we read in 
discussion papers such as this one.
<P>
	The paper notes that existing programs which provide these 
services have not worked very well, however no consideration is 
given for why they have not worked. This is the first place where 
the paper is inadequate. No time is taken to consider why the 
existing programs have failed to meet their objectives. Rather it 
is automatically assumed that what we need is a new program to 
fix the mess that was left by the old ones, just a new program.
<P>
	Incentives for hiring unemployed workers are also suggested 
in the paper. Such schemes often call for the government to pay a 
portion of the worker's wages so that he or she can gain valuable 
work experience. This all sounds great on the surface, however 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7088"> 7088 </A></B>
<P>
these types of  programs lead only to rearranged jobs rather than 
adding new ones.
<P>
	Furthermore when employment incentives are exhausted 
firms simply drop the formerly subsidized workers from the 
payroll and the cycle begins again. Another unemployed person 
is picked up by the government program only to be dropped 
shortly thereafter. That is not the solution to the problem. The 
OECD, and I add this as support, has examined such subsidy 
programs and concluded they cost more than the value of the 
benefit they derive.
<P>
	The paper before us considers the unemployment insurance 
system. Certainly the unemployment insurance system needs 
reform but the minister should know that simply changing the 
name from unemployment insurance to employment insurance 
will not save the Canadian taxpayer one cent nor will it add one 
job to the economy.
<P>
	At least in the case of UI the paper gives two fairly clear 
options. However they are once again without any type of cost 
benefit analysis. How much more money would it cost? We do 
not know the answer to this question. This is precisely what 
makes this discussion paper inappropriate as a consultation tool 
under the present fiscal circumstances. Hard financial choices 
have to be made and this paper seems to ignore those choices 
which must be made not only by the House of Commons but by 
the Canadian people as a whole.
<P>
	The discussion paper also deals with the funding of education. 
Certainly literacy and lifelong learning are trendy concepts but 
where are the specifics? How will the government increase 
literacy and improve access to education? This is perhaps the 
section of the paper which is most devoid of any realistic and 
detailed suggestions. This is unfortunate since the government's 
own admission is that education is a key factor in economic 
growth and productivity.
<P>
	In addition to the status quo only two options are presented. 
They include the use of RRSPs to fund education and training 
and also a system of income contingent student loans.
<P>
	The government has turned to RRSPs to accomplish various 
whims of its social agenda. It does not want to deal with what I 
believe is the root problem: government overspending. RRSPs 
were used to stimulate housing in the first time home buyers 
plan. Now the government is considering them for education.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Canada's growing inability to fund essential programs cannot 
be resolved on the back of RRSPs even though they may be a 
good idea for saving not only for education but for a person's 
retirement. Rather the government must cut unnecessary 
spending in order to stop the crippling effects of our spiralling 
debt.
<P>
	On the issue of income contingent loans I will simply draw the 
attention of hon. members to a private member's bill on this 
very issue by the leader of the Reform Party. We encourage 
members opposite to continue to read the blue book. It has given 
me great pleasure to watch the Minister of Finance as he has 
moved from the red book to the purple book to the grey book. 
Most likely one of these days he will see the light and accept the 
blue book.
<P>
	The second objective of the government's social security 
review is to support those most vulnerable. We in the Reform 
Party support this objective as well. Once again, however, we 
disagree with the discussion paper as to the best way to achieve 
this goal. The role of social policy must be to foster the right 
balance between personal responsibility to care for yourself and 
your family and both public and private health for those truly in 
need; in other words, targeted support and assistance.
<P>
	Since the 1960s the government has enacted program after 
program which discouraged personal responsibility and 
encouraged many Canadians to rely on the government for their 
support and sustenance. We see the devastating results today.
<P>
	The third objective in the government's social security review 
is to ensure that social programs are financially sustainable. We 
all support that. It is a good goal. However, how is it going to be 
done? The green book contains the statement: ``The debt needs 
to be tackled because it causes real damage to jobs and 
security''. Where has the minister been? The debt has been 
causing real damage to jobs and security for quite some time 
now.
<P>
	Perhaps the minister should pay more careful attention to his 
colleague the Minister of Finance. He recognizes that the debt 
and the deficit are hurting our economy now. It is crippling our 
ability to compete economically. One of the facts we know is 
that the annual cost of the $535 billion debt now consumes 42 
per cent of federal revenues, excluding the unemployment 
insurance program which is self-financing.
<P>
	I ask this question: Does the Minister of Human Resources 
Development understand the significance of our ability to 
finance social programs? What about the possibility of a 
recession? It could occur before the government significantly 
surpasses or meets the 3 per cent deficit to GDP target. What 
will that mean to government revenues? It will mean that they 
could dive, that interest rates could climb and possibly the debt 
will spiral. I shudder to think of the fate of our social programs 
and medicare under those circumstances.
<P>
	From a financial perspective another serious problem with 
regard to this review process is the exclusion of the Canada 
pension program and old age assistance from the process. Under 
the present framework these two programs will become more 
expensive due to changing demographics. This expansion will 
increase payroll taxes causing a further drop in employment and 
increased economic insecurity. This is only symptomatic of a  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7089"> 7089 </A></B>
<P>
broader problem. If unchecked, the growth in social spending 
when combined with interest on the debt will consume 100 per 
cent of government revenues by the year 2010.
<P>
	As I have said, the traditional Liberal approach to social 
policy which is presented in this discussion paper denies the 
financial realities of today. Recognizing the extreme 
seriousness of our deficit problem and reducing social program 
expenditures is essential if we are to preserve the ability to help 
those who are truly in need.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	Reductions in spending are not heartless. Consider the advice 
of the finance minister to our finance committee:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If people come before you and say that now is not the time to cut, ask them to 
describe the morality and the justice of letting the debt continue to run wild, 
unchecked, ruining the future of our children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is a significant statement and one that must be 
considered when we look at this social review. When the social 
review is considered in the context of Canada's economic 
situation, one hard fact emerges to which the green book gives 
little attention. The social security review must result in 
expenditure reductions. Seventy-eight per cent of the people 
polled said that must be a target.
<P>
	The finance minister admitted this reality in his budget 
speech in February when he said the days of governments-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I wonder if I might 
seek the assistance of the House. The 10 minutes has certainly 
well lapsed. I know that 10 minutes on subject matter of such 
importance is not very long. If the House would agree to let the 
member conclude his remarks, we would waive the five minute 
question and comment period.
<P>
	Agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that 
very much.
<P>
	If the government wants to meet its objectives of helping 
people find and keep work, protecting the vulnerable and 
ensuring affordability, it must recognize that major reductions 
in spending are required. Only when the financial situation of 
this country is brought under control will our social programs be 
safe.
<P>
	In light of this the Minister of Human Resources 
Development must be criticized for neglecting to include 
financial details in the discussion paper. If the government 
continues on its present course with social reform and refuses to 
make the required reductions in expenditures, the time will soon 
come when Canada will be unable to care for those who are truly 
in need. Reformers are much too responsible to let that happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker , it is a 
pleasure for me to rise in the House today to respond to the 
government motion on social program reform. It is indeed 
encouraging to see the Liberal Party which brought us these 
failed experiments in social engineering finally concede that its 
programs are unworkable and unsustainable.
<P>
	Canada is under attack today, far greater than any attack that 
might have come our way by war. We are under attack by a 
deficit and a debt that are dragging us down. The finance 
minister has come to appreciate this. In the last week or so he has 
been talking about the fact that we are in debt to our eyeballs, the 
impact that debt has on job creation and indeed the threat to our 
social programs.
<P>
	I am pleased we are having this discussion today because the 
social programs we are talking about represent such a huge part 
of the federal government's budget. In addressing these 
programs we must find a way of delivering them not only 
cheaper but better. I think that can be done. Over the years we 
have thrown money at these problems to the detriment. We have 
not helped the situation, we have aggravated it.
<P>
	I look forward to this discussion today. I would like to point 
out there should be no question that when it is all over there must 
be a dollar saving. The taxpayers are asking for it. It was 
reflected in the study reported today in the <I>Financial Post</I> that 
Canadian taxpayers are supporting what is going on here 
because they very much believe it is going to represent a saving 
in tax dollars, which we all so desperately need. I want to make 
that point. It is not something the government should be 
ashamed of. It is something the people in this country want and 
are asking for.
<P>
	Nowhere is it more evident in the Liberal attempt to change or 
reorder society than in the social programs that directly intrude 
on the family. The whole area of child care expenditure with the 
state as the nanny is a clear example of this intrusion. Today I 
will look at the Liberal ideas and current programs and I will 
offer the Reform constructive alternative.
<P>
	The Liberal social security discussion paper describes 
institutional day care as a priority if social programs are to be 
reformed. It states that we must provide working parents with 
the assurance of quality care. I would ask what care could 
possibly be better than quality care offered by the child's own 
parents? No government program or initiative, no matter how 
well thought out and expensive, could ever provide the love and 
affection or match the quality of care that only parents can 
provide.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	The minister stated in the House when asked about informal 
child care, meaning family, friends and neighbours, that parents 
have to work because that is how they get sufficient income. The 
minister should have said sufficient disposable income because 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7090"> 7090 </A></B>
<P>
almost all  Canadians earn more than sufficient wages. This 
government and others tax over half of it away. It is excessively 
high taxes that have forced both parents out to work.
<P>
	When my Reform colleagues and I came to Ottawa we 
promised to be a constructive alternative, to be open and honest 
and offer our best solutions to the debate. We have done this in 
many ways, including producing our plan to eliminate the 
deficit in three years and a comprehensive policy manual called 
the blue sheet.
<P>
	Today in this House I am going to make it very clear where the 
Reform Party stands on the reform of social programs directed 
at children. I am also going to give the minister some clear 
direction in some areas where he can cut spending or spend more 
effectively.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes that the care of children is the 
domain of families and that parents must have full responsibility 
in Canadian society to nurture, provide for and rear their 
children. Current federal government programs are intrusive 
and restrict the choices that parents may make in deciding on the 
best type of care for their family.
<P>
	The role of government is to provide a fair tax and benefit 
system that provides parents with the opportunity to properly 
care for their children in a manner of their choosing. 
Government must uphold the authority and responsibilities of 
parents as exclusive in the area of child rearing. The only 
acceptable direct role for the government is as an intervener to 
protect children in cases of abuse or neglect.
<P>
	According to the red ink book, this Liberal government is 
spending over 400 million tax dollars a year on institutionalized 
day care already and plans to spend an additional $720 million 
over the next three years. Given the recent discovery that the 
current deficit is indeed as serious as we have been saying all 
along, how do we justify this? A Reform government would end 
all state run day care.
<P>
	We believe that the federal government should not involve 
itself with day care programs in any way. If regulation of 
services is necessary then this should be provided by the level of 
government closest to those Canadians receiving the service 
which can most efficiently provide that regulation. Regulation 
of day care is a provincial responsibility and should remain so. 
Federal involvement in and funding for day care should be 
terminated.
<P>
	Let us make no mistake about this point. Federal governments 
have long justified their intrusion in matters of provincial social 
program responsibility with the short phrase: ``They cannot 
afford to fund it fully themselves''. If the provinces cannot 
afford it, it is because it is indeed unaffordable. There is only 
one source of funding for all levels of government because there 
is only one taxpayer. If taxpayers cannot afford something 
provincially, what makes the Liberal government think that it 
can afford it?
<P>
	The military family support program is a small bureaucracy 
within the Department of National Defence that costs taxpayers 
$16 million a year and which does not directly benefit one child. 
There is another $100 million to be saved by eliminating the 
children's bureau of Health Canada. This is not a Liberal 
creation. It was a pet project of the failed government of Brian 
Mulroney. There should be no opposition from this Liberal 
government to eliminating this large Conservative created 
bureaucracy that exists simply to study day care and push 
so-called safe sex education. Little of this $100 million directly 
benefits children.
<P>
	The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
spends $270 million on various child care programs. Much of 
this money is directed at institutions and so-called 
professionals. This is unacceptable to the Reform Party and we 
believe it must stop.
<P>
	The child care expense deduction is an example of gross 
inequality in our tax system, discriminating against stay at home 
parents. This tax deduction will cost over $1.5 billion in lost 
revenue per year while the modest supplemental benefit is 
another $400 million.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	There are several reasonable alternatives to this current 
situation. However the bottom line is that any benefit which is 
given to parents to care for their children must be applied 
equally regardless of employment status.
<P>
	A few weeks ago the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Finance shot down a bill in this House that would have 
allowed parents to split some of their income for taxation 
purposes. Such a measure would have introduced some of the 
equity and fairness we as a party are looking for. It would also 
have recognized the value of the work of stay at home parents 
who are mostly women.
<P>
	This government likes to talk about defending women's rights 
and introducing equality for women. In fact, it has even 
appointed a secretary of state responsible for so-called women's 
issues. I wonder which issues this secretariat represents. Are 
they the issues pushed by NAC and the day care lobby? They are 
certainly not responding to the needs and concerns of working 
Canadian parents, the majority of whom wish to have one parent 
stay at home to raise their children as was made quite clear by 
the recent Angus Reid poll on the family.
<P>
	We believe that tax reform will be a key aspect of any true 
reform of social programs. As a party, Reformers believe that a 
move toward a system of flat taxation will lower administrative 
costs dramatically and introduce new fairness to taxation.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7091"> 7091 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to children, the Reform Party would continue 
to recognize the costs associated with their care through a tax 
credit that would be available to those families with dependent 
children who are in financial need. The credit would be a simple 
line on the income tax form and applied directly to each year's 
taxes. Such a system would provide fair treatment to all 
families and allow parents the freedom to make their choices 
about providing the best care for their children.
<P>
	There are some obvious spin-off benefits to the family centre 
policy that the Reform Party is advocating. Parents provide the 
best nurturing environment for their children. Children who are 
raised in other environments are statistically more likely to 
engage in criminal activity, do poorly in school and become a 
burden on the social safety net. It is in the best interests of all 
Canadians, financially and otherwise, to ensure that children 
receive the best possible care available, the care that exists 
within the family.
<P>
	I have pointed out areas of spending in which this Liberal 
government can find savings in the order of hundreds of millions 
of dollars. I have described some basic ways to make the social 
programs currently directed at children more equitable while 
allowing parents more options.
<P>
	Let us get out of the day care business, provide a fair tax 
system and allow families the freedom to make their own 
decisions. I believe that we need to put the needs and concerns of 
families first. We can achieve our deficit cutting goals, save our 
social safety net-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, you still have a few moments. 
Of course we will look forward to hearing the culmination of 
your remarks a little bit after Question Period.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m. pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House 
will now proceed to Statements by Members pursuant to 
Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on September 30 the Supreme Court of Canada 
accepted the logic of the defence of drunkenness when one Henri 
Daviault said he did not know what he was doing when he 
dragged a 65-year old women from her wheelchair and raped 
her.
<P>
	When the highest court in Canada grants acquittal for rape 
based on drunkenness, women are set back 100 years to 
non-person status. This is insensitive and offensive. 
Drunkenness must not be an excuse to commit crimes against 
women.
<P>
	On behalf of all women, I urge the justice minister to act

	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples has just announced 
that it is delaying for the second time the release of its final 
report. This report, which has already cost $58 million, will not 
be available until early in 1996. Aboriginal people faced with 
overwhelming poverty, unprecedented unemployment and 
suicide rates, and housing conditions which bring shame on 
Canada around the world, do not need additional studies.
<P>
	While the commission studies the issues to death, the 
government makes piecemeal decisions or defers them until the 
commission submits its report, which will only state the 
obvious.
<P>
	The $58 million would have been better used to build 1,000 
houses. The minister should take action and give Natives the 
funds essential to their future, which a royal commission is now 
wasting.

	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple

years a herd of 800 Canadian owned alpacas has been held in 
Australia pending clearance by Agriculture Canada. These 
animals originated in New Zealand where they may have 
contacted the neuroparasite E-Cervi from deer.
<P>
	There is no evidence that alpacas can carry and transmit this 
parasite, but it has not been proved that they cannot. The 
parasite has a dormancy period of several years and there is no 
clinical test for it.
<P>
	One must wonder why Agriculture Canada's concern for the 
health of Canadian animals is greater than the concern of 
Immigration Canada for the health and welfare of Canadian 
people. Every year thousands of immigrants enter Canada 
without being screened for HIV. The transmission vectors of this 
virus are well known. Many years may pass before HIV carriers 
develop full-blown AIDS but the virus is readily detectable

little less wasteful and we recycle a whole lot more, but the basic 
patterns of our society remain unchanged and our long term 
well-being is seriously threatened.
<P>
	Part of the problem lies with the lack of clarity of the term. 
People interpret it in different ways and as a result sustainable 
development is implemented in different ways.
<P>
	A number of government initiatives currently under way must 
help clarify what is meant by the term in order to ensure a shift 
toward sustainability. We must ensure that the needs of our

violent act and ended up in jail.
<P>
	How can violence be prevented if weapons are available 
illegally? Would longer sentences curb violence? Apparently 
not, judging from the United States.

	I believe we must look at the root causes of violence, what we 
teach youngsters including through TV and videos, the 
adequacy of mental health services, economic and job security, 
adequate social housing and community services.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on October 19, the Prime Minister said in this 
House that in his thirty years as a politician, he had never been 
advised of any spying activities.
<P>
	Saturday, however, as he left a special cabinet meeting, after 
questions by the Bloc about the confessions of spy Mike Frost 
and additional revelations made the day before on the CBC 
French network's news program, the Prime Minister suddenly 
announced he had specifically instructed his ministers not to spy 
on citizens who are conducting legitimate operations.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. When 
was the Prime Minister advised that federal services were 
spying or had spied on Canadian citizens engaged in legitimate 
activities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what 
the Prime Minister did not say. What he said, what he repeated in 
the House, what he repeated Saturday and what he repeated to 
everyone is that he never, never, never was involved in spying on 
any political party whatsoever. He would appreciate the same 
courtesy being extended to all Canadians. That is what he  said 
Saturday and what he said last week, and that is this 
government's policy.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister says that the Prime 
Minister was never involved in spying activities. That is not the 
question. The question is about the federal government and 
federal services.
<P>
	According to official information released in 1991, the CSE's 
intelligence and security activities are the responsibility of the 
Privy Council and thus of the Prime Minister. Consequently, the 
present Prime Minister has direct access to information 
collected in the past by the CSE.
<P>
	My question is whether, considering recent revelations, the 
government has specifically checked with the CSE whether 
sovereignist figures like René Lévesque, Jacques Parizeau or 
Louise Beaudoin have ever been under electronic or other 
surveillance.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's 
premise is false. Second, Saturday, the Prime Minister himself 
defended the right of separatists to express their views and do 
their job in a legitimate manner. I wonder whether the hon. 
member is referring to what might have been a policy in the 
past? Does he refuse to take the Prime Minister at his word when 
he says that all Canadians, including separatists, have the right 
to do their job without being monitored or spied on? Does he not 
take the Prime Minister at his word?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do not accept answers that are full of holes and 
hidden meanings. There are those who know and those who do 
not want to know. Obviously, the Prime Minister and the Deputy 
Prime Minister belong to the latter group, those who would 
rather see no evil and hear no evil.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> They would rather not see or hear about 
illegal activities.
<P>
	I want to ask the Deputy Prime Minister, as a guardian and the 
government which is also a guardian, in the broader sense, of our 
fundamental rights, to tell us, and the question is the same one I 
asked earlier, and I would now like a precise answer: Did the 
government check with the CSE whether the CSE had ever spied 
on René Lévesque, Jacques Parizeau or Louise Beaudoin?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I said Friday, and the 
Prime Minister said last week and he said it again on Saturday: 
the CSE has no mandate to spy on any Canadians, including 
members of the Parti Quebecois, the Bloc Quebecois, the 
Reform Party, the Liberals or any political party. They do not 
have the right to engage in spying. Is that clear?

<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Saturday, after a cabinet strategy meeting, the Prime Minister 
tried to minimize the extent of the revelations concerning the 
spying activities of federal agencies. He said that he was not 
interested in this kind of thing or in what happened under 
previous governments, including those under which he served.
<P>
	Can the Deputy Prime Minister tell us what important piece of 
news her government has learned lately, which prompted it to 
give clear instructions putting an end to spying on citizens 
engaged in legitimate political activities?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize members 
opposite are looking for an issue. Let me tell them that they are 
looking in the wrong place.
<P>
	There is no smoking gun. The Prime Minister has repeated the 
position of the government, that the service in question has no 
legal right to spy on any Canadian, including legitimate political 
parties.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the instructions the Prime Minister 
hastily gave this week-end were only aimed at reassuring the 
public following extremely serious revelations concerning 
illegal activities on the part of federal intelligence agencies?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, the Prime 
Minister confirmed, as he did last week, as I did on Friday, as we 
will undoubtedly do when answering questions tomorrow and 
the day after, that the CSE does not have the mandate to spy on 
Canadians. The Prime Minister, true democrat that he is, 
stressed that no MP, no political party, including separatists, 
should be spied on. Because he is a real democrat, he is looking 
forward to meeting the separatists on the battle field, and the 
real battle field will be the referendum, when they are brave 
enough to set a date for it.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the C. D. Howe Institute put it bluntly when it said 
that the 3 per cent of GDP deficit reduction target signalled the 
lack of urgency. Many question whether the government will 
seize the opportunity to get its financial house in order at all.
<P>
	C. D. Howe, the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, the <I>Financial Post</I> and other 
commentators speak for a growing contingent that criticize the 
finance minister for not moving decisively toward the goal of a 
zero deficit.
<P>
	The economic growth which Canada temporarily enjoys 
affords the government a great opportunity to put its fiscal house 
in order. I ask the finance minister: Will the government 
abandon its timid deficit reduction target of 3 per cent of GDP in 
favour of the more ambitious target of eliminating the deficit by 
the end of its current term in office?

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the C. D. Howe Institute has made 
a very constructive contribution to the debate. I would only hope 
the Reform Party might emulate the C. D. Howe Institute and 
attempt to make a constructive contribution to the debate.
<P>
	Let me simply say that we are going to stay with our 3 per cent 
target because it is by far the best way to keep everybody's feet 
in the fire. As the hon. member knows, our ultimate goal is to 
eliminate the deficit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I assure the finance minister that the Reform Party 
is doing all it can to help him to convince his caucus to move in 
the right direction and reduce government spending.
<P>
	The minister's plan to trim the deficit will in three short years 
add $100 billion to our debt and increase the annual interest 
payments from $40 billion to $50 billion. If the government 
cannot do better than that we will be in a disastrous position

recession.

	Because our economy is not recession proof, is the finance

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the finance minister knows well we have tabled 
plans that would help him to accomplish the goal he has asked 
us to accomplish. We are willing to work constructively.
<P>
	It took a year for the minister to admit that the Reform Party 
was on the right track and he was on the wrong track with regard 
to meeting his wimpy deficit targets. I hope he takes our advice a 
little more quickly this time.
<P>
	The minister has set aside a contingency fund of $3 billion for 
the 1996-97 fiscal year. If the finance minister commits this 
fund to deficit reduction he will only be halfway to meeting his 
target.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The questions are little long today, probably 
because it is Monday. I would ask the hon. member to put his 
question forthwith.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Is the finance minister looking for cuts 
exclusive of the $3 billion contingency fund he has, or are his 
deficit reduction goals so timid that he is banking on the 
contingency fund to meet his deficit reduction target?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer to the 
member's question is on page 10 of the grey book. I would 
suggest that he read it. It is only a paragraph and a half. If he 
reads the rest of the book I am sure he will find the answers to a 
number of other questions he raises.
<P>
	I would like to say one thing. The questioner has said that the 
Reform Party has tabled its plans so that we might see them. We 
have given members of the Reform Party an opportunity here in 
the prebudget debate; they had absolutely nothing to say. They 
have had the summer and they are now sitting on the finance 
committee.
<P>
	The Reform Party has not tabled any plans. It has not given us 
any suggestions. It has done nothing but engage in empty 
rhetoric.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy

Mr. Speaker, the program review is not something for tabling.
<P>
	The member should have checked what I said at the recent

program review is a series of reviews by a cabinet committee

under a Liberal regime at that.

	What happened 24 years ago resulted in a royal commission

the laws of Canada, prohibiting it by law from spying on 
Canadians. I cannot see any clearer than that.

I repeated in the House last week. There is absolutely no

on welfare. Even the <I>Globe and Mail</I> is admitting that 
sponsorships, despite being a contractual agreement, are not 
worth the paper they are written on.

the enforcement of this program has failed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

breakdown is of concern. Certainly the consultation process has 
said that very loud and clear.
<P>
	Currently roughly 14 per cent of family class sponsorships do 
break down at an estimated cost of roughly $700 million to the

Responding to questions on the Lagueux report, the Minister of 
National Defence claimed that the report in no way implicates 
any of the senior officials in the department. Yet two directors 
general were reprimanded as a result of it. One subsequently 
committed suicide. The other was promoted one category and 
still occupies that same position. In fact, access to information 
reveals that two years after the Lagueux report this individual 
was still regularly approving contracts for amounts in excess of 
her authorization.
<P>
	Will the minister explain these inconsistencies in his 
response, especially since he claimed that the problems and the 
individuals concerned had been dealt with?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National

I should emphasize that all of these activities predate this 
government. We are very concerned with ensuring that all 
matters pertaining to the administration of the Department of 
National Defence are done in an appropriate manner.
<P>
	With respect to my comments earlier in the House, we were 
talking in the context of the deputy minister and assistant deputy 
ministers. I do recognize that senior people at the level of DG 
have been disciplined. There was one unfortunate occurrence to 
which the hon. member referred.
<P>
	I should also say, because the hon. member and his colleagues 
seem to believe there is something being hidden, that the 
Auditor General has been fully aware of this file for the past year 
or two. He has been kept fully abreast of all the details 
pertaining to this matter. Indeed he has the right to initiate any 
inquiry-in fact, I would invite him to do so-if he feels that the 
actions being taken internally are insufficient.
<P>
	Those actions have involved the RCMP, the Public Service 
Commission and other internal investigative organizations in 
government. It means that if the Auditor General wishes to 
initiate an investigation he may do so. All he has to do is let our 
officials know.
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Auditor General, as we have been informed in this 
Parliament, is an extremely busy individual. I doubt that he has 
time to isolate individual investigations of this sort.
<P>
	I am informed from within the department that this situation 
has resulted in poor morale and even fear of retribution for 
people who speak out.
<P>
	How can the minister justify failing to commission a 
professional, independent, clearly unbiased investigation into 
these areas of defence department management procedures? By 
refusing to take such action he is lending  credibility to the 
perception that something is very wrong in his department.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all concerning the Auditor General, at any one time in 
national defence the Auditor General is conducting between 
seven and twelve audits.
<P>
	The Auditor General has known about the situation in that 
particular administrative unit for a couple of years and has been 
briefed on how the department is dealing with it. At no time has 
he felt that a further investigation was warranted. If the Auditor 
General wishes to conduct such an investigation, he may 
certainly do so.
<P>
	As far as morale is concerned, Mr. Speaker, when you get a 
unit with about 45 or 50 people in it, where there have been 
allegations of misappropriation of funds, where there have been 
allegations of harassment and improper contracting practices, 
where a criminal charge has been laid and somebody is 
convicted, of course that hurts morale.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member not to contribute to trying to 
make morale, which is otherwise good in the national defence 
department, seem any less secure than it really is by the 
misguided charges that he and his colleagues have been making 
over the last number of weeks.

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue,

under way. It is well known that myself, the Solicitor General 
and the Minister of Justice are attempting to do whatever the 
government can to produce changes to our existing system so 
that we can decrease the number of smuggled weapons.
<P>
	I would remind the hon. member of a fact of which he appears 
unaware. We have 130 million border crossings annually 
between the U.S. and Canadian border. The United States is a 
country which has very widespread ownership of handguns in 
particular, but also other weapons. It is extremely difficult to 
interdict the weapons coming across under normal

to do so, which was filed with the Bureau of Competition Policy, 
is in legal limbo and even though it is refusing to negotiate 
seriously with a potential purchaser who could keep the plant

the minister can do to expedite this situation and if not, why not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first let me say that I share the member's concern for 
the employees and their families at this Ultramar facility, 
concerns that he and his colleagues from the Halifax area have 
raised repeatedly with me over the last few months.
<P>
	As he is aware, the undertakings to the director of 
investigation and research by Ultramar are a contractual matter 
to be dealt with by the director. Under the Competition Act the 
director is an independent law enforcement officer and I cannot 
interfere with that role.
<P>
	The legal action initiated by the Attorney General of Nova 
Scotia against the director and Ultramar has had the unfortunate 
effect of preventing the director from carrying out his 
responsibilities to deal with the issues of material adverse 
change and the sale process relating to the refinery.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how could the Deputy Prime Minister be so positive 
and rule out any possibility of spying on Canadian citizens, 
when the exemption granted the CSE regarding non-disclosure 
of personal information covers the entire category ``general 
public'', in other words, everyone in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, what I said Friday 
about the CSE is true. They are covered by the Criminal Code. 
They are subject to all Canadian laws, including the legislation 
to which the hon. member referred. Otherwise, if they were not 
covered, how could they be exempted?

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. The 
president of the CRTC has said that if private carriers do not 
voluntarily choose to carry French CBC Newsworld then action 
will be taken to impose it.
<P>
	This decision is another example of misguided government 
intervention. Why will the minister not let the free market 
determine what Canadians want to see on television?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there has been no Canadian government 
intervention at all. There has been a commitment by the 
president of the CBC and comments made by the president of the 
CRTC. That is all.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this action is nothing more than a $32.7 million dollar tax grab 
to add to the already burgeoning $1.1 billion CBC subsidy. The 
federal government is making all Canadians pay for a system 
they may not even use. How can the minister justify this?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think our colleague is very confused. A 
while ago the CBC applied to provide a certain service on 
specialized channels. The CRTC has granted that application. 
This is in keeping with the law. The CRTC is an arm's length 
agency and the Canadian government, including the minister, is 
not interfering in the process. There is no grab there.
<P>
	I can understand that our colleague would have difficulty 
accepting all of this, because as she said in <I>Hansard</I> at page 
6986: ``I agree with nothing''.

	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton,

legal assistance between the two countries on criminal matters.
<P>
	My question for the Solicitor General is in the form of 
concern on the part of some Canadians. They are concerned 
whether the treaty will in any way impinge on their basic rights 
and in any way subject them to more harassment.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the mutual legal assistance agreement signed today 
between Canada and India is not intended to infringe basic rights 
or create harassment of anyone. It is designed to intensify 
co-operation between law enforcement authorities in Canada 
and in India. It is similar to agreements we already have with a

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing,

Minister. It is about a contradiction in the social security green 
paper. There is much rhetoric in the paper and from the 
government generally about the importance of education, skills 
upgrading and training, with which we all agree.
<P>
	Could she indicate how her government's policy is designed 
to double or triple tuition fees and put student loans through the 
roof? How can that policy support the notion of Canadians 
becoming more educated, better trained and having their skills 
upgraded?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
hon. member for the question because I believe him when he 
says that he is interested in embarking on a real public exercise. 
I know he will join me in congratulating the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, who got a real vote of confidence from 
the people of Canada with the survey on the weekend that 
showed an overwhelming number of Canadians support real 
change.
<P>
	The minister is proposing a real change from the current 
system whereby we would be putting dollars directly into the 
hands of students. We do not want to see the post-secondary 
system starved. At the present moment if we continue on the 
downward course of cash transfers, that is exactly what is going 
to happen.

what kind of a budget it gets or the nature of the agreements it 
enters into with foreign intelligence agencies.

	Can the Deputy Prime Minister give the people of Quebec the

previously?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

himself stated over the weekend that he wants to fight the 
referendum battle on the real issues, the issue of jobs, of 
economic growth, of hope for Quebecers within Canada. As for 
myself, I cannot wait for the separatists to have the courage to 
call the referendum instead of making up stories about the CSE.

	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, today, October 24, is United Nations Day. 
Forty-nine years ago, on October 24, 1945, the Charter of the 
United Nations came into effect.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	This anniversary is cause for special celebrations as it marks 
the beginning of the 50th year of operation of this organization.
<P>
	I wish to thank all the Canadian men and women who have 
contributed over the past 49 years to building this great 
international organization. I am particularly grateful to those 
who promoted its growth over the years, as events unfolded, 
ensuring that it remain an organization concerned with meeting 
the major challenges of modern-day and with working 
relentlessly to promote international peace and security.
<P>
	Allow me to take this opportunity to emphasize the 
outstanding contribution of the men and women who risk their 
lives to defend the principles the UN stands for. I am thinking in 
particular of the 2,745 or so members of our Canadian Armed 
Forces and Royal Canadian Mounted Police serving under the 
UN flag in more than nine peacekeeping operations around the 
world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7104"> 7104 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I also thank the United Nations Association in Canada which 
through its efforts has made the work of the United Nations 
organization known to the Canadian general public.
<P>
	During this year of celebrations which begins today the 
association would be doubly involved on the Canadian scene. 
On one hand, it will continue its daily work and, on the other 
hand, via the Canadian committee for the United Nations 50th 
anniversary, will co-ordinate the activities that will take place 
throughout the year in commemoration of this important event.
<P>
	The field of activity covered by the United Nations is the 
cornerstone of Canadian foreign policy. The challenges facing 
the UN in matters of peacekeeping, international security, the 
promotion of democracy and the struggle for equality and 
human rights are all considered vitally important in Canadian 
eyes as well.
<P>
	More than ever the community of nations and states needs a 
strong, credible, international institution equipped with the 
proper tools to face the challenge that awaits it at the dawn of the 
21st century.
<P>
	In closing, I ask all members of the House to support this 
declaration since it reaffirms Canada's commitment to the 
values that presided nearly half a century ago over the creation 
of the United Nations organization, a multilateral institution 
which today more than ever is a necessary part of 
internationalism and its ideals.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of all Bloc Quebecois members, I am pleased to announce 
that today, October 24, is United Nations Day and marks the 
50th anniversary of this international organization.
<P>
	In a speech he gave in Montreal in May 1992, United Nations 
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali reminded us that ``to 
relate to the universal, one must first be true to oneself. That is 
why sound internationalization of modern life must be based on 
a solid sense of identity. Excessive or misunderstood 
internationalization could destroy cultures and melt them into a 
standard culture, from which the world has nothing to gain''.
<P>
	This quote is particularly significant today, when the UN will 
undergo-soon, we hope-an extensive reform. It faces many 
challenges in the months and years to come.
<P>
	One of these challenges is the emergence of many new 
international players the UN will have to deal with. The radical 
changes in the international geopolitical context have led to a 
large increase in the number of players. Because of this, the new 
problems facing the international community have become even 
more complex and varied.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	There is, however, something good in this as it reflects the 
reality, the will of the people.
<P>
	We are pleased to note that the UN is concerned about a 
standard culture replacing national identities at a time when the 
Canadian government shamelessly claims that there is only one 
culture in Canada, a so-called Canadian culture. It is partly to 
fight this standardization process that the first action of a 
Quebec having achieved sovereignty following a fully 
legitimate process under international law will be to integrate 
into the complex web of multilateral relations by applying to 
join the UN.
<P>
	In closing, I wish to express our sincere thanks to the United 
Nations Association in Canada and to all Quebecers and 
Canadians who helped shape the UN and make it so respectable 
in our eyes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the eve of 
the 50th anniversary of the UN and on United Nations Day, as 
Reform foreign affairs critic I would like to express my support 
for the values and goals set forth by the original UN charter: 
collective security, freedom, justice, and human development.
<P>
	With each passing decade the universality of these values has 
become more widely accepted and the UN has played a strong 
part in this evolution. As we all know, Canada has played a 
pivotal role in the strengthening and development of the United 
Nations. Through our innovation in the field of peacekeeping, 
our dedication to the principle of co-operative multilateralism 
and our unfailing dedication to world peace and human 
development, Canadians have provided a fine example for the 
world community to follow.
<P>
	I especially thank all those Canadians who have had a direct 
hand in making the United Nations a success. We thank our 
peacekeepers, past and present, our UN relief workers and all 
other dedicated Canadians who have worked to promote the 
principles and the goals of the UN.
<P>
	A great deal of work remains, however, and the United 
Nations must certainly reform in order to modernize and prepare 
for the 21st century. This is work that must progress quickly. 
Canada should play a leadership role in making sure that greater 
efficiency, responsiveness, accountability and transparency are 
achieved in coming years.
<P>
	The United Nations can be made better. As members of the 
House we should rededicate ourselves to making it happen. On 
its 50th anniversary and United Nations Day let us all stand up 
for the principles we cherish and for which the United Nations 
has been fighting for 50 years: international peace and security, 
human rights and justice, and contributing toward the social 
progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.

United Nations Day and the 50th anniversary of the founding of

<P>
	On behalf of my colleagues in the New Democratic Party, I 
join in paying tribute today particularly to those Canadian men 
and women who have done so much to strengthen and build the 
United Nations.
<P>
	Our peacekeepers around the world-and Canada has played a 
leading role in peacekeeping-have obviously made Canadians 
very proud, as well as other Canadian men and women who are 
active within the United Nations structure.
<P>
	We certainly join with the Minister of Foreign Affairs in 
urging significant reform of the United Nations. The concept of 
a standing army that is able to respond at short notice is one that 
we welcome. As well we believe there should be far more focus 
on preventive diplomacy, on the opportunity to prevent crises 
from developing into national and in some cases international 
tragedies.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	We also support the concept certainly of an international 
tribunal to judge war criminals, to bring to justice those 
responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
<P>
	Finally I want to say that we in this party strongly support the 
concept of broadening the base of the United Nations to 
encompass a United Nations parliamentary assembly. While we 
recognize that this is a step that may take some time to develop, 
certainly we want to encourage the foreign minister in the 
actions that he is taking to develop support for this concept both 
in Canada and globally.
<P>
	In closing, once again I want to join in congratulating those 
involved both in Canada, NGOs in Canada who support the 
United Nations, and globally-

changes to the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	They want an act serious enough to deter young people from 
committing crime and tough enough to provide real justice.
<P>
	There are many Canadians from coast to coast who feel that 
the Young Offenders Act does not meet its objectives and in 
some instances actually contributes to an increase in crime by 
weakening penalties against delinquents and does not deal with 
repeat offenders in a strong fashion.

by hundreds of petitioners from across Canada, and in particular 
from my own constituency of Burnaby-Kingsway, from Port 
Moody, from Kamloops and a number of other jurisdictions.
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House the fact that 
the current Criminal Code denies people who are suffering from 
terminal or irreversible and debilitating illness the right to 
choose freely and voluntarily to end their lives with the 
assistance of a physician.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call upon Parliament to amend the 
Criminal Code to ensure the right of all Canadians to die with 
dignity by allowing people with terminal or irreversible and 
debilitating illness the right to the assistance of a physician in 
ending their lives at the time of their choice and subject to strict 
safeguards to prevent abuse and ensure that the decision is free, 
informed, competent and voluntarily.

<P>
	They request that Parliament not amend the human rights

<P>
	They present this petition in memory of Dawn Shaw. For their 
sake I would like to go over some of the things they have 
mentioned. They are concerned that the present justice system 
fails to protect the children of our communities who are 
increasingly becoming victims of sexual assault. Judges should 
not be allowed to drop sexual assault charges because of a delay 
in bringing a case to trial. Jail sentences for sexual assault 
offenders should be lengthened for any person convicted of 
sexual assault.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	Community interests should be protected by permitting police 
to take DNA samples from persons suspected of sexual assault. 
Sexual offenders should undergo monitoring by police. 
Pedophiles and sexual offenders should be required to register 
with police in their community of residence and the police be 
required to contact schools and agencies.
<P>
	In memory of Dawn Shaw they request that Parliament enact 
legislation to change the justice system to provide greater 
protection for children from sexual assault and to assure 
conviction of those offenders.

undefined phrase sexual orientation in the Canadian Human 
Rights Act. Refusing to define the statement leaves 
interpretation open to the courts, a very dangerous precedent to 
set.

<P>
	I have the privilege of presenting a petition signed by 174 of 
my constituents. Their concern has led them to sign a statement 
which says that the majority of Canadians believe that same sex 
couples should not receive the same privileges as heterosexual 
couples. I share their belief that all Canadians are already

point out that Canada's mining industry is the mainstay of 
employment in over 150 communities across Canada.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	They point out that the Canadian Mineral Industry Federation 
has proposed a 10-point plan of action to be addressed by both 
the mineral industry and the Government of Canada to keep 
mining in Canada.
<P>
	Therefore, they call upon Parliament to take action that will 
generate employment in the mining sector, promote exploration, 
rebuild Canada's mineral reserves, sustain mining communities 
and keep mining in Canada.

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would ask that all questions be allowed to stand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I would 
ask the parliamentary secretary to the House leader if he would 
be good enough to respond to Question No. 54 on the Order 
Paper dated May 10. It is my understanding that such questions 
are to be responded to within 45 days.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I recognize the hon. member did 
star his question. Therefore, a response is required within 45 
days.
<P>
	In the particular case of his question, I have seen the draft 
response to that question. I was unhappy with the response 
because the response was a response, but not an answer.
<P>
	I sent the reply back to the officials concerned and asked that 
it be improved. A more fulsome answer I think is the word 
mentioned by the Secretary of State for the Status of Women, 
and I appreciate her assistance.
<P>
	I know the hon. member will understand when I say that I sent 
this question back for a more fulsome reply. When that is 
forthcoming I will bring it to the House as quickly as possible, 
and I thank him for raising the matter today.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Shall all questions stand?

Resuming debate, the hon. Secretary of State for 
Multiculturalism and the Status of Women.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am delighted to address the issue of social security reform. It is a 
vital one for all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Indeed, members of this House and the Canadian people face 
a major challenge: updating our social security system. Based 
on the opinion polls, I must say that it seems they are ready and 
they recognize the need.
<P>
	For 50 years, successive Liberal governments instituted a 
series of social programs which shared the wealth of this 
country among all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Women have been particularly concerned about this as some 
of those programs have helped them and their families, their 
children, get back on their feet after a job loss. Others help some 
Canadians get training and an education, while others still have 
come to the rescue of Canadians who have nowhere else to turn.
<P>
	However, the world has changed faster than our programs 
have and the system has not kept pace with the dramatic 
transformation in the economy, in technology, in the Canadian 
family, in global competition and in our fiscal situation.
<P>
	Canadian society is still changing. Women play a much larger 
role in the workforce and in the paid economy than they did 
some 40 or 50 years ago. The needs of other groups such as 
ethnocultural communities, indigenous peoples and the disabled 
have also evolved rapidly over these years.
<P>
	The workplace is in transformation. As familiar jobs 
disappear people are forced to work in unfamiliar situations. 
Many are joining the growing non-standard workforce of part 
time, temporary home workers or workers who work in their 
homes and contract work. These people have to do without the 
security of traditional company pensions and benefit plans.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	As we shift to knowledge based industries, people need more 
education, training and continued learning. I have witnessed this 
transformation in my riding of Mount Royal. During the last 
recession we experienced our share of factory closures where 
people saw jobs and some permanent positions banished 
forever.
<P>
	In many ways the riding of Mount Royal is a reflection of 
Canadian society. We are a diverse group of people of all 
religious, ethnocultural and age groups who live and work 
together in both official languages. For the most part we have 
worked together in harmony, peacefully with good productive 
lives full of hope and fulfilment.
<P>
	Now my constituents are doing their best to adapt to our 
country's new economic reality. Many are succeeding but too 
many are falling through the cracks. I know that my riding of 
Mount Royal is not an exception to the rule. The new challenge 
people face there exists in every major city across the land.
<P>
	Since 1981 the number of Canadians on social assistance has 
doubled to just over three million. Canada assistance plan or 
CAP expenditures have increased from $2.6 billion to $8 billion 
annually. Clearly the social support network has not masked 
societal changes which have occurred over the past 30 years.
<P>
	The bottom line is that we are facing a fundamental shift in the 
way we live and work. Therefore we must redesign our social 
security program to respond to that shift, building on Canadian 
values of compassion and shared opportunity. At the same time 
we must ensure they remain sustainable and affordable.
<P>
	Combined spending on unemployment insurance and social 
assistance has grown as a proportion of Canada's economic 
output by more than 75 per cent between 1972 and 1992. Such 
increases are simply not sustainable. The federal government 
now spends over $38 billion for all social security programs, but 
it has to spend $40 billion for interest on our debt.
<P>
	We are sending that money for the most part to New York, 
Tokyo and Berlin. This is not the way we want to get our system 
under control. If we do not get our social security system and 
others under control, foreign markets will decide what our 
social programs should look like. That is not what Canadians 
want.
<P>
	We want to be able to design our programs for ourselves. 
Therefore I commend my colleague, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, for having the courage to undertake 
such a fundamental reform of Canada's social programs. I echo 
his invitation to all Canadians to get involved in this very 
important discussion, address the green paper, get a copy and 
work hard to give us the kinds of answers that will reflect their 
values. I applaud his insistence that our new system should be 
affordable, effective and fair.
<P>
	To live up to the minister's commitment we will need social 
programs that reflect the reality of rural, urban and metropolitan 
communities. Our social programs must protect those most in 
need: people who cannot work, people on low incomes in 
families that are struggling to get by, people who face barriers 
due to disability or chronic illness, and especially children 
living in poverty.
<P>
	We must improve the welfare of our children because 1.2 
million of them presently live in poverty. This is totally 
unacceptable. Children are poor because their mothers are poor. 
We must therefore ensure that women get the opportunity to 
train for all types of jobs. We must also help those who rely on 
welfare to be moved off that cycle.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7109"> 7109 </A></B>
<P>
	Too many people spend years on social assistance, even 
though with the right kind of employment and training 
opportunities they could find work; but they need a proper 
support system. Too many disadvantaged families get caught 
in the welfare trap for the very good reason that they seem 
better off there. That is really not a very sensible way to have 
the system structured.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Our future prosperity requires that all people contribute to the 
best of their potential in order to fulfil their dreams. We have a 
responsibility to those who depend on social programs to move 
from dependence to full participation, for the best social 
security is a job. The essence of our reform is to get people back 
to work.
<P>
	We believe this is the shortest route to prosperity. A strong 
economy is crucial to the independence and equality of 
Canadians outside the mainstream, especially women, newly 
arrived Canadians and other groups.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Yes, Mr. Speaker, we must make some difficult decisions. Our 
choices today will determine the opportunities available 
tomorrow. The government's No. 1 priority is economic growth 
and job creation. To succeed in this mission, we must act on 
many fronts. The reform of social security is one of our most 
important initiatives in this regard. The reform of our social 
security system must be based on equality for all Canadians. We 
absolutely must listen to the communities which for too long 
have been marginalized in our society: native peoples, 
newcomers, the disabled and women. The nature and scope of 
the options we are proposing are fundamental. It is therefore 
imperative that these groups participate in the consultation 
process under way.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I strongly urge all groups to participate, particularly women's 
groups and ethnocultural organizations. I send them a personal 
message of encouragement. With this reform we will have the 
opportunity to help shape the future of Canada's social programs 
together. I believe that groups owe it to themselves and to their 
constituencies to make the most of this occasion. I urge them not 
to miss the chance to address this consultation document.
<P>
	One of the single most important factors to take into account 
as we examine the green paper is the impact the reforms will 
have on women. Why? It is because women represent 52 per cent 
of the population in Canada. Women make an enormous 
contribution to our society and to our economy, and the future of 
our children lies in the hands of our women. Today I urge 
members to consider the important ways to make sure that our 
new social security system works particularly for women and 
children who are our future.
<P>
	First, we must ensure that the voices of women are heard in 
the consultation process, in our riding and at the committee, for 
women's issues are fundamentally society's issues. They are 
issues that concern every one of us in the House. Women are not 
special interest groups. They represent diverse backgrounds 
with a full range of interests and concerns.
<P>
	To succeed in our mission it is essential that we get their 
guidance. They have to tell us what kind of social programs 
would give them a sense of security, a sense of well-being, and 
contribute to their progress toward equality. Women's groups 
and organizations have been a most important catalyst for 
progress on women's equality and to ensure our full partnership 
and participation in the growth and development of the Canada 
of tomorrow.
<P>
	As a result we will all benefit from their work. We have to 
ensure that organizations representing women's concerns, 
groups that have limited resources and broad mandates, have 
sufficient time and support to participate in this critical 
exercise. The Minister of Human Resources Development has to 
be thanked for facilitating this process.
<P>
	Everyone must be able to participate in this consultation 
process because every Canadian will be affected by the final 
result. The Minister of Human Resources Development has 
already spoken with many organizations. He and I will pursue 
discussions with both women's groups and organizations 
concerned with poverty.
<P>
	The second important component to building a social security 
program that serves everyone is to create a system that is gender 
sensitive. This means a system that recognizes that women and 
men in Canada experience life differently.
<P>
	The discussion paper on social security reform outlines the 
key life streams of Canadians: work, learning and security. 
These are areas where women have different and too often 
disadvantaged experiences. They have a different rhythm of 
attachment to the workforce.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	We must make sure changes and initiatives we suggest in 
these areas reflect that difference, namely child bearing, care for 
the ill and care for the elderly. The options for reform provide 
many openings for change. With gender sensitive responses 
those openings can become doors of opportunity for women and 
for society. Women may benefit from a review of the 
unemployment insurance that is sensitive to those in 
non-standard employment.
<P>
	We all know the workforce dominated by women and younger 
Canadians is currently excluded from unemployment insurance 
coverage. Employment services which are more client centred 
and user friendly would be better tailored for women.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7110"> 7110 </A></B>
<P>
	Enabling Canadians to benefit from lifelong learning is 
particularly important to women, especially for those who 
curtailed their own education and training early in life and/or<I> 
</I>left the workforce to raise their children, an important function 
and role in society. Child care is particularly relevant to women 
whose responsibility for family too often limits their own 
opportunities.
<P>
	These examples demonstrate how we can look at every reform 
option with gender lens to see how it may affect the lives of 
women.
<P>
	Lastly today I want to emphasize that to address child poverty 
we must improve the economic status of women in Canada. The 
reality is that throughout their entire lives women in Canada are 
at a higher risk of poverty than men. Large numbers of women 
live in poverty at some time during their lives. We must 
recognize the complex interplay of factors that put women and 
children at risk. Women are still largely responsible for the 
unpaid work of child care, elder care and housework in the 
family.
<P>
	Indeed women are often in a situation that we describe as the 
sandwich generation. They support their aged parents as well as 
their children. However women are also increasingly 
responsible for earning income to keep the family above the 
poverty line either in two-income families or as heads of lone 
parent households.
<P>
	There is a segment of the Canadian women's population that 
has done quite well. I hope we will see some wonderful 
improvements. Those are women who have had the benefit of 
higher education and have benefited from the role that has been 
played by women's organizations to move toward equality, 
access and breaking the glass ceiling. They are few and far 
between and there is much left to do. They can contribute to this 
discussion as well.
<P>
	Women remain at a disadvantage in the workplace largely for 
reasons related to having and raising children. In 1992 women in 
Canada averaged only 72 cents for every dollar that men made in 
the workforce. It is a catch 22 for women and it is a recipe for 
economic dependence and poverty.
<P>
	A 1990 report entitled ``Women and Poverty Revisited'' by 
the National Council of Welfare concluded that the link between 
motherhood and poverty was clear. According to that report the 
only safeguard which stands between most married women and 
poverty is their husbands' incomes. That is not very reassuring.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In fact, the group which is likely to be hit hardest by poverty 
in Canada is single-parent families headed by women. In 1991, 
82 per cent of one-parent families were headed by women. 
Children who live with a single mother are five times more 
likely to be poor than those who live with two parents. 
Nevertheless, we cannot ask women to remain in precarious 
family situations just for economic reasons, especially when the 
woman and children suffer domestic violence or are threatened 
with  it. We must also strive to avoid stereotyping single 
mothers on welfare.
<P>
	A study of 150 such women in 1991 by Professor Carolyne A. 
Gorlick of the University of Western Ontario showed that their 
average age was 32. Nearly three quarters of them had already 
worked full-or part-time. Forty-one per cent had a university 
education.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Most had one or two children and almost all had some 
education or training. As the Prime Minister said so well in 
Fredericton recently, ``The reform is not a question of figures 
and statistics. It concerns human beings and the challenges they 
must face every day of their life''. So how does one help a single 
mother make the transition from welfare to employment?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Yes we need to support this woman with education and 
training.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I was in this situation 
earlier this day. I know that it is a subject matter of great interest 
to both sides of the House and 10 minutes is sometimes not a 
great deal of time on such a substantive issue.
<P>
	If we could ask the co-operation of members to let the 
secretary of state conclude her remarks, we will waive the 
question and comment period.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not realize we had gone 
that long. I appreciate the good grace in this House.
<P>
	A woman with this kind of education and training upon her 
return to the work force will likely get a job that is lower paid, of 
lower status and less secure. She may need language training or 
Canadian accreditation for education and training from another 
country. She most likely needs adequate enforced child support 
payments from her child's father. She will definitely need child 
care. She needs a workplace that allows her to balance work and 
family responsibility and she needs social security that 
recognizes she will live several years longer than most men.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Women have worked for decades to become economically 
independent, at work and at home. Whatever we do, we must not 
undermine this hard-won progress to individual financial 
self-sufficiency. We must recognize the connections between 
women's economic dependency, inequality and the violence 
done to them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7111"> 7111 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We must support women's individual ability to have control 
over their own lives.
<P>
	In closing, I want to emphasize that Canadians believe in the 
dignity of work and we believe in sharing and in compassion. As 
a society we recognize the interdependence of economic and 
social well-being. We know that we cannot have one without the 
other.
<P>
	Canada, as it is admired around the world for the way we 
balance these factors of our collective lives, wishes to continue 
in that effort. We have worked through times of wrenching 
change before in our history and we can do it again.
<P>
	Let me quote our Prime Minister once again, because I think it 
is important: ``Change does not mean changing our values on 
principles. It means changing programs to meet new needs and 
new realities in accordance with our values and our principles so 
together we can build a social security system that includes all 
Canadians and that contributes to a very strong economy. And 
together we can build a prosperous nation where difference is 
valued and everyone is included''.
<P>
	After all, Canadians both men and women, want security, 
dignity and the opportunity to make a decent living for 
themselves and for their families. All Canadians want to build a 
brighter future for our children and ensure that they have every 
opportunity to prosper.
<P>
	An effective fair, affordable social security system for all of 
us will certainly help. We look forward to everyone's 
participation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> After listening to an 
opinion, I think I may have been a little too harsh when I 
suggested that we eliminate the period for questions and 
comments, especially since a minister had the floor at the time. 
Consequently, I will allow one question.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Secretary of State spoke from the heart. The problem is that the 
reform will primarily affect women and not in a positive way. 
On the contrary, it will have a negative impact on their situation.
<P>
	Here are just a few examples. The first ones affected by the 
two levels for UI purposes will be women who, in many cases, 
hold insecure term jobs-since these are more recent jobs, as 
you know. Women will be the first ones affected. They will also 
be the ones affected by the recommendation that the spouse's 
salary be taken into account when determining UI benefits. 
Women are also the ones who will be affected by the cuts to 
social assistance. Moreover, women will not want to get further 
into debt to get an education.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	So, women are directly affected and, in spite of the very 
sensitive comments made by the Secretary of State who has a 
very kind heart, the fact is that the main objective of this reform 
is to reduce budgets by $15 billion over five years. The 
government may send invitations and hold countless 
discussions, the fact is that women are the first victims of that 
reform. The government helps women in a small way but harms 
them in a very big way.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Mr. Speaker, first it is not true that the 
government will cut $15 billion, which I believe is the amount 
mentioned by the hon. member. This is not true at all and I think 
the Minister of Human Resources Development provided the 
real answer. If you read his answer in <I>Hansard</I>, you will see that 
this is not true.
<P>
	Second, I will admit that there are problems for women and 
that these problems represent a big challenge. However, the 
current situation is simply unacceptable. Everything that is in 
place right now prevents women from moving ahead; it only 
keeps them in poverty. What I want and what this government 
wants is to hold an in-depth consultation exercise, especially 
with women. We want to get their opinion and find out what 
changes they would like to see. We simply cannot ask women to 
keep putting up with the system as it is currently structured.
<P>
	Women cannot rejoin the workforce when they are on welfare, 
because all the-I was going to say ``les stupidités'', but I do not 
know if you say that in French-constraints related to CAP do 
not give women a chance to go back to work.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It makes them poorer rather than enables them to become 
active participants in the job market. I would say to all members 
in this House and in particular to a fervent advocate for fairness 
for women-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I say to the hon. member opposite, to answer her question, that 
she is right. However, this reform will improve the plight of 
women; it will not make things worse. I have always insisted 
that all our initiatives be of benefit to women. If this is not the 
case, I want women to come and tell us. We will then take a 
closer look at the issue. I am asking you to help us bring about 
constructive changes for the future of all Canadian women.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to rise today and compliment the Minister of 
Human Resources Development for his commitment and 
contribution in proceeding with the government's job and 
growth agenda.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7112"> 7112 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister in his discussion paper has given us an 
opportunity to participate in the revamping of our social 
security system. We must bring our social programs in line with 
the realities of today, realities that are tough and constraining, 
realities that our society can no longer ignore.
<P>
	Close to 80 per cent of Canadians agree that Canada's social 
programs are in need of major reform. We are inviting all 
Canadians to consider and to advise us on how we can improve 
our programs and make them suitable for the 1990s and into the 
next century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian social security system was created a number of 
years ago to meet the specific needs of a bygone era. Today, the 
needs are different because society and economic parameters 
have changed considerably.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	For example, when the unemployment insurance program was 
originally developed, it was to give temporary relief to people 
who had lost their jobs. However, today, Canadians must adapt 
to an economy which requires fewer workers. Consequently, the 
Canadian government must provide its people with a different 
support system for all those who want to enter or re-enter a 
highly competitive job market.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is clear to all Canadians that the necessity for change not 
only applies to our unemployment insurance program but to all 
our national social programs. The social security system that has 
provided support to Canadians for decades must now be 
modernized. Our social programs must be redefined according 
to the economic and social changes that have affected our 
society.
<P>
	However, despite the government's strong determination to 
pursue a thorough reform of our social safety net, it will strongly 
abide by the fundamental principles that have guided Liberal 
governments in the past. Hence, the first and foremost priority 
of our government is to preserve our traditional and cherished 
values of justice, of tolerance, of compassion for those who are 
most vulnerable, while providing to all Canadians the 
opportunity for the dignity of work.
<P>
	In helping Canadians to get good jobs we have to consider that 
nearly half of all new jobs require 16 years or more of education 
and training. Yet we still have 30 per cent of students dropping 
out before graduating from high school.
<P>
	This is one of many contradictions that must be eradicated for 
the benefit of our social fabric and our economic future. We 
need to supply better job counselling for unemployment 
insurance claimants. We realize that basic skills training is 
essential for any job and that classroom and workplace training 
is also a key element for the revival of our workforce.
<P>
	Canadians think that our social programs are too bureaucratic, 
inefficient, wasteful and that too many people are put in the 
position of becoming dependent on them. We are not helping 
anyone by assuming that some people cannot do anything to 
improve their state in life. That is exactly what some of our 
social programs do and it must be stopped.
<P>
	Our social security system must protect everyone in need. 
Among them are the people who cannot work, people with 
disabilities or chronic illness, low income families and children 
who live in poverty.
<P>
	In the discussion paper the minister outlines four main 
objectives for reform: helping Canadians find and keep 
employment; providing support for those who are most in need; 
ensuring programs are fair, affordable and effective, while 
eliminating waste; creating a social environment that fosters 
independence and mutual responsibility.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We want to reform our social system to protect the values we 
universally hold true, namely equality, freedom, compassion, 
and mutual support. As a society built on these principles, we 
have the duty to give all the help we can to those who need it the 
most.
<P>
	This means that we must share our resources more fairly. 
Canada is abundantly rich and, in this, is the envy of the world. 
Unfortunately, too few Canadians benefit from our country's 
wealth. This is precisely what we want to rectify with the help of 
all the people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We as a government need to address the issues of an economy 
with fewer jobs, a society with an aging population and a 
shrinking middle class, and an increased poverty level among 
our population. I want to take the opportunity to remind the 
House and Canadians that those who are most in need of social 
reform are those who are the poorest in our country. That is 
women and it is children.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	We have to look at the difficulties that women have to face in 
this new era. Women make up the majority of lone parents and 
60 per cent of them live below the poverty line. Women have to 
work hard to support their families but face unfair wage gaps 
compared to their male counterparts. They are still very poorly 
represented in well paid occupations and positions.
<P>
	Tragically women who do earn a living, however 
inadequately paid, may consider themselves lucky because 
two-thirds of the work of women is unpaid. This reality is 
unacceptable in a country where equality has always been a 
basic element of our national values.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7113"> 7113 </A></B>
<P>
	For all these reasons Canadian women are entitled to receive 
appropriate assistance. For instance affordable child care is 
more than ever a necessity, not a luxury. Our government 
recognizes the urgency of the matter and is committed to work 
jointly with the provinces to increase the number of quality 
child care spaces across Canada.
<P>
	Raising the standard of living of women is of crucial 
importance for the fate of many poor children across the 
country. We must act now to ease the life of over one million 
children living on welfare. The number of poor children in our 
society is increasing not decreasing with our current social 
programs. Obviously we need an improvement.
<P>
	I want to say as one who has worked with women and young 
people living in the social security system that they are the first 
to recognize the need for changes in the programs, they are the 
first to recognize the barriers that prevent them from getting the 
job they need, from getting the training they need. Our system is 
set up in such a way that to do so they have to jeopardize the 
financial security of their children and there are not very many 
women who will do that. Those are the barriers we have to get 
rid of.
<P>
	There are other groups in our society still coping with the lack 
of adequate services, people with disabilities. These people too 
need greater access to training and to employment related 
services.
<P>
	If there is one commitment in this reform, it is the 
commitment of our government to create opportunity for every 
one of our citizens who can contribute to the building of our 
country.
<P>
	I conclude by reminding the House and Canadians that this is 
a participatory process. There are a number of recommendations 
and options in the paper that the minister released two weeks 
ago. It is important that all Canadians inform themselves of 
what is in those papers and engage in the dialogue that will 
happen over the next few months.
<P>
	This coming Saturday, October 29, in Ottawa West I will be 
having an all day community consultation. I know that these 
same kinds of consultations are going on right across the 
country. With my few remaining seconds I simply remind every 
organization and every individual out there that their 
participation in this dialogue is crucial to the future of this 
country.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member referred several times to the problem of women. She 
was very sympathetic to their needs, but what she said is a far 
cry from what actually happens. What the government is 
proposing is a direct contradiction of the principles of equality, 
justice, tolerance and fairness mentioned by the hon. member, 
especially when we are talking about a group of women with 
even more problems, and I am referring to immigrant women, a 
group I know very well.
<P>
	I think that when the Liberals were in the opposition, they 
were far more consistent. Today, they are practising the exact 
opposite of what they preached in the opposition. It is not a wise 
decision on the part of a political party like the Liberal Party, the 
main party in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	My question is this: social programs were introduced when 
Canada was not as rich as it is now. This was years and years ago. 
Today, Canada is much richer, so why attack these programs 
today? Why not get the money to finance these programs from 
the rich and thus avoid cutting the social benefits for which 
women have fought for generations?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to deal 
with women's issues. I think it is very important to stress what I 
said in my speech. This is a discussion. We have made a number 
of proposals. I think the question raised by the hon. member is 
very important and that it has an impact on women and on 
children as well, to some extent. How can we have a better 
system? That is a topic for discussion and dialogue with 
Canadian women. We want to find out what they think about the 
impact of certain options.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member will have a chance to discuss the 
existing system with his constituents who are now on welfare. 
When he talks to women who are in the system, he will hear 
about the problems in the present system and the problems that 
keep them in a state of dependency.
<P>
	I am not certain that I agree that in the past, when Liberal 
governments introduced our social programs, the country was 
poorer. It would be very easy for me to say the problem was 
created by the previous government, but I will not say that.
<P>
	We are now in a situation where we spend 40 cents out of 
every dollar on servicing the debt and, of course, it is 
unacceptable that we cannot spend these 40 cents on something 
that would be of far greater benefit to the country and to 
Canadians.
<P>
	However, I think it is just a matter of using the resources we 
have to improve the situation for the people who are in the 
system, and not leaving them high and dry.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
number of points here but I am going to have to limit it to one 
because of time. I will do that.
<P>
	I want to caution the House and the government particularly 
on the use of statistics. A long time ago I read a book <I>How to Lie</I> 
<I>with Statistics</I>. We often hear that a large proportion of Canada's 
children live in poverty.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7114"> 7114 </A></B>
<P>
	I deplore children living in true poverty. I need to give 
members very quickly this anecdote. My son who now is in 
Rwanda was in southern Sudan a number of years ago. He was 
working with a relief agency there. When he wrote home he 
said: ``Dad, Mom, we are having great success here. Whereas 
there used to be 160 children a day dying of starvation, we have 
brought the number down to 60''. He said: ``That is a great 
success''. Then he added, referring to our community back 
home: ``Of course by Sherwood Park standards, we have not 
quite met it yet''.
<P>
	That is so true. In this country, we do not know what poverty 
is. The statistic that is used by Statistics Canada is that a family 
is in poverty if its family income is less than half of the median 
income.
<P>
	The irony of that is that if the average family income in 
Canada were to reach $100,000 then anyone who makes less 
than $50,000 would be considered by that definition to be in 
poverty. Yes, they are making considerably less than the average 
peers around them but they are not in true poverty. I think we 
need to be very, very careful.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Poverty is also a state of mind. I grew up in a very poor family 
but we were never poor in the truest sense of the word. We 
always had the basic necessities of life and we had a family with 
loads of love. When you have that it is really all that a person 
needs.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to respond to 
this question. Some of my colleagues will remember that it was 
a former Tory chair of the committee on employment and 
immigration that tried to redefine poverty and pretend that 
poverty went away.
<P>
	Let me tell the member opposite about the people in my 
community, the children who start school behind the eight ball 
because they are identified as poor the minute they walk into the 
school. They are not as well fed. They do not have the bright and 
shiny hair. They do not have the nice clothes. Their education is 
immediately crippled from the day they walk into school.
<P>
	If we pretend that poverty in this country is not really a 
problem we will not solve that problem. The victims of not 
solving that problem are our children. Poor children are much 
more likely to be involved in serious accidents, to fall seriously 
ill, to commit suicide, to die, to drop out of school and to end up 
in jail. What more information do we need to solve the problem 
of our poor?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the issue 
of social programs is of particular concern to me, as a former 
labour lawyer in Chile, a 19-year veteran of the FTQ and the 
member of Parliament for a modest riding in Montréal-Nord. I 
must admit that I am very concerned, following the release, on 
October 5, of the Liberal government consultation paper entitled 
``Improving Social Security in Canada''.
<P>
	The title of this paper bears little relation to its contents. It is 
at best an ultraconservative paper. Even the Mulroney 
government had never dared go as far as this Liberal government 
of Jean Chrétien and Lloyd Axworthy.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would just like to 
remind the members that we are supposed to refer to one another 
by our titles. For example, the right hon. Prime Minister, the 
hon. Minister of Human Resources Development, and so on. I 
know that we cannot always show the same consideration to 
former MPs, but as far as those currently in office are concerned, 
we must maintain this respect relationship.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was referring to the government of 
the present Prime Minister and his Minister of Human 
Resources Development. Now, I must add that, regarding social 
programs, the Liberals are doing exactly the opposite of what 
they preached when they were in opposition. I am for social 
security reform, but true reform designed to improve social 
security, not to destroy it.
<P>
	It took decades to build our social security system in Canada. 
Now, this federal government is trying to dismantle it in a matter 
of months. The real hidden agenda of the instigators of this 
reform is to bring the deficit down. Since coming to power, the 
Liberal government has done its utmost to balance its budget on 
the back of the disadvantaged. This paper proposes very drastic 
changes in unemployment insurance as well as in how funding 
of social assistance and post-secondary education are funded, 
changes designed to save $15 billion over the next five years.
<P>
	In so doing, the government is hoping to reduce the national 
debt to 3 per cent of the gross domestic product within three 
years. There is nothing in this paper about the real challenge 
facing Canada today: job creation. No effort is made to 
eliminate the very expensive jurisdictional overlaps between the 
federal government and the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Instead of looking at a fairer taxation system for tax havens, 
family trusts, etc., he attacks programs protecting the most 
vulnerable in our society. The government blames the crisis on 
the poor, the unemployed, the people on welfare, and that is 
outrageous.
<P>
	The union movement which fought for and instigated the 
introduction and improvement of the social security system for 
generations is now unanimous in opposing and condemning the 
reform proposed by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	In Quebec, the presidents of the three central labour 
bodies-Clément Godbout of the FTQ, Gérald Larose of the 
CNTU, and Lorraine Pagé of the CEQ-vigorously denounced 
the federal government's intentions and are preparing a major 
attack and a joint brief to be tabled soon as part of the 
consultations held by the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development. Together, these three unions represent 
over 700,000 Quebec workers.
<P>
	For its part, the 2.2-million-strong Canadian Labour 
Congress has launched a vigorous fight against the proposed 
reform. Its president, Robert White, criticized the discussion 
paper because it does not set out any job-creation measures. He 
added, ``The government seems to think that by training workers 
and cutting their UI benefits, these people will find non-existent 
jobs as if by magic. The concept of compulsory work or enforced 
volunteerism outlined in this paper is an insult to the hundreds 
of thousands of Canadians who have lost their jobs''.
<P>
	The thousands of unemployed workers and welfare recipients, 
as well as all the people I consulted in my riding of Bourassa, 
strongly oppose cutting and dismantling our social programs. 
Montréal-Nord is a city whose population is getting more 
diversified, older and poorer. In the last two years, the amount of 
social benefits has increased by 21 per cent, while 34 per cent of 
all welfare applications are associated with job losses. The 
unemployment rate in Montréal-Nord has reached 30 per cent 
including welfare recipients able to work.
<P>
	My riding and the City of Montreal are now among the largest 
concentrations of poor people in Canada. Those hardest hit by 
this situation are members of visible minorities, young people, 
women and seniors, who are very numerous in my riding.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to denounce VIA Rail's recent decision 
to immediately eliminate 478 jobs including 273 in Montreal. In 
December 1993, the company had already announced that it 
would lay off 250 workers. Most of these workers are members 
of the Canadian Auto Workers, which is my union. These people 
want to work.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These people have decided to work and to be gainfully 
employed. They are particularly worried about the proposed 
modification to the unemployment insurance system. The 
people of my riding are concerned about the intention of the 
federal government to take into account their spouse's income to 
calculate the level of allowance.
<P>
	If enacted these reforms would prove to be very harmful for 
women and will endanger the progress toward equality which an 
entire generation has achieved.
<P>
	Unemployment insurance is one of the pillars of our social 
security system. It is entirely financed by the contributions of 
workers and employers. Employees pay premiums to insure 
themselves against loss of income in the event of the loss of a 
job. Thus the government has  neither the authority nor the 
justification to take from these workers the compensation that is 
rightfully theirs.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must say that, on the whole, Canada's social programs are 
already below the average for industrialized countries. In fact, 
Canada spends $18 billion less every year on social 
expenditures than the average of OECD countries. This shortfall 
shows up especially in child care services, the public pension 
plan and disability insurance. In several areas, Canada's social 
programs are below international standards.
<P>
	For all these reasons, like my party, the Bloc Quebecois, the 
labour movement and the people of my riding, Montréal-Nord, I 
oppose and strongly denounce the social security reform 
advocated by the federal government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very happy to see the United Nations continues to 
demonstrate our position to the rest of the world: Canada is the 
best country in the world in which to live.
<P>
	When was the last time the government gave the opposition a 
chance to discuss social policy reform? When was the last time 
any reform policy met the approval of 91 per cent of the 
population? When was the last time one year after coming to 
power a Prime Minister enjoyed 42 per cent popular support, 
personal support? When was the last time the opposition leader 
received only 7 per cent popular support?
<P>
	Obviously, that says something about the good job the 
government is doing.
<P>
	This morning I was in my riding of Don Valley North. We just 
had the ground breaking ceremonies for one of the projects that 
will create jobs in my riding. It is one of four projects and it will 
create about 111 brand new jobs. These people will have food on 
their tables. They will be able to feed their children, not go on 
welfare or UI. That is the job the government is doing to provide 
Canadians better opportunities and a better future.
<P>
	The previous government had a committee, as was referred to 
earlier, which was to redefine poverty, especially poverty 
among children. The way the committee wanted to do it was to 
redefine the whole income process so, poof, in one sentence it 
would take away 50 per cent of poverty among children. That is 
not the way we are going to do business. We want to listen to 
other Canadians so they have a positive input and not be 
negative about Canada. We want to change the system the best 
way we know how. That is how we are going to do it.

	I have not heard anything from hon. members opposite that

it all the way up.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was positive like my colleagues in 
the Bloc Quebecois; we want to maintain the social programs 
Canada has. The only problem we have with the party opposite is 
that we want to finance them by taking money where it can be 
found, from the rich, family trusts and tax shelters. This is the 
money that must be used to fund social programs. We are very 
positive on that.
<P>
	The UN has declared Canada to be the best country in the 
world; I think that the UN is taking a macro-economic view, but 
if the UN looks at Canada today, it must realize that there are 
huge variations. When I came to Canada 20 years ago, it was a 
more egalitarian society. Today, the rich are getting richer while 
the poor are getting poorer. Among these poor people are the 
children whom the hon. member mentioned. But there are poor 
children in Canada because there are poor families, parents 
without work, women who are disadvantaged in society; that is 
the cause of child poverty.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	I think that we are very positive and during the consultation, 
we will make suggestions and a great contribution to the 
development of human resources, but on the good side, not in 
the direction the government is going.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to discuss the impact of the social program reform for women. 
As the Official Opposition critic for the status of women, I will 
specifically deal with the impact of the proposals tabled by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The discussion paper includes several measures which are 
totally unacceptable to Canadians. The first one relates to the UI 
program. The proposed reform will result in reduced UI benefits 
for women. Indeed, if a person living with another one loses his 
job, the benefits paid to that person will be reduced when his 
spouse earns a good salary. Since, according to statistics, 
women earn about 70 per cent of what men make, they will be 
directly affected by that measure, because their benefits will be 
diminished and may even be reduced to nil.
<P>
	This proposal is totally unacceptable. How can we implement 
such a policy and claim at the same time, on the international 
scene, that we promote the right of women to economic equality, 
as the Canadian government did at the Nairobi conference and 
will do again this fall in Beijing?
<P>
	This is an insidious form of discrimination. Either we really 
try to promote the right of women to equality by ensuring that 
domestic policies are fair and take into account the situation of 
women, or else we stop claiming to be a world leader in that 
field. The government should make up its mind. At the very 
least, it should ensure that it does not increase, through 
irresponsible policies, women's dependence on men, thus 
perpetuating a context which is conducive to violence and 
exploitation.
<P>
	Another proposal in the minister's discussion paper aims at 
reducing access to benefits. Under this proposal, people who are 
frequently unemployed, mainly those who have insecure jobs 
and many women are in this category, would see their benefits 
reduced. Again, this would primarily affect women, since they 
hold most of the seasonal jobs.
<P>
	The document raises another question regarding 
unemployment insurance. I am referring to contributions made 
to the program. Indeed, one wonders if women who are 
ineligible for benefits because of their spouses' incomes will be 
forced to continue to contribute to the UI program, thus putting 
an even greater burden on the family income. In our opinion, 
this would be a hidden increase in the tax burden and would 
violate the promises made by the current Prime Minister.
<P>
	Let us now turn to another aspect of the reform which 
deserves a very close look, namely the financing of 
post-secondary education. Here again, women are experiencing 
a setback. On October 6, the minister stated: ``Let us put a lot 
more money back into the system. Let us make a much broader, 
wider system of grants and loans available to students of all 
kinds everywhere. They can get access to our system on a basis 
where they can repay the money based on their incomes''.
<P>
	A reduction in the transfer payments to the provinces will 
have a direct impact on provincial governments. These 
governments will have to choose between dealing with this new 
tax burden or transferring it to the universities. Either we 
increase taxes to pay the higher costs or the universities will 
have to significantly raise tuition fees, which will increase the 
students' level of indebtedness. This would be a setback, 
especially in Quebec, where we have succeeded in helping 
poorer students to attend college or university. Also, this will 
have a direct impact on women. As we know, women are poorer 
than men.
<P>
	If we go back to the system where only the rich can afford 
post-secondary education, the percentage of female university 
students and graduates will drop considerably.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	You do not have to be a statistician to know that the level of 
education is directly related to the level of income. Is this how 
we will reduce the dropout rate, by dashing the hopes of poorer 
students wanting to go to university and to improve their lot? Is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7117"> 7117 </A></B>
<P>
this how the  Minister of Human Resources Development will 
improve economic opportunities for women?
<P>
	I think the minister will only encourage students to increase 
their indebtedness level in order to be able to further their 
education. This is how we will end up with a two-tier university 
system like in the United States: a classy private system and a 
poor public one. There are no projects, guidelines or 
instructions on expanding day-care services, except for a 
statement that eventually, resources will be invested in this area. 
This is a major omission, and it reflects this government's 
failure to consider the daily needs of women.
<P>
	How can women expect to go back to work or function 
satisfactorily in the work place, when every day they are faced 
with the problem of a shortage of day-care for their children? 
Women would have to earn at least $10 per hour to be able to pay 
for day-care and the transportation costs involved when a 
woman works and has children. Women would have to earn more 
than $10 an hour, so they can afford satisfactory day-care for 
their children while they are at work.
<P>
	Many women, especially single mothers, will leave their jobs 
or will not be promoted because they do not have access to 
day-care or their incomes are not sufficient. One wonders what 
this government's priorities are. Are they about buying missiles 
for $400,000 each, so the Canadian army can make a good 
showing at competitions in Florida, or intercepting private 
communications through the Communications Security 
Establishment, an activity estimated to cost a modest $250 
million annually?
<P>
	Will the Minister of Human Resources Development show 
more concern about programs financing than his leader, who 
said he was not worried about the expenditures cleverly hidden 
in the Public Accounts? Would there not be a case for investing 
in our children's future rather than in unproductive activities? 
Where are this government's priorities? What needs is it willing 
to finance? One also wonders why, in preparing its reform 
proposals, the government failed to consider the unequal 
economic status of men and women and try to correct it.
<P>
	We condemn these reform proposals which are a disaster for 
female workers, students and women who are frequently 
unemployed, proposals that contain no job creation strategy. 
Women need well-paying, steady jobs, but the only job creation 
measure the government has introduced since it was elected, the 
infrastructures program, has failed to increase women's 
participation in the labour market since these jobs did not draw 
on women's more traditional skills.
<P>
	Women do not need any more talk about training, when 
training is a dead end since there are no jobs available. Women 
need real social reform, with measures that will help make them 
equal economic partners, not measures that merely consolidate 
the usual pattern of dependency and dropping out. Mr. Minister, 
some major  changes will be necessary if women are to get their 
rightful place in the labour market.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, precisely, as the member for 
Quebec mentioned, I believe that the aim of this exercise, this 
opinion poll, this Canada-wide consultation is to see if we can 
find solutions to some rather pressing problems. One of the 
problems she talked about is the situation of single mothers. 
Very often, what they earn is not enough to provide for their 
children.
<P>
	I believe that there is a lot to do in this area and I am the first 
one to say that women have been dealt a raw deal by the present 
system, an opinion which I think is shared by most members of 
this House. Women are penalized if they want to get a job or 
train in order to find a better job.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	I would like to know if the member recognizes that, at least, 
we are trying to help women with their job search so that they 
can have a decent income.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, maybe the government thinks it 
is making an effort. But between its rhetoric and reality, there is 
a world of difference. I believe that we must be wary of some of 
the proposals put forward in the working paper, especially with 
respect to women. I believe that when you revert to taking into 
account the spouse's salary to determine eligibility to 
unemployment insurance, this is a real step backward.
<P>
	I believe that if this suggestion is accepted by the Liberal 
government, we will not be helping women. Most frequently 
unemployed people are women, therefore this is what I call a 
double standard. On one hand, the government allows tax 
havens such as family trusts, and on the other, it says that it is 
going to go on a witch hunt to catch unemployed women, to see 
if they are not dipping two or three times in the unemployment 
insurance pot, in which case they will get cut off. They will no 
longer be eligible.
<P>
	With respect to Quebec, there is another side to the story. I 
believe that the real objective of the Liberal government is to get 
involved in job training. In Quebec, there is a consensus. All 
stakeholders, including the Bélanger-Campeau Commission, 
the unions, political parties, the Conseil du patronat, agree that 
Quebec should manage its own job training. This is an expensive 
bureaucracy for the federal government and Quebec, both in 
terms of money and time.
<P>
	I do not believe that the Liberal government will be going in 
that direction. Quebec's unemployment rate has doubled since 
1970. The Liberal government is pursuing the same policy as the 
Conservatives who lost the elections because of it. They wanted 
to make cuts in unemployment insurance, and reform social 
programs, but the Liberal Party promised jobs, jobs, jobs. This 
is where the Liberal Party is heading in the wrong direction. It 
should be offering to stimulate the economy, to stimulate 
business in order to create jobs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7118"> 7118 </A></B>
<P>
	Obviously, if the unemployment rate has doubled since 1970, 
it is because there are no jobs. What are we going to do with 
the frequently unemployed? We are going to penalize them. We 
are going to turn them into second-class unemployed workers, 
and women will be particularly penalized by this suggestion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not correct to say that we want 
to penalize the unemployed. I believe that the role of any 
government is to find work for Canadians, to make education 
accessible, to improve the situation of the neediest, like single 
mothers, and to ensure a more prosperous future for their 
children.
<P>
	Once again, what we hear from the Bloc Quebecois is the 
same old tune. They want the government to stop interfering 
with provincial programs.
<P>
	I will not say anything against the Quebec Government or its 
Department of Education. I did it before and I will have further 
opportunities to do so. The only question we should ask 
ourselves is: ``What matters for people in a difficult situation?'' 
It is not whether their case is being considered by a provincial 
civil servant or a federal civil servant. What matters to people is 
to have access to programs, to have a chance, to know that 
constructive measures to stimulate the economy are being taken. 
What matters to people, and in particular the neediest-and I 
believe that the Liberals always tried to help the neediest-is to 
be able to re-enter the work force.
<P>
	I must, unfortunately, repeat that when the hon. member says 
that this is a problem of overlapping, of federal interference, she 
is a victim of her party's propaganda.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not at all surprised at the 
comments of the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine. I think there was a 
consensus in Quebec on education and occupational training 
from people with high credibility. This issue has nothing to do 
with political allegiance. I was naming all the stakeholders from 
the political, educational and labour communities and we all 
agree in Quebec that education and vocational training should 
be under Quebec's jurisdiction.
<P>
	Civil servants told me that no one could understand a thing 
about the alignment of federal and provincial programs. We can 
see that the hon. member did not often have to look for a job and 
was never forced into the maze of programs delivered by Quebec 
and Ottawa.
<P>
	One of the programs offered by the federal government, 
before the training program starts, is a needs analysis. It so 
happened that there was a two-year delay before it could be 
implemented and when we were about to start, the needs had 
changed and there were no more participants. During all this 
time, the people had not worked. So you can certainly not blame 
this on ill will on the part of the Bloc Quebecois if we do not 
understand.
<P>
	We were elected with a majority in our ridings to defend 
Quebec's interests and I think, in this case, it means to repatriate 
our money.
<P>
	I have not talked about transfers to provinces. The 
government wants to cut transfers so that the onus will be on the 
provinces to manage this cut-rate unemployment. The 
provinces will again be the ones to pick up the tab. And we all 
know that when provinces go broke, they turn to municipalities.
<P>
	Therefore, I think that if provinces were to manage their own 
programs, the constituents and the public would really know 
who the culprit is. Now the federal and provincial governments 
are passing the buck back and forth.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: The 
hon. member for Mercier-Unemployment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have looked forward to rising and speaking in this debate for 
quite a while. I was one who spent a lot of time on his feet in the 
last Parliament debating the very principles that are on the floor 
today: what should be the central tenets of the country and the 
underlying principles that have led us, albeit with our problems, 
to be one of the greatest nations on earth.
<P>
	I come from a region that for far too long has perhaps not 
shared in the greatness of the country, particularly its wealth. 
We have wealth in other areas with our culture, our history, our 
music and our people; but when it comes down to the things that 
put bread and butter on the table I speak from the perspective of 
a regional representative who has tried his very best, as have 
many before me, to impact on the policies of national 
governments in recognition of the fact that we live in a country 
that is regional in its nature.
<P>
	The whole concept of social policy reform perhaps causes 
shivers up the spine of many individuals out there, even some 
provincial premiers who have to rely on a generous, well 
thought, rational program of social spending by the federal 
government, the government that has the tax power, to be able to 
deliver services of a national standard to the individuals they 
represent.
<P>
	We have to go back a bit and talk about the development of 
social policy. Nearly every major program we have today has 
been the result of dialogue in this place and in public. Nearly 
every piece of progressive social legislation that we currently 
have up for debate in our social policy review has been dealing 
with programs that have been brought about by Liberal 
government initiatives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7119"> 7119 </A></B>
<P>
	We have to be careful when we criticize the process if we 
are not willing to understand the history of the party that 
teaches how to reform social programs. When I look back on 
the great history of the Liberal Party it is very clear that the 
Liberal Party tried very much to ensure that the country was 
not the same as the United States.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	We recognized that the free market system had to grow and 
flourish but we believed that there were broader principles 
which had to monitor, had to temper the influence of the private 
sector and market forces in Canada. We were not the same as the 
Americans and we were not the same as some of the countries 
that we sought our early immigration from which were smaller 
and more compact.
<P>
	We are one of the largest nations on earth and we have an 
uneven distribution of population. We have ten provincial and 
two territorial governments at this point. Through all of this as 
our country grew and as the great resources that God gave us in 
this great land were exploited, it was Liberal thinking, small l 
and big <I>L</I>, that said there is a fundamental responsibility of 
governments to ensure that the great wealth that is Canada is 
shared as equally as possible by all Canadians no matter where 
they live.
<P>
	How do we do that? Do we just say if you are living in Alberta 
and they find oil in the ground you are going to do well perhaps 
for this generation or maybe the next, or 100 ago when you lived 
in Atlantic Canada and cod was plentiful and there were all 
kinds of money flowing into those households that did not have 
to share it? No, we believed collectively that we had a 
responsibility as government-our party believed that then and 
believes it today-to try to ensure that the wealth of this country 
is redistributed wherever possible to those individuals who are 
less prosperous today.
<P>
	We have done that through social programs. We came in with 
unemployment insurance. We decided that we had to find some 
vehicle to transfer funds on a regular basis with a standard 
program and we came up with established program financing, 
EPF. That is how the federal government through its taxation 
powers takes moneys in and sends moneys back to the provinces 
to try to ensure a certain level of quality in the delivery of 
service in health care and post-secondary education.
<P>
	The unemployment insurance system was initially put in 
place to ensure that workers who found themselves temporarily 
without employment were not going to have the bank come in 
and foreclose on the farm. It was meant to be an income 
supplement during that period of time until the individual could 
either retrain or find another job in the labour market and pay his 
or her bills.
<P>
	We have had further progressions in social policy right up to 
the Constitution Act in which one of the fundamental 
characteristics of this country was set down as equalization. One 
of the major factors that distinguishes this country from others 
around the world  is the fact that our Constitution says that the 
government has a responsibility to ensure that the provinces 
have the ability to deliver services of national standards, 
national quality, no matter what the fiscal situation of that 
province is.
<P>
	Our social programs through old age security, through 
veterans' pensions, all of those programs have been an attempt 
by past governments to meet that fundamental commitment, that 
characteristic of Canadian society of equalizing the opportunity 
for all Canadians.
<P>
	In a province like Nova Scotia some would say we rely to 
heavily on that. Maybe we do. Some say that perhaps the 
amounts of dollars transferred down have not met with the 
successes that were waiting there for them. I am one of those 
individuals who would agree.
<P>
	I think it is high time we sit down and examine the vehicles. 
These programs are merely vehicles to deliver certain 
principles. It is also a time for us as Canadians to reaffirm the 
principles.
<P>
	I know there are some on the Liberal Party side, perhaps even 
who sit in this Chamber, who believe we have to fight tooth and 
nail to maintain the vehicle. I do not think we have to do that. 
What we have to do in this period of fiscal restraint is redefine 
what we try to accomplish as governments.
<P>
	Is the principle of equalization going to be maintained as one 
of the fundamental strands in the fabric of this country? I think 
most of the people in this place would say yes. Are we still going 
to try to take the wealth of this great country and ensure that 
individuals like me, the son of a coal miner who saw more pay 
days than pay cheques down in Cape Breton, can go to university 
because I have not been tuitioned right out of the picture? Does 
it make sure that somebody who lives in northern Ontario or 
downtown Vancouver or in Bay d'Espoir Newfoundland, when 
they have a problem with their health, does not have to worry 
about the size of their bank account, that quality health care is 
there?
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	We are facing major challenges. I think as this debate goes 
forward Canadians will reaffirm the principles that this country 
has been founded on, principles of fairness, of equal sharing of 
the resource, of caring for one another and a free market system 
altogether, all in one.
<P>
	This reform that we talk about is essential. It is essential that 
we grapple with the real economic problems that we have today. 
It is also essential that these reforms are not dictated by any one 
region of this country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7120"> 7120 </A></B>
<P>
	Atlantic Canada is not western Canada. Alberta is not 
Newfoundland. Quebec is not Ontario. This is a country that 
is as distinct because of the differences that it has been able 
to accommodate internally as it is distinct by its geography and 
its people.
<P>
	During this reform of social policy, during the debate that 
takes place, we must ensure that those principles that have been 
established, that have made this country great from sea to sea to 
sea, are reinvented. We say that is the foundation and if there is a 
better way for us to deliver those principles of equalization, of 
allowing as a people, each and every individual in this country, 
to develop to the fullest of their potential I will be on board for 
that.
<P>
	I am afraid of change. I am afraid when I see two systems of 
UI being put on the table for debate that it means some of my 
fishermen in Atlantic Canada or the Gaspe may find themselves 
on the short end of that stick and I worry about that. I am worried 
that talk of cutting back on transfers through EPS to universities 
will mean that people who grew up or are growing up as I did 
with not very much money coming in for food let alone to put 
away for their children's university may not be able to get a 
quality education.
<P>
	I am equally convinced, and this balances my concern, that as 
this debate goes forward one single thing will come out of it if 
nothing else and it will be that we will come back as a people and 
we will re-endorse and reaffirm those principles of equalization 
of the government allowing the free market system to flourish 
but at the same time using the resources of this great state, of 
this great nation, to ensure as best we can as mere mortals that 
those resources are put to work for the people of this country no 
matter where they live.
<P>
	The debate is important. My voice I hope will be heard. My 
voice will probably be a voice of dissent on many of the things 
that are put on the table but I am not going to sit back and be 
critical and not participate in the process. That is one way the 
people I represent will not be heard and I am quite prepared. My 
voice can be loud at times. I may be small but I was blessed with 
good vocal cords. My voice on behalf of the people not just in 
Atlantic Canada but people right across this country is heard and 
that the desires they have that their government will be able to 
respond to their needs are materialized in a brand new social 
policy reform package and the vehicles that we choose to deliver 
are vehicles that will be efficient, that will deliver to the people 
who need it the most, and more than anything else will ensure 
that the next generation of Canadians, far too many of whom are 
living in poverty, will be able to look forward to a bright future 
in this great country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has 
been most fascinating coming to the House of Commons and 
dealing directly with people who are eminently qualified to 
speak for the Liberal Party as members of Parliament for the 
Liberals.
<P>
	One of the difficult things I have encountered is that I do not 
seem to be able to get a straight answer to a very simple question 
and it reflects around the area of universality. Does the member 
actually believe in universality?
<P>
	As I listened to the member's very eloquent speech it seemed 
to me that he, like most Liberals, is trying to have it both ways. 
The Liberals are saying we are going to have government 
intervention but we are going to have free market. Some of the 
things unfortunately are mutually exclusive.
<P>
	I am not suggesting for a second that I do not believe in the 
basic concept of equalization and trying to even things out but 
we have developed this to such a science in Canada that we have 
reached the point at which we no longer can afford it.
<P>
	I have a question with respect to universality. I believe this is 
the fourth time and the fourth member I have put this question 
to. I know the member is going to give me a straight answer to 
this question because he is such an upright looking gentleman. I 
can tell he is going to give me a straight answer.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Where are we going with this thing? Does the member 
actually believe in the concept of universality in which every 
single Canadian has equal access to all of the programs 
available? Or does the member believe, as the Reform Party 
believes, that we are going to have to target some of our social 
programs, that we are going to have to be selective and make 
sure that the people in Canada who are most in need will have 
those services available to them? In other words, that is the 
difference. Those two things are mutually 
exclusive-universality or are we going to be targeting our 
resources because that is not universality? Which is it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, I could send him over a 
dictionary. That might be a quicker response.
<P>
	To the member for Kootenay East, on university I think 
everything is on the table, to be quite honest. When I see that 
there are over 1.5 million Canadian children living in poverty 
that tells me that the dollars we are spending are not hitting the 
mark. When I see individuals who have to live below the poverty 
line, who have worked hard to build this country because the 
dollars have been spread too thin, then I do not think those are 
the types of programs I want to see continued.
<P>
	When I see single parents, primarily women who cannot get 
out into the workforce because they have children at home, who 
cannot get a hand up because the money available to the 
programs we are maintaining keeps them down and ensures a 
cycle of poverty, of non-productivity both economically and at 
a complete destruction of self-worth, I am prepared to listen to 
anybody in this country who would go back to the basic 
principal of equalized opportunity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7121"> 7121 </A></B>
<P>
	Quite frankly, I would not be here today if it were not for 
those social programs. Maybe most members of the Reform 
Party would, but I do not think so. I know the backgrounds of 
some of those individuals. They have chosen public life. Many 
of them were not brought up with a silver spoon and many of 
them did get the benefit of a university education because of 
transfers to their home provinces for education. I know that. 
Does that mean that everything we have today has to stay the 
same? I would say no.
<P>
	He asked me if I believe in universality. I do for some 
programs. There are some programs I do not think can be cut 
without damaging the fabric of the country. On health care, do I 
want a user pay system? No, I do not. I know the Reform Party 
does not either. We want to maintain that as an essential piece of 
the fabric of this country.
<P>
	I am prepared to sit down on each and every program. I am not 
prepared to do what some on the other benches, most notably the 
Reform Party and the right wing would do, which is simply to do 
across the board cuts.
<P>
	When we look at these things we have to use the ingenuity I 
know members of this Chamber have to develop vehicles that 
would allow for the majority of assistance that is available be 
targeted to those individuals who need it the most. We all know 
that it diminishes on a daily basis. However, does that mean we 
have to throw the baby out with the bath water? I think not. I 
think the baby has to do with a little less water in the tub.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the opportunity to ask a few questions or at least to make a few 
comments on the hon. member for Dartmouth's speech.
<P>
	I have worked with the hon. member on the Fisheries and 
Oceans Committee. First of all, I must say that I find most 
interesting his concern that the paper tabled by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development might possibly create two 
categories of unemployed, when he says that the chronically 
unemployed apply for UI benefits two and three times over a 
five-year period.
<P>
	Yet, coming from maritime regions, we both know that our 
constituents are directly involved in, and directly affected by, 
this. There is even more cause for concern considering that we 
had an inkling of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development's reform earlier this year with the UI changes 
made this spring, for example, when the qualifying period was 
increased from 10 to 12 weeks.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	I would like to hear the hon. member's comments on this, to 
know if there are lobster fishermen in his region who, since cod 
fishing is forbidden under the moratorium, have nothing else to 
fish. To qualify for unemployment insurance, they need 12 
weeks of work. Every one knows that in maritime ridings, 
lobster fishing  is subject to a natural constraint, since the 
season is only 10 weeks long. Now that is very interesting.
<P>
	The last point I would like the hon. member for Dartmouth to 
consider is equalization payments, when he says that the federal 
government has taxing powers to regulate, to administer its 
so-called national social programs.
<P>
	The problem, as I see it, is that the minister already has a 
figure in mind as regards the extent of the cuts. He is trying to 
say which program or program component he would like to cut. 
This sounds like a dangerous approach to me because welfare 
recipient are left out in the cold. Making programs disappear, or 
reducing the assistance provided under such a program, and I 
will conclude on this, will not make welfare recipients 
disappear.
<P>
	This means that the provinces will have to pay out of their 
own pockets. Equalization does not work if Quebec or Ontario, 
for example, see the percentage of welfare recipients they have 
to provide assistance to on their own increase all of a sudden. 
Because if there is a freeze in federal spending levels, 
equalization will not work. These were the comments I wanted 
to make.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to say that I certainly 
enjoy working with the member for Gaspé on the fisheries 
committee. We share many of the same concerns. Our mother 
tongue may be different, but our regions are not that dissimilar 
and our interests are pretty similar.
<P>
	I want to pick up on one thing. The member indicated that the 
federal government has the authority to provide equalization, to 
try to equalize the opportunities for Canadians. I would go one 
further. Since his party is very concerned about constitutions 
and constitutional status, I would like to inform him that it is not 
just the authority, it is a constitutional requirement. Whatever 
cuts are made to social policy as a result of the ballooning 
deficit, every cut must be looked at to see whether or not, in 
accordance with the Constitution, it has increased or decreased 
disparity in the country. That is one of the things that is a fall 
back for us. The Constitution provides for that.
<P>
	With respect to the other question he asked dealing with UI, it 
is a major problem. One of the things we have to do is stop 
handing out the dough. It is a bit like a narcotic. If you have a 
pain in your arm and you do not treat the cause of the pain but 
keep giving the drug for the pain pretty soon you forget about the 
pain but you keep needing the drug.
<P>
	We have to try to deal with diminishing dollars and address 
the real problem. We have to restructure the fishery so that the 
individuals left in the core fishery can make a decent living off it 
and never again see the fishery as a way, through licensing, to 
qualify for UIC. Unfortunately that is what has happened in the 
past. People who have a licence should be able to make a good  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7122"> 7122 </A></B>
<P>
living at lobster, at groundfish, at whatever, but we have spread 
it far too thin.
<P>
	In conclusion, I agree. I have those concerns. I look forward to 
reading the input from his town hall forums that he is going to be 
holding on social policy reform and what his people are saying 
on it. Perhaps we can sit down and see how close together both 
our communities are on the need for this type of restructuring.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to address the 
House on this most important matter of reforming our social 
programs.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate the hon. Minister of Human 
Resources Development and his parliamentary secretary for 
having the courage to put forward this most-needed initiative.
<P>
	I will restrict my comments to two areas. First, why do we 
need social policy reform? Second, what are the principles 
which should direct these changes and what are the objectives 
we want to achieve?
<P>
	On October 14 and 15 I held two sets of public consultations 
in my riding of Timiskaming-French River, one in Kirkland 
Lake and one in Haileybury, probably the first public forums on 
the social reforms in the country. About 100 constituents 
attended the forums and 26 individuals and organizations 
presented briefs.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	There was unanimous agreement on the need for social reform 
and toward the objectives outlined in the minister's discussion 
paper. There was also a broad consensus on the kind of reforms 
needed to achieve these goals. The best way to demonstrate the 
need for reform is to give three examples of situations which 
came up at the hearings.
<P>
	The first example is one of a young couple with two children, 
both earning salaries just above minimum wage. After allowing 
for child care expenses, travel, income taxes, an increase in 
geared to income rent, we found that the net income for this 
couple was $150 less a week than if they had been on social 
assistance. This is wrong and totally unacceptable. In addition, 
the young couple have lost their drug and dental assistance plan. 
Geared to income housing rental is based on gross revenue 
before factoring in income taxes and all the work related 
expenses. In effect, a working couple earning a net income of 
$1,000 a month will pay more in rent than a couple on social 
assistance receiving $1,200 a month. I find this unfair.
<P>
	We are telling those Canadians who have the pride and 
self-motivation to go out and find work that if they do go out and 
work, we will penalize them.
<P>
	The second example is one of a man who is married and has 
four children. He is fairly well-qualified but was unable to find 
a permanent job. He had to go on social assistance to support his 
family. He decided to put an ad  in the paper to find part time 
work and earned $800 gross in a one-month period as a 
self-employed carpenter.
<P>
	This gentleman reported his earnings to the welfare board. 
Not only did they deduct all but $50 from his cheque, they did 
not allow any expenses related to his job, such as advertising. 
This is very important. They even informed this gentleman that 
if he put another ad in the paper, he would be considered 
self-employed and be taken off the payroll altogether. Is this the 
kind of social policy the country needs at this time?
<P>
	The third example is one of a young, single mother with two 
children. This young woman is on social assistance but wants to 
go to school. She wants to get back into the work force. Because 
she lives in a rural area where child care is unavailable and she 
has no means of transportation, she cannot go back to school and 
re-train.
<P>
	Our reforms should, and I hope will, address the special needs 
of those Canadians living in rural areas so they too can benefit 
from the increased opportunities which will hopefully result 
from these reforms. It is clear that reforms are badly needed. 
The response to the government's initiative on my constituents 
was simple. It is about time.
<P>
	A recent COM-PAS poll suggested that 91 per cent of 
respondents want social assistance recipients to be given the 
opportunity-I am not saying to be forced-to re-train or to do 
community work. Seventy per cent agreed that social benefits 
should be re-targeted to the most needy.
<P>
	What are the principles that should guide us as we embark on 
these most urgently needed reforms? First, we must ensure that 
we maintain a social safety net, an income level sufficient for 
those most vulnerable. We must preserve this compassionate, 
caring, society that makes us the envy of the world. We must 
tackle child poverty and encourage self-confidence and 
personal initiative. We must also ensure these programs are 
within our means by ending waste, duplication and abuse. We 
must do this in order to guarantee the future affordability of 
these programs.
<P>
	However, the main thrust of these reforms is about jobs and 
growth. The best social program, as our Prime Minister has said 
many times, is a decent job that does not only ensure Canadians 
the means to sustain themselves, but also restores in them 
confidence and the dignity of work. Félix Leclerc, one of our 
most prominent singers and authors, once said: ``The best way to 
assassinate somebody is to give him nothing to do.''

<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	According to another saying, idleness is the root of all evil. 
By doing everything to put Canadians back to work or to train 
them, we will not only ensure the future viability of our social 
programs but also solve at the same time a host of social 
problems such as family violence and alcoholism.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is what these reforms are all about, giving Canadians the 
tools such as child care, retraining and counselling, so that they 
can get out of the dependency rut and back into productive 
society.
<P>
	This reform is about creating opportunity instead of 
dependency. This reform is about asking all 
governments-federal, provincial, municipal, employers, and 
more important the recipients of social programs-to share 
responsibility. We need programs that are going to be more 
flexible, adapted to people instead of to the bureaucrats that 
administer them.
<P>
	I believe very strongly in the principles and objectives as set 
out in the discussion paper. I intend to continue to consult with 
my constituents so that together we will find a strategy to renew 
and improve our social safety net. Together we will find the 
courage to implement the changes needed to build a better 
society where people will have self-confidence and the dignity 
of a job. Together we will build a society that will continue to be 
the envy of the world into the next century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I heartily agree with 
the hon. member's observation that reform is badly needed in 
the country. Amen to that.
<P>
	I agree also with his observation that the best social program 
is a job. If he believes that or if his government believes that, 
why then does it persist in its destructive anti-employment 
policy of taxing the life out of the Canadian economy in order to 
maintain its spendthrift habits? Is this not an unreasonable 
approach?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Serré:</B> I thank the hon. member for his support. We need 
reform but we do not need the Reform Party.
<P>
	But having said that, I have had occasion to talk to the hon. 
member many times on a lot of issues and we share similar 
views.
<P>
	The government certainly believes that job creation should be 
the number one priority. This is what reform is all about, not 
only this social policy reform but the document tabled by the 
finance minister and the upcoming document of the Minister of 
Industry. All our red book and other programs are geared toward 
creating jobs, creating opportunities.
<P>
	We moved in the first budget to remove some of the 
disincentives that impact on job creation. We reduced UI 
premiums, and hopefully with constructive suggestions from 
both opposition parties and from government  members, we will 
find better ways to put Canadians back to work.
<P>
	It is not only a question of dollars. I know that members of the 
Reform Party always think money. We Liberals think about 
people. Putting people back to work is not only saving a dollar or 
getting more revenue in income tax, it restores to Canadians the 
dignity of being able to be self-sufficient. To do that, we have to 
give them the tools.
<P>
	Right now, as I mentioned in my speech, people have many 
disincentives to going back to work. They are discouraged from 
going back to work. Hopefully, with these reforms, we will be 
able to give them the tools they need to get back to work.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to respond to the speech by the member of the 
government party.
<P>
	As you may recall, in the last nine years of the Conservative 
government, on several occasions when reforms were proposed 
by the former government, the Liberals-then the Official 
Opposition-did a very good job. They gained the trust of the 
Canadian people, who brought them to power. Unfortunately, I 
think that the government misled the population. May I remind 
you of former Tory minister Valcourt's UI reform, which created 
a scandal here in this House.
<P>
	The Conservatives caused a significant rise in the deficit 
which, of course, the current government promised to reduce. 
Everyone, I think, agrees that the deficit should be cut. 
However, reducing the deficit at the expense of the poor is 
unacceptable. The people do not want the deficit to be reduced at 
the expense of the poor.
<P>
	Last week, the Minister of Finance told us that, although the 
Bloc Quebecois agrees that the deficit should be cut, there is no 
other way to bring in the new money that would reduce it. I sit on 
the Standing Committee on Finance and we submitted to the 
committee chairman and to the Minister of Finance, on several 
occasions, adequate solutions that would allow the government 
to find additional funds.
<P>
	We also asked the government to cut into the fat of public 
expenditures, in the right place, namely the other house, 
commonly known as the Senate. It still costs the government 
$628 million a year, including all staff.
<P>
	As you may recall, a minister in this government made a 
return trip in the same day at a cost of $173,000.
<P>
	As you may recall, the Prime Minister decided-

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Sorry, but speeches are 
limited to 10 minutes and subject to a five-minute question and 
comment period. It is very short.
<P>
	Since I want to allow as many members as possible to 
participate in today's debate, I will let the hon. member for 
Timiskaming-French River give a short reply, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Serré:</B> Mr. Speaker, this will be very short. I thank the 
hon. member for his statement.
<P>
	I can summarize their philosophy very briefly. I think that 
they want to keep Canadian and Quebec families in perpetual 
poverty because that is what you do when you give them a 
cheque every month and tell them to stay home and do nothing. 
For a year, I have heard members of the Bloc Quebecois tell us to 
stop duplication, that is how we will save money. That is what 
we are trying to do with these reforms.
<P>
	For a year, I have heard Bloc members tell us to tax the rich. 
That is what we want to do with the education reform. We want 
to stop subsidizing the sons of lawyers and give to those who 
really need it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to speak about a philosophy of governing today. The 
philosophy is called incrementalism. I want to relate this 
philosophy to the social policy review.
<P>
	To illustrate, I want to tell members a story. I know how they 
enjoy a good relevant story. There was a woman who wanted to 
buy a chicken so she went into a country store where the store 
owner had a big sign that offered lots of chickens for sale.
<P>
	The store owner did not tell the lady that he really only had 
one scrawny chicken left at the back of the store. He offered to 
catch one of his many chickens and went back into the chicken 
coop. When he got there he banged a few walls, made some 
clucking noises and came back with his only chicken.
<P>
	He said: ``That will be $5. Thank you very much''. The lady 
answered: ``That chicken looks a little thin. Do you think I could 
have a different one?'' The merchant did not know quite what to 
do but he was a fellow with a fair bit of gall and a lot of nerve so 
he kept that stiff upper lip and went back into the coop.
<P>
	He raised some dust and he hit a few more walls. He made 
some more clucking noises. He fluffed up the chicken's feathers, 
turned it around on the plate, took it back out to the lady and 
said: ``That will be $10, please''. The lady said: ``I don't know. 
That one looks a little thin, too. I think I better take them both''.
<P>
	This is a great analogy to this social policy review that we are 
going through.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals during the last election made a great many 
promises. They said: ``We have many chickens in our coops. In 
fact, all it will cost you is the election. Trust us. Vote us in and 
we will bring back your chicken''. In  fact, on October 10 last 
year the <I>Globe and Mail</I> quoted the Prime Minister as saying: 
``Let me win the election and after that you come and ask me 
questions about how I will run the government''.
<P>
	The poor taxpayer bought into the government claims. The 
taxpayer then said: ``Okay, now we have elected you. Just go 
back into your coop and bring out a nice chicken for us. Let us 
see what you have''. The minister went away and consulted with 
special interest groups, with his political friends and I suppose 
some other people and came back with a chicken for the 
taxpayer. This chicken has a name. Its name is ``Agenda: Jobs 
and Growth''. It is a book full of suggestions but it does not have 
any plans. It especially has no costing to its vague proposals.
<P>
	Canadians took one look at this poor excuse for a chicken and 
said: ``This is one mighty scrawny chicken. There is no meat on 
it. How are Canadians possibly going to get a meal from this 
chicken''?
<P>
	Allow me to quote what some Canadians have actually said. 
The Vanier Institute on the Family said: ``It does not show an 
awful lot of commitment by the government at this time to any 
one of the options put forth''. The Caledon Institute of Social 
Policy said: ``It is on the whole thin on specifics''.
<P>
	The <I>Toronto Star</I> said: ``It is surprisingly timid, vague and 
short of essential information. It does not contain a single 
proposal that could be described as original or daring''. The 
paper was panned by the premiers of B.C. and Saskatchewan and 
endorsed by only one lonely premier. The premier of Ontario 
called it an insult.
<P>
	The chief economist at the Canadian Imperial Bank of 
Commerce said: ``It is a bit of a pig in a poke''. Apparently, he 
likes the pork analogy better than he likes my chicken story.
<P>
	Canadians have had a good look at this chicken now. As the 
poll on the weekend showed, they like the general idea of 
cutbacks, but they want to see some more specifics.
<P>
	However the store owner, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, has the same kind of gall as that other store 
owner. He is going to say: ``Okay, another chicken you want, 
another chicken you will get''. He will go back into his chicken 
coop, make some more political noise, fluff up the feathers of 
his poor old chicken and bring it out for the taxpayer to see. Do 
you know what? It will be the same old chicken only it will cost 
more through higher taxes.
<P>

<P>
	The Liberals delayed this social policy review for nine 
months before bringing it out. They finally brought it forward 
and it says virtually nothing. Why are we surprised? It is not 
the Liberal way to say anything. It is the Liberal way to delay, 
to study, to talk and to talk and after much fanfare raise the 
taxes and take the tiniest baby steps toward any kind of 
resolution of all the problems we are currently experiencing.
<P>
	I want members to know something. Initially, some taxpayers 
will accept the government's tiny incremental solutions because 
at least there is the appearance of change. It is only when 
taxpayers realize that they need both chickens for their pot, 
specific plans for social policy change and action on the debt 
and deficit, that the government will be exposed for what it 
really is.
<P>
	What will the minister say when the bluff is called? He will be 
speechless. It is hard to imagine but I think he will be 
speechless. He will stand there with empty hands and empty 
pockets and say: ``I'm sorry. All along we only had that one 
scrawny chicken. The real chicken is a skinny one. We have 
nothing to deal with the debt and deficit that is in fact destroying 
our social programs''.
<P>
	The Liberal government has ruled this country for 
generations. It has always proceeded in these careful half-step 
fashions. Mackenzie King was a classic Liberal. His words 
``conscription if necessary but not necessarily conscription'' are 
a perfect example of a Liberal statement. Liberals balance 
artfully on the fence, careful not too move too fast, careful not to 
offend. But while the Liberals sit and think and be careful, 
problems are building up like floodwaters behind the dam.
<P>
	What are these problems? Examples are everywhere. Serious 
changes are required in the UI system, changes that Reformers 
have advocated for some years now. Restoring UI to a 
self-sustaining insurance type program, funded, controlled and 
administered by the workers and employers who use it.
<P>
	For example, there is the new health care review. Change was 
promised a year ago, promised again in the spring, promised 
again this fall by a Prime Minister who last week found out that 
the provinces, health care's largest player, the player that 
Reformers say should have even more freedom to administer 
health care programs, will not even participate in this latest $12 
million study. Imagine, $12 million and 22 more people to study 
and review the system for another year. Health care will be close 
to death by that time.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	This goes across the board. The Minister of Public Service 
Renewal gave a speech a year ago telling the public service that 
change is coming, but do not worry we are still reviewing and 
studying. The GST changes are still under review. Tax reform is 
needed but under review. The $58 million royal commission on 
aboriginal peoples is delayed for another six months.
<P>
	If there is no action in our year old social programs a year 
from now they will be in a far worse situation even  if the 
economy continues to do well. Our debt will have grown in a 
year by another $40 billion. The likelihood that all will go as 
planned is small. Life is never ideal. We are in a position of 
tremendous risk.
<P>
	All it would take is a slight downturn in the economy, a small 
jump in the interest rates, to decimate our social programs 
instead of managing the change now in an orderly fashion.
<P>
	The government often accuses Reform of a lack of 
compassion, for wanting to act now on social program reform. Is 
it really a show of compassion to add another $100 billion of 
debt on to the country? Is it truly compassionate to force 
working Canadians to pay more and more of their pay cheques in 
taxes funnelled to foreigners, money for which they will never 
receive any kind of a spinoff however indirect, to force more and 
more jobs out of the economy as Canada becomes less and less 
competitive because of its debt, to gradually whittle away our 
civil service and our social programs because more and more 
must go to pay the interest?
<P>
	The bank does not care if you have good food on your table as 
long as you are able to pay your mortgage. In the same way the 
world investment community could not care less if Canada has 
any social programs or government jobs or anything else, 
period, as long as we pay the interest on our debt.
<P>
	Liberal incrementalism hurts Canadians and that is why 
Reform rejects their course of action. It is an act of compassion 
to swallow the tough medicine right now, to make the changes 
now from further reliance on the federal government and to 
greater rewards for personal initiatives, for a greater reliance on 
family ties and on local institutions in our communities, and 
then finally the personal freedom that can only come from a 
lower level of taxation.
<P>
	That is why Reform says we need to balance the budget during 
the term of this Parliament. That is what we call tough love for 
our country.
<P>
	What used to be a clear governing philosophy of 
incrementalism has even changed of late. Andrew Coyne of the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> says of this government's proposals: ``Behind 
the generalities lurks a government that is scared to death. It is 
not the fear that inspires but the fear that transfixes the deadly 
paralysis of the rabbit in the cobra's gaze''.
<P>
	I believe the Liberals are no longer even incrementalists. 
They are simply afraid to move, paralysed by problems on the 
one hand and the titillations of power on the other.
<P>
	I suggest that it is time to have courage and seize the 
opportunity. I would like to quote a bit of Shakespeare just to 
lighten the atmosphere. It goes like this and it is familiar. I am 
sure Mr. Speaker knows it by heart. It states:
<P>

	The great floodtide of opportunity is flowing. The time to ride 
its crest is now. Change will never be easier than today but three 
more years of discussion papers and reviews may totally ruin 
our social system.
<P>
	Liberals will forever regret passing up the golden opportunity 
to address these problems in last year's federal budget. They 
will regret passing up today's golden opportunity of economic 
growth and their party may well break up if the economy 
founders on the debt. Then a gale force wind will sweep political 
change over this land and the Reform Party, fully matured and 
mindful of the long term interests of the country, will be there to 
pick up the pieces and preserve the essentials of our social safety 
net.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In that same spirit of 
humour, I do not know if I liked the story about the chickens 
better or Shakespeare's quote.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
to the member for Fraser Valley East with great interest.
<P>
	When he was talking about pork and chickens I could not help 
but think of ham and eggs. He is quite a ham and a lot of the ideas 
the Reform Party has is like laying big eggs.
<P>
	I would like to pick up on two points the member raised. First, 
the Reform Party makes much ado about referenda, listening to 
the people and responding to what people are telling it. In fact 
what we are doing in this consultation process of the 
government is listening to the people.
<P>
	When the member gets a chance to respond I wonder if he will 
attempt to square the Reform Party's position vis-à-vis 
referenda and the need to listen to people with what we are doing 
as a government to consult with the public to put out in front of 
Canadians serious options, not just fuzzy ideas.
<P>
	An example is the second part of my question. In my riding I 
have the wonderful city of Elliot Lake which has recently gone 
through a major transformation. Part of that transformation, 
because of changes in the local economy, has included 
thousands of seniors moving to the community. We have an 
opportunity through the options put forward by the minister to 
engage Canadians who are now maybe on unemployment 
insurance or welfare to contribute back to the community and 
help us keep our seniors safe in their homes.
<P>
	The minister's proposals have given us an opportunity to be 
creative, have given direction, and I can hardly imagine how the 
member could respond by suggesting that these options are 
nothing less than very concrete proposals for the future.
<P>
	I would ask him to deal with those two points if he would.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of issues, one 
which is close to every Reformer's heart, the issue of 
referendums. Referendums are one way of determining in a very 
final way what the people in the country want to do as far as 
taxes, expenses, priorities, things they want to get a handle on 
such as capital punishment issues, things that are burning in the 
nation's craw, so to speak.
<P>
	I have no problem whatsoever with squaring the idea of 
listening to the people. A couple of days ago, and this is not a 
referendum, polls indicated 90 per cent of people want action on 
social policy reform. When do they want it? We could start the 
chant: when do they want it?-now. When are they asking for 
it?-now. It has been a year and nothing has happened.
<P>
	If you were to go to the people and ask if they were prepared 
for a change, if you wanted to go, if people wanted to initiate a 
referendum, they would approve massive changes now.
<P>
	What they will not approve is the other side of the equation 
where the Minister of Finance continues to fudge on whether to 
tax RRSPs. Take that to a referendum. People would say 
absolutely not, reduce government spending, that is how we are 
going to handle this deficit problem.
<P>
	I have no trouble figuring it out or relying on the people in the 
country through the use of a referendum. Referendums, I think, 
will back up what the Reform Party has been saying all along 
which is that people want control of the debt and deficit and they 
want it now. They expect the government to control them 
through cutting expenses, not through additional tax increases.
<P>
	Not only would they often approve such things in a 
referendum but it would give that impetus to the government to 
say not only do they want it to in a poll, they ordered it to do it 
and what could be more unifying to the country than that force 
from coast to coast saying we should get on with the necessary 
changes now. Referendums are not a problem. We could 
certainly do that easily.
<P>
	As far as having creative ideas, all ideas are welcome when a 
community goes through massive changes. All ideas have to be 
brought forward on the table. In the paper on jobs and growth 
pensions are not even mentioned. That is what the citizens of 
Elliot Lake would like to have more discussion on than what this 
paper offers.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a great pleasure to participate in this debate today 
and surely the chickens are coming home to roost.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	If the parliamentary channel were to be seen in the other 
place, and I do not mean heaven-and it probably is for hours 
and hours of the day-you could bet one thing. All those 
Liberals, and the place would be full of them, would be rolling 
over in their graves right now. What we are talking about is how 
we are going unscramble an omelette. How are we going to make 
right what the Liberals did 35 years ago in order to buy their 
power and success with our money? That is what is all boils 
down to.
<P>
	We, ladies and gentlemen in television land, are the ones who 
brought this upon ourselves. The Liberals and the 
Conservatives, in order to get re-elected or elected, determined 
the best way to do it was to buy us with our own money. The 
chicken has come home to roost. Our responsibility, this 
Parliament, I and my colleagues, are charged with the great 
responsibility to somehow do this to keep our country whole and 
to ensure that future generations of Canadians grow up in a spirit 
and attitude of confidence, self-worth and self-respect.
<P>
	How are we going to do it? My hon. colleague from Elliot 
Lake talked about ham and eggs which reminded me of story of a 
pig and a chicken walking down the road. They are walking 
down the road and the pig said to the chicken: ``Chicken, I am 
getting a little hungry''. The chicken said: ``So am I. Do you 
think we should stop for breakfast?''. The pig asked: ``What do 
you think we should have?''. The chicken said: ``Why don't we 
have ham and eggs?''. The pig thought for a minute and said: 
``Chicken, when you say ham and eggs, the eggs from you are a 
donation, from me the ham is a commitment''. That is what 
Canadians need and are looking for today. They are looking for 
commitment.
<P>
	There is absolutely nothing as disheartening as going into a 
period of uncertainty and looking at the captain of the ship and 
the captain is looking at somebody else to lead. Our country is 
on stormy waters even as we speak. We need a government, we 
must have a government, that will take the initiative and do what 
it is paid to do, lead. The time for studying, navel gazing 
discussion is long past. We are in serious trouble today and 
dreaming about it and wishing are not going to change a thing.
<P>
	There may be some of us here in this House who do not agree 
with the American philosopher Ayn Rand, but I think all of us 
would agree with at least this one truism, that you must deal with 
things as they are, not as you would wish them to be. If we 
reflect in our daily lives, we know that no matter how difficult 
the situation we may face from day to day, the minute that we 
start dealing with the problem it starts getting better.
<P>
	We know what the problems are in our economy. We know 
what got us here. Surely we know that the first step is the most 
difficult to get us out of this mess and that is the chronic 
overspending of all levels of government.
<P>
	I would like to spend a few minutes talking about one aspect 
of this social policy review, unemployment insurance. 
Unemployment insurance started 35 or so years ago with the 
noblest of intentions. The idea was that unemployment 
insurance would help those who lost their jobs tide them over 
until they were to get a new job. It is a noble idea. Who would 
disagree with that? It was to be paid for by the people who would 
use it-insurance. It would be paid for by the companies that 
hired employees, and employers.
<P>
	When unemployment insurance started in Canada it 
consumed 0.9 per cent of our gross domestic product.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	That is, of the value of all the goods and services that were 
produced in our country, unemployment insurance was 0.9 per 
cent. In 1992-93 unemployment insurance was 3 per cent of our 
gross domestic product. It had increased from $60 million a year 
to around $20 billion. No one got up one morning and said we 
should turn unemployment insurance into something that is not 
going to work, or will not be what we wanted it to be in the first 
place.
<P>
	It gradually, incrementally, took on other responsibilities. It 
became a method whereby we were able to redistribute income 
throughout the nation. As it stands today all across the country 
dependent upon the unemployment rate, it is possible to get 
unemployment insurance. For instance, in a place with 16 per 
cent unemployment I think one needs to work 10 weeks a year to 
get approximately 39 weeks of benefits. If the unemployment in 
Canada averages 10 per cent, people need to work for, I believe, 
15 weeks to get 30 weeks of benefits. It has absolutely no 
relation to insurance.
<P>
	Now we have a suggestion in this book-whatever its 
colour-to change the name, to call it employment insurance. 
Think about it for a minute. We do not like what unemployment 
insurance has become, so let us change the name. Let us call it 
employment insurance. Why do we not call it unfire insurance 
then? Or let us call it uncollision insurance. Let us do whatever 
we have to do, but for goodness sake let us not deal with the 
problem as it is.
<P>
	Let us obfuscate the problem. Let us somehow bury the 
problem so we do not have to deal with it as it is. The Forge 
commission years ago was charged with exactly this 
responsibility, to make unemployment insurance 
unemployment insurance. What did we as parliamentarians do? 
We decided the Canadian people were not ready for these radical 
reforms such as pay as you go, and it was put back on the 
shelves.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7128"> 7128 </A></B>
<P>
	We do not have to go into a great navel gazing exercise in 
order to figure out what is wrong with unemployment 
insurance. All we have to do is make it insurance. There are 
two aspects to this. There is the aspect of the employer and the 
employee. Our system has become so generous and so easy to 
get into that employers, when faced with the decision of letting 
someone go, find it much easier to look someone in the eye and 
say ``we are laying you off, we do not have enough work'', than 
it is to say ``you are out of here because a) you do not show 
up on time, b) you have not made an effort when you are here, 
c) you do not groom yourself properly'' or whatever.
<P>
	It is much easier to say ``we are going to lay you off''. What 
does that do? That is a tax on everybody else who is working. 
Does that do anything for the person being fired? It does 
absolutely nothing.
<P>
	When someone in our unemployment insurance maze happens 
for whatever reason to get laid off or perhaps fired, what 
happens? When people are laid off through no fault of their own, 
the waiting period is fairly short and they are able to claim 
benefits right away, as it should be. When people quit they are 
supposed to be in a situation in which they cannot claim benefits 
for an extended period of time. They can still claim benefits but 
it takes a while.
<P>
	In reality what happens? An employer fires someone and so 
they go to their local unemployment insurance office and say 
they were fired. They are asked why they were fired. The person 
replies: ``I do not know. I should not have been fired. I am the 
greatest employee ever ''.
<P>
	They therefore go to the referee. The person who fired them 
has to go through a long and involved process of saying why they 
fired them. Then they have to go to a committee of three people 
to justify it. Otherwise the person has recourse to say that he or 
she was laid off.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	All this does not do anything to strengthen the insurance 
aspect of what we are talking about. It would be relatively 
simple in many of the great problems we have if we boiled it 
down to some very straightforward essentials.
<P>
	A basic mandate in everything we do is that it must be fair and 
have equity. Fairness and equity must be the underlying values 
in everything we do in social policy review including 
unemployment insurance. We must inculcate with 
everyone-employer, employee, parent and child-a sense of 
personal responsibility for our successes and our failures in life.
<P>
	If we were to do so, we would go a long way in establishing a 
sense of self-sufficiency, self-confidence and self-worth in 
ourselves as individuals. It is up to everyone as individuals to 
make their way in life; it is not up to the government to do it for 
anyone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great respect to the comments of the 
hon. member.
<P>
	After listening to the first story about the chicken and then the 
story about the chicken and the pork that were side by each going 
down the road and after hearing comments from previous 
speakers across the way, I remembered, coming from Atlantic 
Canada, that in many cases we were very fortunate to have the 
slim or the thin chicken in our pot of stew. Sometimes those 
comments scare me. I wonder whether we would have anything 
to put in the pot if we were to listen to some of the comments of 
the Reform Party.
<P>
	I want to direct a question to the hon. colleague across the 
way. Has he read the green book, the paper of the Minister of 
Human Resources Development that was tabled a week or so ago 
now? Does he realizes that the minister invited consultation? 
Does he intend to go to his constituents and say this is an 
opportunity for them to participate, to have input and to have 
their input respected as the input of other members of the 
Reform Party and of other parties in the House will be respected 
by the minister, the department and the government?
<P>
	The opportunity for consultation, the opportunity that 
Canadians were crying out for, has been lacking for many years. 
They want to be part of a participatory government. Then we 
have it and, if we listen to the Reform Party, it is saying: ``Make 
up your mind tomorrow, dictate to Canadians, and forget about 
consultation''.
<P>
	I am somewhat confused when I hear such comments because 
I believe that what Canadians want is participatory government. 
That is what Canadians want in my constituency, in Atlantic 
Canada, and I suspect in other parts of Canada. The Minister of 
Human Resources Development has given them the opportunity 
to be part of it. He has given you the opportunity to be part of it, 
Mr. Speaker, and every member of the House.
<P>
	Let us get to constructive input that will help the department 
and the minister bring about a social program that is not only 
good for all Canadians but supportable to all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. It gives me the opportunity to tell residents of 
Edmonton in general and Edmonton Southwest specifically that 
the meeting at which we will be discussing this subject will take 
place on November 7 at 7.30 p.m. at the Royal West Edmonton 
Inn as part of our ongoing discussions and deliberations with 
constituents.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned dependence and consultation. 
Consultations must be more than a feel good, giant warm fuzzy 
smurf ball that we are throwing out and let us all hug it and think 
we are doing something.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7129"> 7129 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	There has to be a specific purpose to what we are doing. 
Before we can consult on the benefits of one program versus 
another, let us put some costs up front, let us attach some costs to 
it. Who in business would decide to go down plan <I>a</I> or plan <I>b</I> 
without first determining where plan <I>a</I> is starting and finishing? 
That is what is missing in the whole consultation review.
<P>
	I have lived in the maritimes and have some considerable 
sympathy for what people have talked about in an area of the 
country considered to be chronically depressed. I do not think 
that is true. I do not think the maritimes are chronically 
depressed. As a matter of fact it is interesting to note that the 
Bank of Nova Scotia did not start in Toronto; it started in the 
maritimes. The wealth and power that existed in the maritimes 
for many years have gradually progressed eastward to Toronto 
and are concentrated in southern Ontario.
<P>
	If I were a person living in the maritimes I would be on my 
feet screaming for a triple E Senate to give my region at least 
some power and say in the national decision making of the 
country. That fairness in the triple E Senate will go a lot further 
to putting the maritimes in a stronger financial position than all 
the equalization payments forever which have done nothing.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on revising 
our social programs.
<P>
	There have been questions in the House about the consultation 
process and some assertions that it is not genuine. There have 
also been statements that the discussion paper is out of touch 
with Canadians. Some have even said Canadians do not want to 
overhaul our social support system, while others have argued 
that Canadians want major reductions in our social programs.
<P>
	I will deal with both those arguments, not by using conjecture 
or my own opinion but by using the results of a public forum on 
the future of social programs held in Edmonton East in June. The 
results of the forum were submitted to the government before 
the discussion paper was finalized. I am happy to report that the 
document tabled this month reflects much of what my 
constituents said. It is in touch with Canadians.
<P>
	By way of background, in my first speech here I indicated 
Edmonton East is a microcosm of Canada in many ways. We 
have a very diverse population with a mixture of occupations, 
income levels, social and cultural backgrounds. All this 
diversity is similar to the diversity of Canada and was 
represented at the forum. The group had in common a desire to 
do what was best for local communities, what would best meet 
the needs of all people there. That is also the basic value that 
Canadians hold.
<P>
	It is significant there was general agreement that our social 
programs needed to be revamped to accommodate current 
realities. I heard two general themes that night. One was an 
appreciation for Canada's history of social  programs as a good 
way to demonstrate caring and to build community. No one said 
to do away with them. Second were suggestions for 
modifications and improvements. No one defended the status 
quo as good enough.
<P>
	There were differences of opinion, lots of them, as there are 
across the country. Even more, there was an appreciation that 
the government is ready to tackle the problem, not to destroy our 
heritage but to improve on it. The residents of Edmonton East 
also put forward some general directions for improving what we 
have and a number of specific suggestions. I am happy to report 
to the House that the discussion paper includes many of the 
suggestions. Let me highlight a few.
<P>
	It was no surprise that increasing employment opportunities 
was a high priority in every discussion group. ``Training is not 
much good without jobs'', said one participant and others 
agreed. More worthy of note was the recognition that there is a 
positive role for government to play in job creation in 
partnership with the private sector and local communities. No 
one can solve the problem alone.
<P>
	Of particular value for the coming months of debate in the 
House was the willingness of my constituents to recognize and 
to deal with the bigger question of how we define and distribute 
work in Canada. They want to see a better sharing of 
employment opportunities. They want to see that people who 
contribute to building our communities have adequate resources 
for their basic needs whether they contribute through traditional 
jobs or by doing the work that needs to be done, such as caring 
for children or community work.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	They recognize our economy may have a shortage of paid jobs 
but there is a lot of work to be done in the country. They said 
volunteer work was productive work and should be recognized 
by federal programs. They also recognize that employers 
sometimes exploit employees because the lack of jobs makes 
them vulnerable. ``There is no accountability for employers in 
the present circumstances'', said one participant.
<P>
	Going one step further, we as a society need to come to grips 
with new ways to share the dignity of work and its just rewards. 
``Overtime should not be allowed when so many people go 
unemployed'', said one person. Others questioned the belief that 
being home with children is no longer considered acceptable 
work. We look forward to the proposals that will come from the 
task force currently working on the question of distribution of 
work in our society.
<P>
	Another strong theme was the need to improve training 
programs and educational opportunities. Residents show an 
incredible wisdom. They care about the quality of the programs 
and getting good value for their tax dollar, not about who 
delivers them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7130"> 7130 </A></B>
<P>
	Portable skills, on the job training and life skills were all 
suggestions that found their place in the discussion paper. One 
specific suggestion was apprenticeships for women at any age, 
recognizing that they may be re-entering the workforce after 
raising children. More opportunities for less academically 
oriented youth was another emphasis. We do not need just more 
access to university but more diverse kinds of education to 
develop the many different skills of our young people and help 
them find their niche in a global economy.
<P>
	In addition to improving the quality of individual programs, 
residents want better linkages between jobs, programs and 
services. Income support programs need to be linked with 
training programs and training programs with real job potential. 
``Many of the good programs are too small'', said one group. 
Several groups suggested replacing fragmented programs with a 
mix of guaranteed annual income and guaranteed employment.
<P>
	The participants in the Edmonton East forum understood that 
cheap is not the same as efficient. They recognize that adequate 
support is necessary to achieve self-sufficiency. We need to 
invest in people if we want them to invest in building our 
country. People must be able to meet their basic needs in order to 
be productive, learn new skills or care for children.
<P>
	Of particular importance in our debate is the emphasis on the 
needs of children and the importance of giving children a good 
start in life. To me an important test of the success of our 
revision of social programs will be whether or not children 
living in poverty in my riding are better off. Maybe Premier 
Kline can close his eyes to what is happening on the streets of 
my city. I cannot. I see poor children who are too hungry to learn 
well. Last week I met school children who are without warm 
enough clothing to go out and plant tulips in the Canada 
Remembers Program.
<P>
	Everything is not all right in Alberta and that is not the vision 
of Canada we want for our children. Some may not see the 
connection between substandard housing, unemployment, 
frustrated young people and public safety. The residents of my 
riding know the connection because they live with it every day. 
They know what it takes to build strong communities and that is 
what they want governments to invest in.
<P>
	That leads me to the last but perhaps the strongest theme I 
heard: the importance of community support, non-financial 
support. An income cheque does not create security. Young 
people and seniors need a sense of belonging and involvement in 
their community rather than isolation and alienation. Young 
families and children need more than money. They need 
community support for the important task of raising the next 
generation.
<P>
	Edmonton is known for its strong neighbourhood associations 
and its many community run agencies that respond to local 
needs and help to build local community networks. This network 
is under severe distress, thanks  to drastic provincial cuts 
without consulting the people affected by them. Ironically it is 
especially in times of uncertainty and rapid change like we are 
living through today that every community needs some social 
support services and networks.
<P>
	The participants in the Edmonton East forum want the federal 
government to take an active role in co-operation with cities and 
local communities that know what needs to be done. If we do not 
want people to fall through the cracks and become dependent on 
federal government handouts, we must ensure that local 
communities, not just provinces, have a voice in deciding what 
kind of social support network is effective.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Focus on local action, residents told me, not national 
committees or endless federal-provincial consultations. It is 
community networks for example which provide young people 
with a sense of belonging that leads away from crime to safer 
streets.
<P>
	Perhaps our fixation on federal-provincial relations is too 
narrow. Perhaps communities, especially our large urban ones, 
should have a more direct voice when it comes to the social 
development of our country. The people in my riding are 
concerned that we are losing that sense of community that built 
this country and they want to rebuild it. This is the most 
important goal for our revitalization of Canada's social 
programs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
believe the member was in the House when I last asked this 
question about universality so she will know where I am coming 
from.
<P>
	It must be said again and again that the Reform Party stands 
for ensuring that our country has the ability to be able to take 
care of those in our society who are most in need, the kind of 
people the member was just talking about.
<P>
	However, with the greatest of respect to the other Liberal 
members who have responded to this question, I have yet to get 
what I consider to be a straight answer to the question.
<P>
	Perhaps we could rephrase the question with respect to 
universality and say this. If we define universality as being 
programs that are not only available to all members of Canadian 
society, but that in fact just automatically come out to members 
of Canadian society, and if we recognize the problems, the 
difficulties that we have developed in Canada as a result of this 
process, and the fact that we are going to have to target to make 
sure that people who have the most need, whether it is old age 
security, health care, education, or whatever the process is, 
maybe we could define it and come down to something more 
precise.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7131"> 7131 </A></B>
<P>
	Specifically, which programs would the member want to 
ensure remain under this universality blanket in its broadest 
sense? That way, rather than just a simple yes or no we can have 
a sense on where the member would see this going on the basis 
of the input that she has had from her constituents.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bethel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. I think 
universality is perhaps one of the most undefined and 
misunderstood words that we have. I guess it is for that reason I 
will choose not to use it.
<P>
	What I believe in and what is incredibly important to embed in 
all the programs that we offer, be they social programs or 
economic programs, is equity. That to me means that there is 
equitable access, that there is fairness and equity and everyone 
has equal, equitable opportunities.
<P>
	The hon. member has asked what kind of social programs 
should be excluded. I really believe this consultation process 
that we are undergoing now is incredibly valuable. For one thing 
I think it has all Canadians focused on exactly what we need to 
offer in the way of social policy. What has come through very 
clearly is that we need to target those in need.
<P>
	The other incredibly valuable thing that we have done is we 
have discussed this with those who receive the programs and the 
benefits, not just the provinces and not just those who deliver 
those programs but the people who actually receive them. What 
we find from that is that is where the wisdom and the experience 
with those programs comes from. That is where we see some of 
the very best suggestions of change on how to make those 
programs better, more efficient, more cost efficient and more 
effective.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> I 
have a really short question for the hon. member.
<P>
	You mentioned that your community wants more community 
involvement in the process. Can you see programs within the 
system where the community can take over part of what the 
federal government is now involved in?
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I give the floor to 
the hon. member for Edmonton East I would just remind my 
colleagues to direct your interventions through the Chair and not 
directly to one another.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bethel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think what we have seen in the past 
few years is a real desire by communities to be self-sufficient, 
in essence to take care of their own needs. If those needs relate to 
children, whether they be recreation or nutritional programs or 
whatever, I certainly see there being real value in community 
groups and organizations taking over those functions.
<P>
	It is important to know that those organizations will need 
some kind of support to get them going. It is happening now.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that the 
government can modernize our social security system and, 
based on the most recent polls, Canadians agree with that. But, 
first and foremost, we must all think about the kind of society in 
which we want to live. Together we must all search out the 
solutions which are appropriate for us. This is a matter of mutual 
responsibility.
<P>
	We must, in particular, consider the way we spend and not just 
how much we spend. This is what the social policy reform is all 
about. We all agree that the problem has to do with the fact that 
the nature of work changed drastically over the last 30 or 40 
years and that our manpower training programs are no longer 
adequate, given the new technologies and markets.
<P>
	We all agree, including the opposition, that our rural and 
urban areas had a better trained labour force which attracted 
more investments and generated new jobs. This is why we 
proposed a two-tier UI reform: one to help people who normally 
work but sometimes need to rely on unemployment insurance; 
the other, with more emphasis on training, for those who have 
difficulty getting back or staying in the workforce. As you know, 
this is why a sub-committee was set up.
<P>
	The second element of the proposed plan concerns 
post-secondary education. In Canada, education falls under 
provincial or territorial jurisdiction. However, since the early 
days of Confederation, the federal government has supported 
post-secondary education because of the fundamental link 
between education and employment.
<P>
	That support has partly contributed to the establishment of 
our universities and colleges. Accessibility is the new great 
challenge which our post-secondary system must face. Indeed, 
our institutions must train and prepare many more people than in 
the past, and the training provided must be better targeted to the 
new jobs being created.
<P>
	In fact, in the last three years, the number of jobs offered to 
university graduates has increased by 17 per cent, while jobs 
offered to workers with no post-secondary education has 
decreased by 19 per cent.
<P>
	The idea that learning is only for kids and young adults is now 
obsolete. Canadians must be able to enjoy better education and 
training opportunities throughout their working lives. We are 
now talking about life-long training. We must modernize the 
system to avoid restricting access to education and training 
either for young Canadians who are just starting a career or for 
workers who want to keep up with the changing economy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7132"> 7132 </A></B>
<P>
	In a competitive global market, investing in learning is a wise 
decision from an economic point of view, but it must also be 
a shared responsibility. The goal is to maintain and extend 
access to post-secondary education and training.
<P>
	Too many people spend years on welfare, when they could 
find work if they had efficient support to look for a job or further 
their education. The fact is that, since 1981, the number of 
welfare recipients in Canada has doubled to reach a little over 
three million.
<P>
	Our social security system should protect the haves-not, that 
is the people who cannot work, the low-income families, the 
disabled or chronically ill and especially children living in 
poverty.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	One thing is clear: even if the Canadian government had a 
surplus instead of a deficit, we still would have to modernize our 
social programs. We need a social security system that is viable 
in the long run. We need a system that gives people the means to 
break free from the bonds of welfare or to seek separation from 
welfare, as the Opposition would put it. There is too much 
unemployment, too many children living in poverty. The time 
has come to act and to solve these problems.
<P>
	This being said, we encourage Canadians to take advantage of 
the social security reform process to make their points of view 
known. In the weeks to come, a committee will hold hearings in 
all parts of the country. At the same time, hon. members will 
hold, as I did, public meetings in their ridings to consult their 
constituents.
<P>
	Later, the Canadian government will discuss the review with 
the provinces, and I certainly hope, like a majority of 
Quebecers, that the Quebec government will take part in this 
Canada-wide consultation.
<P>
	The facts are clear. We must concentrate our efforts on the 
most vulnerable. This is only just and fair.
<P>
	No one, of course, expects the working paper to solve 
everything. It addresses a structural problem. It shows us the 
way to a society that is better adapted to the social realities of 
the year 2000. However, the Canadian government is also 
undertaking initiatives to resolve difficulties in all other areas, 
including a detailed examination of each federal program and 
the modernization of government operations. It is also taking 
concrete measures to help businesses take advantage of new 
technologies and enter foreign markets. That is why we have 
asked Jacques Parizeau to be part of the team that will leave for 
China in a few days.
<P>
	It takes time and a lot of goodwill to bring about substantial 
reforms, but I can assure you that the Prime Minister, the 
government and the Department of Human Resources 
Development have the vision, the patience and the 
determination necessary to modernize our social programs and 
to adapt them to the needs of Canadian society and to the 
requirements of the next century.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member will know that I have a question.
<P>
	I was interested in the response to my question about 
universality from the colleague who just preceded him. She 
said, and I think I wrote it down correctly: ``We have to target to 
those in need'', which of course has been the position of the 
Reform Party all the way through.
<P>
	One thing has been really instructive. It perhaps sounds like I 
am trying to redo the election of a year ago, but it seems that this 
position that we have to target to those in need has been coming 
forward from the Liberal members seems to be unique to the 
members of the Liberal Party who have been elected to this 
House. During the course of the election I did not hear that.
<P>
	When I said we have to target to those in need, what I heard 
from our political adversaries, some of whom happen to belong 
to that party, was: ``Oh, you are out to destroy the social 
programs. Oh my goodness, what is going to happen now? We 
believe in the sanctification of the concept of universality''.
<P>
	I would like to ask this member exactly the same question. 
Perhaps I could ask him if he too would like to reflect back 
approximately a year ago, 364 days I believe, the anniversary of 
the election being tomorrow. I wonder if during the course of the 
election we could find anywhere in any of his speeches or his 
public pronouncements where he got up on a soap box and said: 
``I, a Liberal candidate in this election, say we have to target our 
social programs to those in need'' or if he was like some of the 
other people who I was in contest with who were saying: ``No, 
no, we can't do that. It must be universality''. Has this member 
changed his position from the election?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think there is a well known 
concept here of accepting universality. If we look in terms of 
health care for example, all Canadians are treated in equal 
fashion. It is not an American system, it is a Canadian system. 
We can just take that as an example. We do believe in the 
universality of treatment. We do not believe in charging user 
fees for someone who needs cancer treatment, like they are 
doing now in some provinces, one being the province of Quebec 
and, if I am not mistaken, in the province of Alberta where they 
have made considerable cuts in health care.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7133"> 7133 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	It is not the opinion of the government or myself as the 
member for Bonaventure-Magdalen Islands to accept such 
cuts in that domain.
<P>
	That being said, the concept of universality in health is 
maintained but there are other aspects as well in terms of where 
we should reorient our services, the caring for children, trying to 
do more for those who are impoverished.
<P>
	We are also looking at the possibility of maybe reorienting 
our program on high income earners for child care. That money 
should be used for those who are really in need.
<P>
	We are looking at universality one way or another across 
Canada but at health care where it is really needed. There should 
be no class differentiation between a cancer patient in Quebec or 
a cancer patient in Alberta. They are all suffering from the same 
disease, therefore they should all get the same treatment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will try to make this brief.
<P>
	I was interested in the hon. member's adamant support for the 
universality of our health care system. I would like to compare 
the current problem we have in our health care system to that of 
buying a car.
<P>
	If a person wanted to buy a $20,000 vehicle and found that he 
had only $15,000 and had to get the other $5,000 from another 
source, who should be in control of the car? Should it be the 
person who bought the car and put the majority of the money in 
or should it be the lender who gave him the $5,000?
<P>
	Our current health care system is primarily funded by the 
provinces yet the federal government wants to call the shots, 
dictate the terms of the Canada Health Act. I would like the hon. 
member to respond to that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, health care has nothing to do with 
buying a car. It is not a luxury, it is a right. Canadians have the 
right to equitable health care across Canada.
<P>
	If the member wants to continue with these transfer 
payments-I am not expressing the government's position, I am 
expressing my own personal impressions-the provinces must 
recognize that we cannot stand for user fees. One cannot start 
creating private clinics across Canada.
<P>
	We cannot say that because one person has money he will get 
cancer treatment and because the other person does not have 
money they will go into a U.S. system where they will have to 
rely on charitable organizations to pay for their health care.
<P>
	That is not the Canada I grew up in. That is not the kind of 
Canada my grandparents built and believe you me, Mr. Speaker, 
my children will remain Canadians, when I have children. We 
will still have universality. That is one of the hallmarks of 
Canada and especially of our health care system.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We have been known to 
make promises.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me 
tell you that I am shaken and even bewildered by this Liberal 
document on social programs.
<P>
	There is nothing in that green book save proposals to reform 
our system on the backs of the poor. That, in my opinion, is a 
step backwards. Where are the commitments made by the 
Liberal government in its red book?
<P>
	When will the government stop treating people in Canada, in 
Quebec, and other provinces like gullible fools? The 
government is hiding behind vague consultations that will drag 
on for months. Countless organizations will express their 
disappointment to the committee. They will be listened to 
politely when in fact the dice are loaded and decisions have 
already been made. The minister will cut $15 billion in social 
spending. Those who will be affected are middle and lower class 
families.
<P>
	The reform proposal is a shameful attempt to reduce the 
deficit and the debt on the backs of those people. The Liberal 
government has a smile on its face while it attacks the poor, not 
poverty.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	Above all, the government is not acting as a good government 
should. A good government should be more concerned with 
today's realities, that is excessive government spending for day 
to day operations and wasteful spending due to the refusal to 
abolish overlap between different government levels.
<P>
	The reform has a very negative impact on those citizens who 
want to work and cannot find jobs and for whom there are no 
jobs. The government is creating second class unemployment 
for workers in uncertain jobs. These workers represent 40 per 
cent of the workforce. Among those uncertain jobs, many are 
cyclical and seasonal. Ask a lumberman to work when all the 
felling is done. Ask a construction worker to build when the 
work site is closed. Ask an independent worker to provide 
himself with contracts. It is ridiculous.
<P>
	These people will have to find jobs that do not exist just to 
show their good will to the Liberal government. It is totally 
ridiculous and even worse because the government won the 
election with a platform based on three words: jobs, jobs, jobs. 
Was that just wishful thinking? There are still no results. The 
Liberal government has not yet understood that people in 
precarious jobs are already subject to economic instability. They 
want to add to their stress, to their feeling of helplessness and to 
their despair.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7134"> 7134 </A></B>
<P>
	Another option is the social label. With this reform, the 
minister will impose mandatory employability measures, 
training programs and community work on the unemployed. 
What a mess! Hon. members opposite do not realize that to deal 
with structural unemployment, we have to change the structure 
of employment. The federal government should let the 
Government of Quebec set up its own manpower training 
system, and it will save money in the process by reducing 
duplication in this area.
<P>
	Let the provinces be responsible for manpower training. 
Social security reform puts groups that have already been 
severely hit on the firing line. Young people, single mothers, 
seasonal workers, workers who are fifty and over, and the 
middle-class will be hit harder than anyone else. On top of that, 
they will pay higher premiums and receive lower benefits.
<P>
	Women will be the first in line. The minister is undermining 
their financial independence, which they fought for bit by bit, 
for so many years. And it gets even worse. Is this the Liberal 
government's vision of the future? When the spouse's income 
becomes a factor that determines eligibility for unemployment 
insurance benefits? Does this mean women have the right to 
work but are not entitled to unemployment insurance if they lose 
their jobs?
<P>
	The federal government is not focusing on the real problems. 
It sharpens the differences between classes in society. The gap 
between the rich and people on middle- and low-incomes will 
get wider. Society is becoming polarized. Furthermore, the 
government is introducing cuts in transfers to the provinces for 
post-secondary education, cuts totalling several billion dollars, 
which represents about $300 million for Quebec.
<P>
	With cuts like these in post-secondary education programs, 
CEGEPs and universities will have to raise and even double 
their tuition fees. It is clear that education will become an 
impossible dream for students of modest means.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	Students from socially disadvantaged families will have a 
clear choice: either they go deep into debt or they can forget 
about higher education. Yes, the choice is clear. Only one class 
in society will be able to afford higher education: students from 
rich and wealthy families.
<P>
	To this, the Bloc Quebecois says no. We refuse to set the clock 
back twenty years. Access to higher education is everyone's 
right, a the right that students alone should be able to exercise on 
the basis of personal choice, and not on the basis of whether they 
can afford it. Students cannot afford to go into debt to get an 
education, and the minister's answer to that is unrealistic. He 
talks about using RRSPs. How can a student use an RRSP he 
does not have? The minister of course, will say he is referring to 
the parents RRSPs. Yes, but the truth is that middle-class 
parents need their RRSPs to live on during  their retirement. If 
they were able to contribute to an RRSP, it was because they 
made certain sacrifices.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is convinced the social security reform 
proposals presented by the Liberal government are merely a tool 
to strengthen Ottawa's centralist tendencies. The federal 
government is using every means at its disposal to appropriate 
the jurisdictions of the provinces and has no desire to cut 
wasteful spending and duplication.
<P>
	The Chrétien government is cutting social programs instead 
of providing for consistent and comprehensive job-centred 
policies. It wants to reform the unemployed instead of dealing 
with unemployment. It is using this reform to become more and 
more involved in areas over which the provinces have exclusive 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Has the minister not considered some legitimate budget cuts? 
It would make more sense to work on recovery of bad debts 
totalling around $6 billion. Withdrawing from areas of 
provincial jurisdiction would save another $3 billion. Tax 
reform would provide an opportunity to measure and control the 
deficit. Hundreds of millions could be recovered in the process. 
Consider family trusts. I am sure that with the approach it has 
selected to reduce the deficit and reduce the debt and foreign 
interest payments, the government is on the wrong track.
<P>
	What we need is genuine reform, genuine tax reform that will 
give us the resources we need to put the country's finances back 
on track.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again we hear about 
provincial and federal jurisdictions. Some say that the federal 
government is interfering in programs that are administered by 
Quebec.
<P>
	Friday, I read in the <I>Le Soleil</I> the Lise Bissonnette's editorial 
about the costly failure of education in Quebec. According to an 
internal report of the Commission des écoles catholiques de 
Montréal on the drop-out problem in high school, the situation 
is a real mess. Now, this is the province's jurisdiction, Mr. 
Speaker. In the same editorial, I read that 46 per cent of the 
students registered in the French sector of the CECM drop out of 
school. That is what provincial jurisdiction gives us.
<P>
	I also read that 3,000 young people, 50 per cent of whom are 
under 16, drop out of school on Montreal Island. Again, this is 
the province's jurisdiction. I also learned that in the 
disadvantaged areas of Montreal Island, eight students out of ten 
do not finish their secondary education. That study was done by 
the Commission des écoles catholiques de Montréal. I also read 
that generally speaking 35 per cent of Quebecers do not finish 
high school and that Quebec comes in one of the last among 
developed countries. I think it is time we stop hiding the truth 
and stop accusing the federal government. We have proof of 
what we say.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7135"> 7135 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	Lise Bissonnette, who writes the editorial in a famous 
nationalist newspaper, challenges the Government of Quebec to 
address the problem once and for all. We have been waiting for 
20 years to see Quebec assume its true responsibilities. It has the 
jurisdiction, let it exercise it. Now, we are told that the federal 
should transfer its powers to the province, but Quebec is not 
doing its homework.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, as a former teacher in a Quebec 
composite high school, I must say that what is being described 
as a bad education system, is not. The 46 per cent that are being 
mentioned are students who drop out because they are not 
offered appropriate courses. The people who decide on the 
curriculum are being dictated to by Ottawa, and yet, the only one 
who knows what students need in their schools is the Quebec 
government. We have to take these statistics with a grain of salt.
<P>
	If we have a 46 per cent drop-out rate, it is because we do not 
give these students the means to fulfil themselves; this will only 
happen when the Quebec government has full authority, when it 
holds the levers of power. Only then will we be able to take 
charge and give our students, girls and boys alike, all the options 
they need to fulfil themselves.
<P>
	This is sure to have an impact on unemployment rates. In an 
area like mine, in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, what is the 
use of training welders when, as we are talking, the 
unemployment rate is 16 per cent, and they are not in demand? 
We must train people in the branches for which there is a need. 
Only Quebec can pinpoint these branches.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
October 5, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
unveiled a document entitled: ``Agenda: Jobs and 
Growth-Improving Social Security in Canada''.
<P>
	First, I would like to say that this work plan is misleading, and 
that the title itself is tantamount to false representation. Of 
course, the green book deals with jobs, but to my utter 
disappointment and that of all those who read it, growth is never 
mentioned.
<P>
	It says on page 19, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Many Canadian families lost economic ground during the 1980s and early 
1990s. Overall, the average disposable household income has not grown since 
the early 1980s.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In recent years, increasing numbers of Canadians who cannot find jobs have 
turned to social assistance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, more than three million people 
depend on social assistance, and this does not include some 
960,000 workers who currently receive unemployment 
insurance. This, of course, does not include those who qualify 
neither for social assistance nor for unemployment insurance. 
This is a disgraceful and intolerable situation in a country which 
claims to have the best social security system in the world.
<P>
	When faced with such facts, how can the minister argue that 
he is talking about growth! He should have  added the word debt 
in the title. It would have read: The growth of the debt and the 
social security of the future. It would have been a much more 
accurate title for his discussion paper and for the measures he 
intends to propose.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	To me, this draft action plan is simply a monograph on the 
state of employment in this country and the incapacity of federal 
programs to answer job creation needs.
<P>
	The social security that the minister is seeking for the future 
in Canada will disappear sooner or later. This is the real agenda 
of the Minister of Human Resources Development and of the 
federal government he represents.
<P>
	I should also say that the Prime Minister's speech conceals 
the real intentions of his government. He tried to make us 
believe that he feels for those who can no longer find jobs. In a 
speech before the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, he said: 
``We do not provide Canadians with sufficient assistance to find 
jobs and to keep their jobs. They do not get enough help from us 
to acquire the knowledge and expertise that will allow them to 
compete world-wide''.
<P>
	Paradoxically, this reform proposal, apparently designed to 
help the government make its system more cost-effective, will 
bring about major cuts in UI benefits, index-linked cuts in 
provincial transfer payments for social assistance and 
substantial cuts in provincial transfer payments for 
post-secondary education.
<P>
	The Prime Minister talks about investing in our human 
resources and in learning. Why does his minister suggest that 
cuts be made in manpower training and income security 
programs then? Whom are we to believe? The Minister of 
Human Resources Development, the Prime Minister or the 
Minister of Finance, who is calling for major cuts? Which of 
them are we to believe?
<P>
	The real purpose of this social programs reform is not to 
promote job creation and learning but rather to initiate the 
Minister of Finance's budget cuts. And this means cutting 
blindly in social programs across the board.
<P>
	A secret document submitted to the federal Cabinet and 
published by the <I>Toronto Star</I> on October 5, indicated that 
another $7.5 billion in cuts over the next five years were 
contemplated, in addition to the $7.5 billion already announced 
in the last budget.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
tells us on page 23 of his paper:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><A NAME="7136"> 7136 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If further measures are required to achieve the government's deficit target, they will 
be included in the 1995 Budget.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, they could not be more explicit.
<P>
	The federal government's main objectives are clear: the first 
is literally to cut social programs and the second is to take 
control over areas of provincial jurisdiction, by maintaining a 
unilateral decision.
<P>
	From reading the green paper, I see that most of the options 
presented are centralizing. So what are the Liberal government's 
real intentions?
<P>
	First, it wants to take back large amounts from the poor and 
the middle class, then it sneaks into areas of provincial 
jurisdiction without even touching on the Canadian 
Constitution.
<P>
	We must admit that the federal Liberal government timed its 
operation well. It waited for the results of the election in Quebec 
to present its draft working plan. Moreover, the minister now 
thinks that he can delay tabling his reform until the fall of 1995.
<P>
	We now understand why the Prime Minister insists that 
Quebec hold the referendum on sovereignty within eight to ten 
months. The Prime Minister wants Quebecers to vote in the 
referendum before the social program reform is tabled.
<P>
	The minister cannot go on hiding his intentions on the pretext 
that he wants to consult the people and the provinces some more. 
What, quite frankly, has this government been doing for a year 
now but consulting and reconsulting? And without really doing 
that much, we might add.
<P>
	Since the minister showed no consideration for the first phase 
of consultation on unemployment insurance reform, why would 
it be different for his social program reform?
<P>
	We in Quebec note that the federal government's timetable is 
based mainly on political events in Quebec, which confirms our 
fear that it wants to attack the jurisdiction of Quebec and of the 
other provinces.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	As the Official Opposition party in the House of Commons, 
the Bloc Quebecois will participate in the reform consultation 
process, even though we feel that the government has already 
made its bed. Be assured, Mr. Speaker, that we will be there to 
defend Quebecers' interests. We also hope that the minister will 
have the decency to table his reform before the referendum on 
Quebec sovereignty.
<P>
	Quebecers have a right to know what the federal government 
is plotting behind this whole reform. They will not be had a 
second time like in 1980. As we all remember, to win his cause, 
Prime Minister Trudeau told the people that no meant yes, and 
we know what happened next, namely the unilateral repatriation 
of the Constitution without Quebec's consent, followed by the 
rejection of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords.
<P>
	My colleagues from Timiskaming and 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, who sit on the Standing Committee 
on Finance, have already made concrete and realistic 
suggestions for eliminating the federal deficit without touching 
social programs. These suggestions are as follows. First, 
recovering bad debts, which would bring in some $6 billion. 
Second, the federal government's complete withdrawal from 
areas of provincial jurisdiction, which would generate at least 
$3 billion. Third, reforming taxation of family trusts, which 
would bring in between $300 million and $400 million. Fourth, 
cutting subsidies to unproductive and non-competitive 
businesses, which could save $3.3 billion. Fifth, cutting the 
defence budget by $1.6 billion. Sixth, withdrawing at once from 
Hibernia, which will cost federal coffers $250 million this year. 
These are concrete measures proposed by the Official 
Opposition to help eliminate the federal deficit without 
touching social programs.
<P>
	In conclusion, this paper should have put more emphasis on 
the diversity of our labour markets and, as indicated by the polls 
commissioned by the Department of Human Resources 
Development, on the need to delegate to the provinces the 
responsibility of employment services programs as well as 
vocational training for welfare recipients.
<P>
	Instead, with its reform, the federal government persists in 
trying to reduce the deficit at the expense of the poorest and of 
the middle class. The Liberal government targets those who 
already have nothing, namely the poor. In its discussion paper, 
the government uses the word employment in an abusive way, 
for there is no mention of any job creation strategy in it. Instead 
of tackling the problems of waste, mismanagement and lack of 
jobs, the federal government now targets the unemployed and 
the middle class.
<P>
	I will end by saying that a member of Parliament also has a 
responsibility to protect the poorest in our society. We must 
represent all our fellow citizens and in particular those who are 
most often victim of prejudice or rejection: the poor, the 
unemployed, our seniors and, in particular, our young families. I 
sincerely think that this social program reform will not solve 
any of the problems which the government wants to tackle.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
September 19, in this House, I asked a question of the Minister 
of Finance.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	I stressed the fact that, according to Statistics Canada, the 
unemployment rate had risen by 0.7 per cent in August in 
Quebec and that it stood at 12.2 per cent. I said that in spite of a 
slight economic recovery and given the increase in population, 
Quebec still needed 210,000 jobs to reach its pre-recession level 
of employment.
<P>
	Therfore I asked the Minister why did he not decide to create 
jobs by proposing concrete measures?
<P>
	That was in September. We are now at the end of October and I 
must say that unemployment in Quebec is still at 12.2 per cent 
and the minister replied that 77,000 jobs had been created since 
the beginning of the year. These figures must be adjusted 
downwards because 28,000 jobs were lost last month, and 4,000 
the month before.
<P>
	This means that, despite the recovery, and despite the fact that 
the economic situation of Quebec may seem bright, it does not 
make any difference for the workers. Unemployment is still 
officially at 12.2 per cent and there are no forthcoming 
government initiatives that might help Quebec get out of this 
difficult situation.
<P>
	I also asked the Minister of Finance when he would be 
reducing the UI premiums in order to lighten the burden of 
small- and medium-sized companies? When? The opposition 
has been denouncing the increase in UI premiums for over a year 
now.
<P>
	The minister said it was an excellent question and that he was 
going to, but he did not. I will ask him again, and we will keep 
asking, even more so because he makes Quebec and Quebecers 
pay a high price in the first phase of the unemployment 
insurance reform. Billions, we now know it, billions have been 
accumulating in the unemployment insurance fund. The 
minister, contrary to what he says, contrary to what we can read 
in the green book, does not care about job creation, in Quebec at 
least, since he seems satisfied with the present situation.
<P>
	I can only repeat my question: When is he going to lower 
unemployment insurance premiums? We cannot accept any 
other answer than an agreement to lower them now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the member pointed out, 
employment in Quebec continues to be below its pre-recession 
peak. This is an unacceptable situation, which this government 
intends to correct.
<P>
	The weak employment situation in the province reflects the 
loss of 135,000 jobs and the rise in the unemployment rate of 
more than four percentage points in the three and a half years 
prior to the election of this government.
<P>
	In less than a year since this government was elected, over 
half that loss has been recovered. From October 1993 to 
September 1994, full-time employment has increased by 
102,000 in Quebec and the unemployment rate has fallen a full 
percentage point, from 13.2 per cent to 12.2 per cent).
<P>
	At this rate Quebec will reach its pre-recession peak in seven 
months. The recent strong employment growth in Quebec and 
across Canada has been helped by this government's freezing of 
the UI premiums below the required statutory rate in 1994; and 
the implementation of the $6 billion Federal Infrastructure 
Program to encourage capital expenditures.
<P>
	Employment growth will be further helped by a rollback in the 
UI premium rate in 1995, as announced in the 1994 Budget.
<P>
	The changes in the UI program announced in the last budget 
and the additional changes which will result from Minister 
Axworthy's social security reform will allow further reduction 
in UI premiums in the future. Because of lower payroll taxes, 
businesses in Quebec will find it easier to create jobs.
<P>
	We have reasons to be optimistic that employment growth 
will continue. Employment growth in the past two quarters has 
been the strongest in more than five years.
<P>
	Furthermore, growth in the economy is gaining momentum. 
In the second quarter, the real GDP grew 6.4 per cent (annual 
rate), up strongly from about four per cent in the previous two 
quarters and in 1993 as a whole.
<P>
	All sectors of the economy are now contributing to and 
reinforcing the growth in employment. Surging exports led to a 
record real trade surplus in July. Strong growth in current and 
planned investments in non-residential construction indicates 
firms are beginning to expand their production capacity, which 
will require more employees.
<P>
	Improving employment prospects have boosted consumer 
confidence and consumer spending.
<P>
	However, for Quebec to share fully in the strong employment 
growth outlook for the Canadian economy as a whole, the 
political uncertainty about Quebec's future within Canada needs 
to be resolved.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted.
<P>
	Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.53 p.m.)
<P>
