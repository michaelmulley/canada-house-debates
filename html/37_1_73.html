the important pieces of legislation before the House prior to the

the government to work together to provide strong federal 
protection for endangered species.

pass the strongest endangered species legislation ever.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I took part in the very first of these runs four years ago, 
hardly anyone talked about prostate cancer.  However times have 
changed and no one is hiding the fact that four members of the 
House have had prostate surgery in the last nine months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this year's run many members of the House have already 
sponsored me with $20, $50 and even $250 donations, but there is 
still time to contribute.  Last year the run organizers were able 
to announce that MPs of Canada in all parties had contributed the 
single largest lump sum in aid of the run for prostate cancer 
research.  We need to lead by example and do it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mark your calendar on June 24, Mr. Speaker, and send me your 
cheque.  Mark your calendar as well on October 30, which will be 
PSA day on the Hill when you can have your PSA test for prostate 
cancer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today 
is the third annual Clean Air Day, a time to increase public 
awareness and action on cleaning the air we breathe and on 
climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time the government of Nova Scotia has embarked on a 
public review of the province's energy strategy.  We have long 
known about the links between our use of fossil fuels, our health 
and our environment.  Today with newer and better technologies we 
are seeking cleaner, more efficient means of heating our homes 
and uses for alternative energy sources to power the world around 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Partnerships must be fostered between governments and private 
industry to develop and expand our use of environmentally cleaner 
energy sources to reduce our dependency on traditional, 
non-renewable energy sources.  I encourage all Nova Scotians to 
get involved in the review process as it impacts on the daily 
lives of each and every one of us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Irwin Cotler (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
establishment of Raoul Wallenberg Day recognizes this lost hero 
of the Holocaust, this Saint-Just of the nations, whom the UN 
characterized as the greatest humanitarian of the 20th century 
for having saved more people in the second world war than almost 
any government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an historic initiative that will have enduring resonance. 
We will be recognizing, teaching and inspiring Canadians about 
the unparalleled and unprecedented heroism of Canada's only 
honorary citizen who, in his singular protection of civilians in 
armed conflict, signified the best of international humanitarian 
law; who, in his singular organization of humanitarian relief, 
exemplified the best of humanitarian intervention; who, in his 
warning to Nazi generals that they would be held accountable for 
their crimes, foreshadowed the Nuremberg principles; who, in 
saving 100,000 Jews, personified the Talmudic idiom that if a 
person saves a single life it is as if he saved an entire 
universe; and who, in having the courage to care and the 
commitment to act, showed that one person can make a difference, 
that one person can confront radical evil, prevail and transform 
history.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this 
past weekend in Montreal I had the pleasure of participating in 
the Inclusion by Design conference of the Canadian Council on 
Rehabilitation and Work.  The conference coincided with access 
week from May 27 to June 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of this progressive international event was to focus on 
planning for a barrier free world, one that would include all 
people regardless of ability and encourage universal policies 
both within government and in the community at large.  This 
vision of inclusion is shared by the subcommittee on the status 
of persons with disabilities.  As chair it is my hope that the 
declarations developed over the weekend will be implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development reaffirmed the 
federal government's commitment to ensure that Canadians with 
disabilities get the supports they need to participate fully in 
society.  The minister stated that we need to focus on 
understanding the labour market and the challenge it presents to 
Canadians with disabilities.  We must recognize that universal 
access is fundamentally about human rights and social justice.

of serving our country because our ancestors fought to make it 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifty-seven years ago today on D-Day 14,000 Canadians were 
fighting, many dying, on the beaches of Normandy.  The soldiers 
were mostly kids the ages of my three sons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>D-Day has often been called the beginning of the end of World 
War II.  Despite seemingly insurmountable obstacles our soldiers 
fought on bravely.  By day's end Canadian troops had progressed 
further inland than any of our allies.  If Canada became a nation 
at Vimy Ridge we reinforced it on D-Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country has a long and proud military history which has 
helped purchase our freedom.  Today I thank our veterans not only 
for their service and sacrifice but for ensuring I do not have to 
send my sons to war.

culture.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton—Victoria—Brock, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today is the 57th anniversary of D-Day.  Fifty-seven 
years ago allied and Canadian troops established a bridgehead in 
France which would lead to the liberation of northwestern Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to imagine the conditions our troops faced as 
they disembarked on the German occupied beaches of Normandy. 
Laden with equipment, some were dropped off in water that went 
over their heads.  They were greeted on the shores by enemy 
artillery, machine guns, barbed wire and mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the landings were a success more than 1,000 
Canadians were killed or wounded on D-Day.  By the end of August 
when the allies had succeeded in breaking out of Normandy, Canada 
had suffered more than 18,000 casualties of whom 5,000 lost their 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we take the opportunity to pay tribute to the great 
courage and devotion of our troops in that campaign.  Let us 
never forget.

and disarming police officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these issues deserve consideration in and of themselves, but 
the Liberal government lumped all together is suggesting that it

Bill C-15 deals with amendments to the criminal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would simply ask members of the official opposition is 
why, if they are so keenly interested in the legislation, they do

this bill have been sitting around this place for better than two

on him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell the hon. member for Joliette that I would

the texts will be out of date before we get them?  As long as

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Canadian government always respects its 
negotiating partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for the great success of Canadian diplomacy 
throughout the world is precisely the respect Canada has for the 
partners with which it is involved.  That is how international 
diplomacy works, respecting one's partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We too are impatient to see the texts made public, but we are 
going to respect Brazil and others, whose wish it is to have the 
texts available in all four languages.  We are not going to be 
pushed into disrespecting our partners by any partisan 
impatience from the Bloc Quebecois.

suffering in the former Soviet Union;

With regard to the causes of mortality of mature wild Atlantic 
salmon in the Atlantic Ocean: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) Canada does not have programs in place currently to research 
these causes. Expenditures on Atlantic salmon assessment have 
concentrated on monitoring of returns to freshwater and on 
production from freshwater. Canada did however host an 
international meeting of scientists last June in Halifax to 
outline the research program that should be undertaken to 
research the causes of marine mortality.  Some of the potential 
factors affecting marine mortality are reduced smolt quality, 
freshwater effects; adverse estuarine conditions; increased 
predation in the marine environment; and changes in ocean 
migration patterns. A 
number of these factors may be linked to changes in climate 
and/or oceanographic conditions. A research program to address 
these items will be long term and expensive and it will be 
supported as funds permit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) There are no funds available to support research into this 
issue at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) The North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization, NASCO, 
has agreed to develop ideas for a five year, internationally 
co-ordinated research program to identify and explain the causes 
of increased salmon mortality at sea and to develop measures to 
counteract the problem. Canada has already played a role in this 
initiative by working with other countries in the sharing and 
dissemination of scientific information, and it will be further 
discussed with the other NASCO parties in June 2001 at NASCO's 
annual meeting.

the amendment should receive the support of all members.

Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is the first opportunity I 
have had to speak to the bill in committee of the whole.  I take 
the opportunity to comment on what is no doubt a very symbolic 
amendment by the hon. member, my vis-à-vis in the Conservative 
Party, the House leader of the Conservative Party.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the amendment he is offering to the committee of the 
whole is well intentioned, but I profoundly disagree with it for 
a number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is not at all part of the recommendations of the 
Lumley report.  The Lumley commission and the commissions we have 
established following every election have never operated that 
way.  We have had recommendations in the past about dealing with 
the state of parliament as it exists.  Comparisons made in the 
Lumley report with the private sector, the public sector, the 
inflation rate and everything else, and I am looking at table 3.1 
on page 12 of the report, refer to conditions as they are now. 
The scales are adjusted to the level we have at present and no 
other level.  Therefore, it would be inappropriate to consider an 
amendment of this kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member proposed that we not vote an amendment to the 
compensation package that applies now.  He said it would somehow 
not be appropriate.  I believe the words conflict of interest 
were used.  He said such an offering would be somehow better if 
it applied to a future parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I profoundly disagree.  I have always stood up for the rights 
and privileges of members of the House.  I did so when it was 
somewhat more popular than it is now.  I also did so when it was 
far less popular.  I remember some pension issues several years 
ago when the fashionable thing was to say how much of a pay cut 
we should all take.  I refused to participate in anything of that 
nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have taken the position that if I am not worth the salary, my 
constituents will surely replace me with someone who is.  That is 
why I disagree with the proposition.  Debasing the currency is in 
no way helpful for any of us in the House or indeed for the high 
office we all hold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is not proposing to reduce the salary, so I will 
not overstate what he said.  However on the business of applying 
it to a future parliament, that would make someone else 
accountable four years from now for the decision we make today. 
That is not correct either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members are free to agree or disagree with that proposition but 
it is one I believe in very firmly.  I will make my decisions 
today.  I will stand out there in front of the microphones or 
whomever and defend the decisions I have made.  I will defend 
them before my constituents this weekend and so on because they 
are the decisions I made.  I will not say that I made the 
decisions now and whoever is here four years from now can judge 
them.  That would not be right.  As a matter of principle it is 
wrong.  I recognize that other people might feel differently 
about it but I do not.  That is the right way of doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, if we create that kind of condition what will occur 
four years from now?  There will be a huge debate as to whether 
the previously voted increase should be knocked down by whoever 
may start a form of surenchère about the issue again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is no way to legislate.  We do not legislate anything else 
that way and we should not legislate this matter that way.  We 
should legislate it in a proper and responsible way.  We are 
doing what the Lumley commission asked us to do.  We are 
offering, by way of this clause, to put it in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government therefore cannot support the amendment put 
forward by the hon. House leader of the Conservative Party.  As I 
said, I am sure it is well-intentioned and properly put and so 
on.  However I fundamentally disagree that it should be done and 
I cannot support the amendment for all the reasons I have just 
enunciated.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Chairman, I would like to rise in support of the amendment 
put forward by the House leader for the Progressive Conservative 
Party.  I am at a bit of a disadvantage because we have not yet 
received the amendments and I understood that in fact my House 
leader would be putting forward a similar or identical amendment 
to delay the effect of the bill until after the next election, 
into the next parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just respond briefly to the hon. government House leader. 
First he suggests that to delay the effect of this bill until 
after the next election would be inconsistent with the 
recommendations of the independent Lumley commission.  How 
disingenuous, coming from the very same government House leader 
who has ignored the recommendation in that report for the 
beginning point of April of this year for the effect of this 
legislation and has dialled this back so that it is retroactively 
covered as of January.  Talking about an unprecedented way of 
doing legislation, to begin to impose pay increases retroactive 
to six months before the bill is even considered is highly 
unconventional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point to a very ancient rule of this place and, I 
think, of our mother parliament, which is that we as members 
ought to absent ourselves from voting on matters in which we have 
a direct pecuniary interest.  I refer the Chair to Standing Order 
21 which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No Member is entitled to vote upon any question in which he or 
she has a direct pecuniary interest, and the vote of any Member 
so interested will be disallowed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This rule has been in place since Confederation.  The government 
House leader will no doubt argue that it is trumped by the 
precedent whereby parliament does in fact, through the 
appropriation power, approve its own pay.  However it does not 
have to be this way.  We do not have to continue to put ourselves 
in this conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer the government House leader to the fact that several 
years ago the congress of the United States, finding itself in 
precisely the same sort of conflict of interest, managed to 
elicit sufficient support to pass a constitutional amendment 
requiring that any potential pay increases in the U.S. congress 
would not come into effect until following an election.  Why? 
Precisely because it would take the congresspersons, and in our 
case parliamentarians, out of this untenable conflict of interest 
and would allow the voters, upon whom we impose taxes to pay for 
these salaries, to determine whether or not they are appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment reflects the policy of my party.  It ought not to 
be a partisan issue, though, and all members should see this as a 
elegant way in which we can extricate ourselves from this 
untenable conflict of interest in which we find ourselves in 
every parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one last point.  The government House leader says that 
this would become an issue in the next election or after the 
election.  The point is this:  I do not think a single member of 
the House campaigned on a 20% pay increase.  I do not think a 
single member raised, in a piece of election literature or an 
election speech or a visit to a constituent, the notion that one 
of the priority pieces of the business of the House would be an 
increase in compensation for members of parliament.  This was not 
considered by the public when they gave the House a mandate.  If 
we delay this pay increase as this amendment would seek to do it 
would allow Canadians, the people who pay the bills, to make a 
final determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that as sensible people Canadians will make the right 
decision.  They will look at the independent commission and say 
that most of those recommendations are sensible.  We can trust 
Canadians to make the right decision in an election and the next 
parliament to respect that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak in favour of this amendment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my party is 
against such an amendment, but supports the bill and the 
government initiative for a number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, this amendment was brought forward because of a potential 
conflict of interest. My colleague from the Progressive 
Conservative Party and the member for the Canadian Alliance have 
supported this proposal. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT23"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT23"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1550

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think a mistake is being made here, because this bill is the 
logical follow-up to the process that got underway when the act 
respecting the compensation of the elected members of this House 
was passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lawmakers decided that, after each parliament, an objective 
committee of experts would review the whole issue of 
compensation. Each time there is an election, this is done. Too 
often, lawmakers, lacking courage and unable to explain to their 
fellow citizens how things really are, have put aside reports 
that had been paid for, reports that established, based on 
objective parameters, what the decent salary of a 
parliamentarian, of a minister and of the prime minister should 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is about following up on a report based on a high quality 
study that was done by people who are totally above reproach 
with regard to the conflict of interest issue, knowledgeable 
people who can be objective, people who have such wisdom that we 
in parliament should agree that their recommendations have to be 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, there is certainly no conflict of interest in doing 
what the law says and following a process that was established 
by previous parliaments. I take absolutely no shame in taking 
part in the proper application of an act. Clause 1 states that 
the prime minister's salary should be equal to that of the chief 
justice of the supreme court. I tested the idea in the riding of 
Roberval, Quebec, which is not a rich riding. I met dozens of 
people, some of whom upbraided me, saying “You MPs will be 
voting yourselves a raise; you are going to have huge salaries”. 
I checked, and then I asked each of them “Are you opposed to the 
Prime Minister of Canada earning the same as the chief justice 
of the supreme court?  After all, the Prime Minister is the one 
who appoints the chief justice and, in my view, the 
responsibilities of the Prime Minister are greater and have more 
of an impact on the citizens of this country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They all told me “Well, no, we thought that the Prime Minister 
earned more than the chief justice”.  All citizens know in their 
heart of hearts that there is one basic principle: if 
politicians had not been cowardly in the past, if politicians 
had had the courage to treat themselves as they treat the 
public, if politicians had had the courage to respect certain 
principles, the Prime Minister of Canada would never have earned 
less than the chief justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, ministers should earn more than their deputies. 
When I asked people in the riding of Roberval “Do you think it 
is right that a minister, who is responsible for a department, 
who has no job security, who is accountable day in and day out 
for his department, should earn less than his employees who are 
deputy ministers and assistant deputy ministers?”, everyone 
answered that this made no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a place for common sense in legislation, and I think 
that this bill adopts principles to which we cannot object.  The 
only reason for refusing to have anything to do with such a bill 
is lack of courage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House something: I do not think that anyone here 
is interested in going down in history over a question of salary. 
But everybody would like to leave this parliament with his or 
her head held high, saying “When the time came to make 
decisions, even the most politically difficult ones—by which I 
mean the ones that concern us personally—I had the courage to 
make them, and I made them with my head held high.  I confronted 
public opinion and I cannot be faulted in any way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will recall a lot of demagoguery in the recent past 
around salaries, benefits and pension plans.  We all know what 
the outcome was at the polls.  I am convinced that the people of 
Roberval will respect me and my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois, because we had the courage to speak up and uphold the 
principles in which we believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the government, and we will be opposing the 
amendment, and all amendments, coming from certain opposition 
parties. 
We are not trying to score political points with MPs' salaries. 
It is too important an issue, and if our predecessors had shown 
more courage, we would not be where we are today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Chairman, I have just a brief comment on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not support this amendment.  We feel that the time to deal 
with this is now.  I think we have an obligation to reflect on 
what the actual consequences of passing this amendment would be. 
They would be that we would have a debate for the next three and 
a half years about this salary package.  I do not think that 
would be particularly healthy for the political process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that this kind of thing was done just before an election 
and I think that is what this kind of measure was at one point 
intended for.  It would make more sense to do it just before an 
election so that we would not have a three and a half year period 
in which all of the vicissitudes of politics could enter into the 
debate.  I think it would be ill advised if it passed at this 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would just like to say for the hon. member who said 
this would give constituents a chance to pass judgment that it 
would not really.  They would just get a chance to pass judgment 
on who would get the new salary.  They would not get a chance to 
pass judgment on whether or not that salary would be paid, so it 
is a bit of an illusion to suggest that somehow voters would get 
to render a decision on whether or not the salary package would 
be accepted.  All they would be able to decide is who would 
receive the salary, not whether or not that was what would be 
paid. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Chairman, I have several points of clarification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too support the amendment to make this effective after the 
next election, but more important, I have some questions on what 
the government House leader suggested are adjustments to salary 
and so on and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the provision that basically every member of parliament 
would have to opt in to this.  Would the government House leader 
or staff mind providing us with what the actual salary would be 
if members did not opt in?  Would it be $69,100 or $109,500? That 
is the first question.  Second, what would be the percentage of 
pension based on that?  Would it be 4% or 3% on whichever dollar 
value?  Third, would the non-taxable benefit still exist? I 
suppose you could answer that by saying whether or not it was 
$69,000 or $109,500.  Last, I understand that the original 
recommended effective date of this was April 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all I need.  In other words, if members do not opt in, 
what is their status and where will they go from there? 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, I will try to answer the 
several questions that have been asked.  Arguably not all of them 
were on clause 1, but nonetheless I think they are of 
considerable interest to members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue that some hon. members raise as to what they 
believe to be an April 1 retroactivity clause in this, it is not 
in the report.  Perhaps the mistake, if I can call it that, has 
occurred by some misreading that Bill C-12 will come into force 
retroactive to April 1.  Maybe that is where it comes from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of why the date of January 1 was utilized for this 
bill, hon. members who were here last time, particularly those 
who were in House leadership positions and so on, will recall 
that the last bill took effect the date of the election prior. 
That is the way it was done before.  We could have done exactly 
the same thing this time.  That would have made it retroactive to 
November 27.  It would have given retroactivity of one more month 
but would have essentially meant adjusting everybody's tax 
returns for last year. 
I felt it would be quite a burden, given the small change that it 
would make.  In fact, the tradition would have meant to back it 
up further, not less than what it is now.  That is the reason for 
that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I am using the last question first because I did not note 
and I am only going from memory.  How does the bill apply to 
someone who does not opt in?  I will preface my remarks by saying 
that I hope everyone does opt in, even those who feel obligated 
for whatever reason to vote against the bill, although I hope 
there are no one does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that yesterday, I said in media reports and I repeat it 
again before my colleagues, because I think it is an important 
consideration.  The new bill would not apply for people who did 
not opt in. In other words, they would remain at where they are 
now: the old cost of indexation formula, the old salary 
structure, the old tax free portion, the old accrual rate and 
everything that exists now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  So two systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Yes, if people do not elect the new 
system, they will have the old system, as the right hon. member 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Two classes.  Two systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  With respect, Mr. Chairman, I do not 
think it is appropriate for us to start provoking each other on 
this.  I do not think it is helpful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I hope everyone opts in.  If that occurs, there will not 
be a group of people who will have opted out.  The people here 
are adults and they can do that even though I do not think they 
should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from Calgary started with the remark that it was 
disingenuous of me to have made my previous response.  I will let 
colleagues judge on the appropriateness of this.  He alleges that 
the standing orders somehow put us in a conflict of interest if 
we vote on the bill.  The hon. member has now been here for some 
time and he knows that what he said is not correct.  He knows 
that what the rules reference private bills, the incorporation of 
companies and so on in which members have private interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speakers have ruled from time immemorial that our voting on 
estimates, supply and everything else that gives us our salary 
does not form part of that.  We all know that around here.  The 
hon. member I am sure knows that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that we should extricate ourselves from the 
process.  That is exactly what the recommendation of the Lumley 
Commission wants us to do, and that is exactly what the action of 
voting for this bill would create. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could argue with the argument presented by the hon. member to 
the nth degree to show how inappropriate it was.  In fact the 
mere act of extricating ourselves for another process would 
constitute a conflict of interest under the rules he has just 
enunciated.  That is why he cannot use that argument.  Yes, I am 
in favour of using objective measures in the future that would 
make it such that these kinds of votes and debates would become 
unnecessary.  Mr. Lumley spoke extensively about that.  However 
our initiating that process, or our voting on the bill today and 
all of these measures do not constitute a conflict of interest. 
That is not correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  With respect, Mr. Chairman, it is a 
ridiculous position to put the House of Commons in with two 
pensions.  That is ridiculous.

The government House leader in rejecting the amendment said that 
he could not possibly support it because it would put off the 
enactment of the law until after the election.  It would do 
something that had not been done before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the government House leader whether there 
has ever in legislation before been an opt in clause? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Unprecedented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit:</B>  It is unprecedented, Mr. Chairman, and I 
would like the House leader to respond to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  I wonder if I might ask member for Lakeland 
to repeat his question please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit:</B>  Mr. Chairman, the question is in regard 
to a comment made by the House leader in explaining why he had to 
reject the amendment which would put off the implementation of 
the pay increase until after the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In rejecting it he said it had not been done before and the 
precedent was not there.  I want to ask the government House 
leader whether the precedent is there for putting in place an opt 
in clause for legislation?  I have never heard of a piece of 
legislation before which requires an opt in clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is a common thing, something that has been done, then I 
want to opt in to our supply day motion which would reduce taxes 
dramatically.  I want in on that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I will gladly answer that.  I 
do not know if the member was here between 1993 and 1997.  I 
think he was elected in 1993.  I am surprised he would not recall 
that there was an opt in provision— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  An opt out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  No, opt in, is the exact terminology. 
All members were deemed to be opted out of the pension plan. Each 
one of them had to sign to opt back in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Pallister:</B>  Two wrongs do not make a right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  The hon. member says two wrongs do not 
make a right.  It was not me who asked for that clause.  I 
remember those who asked for that particular provision to exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Pallister:</B>  Do you give us everything we ask for 
over here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Those provisions were asked for.

through the Chair, otherwise we will not facilitate the debate we 
are engaged in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  In addition, I am asked are there any 
other opting in provisions?  Hon. members may not want to 
consider that example.  I recognize that perhaps it was not the 
best example, and members felt compelled at the time to ask for 
this for whatever reason and so on.  It was a tough one, and I 
remember it.  However there are other examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the Public Service Superannuation Act has opt in 
provisions.  The Canadian Forces Superannuation Act has opt in 
provisions, and I notice the member is listening attentively, and 
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act also has opt 
in provisions for the beneficiary of the particular emoluments in 
question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Mr. Chairman, 
let me deal first of all with the Lumley report.  It is a report, 
a recommendation to us.  It is not a direction to the House.  It 
does not absolve the House of its responsibility to take its own 
decisions.  The government and members of the House cannot hide 
behind a report.  It is nothing more than a report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question that was raised by my colleague from Calgary

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is saying that it cannot depart from the 
Lumley report on other matters, then it is inconsistent in 
pretending that on a question where the Lumley report is silent, 
as it is silent on this issue of retroactivity, the government 
can reward members of parliament for service already performed by 
adding extra income to each one of us.  That is simply wrong.  It 
is illogical.  It cannot be defended in the context of the report 
and it certainly, if I may return to the question of the Lumley 
report generally, the Lumley report in any event is only a report 
to the House.  It is not a directive that binds us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The dilemma we face and are trying to address with this 
particular amendment has nothing to do with the level of 
compensation.  That is, as everyone knows, a very real problem. 
We are dealing however with a much more serious issue, which has 
to do with the sense so alive in the Canadian public that this is 
an institution with the primary interest of serving its own 
interests.  To take the a very current matter, this is an 
institution that puts the interests of the pay of members of 
parliament ahead of the safety of children who might be assaulted 
by activities on the Internet.  That is the concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is not about the level of contribution.  The issue is 
about the degree to which we can win back respect for the House 
of Commons.  The way to avoid the impression of being 
self-serving is to say that what we pass will not apply to us, 
that the pay raise we authorize will not apply to us.  It will 
not apply until a later parliament.  It is a very simple 
principle.  It is a very strong principle.  We should not be 
self-serving in the House.  If we want to deal with and combat 
the cynicism alive in the land then we have to find a way in 
which we stop this image instead of reinforcing the image of 
being a self-serving institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point is that surely there should be a practice here 
that when we go to the electorate we should be honest with the 
people who vote for us.  The government House leader did not talk 
in the last campaign about the salary increase.  He did not, nor 
did I, nor did any one of us indicate that one of the first 
things we would do in the first six months we were back would be 
to enrich ourselves through the salary payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be honest with the people of the country.  To do it 
this way by bringing in a bill like this so early, giving it such 
priority and trying to sneak it through at the end of a session, 
simply undermines the kind of respect that can be won for a House 
of Commons of this kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was rather surprised by my colleague and friend, the hon. 
member for Winnipeg—Transcona, who expressed his concern that 
there would be debate at the next election campaign.  I recall an 
instance some years ago in which a party leader suggested that 
election campaigns were not the place to debate national issues. 
I did not think that was right then and I do not think it is 
right now.  Obviously these issues should be debated in election 
campaigns.  We should not resort to devices that would deny the 
opportunity for the people of Canada to debate issues which they 
consider to be of importance to them. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to come back for a few moments to the matter of 
conflict of interest.  I agree there is no conflict of interest 
in the strict meaning of the word, but as far as an apparent 
conflict of interest is concerned, there is certainly that.  The 
election was in November.  Now we are in June.  Six months after 
the election, one of the first actions of this parliament is to 
give us way more money.  This is guaranteed to be perceived as a 
major conflict of interest. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very real problem we all face is the country's cynicism 
about public life.  Why is that?  Because our actions earn 
cynicism.  The action of moving forward now on a salary increase 
as one of the first priorities of parliament will bound to be 
seen with cynicism.  Is there a way to protect against it?  Yes 
there is. The way to protect against it is to adopt the amendment 
proposed by my colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, 
which would ensure that we in this parliament do not profit from 
the salary increase, only parliamentarians in subsequent Houses 
would profit from that increase.

I fail to understand the member's logic.  I feel that the member 
is speaking from an advantaged position.  There are many of us in 
the House, and I would include myself as one, who are speaking 
from an advantaged position.  I respect the member's position as 
the leader of the party.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader has a remuneration package, and I respect that 
package, that is in a different category than those of most other 
MPs and backbenchers in the House of Commons.  I say 
respectfully, Mr. Chairman, through you to the member, that he 
should have that package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been saying in the <I>Hill Times</I> for three or four 
years, as the right hon. member knows, that I think members of 
parliament are not properly remunerated.  My constituents know 
it.  I have said it publicly.  I come from the private sector and 
quite frankly I am advantaged too.  I say to the hon. member that 
there are many in the House who have families and who do not have 
the advantage the right hon. member has.  The amount is 
irrelevant, whatever the advantage.  I am not pointing to the 
amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am making is that I do not think people in the House 
who are advantaged have any right to lead the way for those in 
the House who have economic challenges to meet in order to feed 
their children and put them through university and to pay their 
mortgages.  I cannot identify a member in the House who would 
not, if he or she could, through the joy of working in the House, 
work for nothing.  For the right hon. leader to single out that 
by having a proper remuneration we are not doing any other public 
policy initiatives I find a bit unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I will be very brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I want to point out that there are some part time nurses 
in the country who are earning less than $20,000 a year as their 
total salary, less than the income here.  Yes, I am advantaged. 
Yes, the hon. member is advantaged.  Yes, members of parliament 
who had investments in golf courses are advantaged.  Of course 
there are advantages, but that is not the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here is this:  should parliament confer advantages on 
itself?  That is the issue.  What this proposal would do is say 
no, we do not confer advantages on ourselves, we establish a 
regime that will not apply until after there has been an 
election.  That is the principle.  I think the hon. member can 
understand it.  It should be enshrined in the legislation of a 
parliament that respects its reputation, as much as we all should 
be defending and respecting the reputation of this parliament in 
a cynical age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. 
Chairman, my question is for the right hon. member.  I generally 
pass up opportunities to contribute to cynicism about politics 
because I do not think it does anyone any good, but I have a long 
memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was here in 1981 when the right hon. member and his party 
voted for a pay increase that was retroactive.  That was in the 
first year of the parliament and I do not remember any speeches 
like this at the time.  There were only 10 people who voted 
against that raise and pension plan at that time.  I was one of 
them, so I remember the debate very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the right hon. gentleman could explain to us the 
difference between the position he took then and the position he 
takes now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I remember those 
circumstances very well and I remember the reaction that was 
ignited in the country.  There was a substantial decline in 
respect for this institution, in part as a result of the sense 
that we had been self-serving as a country. What we should do in 
this parliament is learn from past experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public holds parliament on a short leash.  The growth of 
cynicism in this parliament is one of the most serious issues we 
face.  There is no doubt that action on pay contributed to that 
cynicism then and action on pay will contribute to that cynicism 
now unless we adopt the motion that has been brought forward by 
my colleague, which will say that this parliament has the 
determination and the foresight not to profit from its own acts. 
That is why we are proposing this amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard—La Prairie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
did not intend to speak, but I cannot remain indifferent to the 
comments by the right hon. leader of the Progressive Conservative 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When, over the weekend, I spoke in my riding about the increase 
in members' salaries, reaction was, naturally, a bit tongue in 
cheek at times, that is to be expected, but generally the people 
in my riding understand very well that our work deserves 
recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in the riding also understood very clearly that it 
was not our intention to underestimate or overestimate our work, 
and, that to avoid doing so, we asked a commission for 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider these recommendations, matters of this 
importance, and I see someone with the experience of the leader 
of the Progressive Conservative Party trotting out rhetoric, 
putting the protection of child safety in the balance, when I 
hear him making digs about owners of golf courses and raising all 
sorts of questions about honesty, I cannot remain indifferent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Honesty involves assuming one's responsibilities when one must 
and not making contradictions such as we have just seen.  How can 
a person argue that there had to be a debate during the election 
campaign when their colleague is prepared to make a decision now 
on condition it be binding for those who come after?  He has no 
interest in an election debate.  He is interested in rhetoric. 
That is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go on any longer on the subject. One thing is 
certain.  Up to now, prior to the intervention by the right hon. 
leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, the level of 
debates around this table was excellent.  I would like to go back 
to that debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Chairman, I will try to be brief because 
obviously a lot of my colleagues want to join in the debate.  As 
the member for Elk Island indicated, there are a number of 
amendments that we would like to get to and have people speak to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a couple of points for the hon. government House 
leader who spoke earlier in defence of the legislation.  First, 
he said, and I believe I would be quoting fairly accurately, that 
he hopes everyone will opt in and he hopes no one will vote 
against the legislation.  With all due respect, I think there 
will be a number of people who will vote against it, perhaps not 
because they do not agree with different parts of the legislation 
but because they certainly disagree with the process through 
which this is arrived at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the general public understands that a 
number of people have great difficulty with this process whereby, 
as a number of people have indicated, we debate, decide on and 
rush through a bill concerning our own remuneration.  I fully 
expect, with all due respect, that some people will 
be voting against the process, against what we view as a very 
seriously flawed process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I want to briefly address the opt in clause.  In 
responding to the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford, the House 
leader said something to the effect that if an individual does 
not opt in basically the entire existing remuneration package 
will stay in place for that member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that the government would proceed with 
something that would create an administrative and logistical 
nightmare for the people who govern and administer the wage and 
benefit packages for members of parliament.  I cannot believe 
that we would put something in place that would affect not only 
our wages but our pensions and the rate they accrue at and in 
which some people would still have a tax free allowance and other 
people would not.  To have individual situations of that nature 
is absolutely ludicrous.  I think the general public needs to be 
aware of that.  It really calls into question why the government 
would have an opt in clause like this for something as 
fundamentally altering as legislation dealing not only with wages 
but with pensions and other benefits.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the issue of this amendment, I certainly support the 
intent of it so that it only applies after the next election, 
such that, as a number of the Progressive Conservatives who put 
this forward have indicated, we would not be dealing with stuff 
for our own benefit unless we actually run in the next election 
and are re-elected.  There would be an understanding among the 
general public that this would apply at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would question the right hon. member who just spoke.  He 
should have had those types of concerns when he was a high 
profile cabinet minister with the Mulroney government.  He could 
have changed it then.  If he is so fundamentally opposed to the 
process, let me say that it could have been changed then, as it 
can be changed now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely ridiculous that the Prime Minister defends this 
by saying this is the way it has always been done and therefore 
it always has to be done that way.  As the right hon. gentleman 
said, and I agree with him on this point, there is nothing 
preventing us from changing this.  At this time we are a law unto 
ourselves, especially in dealing with issues that benefit 
ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a last point I would like to make, and then I will turn 
this over to colleagues who also want to address the bill.  I 
would direct this to the government House leader.  We have a 
different government than we did a year ago, but it is basically 
the same administration.  I think most people understand that.  A 
year ago we dealt with the pension and remuneration package put 
forward and the government sought to end the opt out or, in other 
words, to have everyone in the plan.  I assume that was because 
it saw the error in having multiple different schemes for 
different MPs, with some in and some out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the reality is that we are perpetuating that error in 
judgment by having another situation whereby we could have MPs 
treated differently in regard to whether they opt in or stay out. 
Why was there a different rule last year where everyone was 
forced back into the pension plan in order to try to have 
uniformity when we now have a plan with all these people who 
could opt out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Chairman, in the last point raised by the 
hon. member he asked why the government forced—I think that is 
the word he used—people to come back into the pension plan a 
year ago.  There were discussions that went on between people at 
that time.  I said at the time— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  I remember you wearing the pigs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  Order, please.  We have approximately two 
minutes left in clause 1.  The Chair and the vast majority of 
members are interested in the final comments in this debate and I 
would hope those who are taking freely of their time to go across 
the floor to one another will not be seeking the floor at a later 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Chairman, there were commitments 
made a little over a year ago to colleagues on both sides of the 
House which I said I would never breach and I will not. 
Notwithstanding the provocation, I will not breach those 
commitments.  I live by the word I make.  Even today, 
notwithstanding what is being said, I will not breach the 
commitment that I made to colleagues in the House.  I will leave 
it at that on the score of this particular issue.  The hon. 
member knows perfectly well to what I am referring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the acceptability of the amendment, I do not believe 
this amendment makes the bill better at all.  I will summarize 
what I said in the beginning for the benefit of all hon. members. 
I urge them to defeat that amendment.  There is no such 
recommendation in the report.  It is not in keeping with the 
tradition under which we have operated in the past.  It does not 
make the bill better.  It makes it worse. 
The bill works perfectly well.  As it is now it works even 
better.  This amendment is not progressive.  As a matter of fact, 
in my view it is a step backwards.

</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Chairman, the most significant amendment I have 
proposes that the salary increase for members of parliament and 
senators would be restricted to 2% as opposed to 20%.  The 
rationale for that is that is what was proposed to the Public 
Service Alliance of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, that future increases, which was my amendment to 
clause 1, would not be tied to the salary of the chief justice 
but rather would be the aggregate average percentage in the wage 
increases earned by members of the Public Service Alliance of 
Canada.  This is a fair reasonable approach and something I 
believe the Canadian Taxpayers Federation has said would be fair 
and reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first question to the minister is, how can he feel that it is 
justified for members of the House to take a 20% increase in 
salary when those same members have failed to provide a salary 
increase to taxpayers in the form of a substantive tax cut?  I 
think taxpayers will find the taking of a 20% salary increase to 
be offensive based on the fact that they themselves have not been 
given that type of an increase in the form of a tax cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question is, because the bill proposes to extend a 
stipend to chairs and vice-chairs of committees that heretofore 
has not existed, does the minister not view that as just another 
extension of the ability of the Prime Minister to exert influence 
and control over his own members?  Of course one of my amendments 
would be to repeal that stipend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My third question for the minister deals with the opt in clause. 
Does he not see that as somewhat political grandstanding?  In 
effect, what that would do is set up a two tier salary system for 
members of parliament.  Does the minister feel that some members 
of the opposition, who may choose to not opt in, deserve less 
salary than members of his own caucus?  I am thinking in 
particular of the member who helps his constituents depending on 
whether or not they vote Liberal and the member who makes up 
allegations of racism in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably, my amendment, which dealt with changing the 
retroactivity to go back only to April 1 as opposed to January 1, 
was ruled out of order.  I had to refer to it in general because 
there was not a specific clause to refer to.  Does the minister 
not think that the retroactivity is excessive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, because some members are curious about this, I would 
like the minister to clarify the opting out provisions.  If some 
members opt out, then seek re-election and are re-elected, would 
they remain opted out or would they be in?  The bill does not 
seem to be clear on that.  It states that elected members would 
be in, but what about members who previously were members?

of the questions raised by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is advocating that we base ourselves on other formula for 
establishing what the salary increase of members of parliament 
should be.  It gives me a good occasion to raise something which 
I had not before.  I draw to the attention of all hon. members

21.6%.  The average industrial wage increase was 23.6%.  The 
general public wage settlement was 15.2%.  The general private 
wage settlement was 22.4%.  The Conference Board survey of wage 
increases was 31.9%.  Members of parliament increases were 6.0%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if the hon. member had an opportunity to read that 
table.  If he had, he would know that what he is saying would 
probably result in a greater increase than the one we have now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, let us look back at a few things historically.  I shared 
some of this with a few colleagues across the way, albeit not all 
of them but a few.   I will give an example, and it is not the be 
all and end all of examples, but it is certainly one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1963 a judge of the federal court earned $21,000 a year and 
an MP earned $23,700, 12% more.  In 1971 a judge was up to 
$36,000 and an MP at $33,000.  These are the MP salaries grossed 
up, assuming that everything would be taxable, so that we can 
compare apples and apples.  In 1980 a judge was at $70,000 and an 
MP was at $66,000.  We were still reasonably close.  In 1992 a 
judge was at $155,000 and an MP was at $106,000.  In 2000 a judge 
was at $179,000 and an MP was at $108,000.  From 1992 to 2000 the 
MP's salary had gone up $1,900 a year and the judge's salary had 
gone up $25,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to a question from the hon. member from Calgary, I 
indicated that Bill C-12 was retroactive to April 1, 2001.  That 
is not correct.  It is April 1, 2000 that the retroactivity 
provision of Bill C-12 applies.  What that does is it gives a 
salary now, April 1, 2001, of judges at $204,600 and MPs at 
$109,000.  Today an MP earns 45% of the salary of a judge.  Even 
with this so-called generous increase, MPs will still only make 
55% of the salary of a judge.  That is how far the salary 
structure had fallen behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we could say that the amount is excessive.  We can say all 
these things.  They are easy to say, a lot easier than defending 
the bill perhaps, but it does not mean they are right. What is 
proposed in the bill I believe is right.  The Lumley commission 
proposed the amount.  We did not deviate from the 20%.  We did 
not say that it should be 25% or 30%.  Using some of the indices 
it should have perhaps been higher.  Using the index that the 
hon. member wants to propose perhaps would have been lower, but 
we used the objective one produced in the report.  That is why we 
used that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we offering chairs and vice-chairs greater remuneration 
than others?  They are positions with greater responsibility, as 
are the positions of the House leaders, the leaders of each party 
and anyone else who holds some of these offices.  It is not a 
matter of whether the Prime Minister appoints them. I could turn 
around and ask the member about his leader appointing the 
vice-chairs, which would be equally silly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party then 
allegedly appointing the chairs and vice-chairs in the Senate, 
and so on?  We could spread that nonsense all over the place. It 
does not accomplish anything.  The fact still remains that a 
chair and a vice-chair of a committee are positions that are, 
according to the commission, worthy of further remuneration, 
which is something that exists at the provincial level in many if 
not most of the provinces in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the opt in clause, hon. member wants to know if that 
means that some members are not deserving of the salary?  No.  I 
think all colleagues in the House deserve the salary.  That is 
why I said a while ago, and I do not know whether the member was 
in attendance when I said it, that I hope everyone will opt in. 
I also hope that all members will vote for the bill. 
However, I repeat that even if they vote against it I hope that 
they opt in anyway because in my view they are still worth the 
salary.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the retroactivity, the hon. member asked why we used that 
date. I answered that in a previous question.  It goes back to 
January 1 because in past reports it went back to the date of the 
last election.  I did not go quite that far back because it was 
only a few days prior to the beginning of the calendar year and 
it caused probably greater aggravation than it was worth.  So I 
stopped after January 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report is about the present parliament which started after

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Pallister (Portage—Lisgar, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Chairman, I welcome the opportunity to add my comments to 
those made thus far on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin from the position that there is room for principle on 
all sides of this debate.  I begin from the position that every 
member of the House will use what principles they have to make 
their decision on this bill.  However, we were not born with 
principles, and some would argue that the very fact we are 
debating the bill is evidence that we have do not them.  I do not 
take that position either.  I take the position that I have 
principles, so as a principle based member of the House I will 
try to use those principles to make my decision on how I vote on 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by sharing with the members of the House some of the 
experiences I have had which have developed those principles in 
me.  One fundamental principle I have is that I believe very 
strongly in equal pay for equal work.  I believe that is a 
fundamental principle that we should all stand for in the House 
and that we should support wholeheartedly with every ounce of 
strength we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my first occupation I was given the opportunity to work as a 
school teacher.  We did not receive pay differentiated on the 
basis of our sex, race, creed, colour or any other factors.  We 
received equal pay for equal work based on our training and 
educational background.  That was a fundamental principle of my 
experience as a school teacher.  Then I entered the private 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a person who started a small business from scratch, I 
employed people on the basis of the fundamental principle, which 
should apply in the private sector and unfortunately sometimes 
does not, that people should be paid equally on the basis of 
their work regardless of any other factor.  When replacing a 
position for example, one should compensate that person similarly 
or identically based on his or her equal ability to offer work 
and skill to a small business venture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the public sector such a principle is well understood.  We 
abide by this principle in the public sector in every respect. 
We must support the principle of equal pay for equal work.  That 
principle is something I believe is very important to all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question then becomes what principles are greater than that 
one?  What principles are more important to us in the House than 
that one?  If there are principles of more significance to us as 
members of the House, then let us speak to them through this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill contains a clause which allows members to opt in.  What 
that does is create two classes of members not differentiated on 
the basis of skill, work ethic, what they offer to the House or 
to the members of their constituencies, but solely on the basis 
of how they choose to listen to their principles and whether feel 
that the bill is in keeping with their fundamental beliefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of the House feel very strongly that the bill is 
contrary and contradictory to their fundamental principles, they 
must vote against it and must therefore opt out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine why they must opt out.  Because it is in the 
bill.  Only for that reason must members be put in the position 
of having to make the choice as to whether they do or do not 
receive the benefits that other members do.  In other words, what 
we are doing is debating a bill which penalizes those of 
principle.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It fundamentally detracts from the compensation of some members 
of the House based on one factor and one factor only: their 
personal principles, and that is wrong.  It is wrong to debate a 
bill which contains a clause which creates two classes of members 
of parliament.  That sends the wrong message to the people of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of our local chamber of commerce and as a 
participant in the national chamber of commerce, I know that 
small businesses in the private sector united together and 
initiated, through tremendous effort from their collective 
members, the idea of promoting equal pay for equal work across 
Canada.  I understand how much work is involved in that.  I 
understand the collective sacrifices made by volunteers to try to 
create a level playing field and provide an opportunity for all 
Canadians to share the benefits they deserve to receive from 
their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand what this opt in, opt out situation does and so 
should the members opposite.  It sends a completely flawed 
message to the people of Canada.  It says that there can be two 
different classes of members of parliament based on their 
fundamental principles.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader has repeatedly said that he hoped 
everyone would opt in.  He said it with a palpable sense of guilt 
because he knows, as thinking members of the House must know, 
that this opt in clause is fundamentally flawed.  I invite the 
House leader to explain if it is not flawed, why it is legitimate 
and valid.  I invite him to tell us what the purpose of it is 
beyond the fact that it will simply allow members of principle to 
be punished financially for expressing their views on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there some fundamental greater principle to be served when we 
do not have the option in the House to opt out of any other piece 
of legislation?  He uses the example of superannuation, but he 
knows full well that benefits are received in another form if not 
going into superannuation.  That is not a legitimate example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there a fundamental principle served by the presence of the 
opt in clause in the legislation?  I ask him to address that 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this particular clause in the bill sends the 
message that opposition has its price.  It is too cute by half. 
It will be seen by Canadians to be a ploy to suppress opposition 
rather than encourage debate on principle.  For that reason it is 
a sham and a shame.  It creates a crisis of principle because it 
forces individual members of parliament to participate in what is 
essentially a game that none of us can win.  It is a game which 
creates two classes of members of parliament for no legitimate 
reason whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the absence of this clause there would be opportunity for 
fundamental debate that could take place on significant 
principles on the differences we have, which are honest and 
legitimate.  The reality is that this clause creates a phony 
debate.  It is a diversionary tactic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Stand by your choice.  It is a personal 
choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Pallister:</B>  Mr. Chairman, the Secretary of State

she were in the private sector she would have been fired long

to find myself in agreement with the member for 
Saskatoon—Humboldt. This day will go down in infamy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has an amendment which is similar, not numerically 
similar but in the same ballpark, and it would have the effect of 
reducing the raise from 20% to 10%.  We do this because we feel 
that this is the kind of raise that could be justified given 
certain indicators. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT35"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT35"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1650

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not understand the rationale for a 20% increase.  We think 
a lot of Canadians feel likewise.  We understand the rationale in 
a technical sense because the government has paid the Prime 
Minister a certain amount equal to the chief justice, then it has 
worked its way down in terms of percentages and arrived at a 
certain number, and that number is a 20% increase over what 
members are now making.  We understand how it got there, but we 
share the feeling of a lot of Canadians that a 20% raise is 
incomprehensible to them when they know what kind of percentage 
increases they are being offered at the bargaining table.  It is 
for this reason we signal our intention that we would be much 
happier with a 10% raise, and feel much more comfortable with it 
than a 20% raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In doing this we are acting in a way that is somewhat 
contradictory in a sense, but I think we are acting in that 
contradictory way because a lot of us have said we need to have 
this taken out of our hands and have someone else make the 
recommendation.  We have a commission before us and all of us 
here have moved amendments to change the recommendations that 
have been made by this independent body, so we are all a bit 
guilty of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not brought in a bill that is identical to 
what Mr. Lumley and the hon. member for Elk Island recommended. 
There are Alliance amendments, Conservative amendments and NDP 
amendments.  All of us want to tinker with this independent 
recommendation, each in our own way.  For me it just points out 
the reason why the part of the bill that takes it out of our 
hands forever is a good part of the bill, because we are setting 
up a mechanism now with which we will not be able to tinker in 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that it does not matter how 
independent a report it is and how well written it is, when it 
gets to the floor of the House we will all have our opinions on 
what should be changed in it.  Therefore, it becomes politicized 
no matter how hard we try not to politicize it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this by way of wanting to put on the record one more time 
the fact that we support the way in which the bill finally does 
what the NDP has been asking for for many years, and on the basis 
of which sometimes in the past we have voted against salary 
increases because we have said that this does not remove it from 
us, and it means that we would have to go through this again. 
Finally, this time we have a process by which we will not have to 
go through this again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would warn members that if the independent commission that 
settles judges salaries and if judges salaries start to go 
through the roof, there will be politics again, because we always 
have the possibility of changing the mechanism.  In other words, 
we never completely evade responsibility for this.  However, I 
think we go some way toward creating a situation in which we will 
not have to have this kind of tension again.  Hopefully we will 
not have the kind of silliness that the member for 
Portage—Lisgar refers to.  I and my party agree with him and 
others who have criticized the government for bringing in this 
opting in clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wanted to put on the record that all of us are tinkering 
with the commission report.  We are very good at pointing out 
when the government does it or when somebody else does it. 
However, the Conservatives have disagreed with the provision to 
pay chairs and they have brought in amendments on that score. The 
Alliance has other concerns about the report.  We are all guilty 
of tinkering with the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the ability to change the report.  The government has 
the ability to change it by virtue of using its majority.  We all 
have the ability to change it by agreeing with each other.  I 
would urge members to consider the wisdom of having a 10% 
increase as opposed to a 20% increase.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PARLIAMENT OF CANADA ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK221">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration in committee of the whole of 
Bill C-28, an act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act, the 
Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act and the Salaries 
Act, Mr. Kilger in the chair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Betty Hinton (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Chairman, I listened very carefully 
today and I read the report thoroughly.  There are parts of that 
report that I can agree with wholeheartedly.  I agree completely 
with the abolition of the tax free portion of it.  I agree with 
the independent body making the decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am have severe trouble with, and what was just confirmed 
by the House leader, is that if we choose to opt out because this 
is unpalatable to us, then we remain out forever more.  That is 
ridiculous and is an unfair position to put anyone in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take exception to some of the things that were quoted today as 
well because they were inaccurate.  One thing I take exception to 
is the fact that I can stand here and say in all honesty that I 
had no idea that this was coming forward.  I have not been an MP 
for six years prior, and I did not know there had not been a 
raise in the last six years.  It is reasonable to assume that if 
there has not been one in the last six years, it would come 
forward this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have the problem that by law it would be reviewed within 
the first six months of parliament.  This does not come as a huge 
surprise to people who have been here before, but it does come as 
a huge surprise to myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that some of the arguments which 
have been made regarding reducing it are valid arguments.  I 
would accept a reduction.  I have no difficulty with that at all. 
However, I do like to deal in realities and some of the things 
reported in the report stated that the Ontario English Catholic 
Teachers' Association, a unionized group, paid $100,084 for the 
president, and that the director of Canadian affairs of the Sheet 
Metal Workers' International Association received $161,000 a 
year.  Therefore, in terms of putting us on level with working 
people, these are working people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see today a resolution to this that is fair, and 
I do not see that forthcoming.  If we are going to leave people 
in a position where they have to make a choice between accepting 
this forever more, in the hope that they are going to serve for 
10 or 15 more years, or opting out is a very unfair way of doing 
things.  I really resent the way the legislation is being put 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I was assured that opting out of this pay raise would allow 
me to opt out of other legislation, I could name them on my 
fingers in five seconds.  My constituency would opt out of the 
gun legislation, the things that are sitting in front of us today 
about cruelty to animals and employment equity.  I come from a 
ranching area and branding is an everyday part of life there, as 
is castration for animals.  If I have the option, by opting out 
of this and I am allowed to opt out of other legislation, I will 
do so today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, a few members have spoken, so 
perhaps I could respond to some of the concerns that they have 
raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from Manitoba who spoke some while ago, talked 
extensively of this business of equal pay for equal work.  It 
goes a lot further than that.  It also goes to equal pay for work 
of equal value.  My colleagues on this side of the House believe 
in both those propositions, not just the first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, opting not to take a benefit personally does not 
constitute unequal treatment under the law.  Everyone knows that. 
Opting to give one's personal funds to a charity does not mean 
that someone becomes disadvantaged under the law, because one has 
voluntarily given up that money.  The hon. member asked “When 
did I ever become a charity?”  That is an excellent question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if one opted then to give money back to the public 
treasury, which certainly one has the opportunity of doing, does 
not mean that person has suffered mistreatment by the government 
as a result of that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not an appropriate proposition.  The member is really 
mixing up propositions.  Accepting or not accepting a benefit 
does not constitute inequity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the fact that the bill is structured in essentially 
the same way as the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances 
Act, the amendments thereto, which were designed after the 1993 
election at the request of members of the House.  Not to put too 
fine a point on it, the members who made that request were not 
sitting on this side of the House.  It was structured in the same 
way.  There was an opting in provision where everyone was deemed 
to have been opted out and one had to opt in in order to be part 
of the pension.  It is exactly the same principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, on the Public Service Superannuation Act, the hon. 
member said it is not the same because one would get the benefit 
another way.  No, it is not so.  A person would get their own 
contributions another way but not the employer's contributions. 
The employer's contributions are provided by virtue of adhering 
to the package.  One does not get all the benefits another way by 
not participating in that.  Of course I also gave other examples, 
such as the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act, the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act and so on.  I am sure 
there are several others as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys said 
that there had been no salary increase over the last six years. 
That is not what I said, with respect.  I said that the salary 
increase for members of parliament over the last 11 years had 
been a total of 6%.  That is where the number six came in, not 
that there had been no increase over the last six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did the salary get to be this way?  Perhaps we should take a 
minute and discuss that so members will understand why the salary 
structure got off kilter the way it did.  I do not think there is 
any doubt that it did, otherwise members would not see a 
situation like we have now, where I as a minister am not only 
paid much less than my own deputy minister but an assistant 
deputy minister has now caught up with a minister.  It has become 
that off kilter over the years.  I am talking about public 
servants and not about people in the private sector, to use the 
example raised by the member for Saskatoon—Humboldt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It got that way because of two reasons.  First, there were two 
freezes, one of them around 1985 or so and the second one in the 
late eighties.  That combination meant that the salary was frozen 
for something like six out of eight years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, when the legislation was designed in the late seventies 
there was a rather curious clause in it, which said that every 
year there would be a cost of living adjustment minus 1%. 
Therefore, in years where there was no government imposed freeze, 
members got an increase in the cost of living minus 1%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members had the combination of those two factors acting one in 
tandem with the other, which caused what we have now.  For 
example, if the inflation rate was 10%, a member got back 9% and 
recovered 90% of the inflation.  When there was an inflation rate 
of 2% and there was a recovery of 1%, members lost 50% of the 
inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these things have occurred progressively.  Many of them 
occurred even before I came here.  Heaven knows I have been here 
a long time, but some of them even predate my arrival, namely, 
the structure and how members got to the cost of living formula 
that we have there.  That is how it got so off kilter over so 
many years and I do not think anyone would deny that it is.

</I></B></P><P align=left>After the 36th parliament, and now in the 37th parliament, 
Alliance members have all adhered to the members' pension plan, 
one after the other. The bill before us basically says “If you 
agree, you sign the form and you will get it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the Canadian Alliance Party is that its caucus 
remains very divided. Half of its members want the raise, but 
because of the party line or because of a directive from the 
party, caucus members are stuck with the instructions that were 
issued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is evidenced by the fact that yesterday, at second reading, 
the Alliance members who left the caucus—and are now sitting 
along the curtains—voted in favour of Bill C-28, because they are 
not bound by a decision made by the leadership of the caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I tell Canadian Alliance members “Be honest, be 
transparent. If you vote against the raise, I hope that later 
you will not sign the form and cash your cheque at the bank”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Chairman, my congratulations to you for your remarkable ability 
to remember everyone when we are sitting in different seats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to return to what the government House leader was saying 
earlier.  He expressed concern about the fact that he now earns 
less than his assistant deputy minister.  Obviously Canadians' 
hearts will bleed at the thought that the minister would be 
earning less than one of the highest paid civil servants in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that it is not a unique situation.  We find 
junior officers in the Canadian military who earn less than chief 
warrant officers, based on the fact that the non-commissioned 
officer has some form of superior expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the government House leader some questions 
which relate to opting out.  First, am I to understand that the 
extra stipends paid to MPs who serve in some post or capacity 
other than as members of parliament, for example as chair or vice 
chair of a committee or as a party leader or a House leader, can 
opt out of one of those or are they mandatory without an opting 
out clause? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question relates to opting out permanently.  I gather 
it would mean that in the next election should someone on this 
side opt out, the voters would know that the Liberal candidate 
opposing him or her, for example, would be paid more following 
the election than that incumbent MP, and that in future elections 
that difference would grow over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the inflation rate clause mentioned in his previous 
comments apply in perpetuity as well for those who opt out?  Can 
we assume that over time the differential will grow and grow? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I believe that enthusiasm is 
growing in the Chamber.  The hon. member asked a few interesting 
questions.  I will forget about the editorial comment at the 
beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important clause and it is important for the 
House to have the information.  The bill is structured in such a 
way that if members do not opt in, they do not opt in to 
anything.  They are opted out of extra emolument for the chair, 
vice chair, extra pay for anything, grossing up the increased 
part of salary and so on and so forth.  If one opts out, one opts 
out of everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asked if all of the provisions of the existing 
package continue.  The answer is yes.  For instance, if the cost 
of living increase was 2% next year and an hon. member did not 
participate in the program, the hon. member would get 2% less 1% 
or a 1% increase.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is right in saying that the disparity could 
grow.  Of course that really depends on the size of the inflation 
rate.  The irony is that if the inflation rate is higher 
proportionately the member would lose less than if the inflation 
rate is lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I rise on a point of order.  I 
believe it is very important for members to make informed 
decisions.  In view of the fact that after the vote is called I 
will not be able to rise on a point of order, I would like to ask 
that when the votes are called on the amendments there be a brief 
statement of what the amendment actually does.  Otherwise I 
believe members will be voting from a base of ignorance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  With respect to my colleague from Elk 
Island, we are under an order of the House.  Unless the House 
chooses to do otherwise, I will not be complying with his wishes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Chairman, I see my friends across the way think that 
ignorance is bliss and that those who have been very attentive in 
the debate have suddenly arrived.  That is nice to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of questions for the government House leader. 
First, did the minister himself not publicly say just a few days 
ago that he was opposed to inserting an opting out provision in 
the bill?  Now he is here defending it.  I wonder what changed 
his thinking in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, with respect to the apparent perpetuity of such a 
decision, how would that work in the next parliament if there is 
to be another compensation commission and legislation is passed 
at that time?  Or would there be changes that track judicial 
salaries?  Would they apply to people who opt out at this point? 
Or again is that in perpetuity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Colleagues opposite are saying to read the bill.  The bill has 
been on the table for about two days and we have a couple of 
hours in committee, which is not a normal opportunity to read the 
bill and get expert external advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is silent on this matter and this is committee of the 
whole where we have an opportunity to ask substantive questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to ask the government House leader about the 
accrual rate for the pension plan.  My understanding was that 
chairman Lumley verbally suggested that the benefit accrual rate 
be 2.5% in order for the value of the pensions to be neutral 
given the increase in the pensionable salary.  Could the minister 
confirm that?  If that indeed was the intention of the 
commission, why does the bill propose a benefit accrual rate of 
3%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I will try to respond rather 
rapidly.  I will start with the last point on the accrual rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accrual rate is reduced from 4% to 3%.  Furthermore, the 
number of years necessary in order to arrive at the maximum 
contribution is increased from 19 to 25.  What we have proposed 
is certainly no more generous than what officials are generally 
offered in the private sector.  What we are offering here is a 
condition.  In the present House of Commons there is a grand 
total of 5 members who have 25 years of service, so the chance 
that someone would actually get a maximum pension is 5 over 301 
under the proposal we have made here.  This does not make for an 
overly generous pension scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, given that the amount is taken on the larger structure, 
in order to get a pension MPs will in fact now have to contribute 
$2,900 more per year in premiums from here on in. 
In terms of government dollars spent for pension dollars out, 
this reduces the output proportionately considerably, because it 
is going more and more in that direction with the private sector.

<A NAME="LINK285">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 7 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-287, an act to amend the Food and Drugs Act (genetically 
modified food), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK286"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted by the existence of Bill C-287, which concerns 
genetically modified food.  I congratulate the member for 
Davenport for introducing it into the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much more than a matter of labelling, this bill represents the 
ability of each individual to make a personal choice on the 
essence of life within an open and democratic society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each area that touches our life, we make choices, and we have 
the right to do so.  We choose our children's schools, a doctor, 
where we will live, where we will build our home, a type of car 
or of clothing, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when it comes to the food we eat—the simplest and most 
vital element in our lives—we cannot make a reasonable and 
intelligent choice. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I prefer to eat a natural fish rather than a fish from 
aquaculture or fish farming, I cannot make that choice because no 
information in the stores differentiates one from the other.  In 
the same way, when it concerns genetically modified foods, no 
labelling at all distinguishes them from non-modified foods. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1835"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT56"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT56"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1835
<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet if this information were available, I believe that the great 
majority of people would most definitely opt for non-modified 
foods.  I certainly would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that proponents of genetically modified foods will 
adamantly advance the idea that their products are totally safe 
and present no dangers to our health.  Certainly this has been 
the pitch that the big proponent of genetically modified foods 
and seeds, Monsanto, has been advancing for several years, now 
that it has staked its future on genetically modified seeds and 
crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague's objectives in presenting the bill are simple. 
First, it gives citizens a choice through labelling.  This is the 
fundamental case in his bill.  If there is labelling, as he 
suggests there must be, then obviously citizens are faced with a 
normal choice.  They choose GM foods if they want to or they 
leave them aside and choose natural foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a second objective in his bill.  Even if science 
regarding genetically modified foods is not conclusive, we should 
use the precautionary principle so that we are put in a position 
where we use caution and the benefit of the doubt in advising 
people that there may be a potential danger.  When science is not 
conclusive, the precautionary principle, which our country 
adopted during UNCED at Rio, clearly states that we should use 
caution regarding any danger or any potential danger to health 
and environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we exercise this caution?  How can we be preventive? 
Without labelling, how can we be cautionary and precautionary if 
we do not know whether the food is of a certain type or not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the bill reminds us, Canada has embarked on various 
international engagements regarding the potential labelling of 
food.  Both the Codex Alimentarius Commission guidelines of 
2000 and more recently the biosafety protocol always point toward 
caution and toward labelling.  Bill C-287 would provide a 
stringent monitoring and recording of all stages of production of 
genetically modified foods, which would enable correct labelling 
to be achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opponents of labelling have been saying for years that we cannot 
label genetically modified foods because it is almost impossible 
to separate them from other foodstuffs because they are an 
intrinsic part of all foodstuff.  Yet if the bill were followed, 
if there were strict monitoring of all stages of creation and 
production, of food growing, of recording of all the stages, then 
we would be able to label foods to a sufficiently clear and 
reasonable degree such that people could make a choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In presenting the bill, in having it made votable before the 
House, and in us having a chance to debate the very issue of 
labelling, I think Bill C-287 is doing our country a great 
favour, because so far all the steps we have taken have been 
voluntary steps.  In fact, we are doing Canada a big favour 
economically because, more and more, various countries will 
refuse to accept any food exports from us which may be 
genetically modified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all colleagues to strongly support the bill to ensure 
that labelling becomes a legal reality.  Certainly in labelling 
our foods, we will benefit not only the health and the 
environment of our society but we will help our exports in the 
long run.  I urge all colleagues to back Bill C-287 and vote in 
favour of it at second reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Merrifield (Yellowhead, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, before I start I would like to ask for the consent of 
the House to split my time with the member for Yorkton—Melville? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Does the hon. member 
have unanimous consent to split his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Merrifield:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on 
Bill C-287, regarding the labelling of genetically modified 
foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from two perspectives.  First, I am a member of the 
health committee.  As the deputy health critic in this whole area 
of genetically modified foods, I believe it is important to see 
it from a health perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I have quite a bit of firsthand experience in dealing 
with genetically modified foods.  I farm and have grown 
genetically modified foods for a number of years.  I know a 
little bit of the science and know what actually happens at the 
farm gate and in the farmer's fields when growing these 
genetically modified foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the confusion for consumers when they look at the whole 
area of genetically modified foods is whether it is really 
important.  They ask questions such as what is a genetically 
modified food and is it safe?  The whole idea of genetically 
modified foods is that it is sort of a Frankenstein food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to have a good debate about that before we get into the 
idea of whether or not we should label it.  Once we ask those 
questions and answer them, we will have a better discernment of 
exactly what we are trying to label. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must first understand the degree to which genetically 
modified foods are being grown in the world today.  Some 33 
million acres of genetically modified crops, which represents 10% 
of the world's supply, is actually being grown right now.  That 
is a tremendous number.  However, we have yet to see any harmful 
repercussions from the usage of genetically modified foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should take a look at the long term effects because people 
are saying our foods maybe become eroded and may not have the 
same nutritional values that they used to, yet the statistics 
show a different picture.  The statistics show we are living 
longer and have more active and healthier lives now than ever 
before.  If our food sources were to become polluted or 
dangerous, the opposite of that would actually take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opponents of this would suggest that is yet to come.  It is 
something we should be cautious of in the future.  I would 
suggest that if that is true, then we should do it on a 
scientific basis.  We should look at genetically modified foods 
from a scientific perspective as to whether we should label them 
or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The population of the world is exploding.  There are more than 
six billion people right now.  How many hungry mouths would we 
have if we did not grow genetically modified foods?  The 
projections are that we will grow to nine billion people very 
soon and it will continue to escalate.  The technologies that we 
develop are very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Genetically modified foods, depending on how we see them and how 
we discern what a genetically modified food is, have been around 
from the beginning of time.  We have modified foods for a number 
of years.  Today we have 600 million hectares of wheat grown 
worldwide.  If we were using the same technology that we used in 
1965, we would need another 850 million hectares of land to grow 
that same amount of wheat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have hybridized and genetically modified foods for many 
years.  It has now become a bit of a phobia because of what our 
European neighbours have been doing with regard to genetically 
modified foods, and suggesting that there is something dangerous 
and sinister about using them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they were honest with the world and with their own people 
they would be more realistic.  They would say they were using 
opposition to GM foods as a marketing tool.  I do not argue that 
they should not do that.  I just argue that they are maybe not 
being straight up with their population.  In Canada we use 
modified foods and have for a number of years.  I think we have 
proven them to be very safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get a genetically modified food in place, one needs to do a 
number of things.  First, it takes seven years to get it on the 
shelf.  We do not just snap our fingers and make it happen. Seven 
years of work goes into it.  Members must realize that GM foods 
do not go straight from Monsanto's labs onto the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I oppose labelling because the science shows nothing to support 
it.  On that basis, I think we should stay with the science and 
we will not go wrong. 
<P><A NAME="LINK288"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure today to speak to 
Bill C-287 put forward by the member for Davenport.  The member's 
bill calls for mandatory labelling of foods that contain 
genetically modified organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent a constituency that has agriculture as its main 
industry.  It seems to me that the bill would hurt the farming 
sector in a very negative way.  I have received many letters from 
agricultural groups that have serious concerns with the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Roy Button, president of the Saskatchewan Canola Development 
Commission, stated in a letter to my office that if mandatory 
labelling of genetically modified foods is established for some 
concerned customers then “the cost of food production for all 
consumers will be increased and there will be no improvement in 
food safety”.  These costs would then be passed on to the 
producer, resulting in lower commodity prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Ray Hilderman, president of the Saskatchewan Canola Growers 
Association which represents 40,000 Saskatchewan canola 
producers, states that a recent study by the Canola Council of 
Canada showed that canola producers were saving $5.80 an acre by 
growing transgenic canola.  The study said transgenic canola 
resulted in higher yields, lower dockage for foreign markets, 
better returns, less field tillage, less use of pesticides and 
less consumption of fuel, which not only saves the producer money 
but benefits the environment as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also states that there would be a problem with the labelling 
of canola oil.  As the bill stands now, products derived from 
genetically modified plants must be labelled. However tests 
conducted on canola oil cannot differentiate between genetically 
modified and non-genetically modified canola. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario Corn Producers' Association, which represents 21,000 
corn growers in Ontario, stated in a letter to the member for 
Davenport that it has found most farmers to be supportive of 
biotechnology as a means of improving their product.  The 
benefits of biotech include reduced pesticide use and improved 
pest control, which also benefits the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The OCPA also pointed out that the intention of the bill to 
abandon the novel crop and food regulations, against which all 
new crops and foods must be tested, could introduce “new corn 
varieties made using wide crosses with bananas or barnyard 
grasses, for example, or soybeans with peanuts, with no 
requirement for testing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Dairy Council of Canada states in a letter from its 
vice-president, Mr. Pierre Nadeau, that the bill raises complex 
scientific and technical questions.  First, what is meant by 
traditional breeding?  What techniques would be classified as 
biotechnology?  Second, how would the 1% threshold be calculated? 
Would it be calculated on the amount in the food, the per serving 
amount?  Would it be calculated by volume?  Would it be 
calculated by weight? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears to me that the legislation is very reactionary. 
Currently the Canadian General Standards Board is developing a 
voluntary labelling program for genetically modified foods.  With 
help from over 60 concerned industry and consumer groups, the 
CGSB is ensuring a labelling standard that is informative, 
understandable and supportable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers are demanding that products they buy in stores be 
properly labelled so they can make wise and informed choices. 
Government should not interfere in something consumer demand can 
rectify.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Mr. Nadeau of the National Dairy Council of Canada stated in 
his letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that mandatory labelling at this time is 
driven in large part by perception.  People are always afraid of 
what they do not understand.  The question becomes:  should 
legislation be implemented in response to public perception at a 
particular point in time, or should legislation be the result of 
enlightened governance? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems clear that the legislation was not drafted in an 
informed light.  Why should we force something down the throats 
of food processors that they themselves have been working on for 
the last couple of years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I will say that there is a much better way to go 
on this issue.  We should treat it the same way we treat organic 
foods.  Organic foods are labelled on a voluntary basis.  That is 
much more sensible and it is the only practical approach. 
<P><A NAME="LINK289"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham—Kent Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems I found when doing research on the topic was 
that there was confusion with regard to safety versus 
information.  I assure every member of the House and all 
Canadians that safety is an issue with the inspection of food in 
Canada.  Food safety falls under the Department of Health and the 
inspection process is important to agriculture as well.  We have 
mandatory labelling wherever safety is an issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about safety as it relates to allergies.  There is 
no one in Canada who would not support that.  The debate is not 
about safety.  It is about public information.  We must make that 
clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second point is that there is tremendous concern about 
approving mandatory labelling before all the research is in. 
Organizations like the Consumers' Association of Canada, the 
chambers of commerce, the food manufacturers' groups, 
distributors' groups and processors' groups, many groups in the 
agricultural sector, the boards that relate to our grains, and 
the commodity organizations all have great concern with the 
issue.  There is a wide variety of concerns with regard to the 
effect the bill will have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another concern that because of the research and work 
going on, and there is tremendous study going on at this time, it 
is important to wait before a final verdict is made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the three points I will talk about in the few moments 
I have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Food labelling falls under the Department of Health, and food 
safety is an issue.  There can be no compromise with food safety 
and labelling in Canada.  The Department of Health makes sure 
that anything with a safety condition is labelled.  All other 
food labelling is controlled by the Canadian Food Inspection 
Agency and it is its responsibility to ensure labels are done 
properly.  In regard to health, such as allergy products or 
anything else of that nature, mandatory labelling is in place in 
Canada and will continue to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also rules for labelling genetically modified foods on 
a voluntary basis.  Voluntary means a food does or does not 
contain genetically modified products.  A volunteer labelling 
system affects all consumers, but it is clear that not all 
organizations dealing with the issue have set out the rules in a 
clear or concise way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> on April 24, 2000 suggested there 
were real problems with genetic labelling. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1855"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They tested all kinds of products that were labelled genetic 
free.  The results of the tests showed that some materials in the 
American public which contained 40% genetically modified products 
were labelled genetic free.  Many products were not labelled in 
an accurate and clear way.  That could become a major problem for 
everyone in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to go through a labelling process, the process must be 
clear.  It must be able to be confirmed.  It must be accurate and 
not deceptive to anyone.  The rules must be set out by the 
experts: people involved in food processing, governments that 
have a vested interest in making sure the consumer gets accurate 
information, chambers of commerce and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point in time the CGSB, the Canadian General Standards 
Board, is working with 132 participants.  Some of the 
participants include the Consumers' Association of Canada, the 
National Institute of Nutrition, the National Research Council, 
the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, AgriCorp, Ontario Corn 
Producers, the National Dairy Council, the governments of the 
provinces and territories, and the departments of health, 
agriculture, justice, industry and international trade in the 
Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very broad spectrum.  These groups are working as 
closely as they can with all stakeholders and everyone who wishes 
to get involved in setting much needed standards for the Canadian 
public.  The results are to be reported within a few months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the obligation of all members of parliament to make 
certain that proper information comes back so that all groups 
that have been doing studies for a long time can report, make 
clear to the Canadian public what information should be reported 
and labelled, and set out the process in a proper way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must wonder why we are moving so quickly at this point in 
time with a private member's bill when we realize the work that 
has been done by so many organizations to make certain that 
Canadians get proper information and that proper standards are 
set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Society of Canada was asked to look into biotechnology 
and the regulations Canada would need in the future.  The society 
formed an independent panel of science experts and asked them to 
study biotechnology labelling.  They arrived at three 
conclusions.  They endorsed the mandatory labelling system now in 
place in Canada and said that where health and safety are 
important proper labelling must be mandatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there are no clear grounds or rules to develop a general 
mandatory labelling regime.  The Royal Society of Canada, which 
is doing a great deal of study, strongly supports a voluntary 
labelling system.  It does not believe in a mandatory system that 
would be without rules, clarity or form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do we go from this point?  There is no doubt that 
consumers should have access to information that enables them to 
make informed decisions about the food they eat.  That 
information must be accurate, understandable, informative, 
verifiable and not misleading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's policy for labelling food has served Canadians very 
well in the health and safety field.  The stringent safety 
requirements upheld by Health Canada, the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency and Environment Canada have long protected the 
health of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>More detail is needed if labelling is to be accurate and useful 
to consumers.  That is why the Government of Canada has put in 
place a process to develop a set of national standards with 
voluntary labelling to make sure that this issue is handled 
appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not pre-empt all the study that is being done by the 
experts and organizations that have been very intensely involved 
in food production and safety for many years and cause potential 
trade problems for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a riding that is very rural and agricultural and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Neigette-et-la Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to address Bill C-287, an act to 
amend the Food and Drugs Act specifically concerning genetically 
modified food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very simple piece of legislation. New section 7.1(1) 
states:

</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the member for Lac-Saint-Louis told us that it was very 
important to know what we eat. I think it is a fundamental 
individual right to know what we eat.  But to know it is, this 
information must provided on the label of the product that we 
buy at the store. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who spoke before me suggested that we consult all the 
experts, take into account their point of view and look at the 
findings of the research done before supporting this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have to wait for all scientists to agree on the effects of

bridge before we take any action at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that it is important that labelling be made mandatory. 
Already, almost 88% of farmers say they are ready to label.  Why 
should we have to have pressure put on us by lobbyists? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very often I hear members speak who are themselves farmers, and 
who do not always mention that they are judge and jury in this 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here to pass laws to improve the health of the public. 
The Canadian Alliance speaker said that he was on the Standing 
Committee on Health and that he was going to ask, on the 
committee's behalf, that the bill not be supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that it is. 
If the public is to remain healthy, I would hope that we could 
at least know what sort of junk we are eating, in order to be 
able to decide whether or not to buy it.  If we do not know what 
we are eating, it is fairly obvious that the impacts can be 
horrendous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider what is going on in our society, what we are eating, 
and in what kind of environment we are living, that there are as 
many cancers as there are today.  We have to wonder.  Why are 
there more and more people being born with all sorts of 
disabilities, and with much more severe ones?  Naturally, people 
are living longer, and we know more about diseases.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely there is something that explains what is going on right 
now in our world.  I think it is important that we support this 
bill.  We must start somewhere.  Recently, we did much worse for 
young offenders than what this bill wants to do with the food we 
eat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that we could take a first step.  If ever this 
turns out to be completely ridiculous or impossible, it will 
always be possible to turn around and say that we made a 
mistake.  Then we can change our minds and take a different 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to talk about something that is going on right now. 
We want this to be done on a voluntary basis. A brewery called 
Unibroue asked the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to issue a 
certificate officially guaranteeing that its beer was free of 
genetically modified organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a long process that started on June 22, 2000 and ended 
around April 24, 2001. Finally, just a month ago, the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency issued a certificate guaranteeing that the 
beer produced by Unibroue was GMO-free. Unibroue needed this 
certificate to launch a major marketing campaign on the European 
market, which it did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened next is somewhat catastrophic. When the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency saw that Unibroue was using this 
certificate for marketing purposes and to sell its product, its 
beer, it decided to withdraw the certificate. It told the company 
that it could no longer use the certificate, that it was taking 
it away. The company was told by the agency that it had no right 
to use the certificate for marketing purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency issued the certificate on April 24, 2001, only to 
withdraw it in June of 2001. It is totally ridiculous. This kind 
of thing should not happen. It makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to think that such a bill could be passed.  I 
will certainly recommend that my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois 
support this bill, even though we are free to vote as we please 
on private members' bills. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK291"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will start this evening by recognizing all the hard work 
that the hon. member for Davenport has put into the bill.  It is 
an extremely important piece of legislation and the work he has 
put into it reflects the quality of the representation that he 
brings into the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deserves the support of all political parties in the 
House.  The New Democratic Party is fully in support of the 
legislation.  It has been reflected in our policy for some time 
and was adopted overwhelmingly in our convention in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to take this opportunity to recognize the work 
that my colleague from Winnipeg North Centre has put into this 
area.  She has done much to promote the labelling of genetically 
modified organisms.  In addition to this private member's bill, 
she also has a private member's bill on the same issue.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to reflect on what has happened in the country 
in terms of this type of legislation.  In that regard I will 
quote a couple of statistics.  More than 80 groups have joined in 
support of the bill.  They have educated the Canadian public 
about the importance of implementing a mandatory labelling scheme 
so that the public is made aware of genetically engineered foods 
before consuming them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, more than 35 countries around the world have 
adopted or are in the process of adopting mandatory labelling. 
The interesting part about that, and maybe the scary part about 
it, is that Canada is seen now as having fallen significantly 
behind these other countries.  I believe it was my friend on the 
Liberal side of the House who made a point that I want to echo. 
As a result of falling behind we face the possibility as a 
country of losing access to international markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our farming industry is not in great shape, as we all know, and 
adding to its problems is the last thing the government and the 
House should be doing.  Support for labelling is important from 
that perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to note some of the countries that have adopted or are in 
the process of adopting standardized mandatory labelling.  The 
United Kingdom, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, 
and at least 14 of the European Union countries have gone down 
this road, much in advance of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-287 would also assist us in complying with our 
international responsibilities.  We have adopted the Cartagena 
protocol on biosafety.  We met internationally.  We have debated 
the issue.  We have accepted that protocol.  We have to follow 
through on it.  In that regard the bill would allow for the 
labelling of food or food ingredients that contain genetic 
material obtained through the use of modern biotechnology.  That 
is right in the definition section of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one looks at the details of the bill it is important to 
note, and again this is some praise to the hon. member for 
Davenport, that it traces genetically modified organisms that are 
added to food through all stages of production, distribution, 
manufacture, packaging and sale.  It is extremely important that 
it is detailed to that degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I echo the importance, as has been indicated more 
eloquently by other members, of the basic right of all Canadians 
to know what is in the food they are consuming.  It seems to me 
that right of the consumer is ingrained in all sorts of 
legislation. It reflects the consumer movement that has been 
alive and healthy for a good number of years.  In that respect 
every public opinion poll shows that the vast majority of 
Canadians believe they have the right to know what is in their 
food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to the 80 groups that have lobbied around the 
country and have educated the public, they have moved that 
consciousness in the Canadian public quite significantly over the 
last five years or six years.  We now see that 70%, 80% and 
sometimes 90% of respondents in these surveys indicate that they 
believe they have a right to know what is in the food they are 
consuming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some argue that the industry should do it itself, that we should 
go to voluntary labelling.  We have seen in any number of areas 
that simply does not work.  We strongly supports that part of the 
bill which makes labelling mandatory.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note the excellent work that ended in the 
report of the Royal Society of Canada earlier this year, in 
February, I believe.  In that report there was a very damning 
condemnation of the practices of this government as far as food 
safety is concerned.  The society was critical of the government, 
saying that in fact Canadians do not know enough about 
genetically modified foods, about what is safe and what is not. 
The society argued quite strenuously in that report that this is 
because the process itself is so flawed, so problematic, that 
governments approve food for human consumption using a 
methodology that just simply is no longer acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The precautionary principle should be applicable here.  To a 
significant degree it is reflected in the clauses of this bill. 
In this situation, that precautionary principle would ensure that 
if we are not sure about the safety of GM food we do not allow it 
on the market.  If scientists cannot tell us whether it is safe, 
not only in the short term but in the long term, then it does not 
go into a product that is sold for human consumption.  It is 
simply not allowed in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the bill.  It is time that we get in line with 
the international community and with a great deal of our trading 
partners.  It is time to catch up to them.  It is time to bring 
in the bill and pass it in the House so that our society has that 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a unique opportunity for the House to reflect on the work 
that has been done by the member for Davenport.  We should send 
this over to committee, let it do its review, then bring it back 
to this House once it comes out of committee and pass it into 
law. 
<P><A NAME="LINK292"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Lunney (Nanaimo—Alberni, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask for permission from the House to resume. 
I did speak to the bill earlier.  There was some confusion about 
me sharing the time with the hon. member.  Therefore, with 
permission of the House, I am asking for agreement to speak again 
on this issue.  I am just looking for the five minutes I missed 
the last time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I fully understand the 
hon. member's problem.  He is a new member, so in the spirit of 
co-operation does he have unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Lunney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank you and all 
members in the House for indulging me in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last opportunity I had to address the issue I laid the 
foundation for the remarks that I will pick up on and continue 
with.  The issue we are considering as we consider this bill is 
this:  are GM foods safe?  I believe the public does need some 
reassurance in this matter.  What is the science behind it?  We 
have heard a number of members address this issue.  What are the 
long term effects of GM foods on humans and in the environment? 
Frankly, nobody really knows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument that has been put forward as Health Canada's 
primary justification for the safety of these products is a 
substantial equivalence argument, that is, the gene inserted is 
one that is known and it produces a certain protein, that protein 
is available in other products and no evidence of harm in those 
products has been demonstrated, so therefore it should be 
acceptable.  Frankly, the argument of substantial equivalence 
does not stand up to scientific scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. members in the House to consider that this 
argument of substantial equivalence was recently used in a 
reverse sense by the scientists who developed the oncomouse.  We 
might remember that the oncomouse, developed by Harvard 
scientists, is a mouse that breeds cancer in all of its 
offspring, which is very useful for research.  I am sure the 
mouse and its offspring, by the way, are very grateful to the 
scientists for introducing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The change was a very small change, 99.9% the same, but the 
difference to the mouse and its offspring was quite significant, 
I would suggest.  On the one hand, in order to argue that this 
mouse was different and to get patenting rights the Harvard 
scientists argued that this mouse was substantially different. We 
hear scientists arguing both sides of this equation using the 
same argument, in one case to say that it is the same and in 
another case to say it is different enough that a mouse and its 
progeny can inherit cancer.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying that the substantial equivalents argument does not 
stand up to the scientific precautionary principle.  I am 
reflecting the recommendations of the Royal Society of Canada 
that recently reported to the health ministry on this matter 
wherein 14 distinguished Canadian scientists stated that the 
precautionary principle is not honoured by substantial 
equivalents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention that scorpion venom is being used in a 
baculovirus.  Here is a virus being introduced not for food 
consumption per se but as a pesticide.  It was found that the 
baculovirus slows insect growth, but by inserting a scorpion 
venom gene the kill rate was very high and effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly enough, another group of scientists are using the 
baculovirus for liver modification because they find that this 
virus has access to human liver and brain cells.  The two 
scientists do not seem to be considering that if virus A with 
scorpion venom should breed with virus B, a very close relative, 
the consequences for humans could be catastrophic.  We need some 
science to reassure us that these things, which are very stable 
in the environment but very unstable when they reproduce, are not 
setting the stage for catastrophic consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scientific alarm bells are ringing.  We cannot ignore the 
alarm bells.  Need we remind ourselves of tainted blood, AIDS, or 
hepatitis C, believing that our blood system was safe.  We might 
look at the Walkerton water system where officials had been 
drinking the water for years because they trusted their system 
was safe but failed to notice that something had changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister went to Europe and said that we had been 
eating these foods for years and that we were healthy.  He said 
“Look at me, do I look sick”?  However, that test fails the 
scientific principle in terms of best science practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Health Canada and the CFIA wants to assure Canadians that 
these products are safe, we need to employ better science to 
satisfy Canadians.  We need to use best science practices and 
that minimal risk is involved as was advocated by the royal 
society. We have an obligation to respect the right of Canadians 
to choose what they are consuming and give them a choice until 
the risk from these products is considered reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada, in assuring these products are safe under present 
testing, is also exposing the taxpayers to extreme liability as 
well as potentially risking their health.  We need better science 
around these products to assure Canadians that they are safe.  We 
also need to consider what options are available, including the 
labelling issue, in order to satisfy Canadians until the 
scientific principle is better satisfied to reduce the risk of 
these products. 
<P><A NAME="LINK293"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would first 
like to acknowledge that the bill comes from one of the deans of 
the House who I respect very much.  He has always been a 
committed member and a great driving force in everything he 
believes in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be the season for compliments, Mr. Speaker, but you are 
a very wise person to allow as many people as possible to speak 
on the bill.  That is a nice way to do it for members in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the House that Canada is recognized worldwide as 
having one of the safest food systems in the world.  The 
responsibility for food safety is shared at the federal level 
between Health Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. 
Health Canada's responsibility regarding food is to establish 
science based policies and standards to ensure that all foods are 
safe and nutritious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several years ago Health Canada recognized the application of 
new techniques either to genetically modified micro-organisms and 
plants in order to produce new food or to simply to produce 
common, everyday foods another way.  It was also recognized that 
the safety of such foods should be assessed and that the existing 
regulatory framework of the Food and Drugs Act was the suitable 
tool to establish a clear and stringent process for evaluating 
the safety of biotechnology derived foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, a variety of novel foods are being developed and 
introduced into the Canadian marketplace.  These novel foods 
include foods derived from biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada believes that foods that have not previously been 
used as foods, or foods that have been modified from their 
traditional composition as well as foods that have been produced 
using new technology, including biotechnology, should be assessed 
prior to being allowed on the market. 
I think we all agree with that and I respect the people in Health 
Canada for that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1925"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end the federal government has enacted novel foods 
regulations which define what a novel food is.  It makes it 
mandatory for a company to notify Health Canada before a novel 
food can be sold in Canada.  This pre-market notification ensures 
that the safety of each novel food, including genetically 
modified food, is assessed and verified before it can enter the 
Canadian marketplace.  In addition, the definition of novel foods 
is well tailored to the mandate of Health Canada, ensuring that 
all foods are safe and nutritious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The safety assessment undertaken in relation to these 
regulations is conducted according to scientific principles 
developed through expert consultation with international 
authorities such as the World Health Organization, the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approach used in Canada is also followed by regulatory 
agencies in the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and 
the United States.  Health Canada's guidelines for the safety 
assessment of novel foods outline the safety assessment approach. 
These guidelines have benefited from detailed consultations with 
stakeholders in Canada and continue to be available for review 
and critique. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in the case for approval of most products by regulatory 
agencies around the world, companies or proponents of 
biotechnology derived foods are required to submit a set of data 
which must be of sufficiently high calibre and meet the criteria 
specified in the guidelines.  This information is reviewed by a 
team of scientific evaluators representing expertise in molecular 
biology, toxicology, chemistry, nutritional sciences and 
microbiology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scientific validity of study protocols used, as well as the 
raw data submitted, are critically analyzed.  If any part of the 
information provided is insufficient, including if long term 
studies are warranted, further studies will be required from that 
company.  The food will not be approved and the food company or 
proponent will be obligated to carry out those studies and report 
on the results before any further consideration of the 
submission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning food labelling policies in Canada, Health Canada and 
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency share accountability under 
the Food and Drugs Act.  Health Canada's responsibilities derive 
from its mandate for health and safety issues, while the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency is responsible for protecting consumers 
from misrepresentation and fraud with respect to food labelling, 
packaging and advertising and for prescribing basic food 
labelling and advertising standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the development of the interim 
position on labelling is based upon previous public 
consultations.  Since 1993 there have been three public 
consultations in Canada on the issue of labelling foods derived 
through genetic modification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public consultation process was used to bring together a 
group of stakeholders, including industry and industry 
associations, consumer groups and individuals to determine 
Canadian views on the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This position calls for mandatory labelling to address health 
and safety issues.  We do that to identify composition or 
nutritional changes.  In these situations labelling is required 
to alert consumers or susceptible groups in the population at 
large.  Additionally, food producers and manufacturers may 
voluntarily label foods derived from biotechnology, provided that 
the label is truthful and not misleading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently labelling of foods derived from the application of 
biotechnology has become a key issue of public attention.  It is 
important to note that the primary issue related to labelling has 
been one of consumer choice and the right to know.  To examine 
the broad considerations related to biotechnology, the federal 
government has created the Canadian biotechnology advisory 
committee as part of its renewed biotechnology strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there are several initiatives underway in order to 
determine the most appropriate mechanisms for providing consumers 
with information that will assist them to better understand the 
nature of their food choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada continues to work with colleagues at the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency and with other stakeholders, including 
health professionals, consumer groups and industry associations, 
in order to develop mechanisms to provide information in the most 
effective manner regarding foods derived from biotechnology, 
mechanisms that are consistent with international approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to further debate on this issue but I think we 
have to clarify a few more things before we can support the bill.

<P><A NAME="LINK296"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to come back to a question I asked on May 29. 
My question dealt with the fact that this year the fishing 
industry in the Acadian Peninsula is what can be called, I 
guess, a total disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, in the Caraquet area, lobstermen have caught only 
6,000 pounds of lobster. On some days, lobstermen in the 
Petit-Shippagan area have come back home with only 15 and 38 
pounds of lobster. That is unheard of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, crab quotas have been cut, which means that less fish or 
crab have been caught. Fish plants have closed down after only 
three weeks for lack of fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked in the House of Commons what the government would do to 
provide relief to these plant workers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, let me remind the House of what the 
parliamentary secretary told me at the time “When the licences 
of an enterprise are sold, it is the responsibility of the 
enterprise owner to deal with the crew members”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I was not talking about crew members; I was talking about 
plant workers.  I am anxious to hear what his answer will be 
this evening.  I hope he will not mention crew members again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear that the fish plants closed after three weeks. 
Workers in these plants will have trouble making their 420 
hours.  They will be obliged to take part in projects, and this 
will be divided by the wonderful 14 week formula.  And the gap 
about which I have spoken so often in the House of Commons will 
begin in December. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I asked on May 29 had to do with what the federal 
government would do to help New Brunswick cope with this 
disaster, this crisis in the fishery, which will affect 
thousands of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was my question.  I think that there was some confusion 
that day. 
I hope that, now that the question is clearer this evening, the 
parliamentary secretary who will shortly be replying will be 
able to answer it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the federal government bought crab fishers' boats in 
order to give them to the aboriginals on the Burnt Church 
reserve.  But the aboriginals do not want them.  There is no 
agreement in this regard.  It is not good enough that quotas are 
lower.  No one is fishing these quotas.  These are resources 
that are therefore not reaching the fish plants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the government do so that these quotas can be 
distributed to someone else, to other fishers, so that the fish 
and seafood quotas are used and people can go to work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes no sense that the government spent over $10 million to 
close the fishery.  There is nothing to show for it.  People 
have no work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that I am getting to the end of my four minutes, so I am 
going to ask a clear question of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the federal government going to do to help the fish 
plant workers in the Acadian peninsula, who have had only three 
weeks work?  These people could not get work this year because of 
the crisis we are still having with the crab fishery.  What will 
the federal government do to help the province of New Brunswick 
set up a partnership in order to help these workers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe my question is clear.  This is what I would like to 
have an answer from the parliamentary secretary on.  In other 
words, I would like to have a reply to the question I asked him 
on May 29. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me say at 
the outset that I sympathize with the hon. member.  I understand 
his question very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representing pretty much a total fishing riding, I know the 
difficulties that the lack of resources can cause, not only for 
the harvesters but particularly for fish plant workers who do not 
have enough resources to process in their plants to provide 
meaningful work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, the 1996 crab season was marked by riots and 
demonstrations by traditional crab fishery workers in 
northeastern New Brunswick.  To provide temporary sharing of a 
very lucrative resource with non-traditional participants meant 
that these workers would see their weeks of work decline with 
reduced quotas for the traditional crab fleet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result the traditional crab industry proposed a solidarity 
fund to assist plant workers and displaced crew members to adjust 
to declining employment.  The solidarity fund has always been an 
industry led initiative with contributions from all crab 
harvesters each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of New Brunswick has also made contributions over 
the years, including a contribution of $1 million this year.  The 
New Brunswick portion of the fund currently includes about 
$130,000 remaining from last year, plus contributions made this 
year by temporary participants in the fishery.  The issue of 
contributions to the fund is one that must be resolved between 
crab fishers and plant workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, under the Employment Insurance Act there are a 
number of HRDC benefits designed to aid unemployed Canadians.  To 
further address the issue of the shortage of work for crab 
fishery workers in New Brunswick, officials of the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans are currently co-operating with HRDC and the 
province of New Brunswick to try to find some solution for this 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plant workers have asked the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans to allocate crab to them.  To do so would be contrary to a 
long established policy.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>IMMIGRATION 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK299"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let me begin by complimenting the parliamentary 
secretary on his commitment to the work of the Standing Committee 
on Citizenship and Immigration and the co-operative spirit he 
always offers in the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate the question I asked of the minister during question 
period regarding what he had said publicly in the newspapers: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the minister of has said that the Sklarzyk family are queue 
jumpers, but the fact is that the family has been ordered 
deported due to a technical error.  Meanwhile a suspected 
assassin, Rudy Pacificador, has been allowed to stay in the 
country for 14 years and still has not been deported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the fairness and compassion in her system when it 
allows a suspected assassin to be treated better than a family 
who has behaved in an exemplary fashion? 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bad news is that the family was deported back to Poland a 
couple of weekends ago.  My role tonight is not to be their legal 
advocate.  My role is to raise questions about the system and why 
the system operates the way it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, why do we protect criminals over lawful citizens even 
though they do not have status as permanent residents but are 
certainly visitors to this country? Second, why is it that we 
create these problems for ourselves? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine the Sklarzyk case.  They came here in 1994 with 
two children who had been born in Poland.  The irony is that they 
came under a visitor's visa, but the fact is their visitor's visa 
was renewed three times.  One would think this would give the 
Sklarzyks the wrong message about staying around here.  After 
three renewals they disappeared.  Ironically they disappeared to 
start a business and raise another family.  They had two more 
children in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After seven years all of a sudden the government takes an 
interest in thinking that they should be removed.  For what 
cause?  Was it because they were $50 short on their application 
fee?  Their lawyer says they actually paid the application fee 
twice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile 15,000 people have written warrants for their 
deportation and we cannot even find them because we do not know 
where they are.  However we knew where the poor Sklarzyk family 
was.  They were in a business and raising their family like other 
immigrants who have come here for centuries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we pick on people like the Sklarzyks?  Certainly they are 
a good example of the error we made in encouraging them to stay 
here.  At the same time it shows that this county is not 
compassionate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the parliamentary secretary is this:  why do we 
do what we do?  It is a poor example to the world when Canada is 
supposed to be seen as a country that shows compassion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK300"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Assad (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would also 
like to say that the member for Dauphin—Swan River showed that 
he is a very open minded individual during deliberations in 
committee.  On many occasions his contributions were very 
liberal, if I may use the term.  It was greatly appreciated.  In 
fact, that goes for every member of the committee.  There was 
co-operation and there were heartfelt and compassionate 
discussions on the best possible policy for immigration for our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the question, the key role of our immigration 
policy is to strike a balance between enforcement and 
facilitation.  It is always difficult to tell people that they 
have to leave Canada.  I can imagine that it is very dramatic.  I 
can assure the member that in the case of the Sklarzyk family, 
reported by the media, the file has been reviewed and there was 
no administrative error.  That is a fabrication of the media. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, we apply the law in keeping with the rules.  Before a 
person is expelled, he or she is entitled to application of the 
law in keeping with the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can guarantee the hon. member that no one is expelled because 
of administrative error.  There is a clear order of priority 
governing expulsions: criminals, rejected refugee claimants, and 
visitors whose visas have expired. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999, as reported in the media, the family overstayed the 
limits of their visitor's visa.  At that point they had already 
been granted extensions and were advised to submit an application 
for permanent residence if their intention was to stay in Canada. 
No application was submitted, but the family did claim refugee 
status.  Further, the Immigration and Refugee Board determined 
that the family members were not refugees.  Subsequently, the 
family has now exhausted all avenues of appeal.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK302"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on April 5 I brought to the attention of the House the 
wonderful news that women and part time workers had just won an 
important victory, with a federal judge deciding that Canada's 
employment insurance rules violate their constitutional rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kelly Lesiuk from Winnipeg brought forward the first charter 
challenge that the Employment Insurance Act treats women and part 
time workers unfairly.  Kelly, as a part time nurse, was unable 
to claim EI benefits because she fell 33 hours short of 
qualifying.  Problems with her pregnancy had forced her to stop 
work at five months.  To make ends meet she had to return to work 
six weeks after undergoing a Caesarean section and the family had 
to deplete its savings and borrow money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice Roger Salhany found that the current eligibility rules 
which require workers to accumulate 700 hours of employment to 
qualify for benefits are discriminatory.  He stated: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the eligibility requirements demean the essential human dignity 
of women who predominate in the part-time labour force because 
they must work for longer periods than full-time workers in order 
to demonstrate their labour force attachment. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This makes it almost impossible for them to collect benefits. 
His ruling is clear.  The Employment Insurance Act discriminated 
against women and part time workers.  Women make up 70% of the 
part time workforce and carry most of the responsibility for 
raising children.  This decision recognizes the juggling act of 
working mothers and indicates that they should not be penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because women continue to serve as primary caregivers they have 
fewer hours available for paid work outside the home. 
Consequently they end up working fewer hours, often in part time 
employment and, like Kelly Lesiuk, they fail to qualify for 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unbelievably the government decided to appeal this decision, 
with the minister saying that she needed to seek clarity.  How 
much more clarity does the government need? 
An inequality is staring them in the face.  Kelly Lesiuk and 
other women are forced to wait for the outcome of this appeal. 
Over 60 cases are also waiting to be heard.  The government must 
act to recognize the real circumstances of women in the 
workforce.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the government chosen to postpone justice for Canadian 
workers?  What is the government prepared to do to address this 
situation?  Will the government change eligibility requirements 
to remove the barriers creating these inequalities. 
<P><A NAME="LINK303"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the question 
is an important one for part time workers, particularly as the 
member opposite mentioned, because such a large number of part 
time workers are women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Employment Insurance Commission unanimously agreed to 
seek a judicial review of Justice Salhany's decision by the 
Federal Court of Appeal.  However the scope of the umpire's 
ruling went beyond Ms. Lesiuk's case.  Therefore, the commission 
felt that it was important to seek clarification with respect to 
a number of the aspects of this ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice Salhany did not invalidate the employment insurance 
provisions at issue.  The existing qualifying requirements for 
both regular and maternity employment insurance benefits continue 
to apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now up to the Federal Court of Appeal to determine the 
outcome of the application.  As this issue is now before the 
courts, it is impossible for me to comment specifically about the 
case. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this House 
stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 24(1).
